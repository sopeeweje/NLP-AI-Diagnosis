"Toward Precision Medicine for Substance Use Disorders with Co-Occurring PTSD - A Machine Learning Approach PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Over 20 years of empirical data document the individual and societal costs of co-occurring substance use disorders (SUD) and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Although evidence-based treatments are available for SUD+PTSD, the lack of methods or guidelines for personalized treatment recommendations represents a critical barrier to progress in the field. Secondary analyses of existing treatment research datasets have the promise to identify cost-effective and noninvasive variables that represent predictors, moderators, mediators, mechanisms of action, and secondary effects in a way that can be easily replicated in research and expanded to the real world. Importantly, extant datasets provide an opportunity to develop and test innovative analytic approaches that leverage technological advances in computing power to: 1) develop precision medicine algorithms that can prognosticate and prescribe at the patient-level, 2) generate new hypotheses to guide future research on treatment development and dissemination, and 3) innovate existing methods that can be applied to solve related problems in the field. Accordingly, the proposed project will apply machine learning methodologies to the largest existing NIDA-funded multi-site clinical trial for SUD+PTSD in order to: Aim 1: Develop algorithms that can identify the probability of treatment response on both SUD and PTSD outcomes based on routinely collected intake data. Aim 2: Identify key variables associated with a significant increase or decrease in the treatment response probability. Aim 3: Assess the feasibility of providing data-driven, personalized prescriptions that fit patients to the treatment most likely to benefit them based on their individual profile. The proposed machine learning analyses will be developed by the applicant at the Anxiety and Health Behaviors Laboratory of The University of Texas at Austin, and evaluated at the Texas Advanced Computing Center (TACC), which houses the fastest academic supercomputer in the United States of America, and one of the most powerful systems in the world. Importantly, the algorithms (once developed) can be easily disseminated and do not require powerful hardware to execute. Therefore, the combination of advanced machine learning analyses and high-performance computing has the promise to provide methods and findings that can be expanded across extant datasets and future research projects to facilitate scientific discovery in the field of personalized medicine for addiction that: 1) goes beyond comparing mean response across treatments, and 2) that is otherwise not possible with traditional statistical methods. If successful, the project will support a strategy that represents a paradigm shift from one-size-fits-all recommendations derived from treatment comparisons in clinical trials, to a data-driven, precision medicine approach that prognosticates and prescribes at the patient level. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed project will apply machine learning methodologies to the largest existing NIDA-funded multi-site clinical trial for substance use disorders (SUD) and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). If the project is successful, it will be the first to: 1) develop algorithms that can identify the probability of treatment response on both SUD and PTSD outcomes based on routinely collected intake data, 2) identify key variables associated with a significant increase or decrease in the probability for treatment response, and 3) assess the feasibility of providing data-driven prescriptions that fit patients to the treatment most likely to benefit them based on their individual profile.",Toward Precision Medicine for Substance Use Disorders with Co-Occurring PTSD - A Machine Learning Approach,9809511,R36DA049122,"['Address', 'Aftercare', 'Algorithms', 'Americas', 'Anxiety', 'Clinical Trials', 'Comorbidity', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Dropout', 'Evidence based treatment', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health behavior', 'Healthcare', 'High Performance Computing', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Inpatients', 'Intake', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Mental Depression', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Multi-Institutional Clinical Trial', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Predictive Value', 'Probability', 'Randomized', 'Recommendation', 'Recovery', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Running', 'Sample Size', 'Selection for Treatments', 'Signal Transduction', 'Statistical Methods', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Texas', 'Trauma', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Work', 'addiction', 'analytical method', 'anxiety treatment', 'austin', 'base', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning algorithm', 'outcome forecast', 'patient response', 'personalized medicine', 'precision medicine', 'predicting response', 'profiles in patients', 'response', 'secondary analysis', 'simulation', 'societal costs', 'suicidal risk', 'supercomputer', 'symposium', 'therapy development', 'treatment effect', 'treatment response']",NIDA,"UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS, AUSTIN",R36,2019,49534,0.05445780588406558
"Implementation of Technology-Based Evaluation of Motivational Interviewing ï»¿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Millions of Americans are receiving behavioral interventions for problematic alcohol use. In 2010, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) documented over 1.8 million treatment episodes for drug and alcohol problems, many involving group or individual psychotherapy. The tremendous service-delivery need has focused research on optimal training methods, to promote the dissemination of evidence-based interventions. A recent meta-analysis of motivational interviewing (MI) shows that ""post-training supports"" - such as performance-based feedback or coaching - are critical for maintaining counselor skills following training. However, the practical implementation of performance-based feedback for alcohol use disorders (AUDs) and problematic drinking is currently prohibitive in effort, time, and money. There is a critical need or technology to ""scale up"" performance-based feedback to counselors for AUDs and problematic drinking.  This competitive renewal builds on interdisciplinary research focused on automating the evaluation of MI fidelity for alcohol and substance use problems. This collaborative research brings together speech signal processing experts from electrical engineering and statistical text-mining and natural language processing experts from computer science with MI expert trainers and researchers. Our previous research laid a computational foundation for generating MI fidelity codes from semantic and vocal features, and the current proposal moves this work into direct clinical application. In collaboration with the University of Utah Counseling Center (UCC), we will develop and implement a clinical software support tool, the Counselor Observer Ratings Expert for MI (CORE-MI). The CORE-MI system will provide performance-based feedback focused on MI fidelity codes for training, supervision, and quality assurance for counselors treating clients struggling with alcohol and substance use problems.  The research will use a hybrid implementation-effectiveness design to pursue the following three aims: 1) Implement and calibrate the CORE-MI system at the UCC clinic to provide automated, performance-based feedback on MI; 2) Compare counselor fidelity to MI and client alcohol and substance use outcomes, before and after initiation of the CORE-MI system (approximately, N = 2,400 sessions); and 3) Using machine learning tools, computationally explore mechanisms of MI using semantic and vocal data, MI fidelity codes, and client outcomes from approximately 3,000 sessions. The successful execution of this project will break the reliance on human judgment for providing performance-based feedback to MI and will massively expand the capacity to train, supervise, and provide quality assurance. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    Performance-based feedback is an effective method for training and supervising counseling approaches for alcohol-related problems. However, current feedback methods rely on human raters and are not feasible in the real-world due to time and cost. The current study will implement a clinical support software tool that uses speech signal processing and computational models - instead of human judgment - to evaluate motivational interviewing for alcohol and substance use problems.",Implementation of Technology-Based Evaluation of Motivational Interviewing,9761396,R01AA018673,"['Acoustics', 'Addictive Behavior', 'Alcohol abuse', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Alcohols', 'American', 'Arousal', 'Assessment tool', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Calibration', 'Cause of Death', 'Client', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical effectiveness', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Counseling', 'Data', 'Development', 'Educational workshop', 'Effectiveness', 'Electrical Engineering', 'Empathy', 'Evaluation', 'Evidence based intervention', 'Feedback', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Group Psychotherapy', 'Homicide', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention Studies', 'Judgment', 'Learning', 'Learning Skill', 'Life', 'Linguistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental Health', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Patient Outcomes Assessments', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Population', 'Process', 'Professional counselor', 'Psychologist', 'Psychotherapy', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Semantics', 'Software Tools', 'Speech', 'Standardization', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Suicide', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Support', 'United States Department of Veterans Affairs', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'United States Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration', 'Universities', 'Utah', 'Vision', 'Work', 'addiction', 'alcohol abuse therapy', 'alcohol intervention', 'alcohol related problem', 'alcohol use disorder', 'base', 'clinical application', 'clinical implementation', 'computer science', 'cost', 'design', 'drinking', 'high risk drinking', 'improved', 'motivational enhancement therapy', 'public health relevance', 'quality assurance', 'scale up', 'service delivery', 'signal processing', 'skills', 'support tools', 'technological innovation', 'technology validation', 'text searching', 'tool', 'vehicular accident', 'visual feedback', 'young adult']",NIAAA,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2019,587565,0.03252114040369104
"Great Lakes Node of the Drug Abuse Clinical Trials Network Project Summary/Abstract In alignment with RFA-DA-19-008, this application seeks to establish the Great Lakes Node (GLN) of the NIDA-supported Drug Abuse Clinical Trials Network (CTN). This node will draw on an experienced set of investigators who have active collaborations and represent all of the major academic medical centers in the Greater Chicago and Wisconsin areas. The node will serve as a vital Midwestern hub for the CTN and will expand on the success of the CTN approach. In addition, the GLN will bring substantial experience in adolescent/young adult research, seniors/aging research, digital & mobile technologies, opioid misuse, collaborative care/population health, telehealth, and electronic health record and systems-driven interventions and research methodologies. The GLN will support engagement with CTN protocols and also add the following: Aim 1: GLN will identify and recommend substance misuse research and intervention protocols focused on systems-based practice using hospital-based screening, collaborative care, and population approaches. Aim 2: We will establish a digital and computation health core that will leverage our expertise in these domains and serve as a conduit for studies in mHealth, eHealth, artificial intelligence, natural language processing, and telehealth interventions. Aim 3: Our node will bring substantial expertise with youth/adolescent health and seniors/aging that will enable us to recommend studies to the CTN that examine the genesis of substance misuse and the potential for prevention strategies to mitigate these life-course pathways. Aim 4: In alignment with our teamâs expertise, we plan to support work on substance and opioid misuse that focuses on health disparities including socioeconomic, geographic, sexual orientation, and gender identity. Aim 5: Leveraging our experience in professional education and practice-based learning, our node will rigorously test the impact of professional education on opioid and substance treatment. We have built on the ECHO model to develop methods to conduct high-quality distance education and supported training that are currently being trialed in Illinois with plans to expand these programs nationally. Aim 6: GLN will expand the pipeline of early investigators interested in substance misuse research. We will align this part of our program with our very successful CTSA-supported programs and build specific subprogramming that supports addiction and substance misuse research, training, and mentorship. Project Narrative This application will establish the Great Lakes Node of the Drug Abuse Clinical Trials Network. The creation of this node will help facilitate research on substance and opioid misuse which are key components of NIH and federal government strategy to reduce the mortality and morbidity associated with the current opioid and substance epidemics. This node will support clinical trials relevant to the epidemics and also advance research in novel models of care, data analytics, mobile interventions and training.",Great Lakes Node of the Drug Abuse Clinical Trials Network,9839124,UG1DA049467,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Adolescent', 'African American', 'Aging', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Asians', 'Buprenorphine', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Chicago', 'Cities', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Network', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'County', 'Data Analytics', 'Distance Education', 'Drug abuse', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emergency department visit', 'Epidemic', 'Federal Government', 'Gender Identity', 'Geography', 'Health', 'Health system', 'Heroin', 'Home environment', 'Homelessness', 'Hospitals', 'Illinois', 'Indiana', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Latino', 'Learning', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Los Angeles', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Midwestern United States', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'Native Americans', 'Natural Language Processing', 'New York', 'Opioid', 'Opioid Analgesics', 'Pacific Island Americans', 'Pathway interactions', 'Population', 'Prevention strategy', 'Professional Education', 'Professional Practice', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Refugees', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Rest', 'Rural', 'Sex Orientation', 'Side', 'System', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Training Support', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Veterans', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Wisconsin', 'Work', 'addiction', 'adolescent health', 'base', 'collaborative care', 'cooking', 'digital', 'eHealth', 'ethnic diversity', 'experience', 'health disparity', 'interest', 'mHealth', 'medical schools', 'metropolitan', 'mobile computing', 'mortality', 'novel', 'opioid misuse', 'opioid overdose', 'opioid treatment program', 'overdose death', 'population health', 'programs', 'racial and ethnic', 'racial diversity', 'rural area', 'screening', 'sexual identity', 'socioeconomics', 'substance misuse', 'suburb', 'success', 'telehealth', 'urban area', 'waiver', 'young adult']",NIDA,RUSH UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,UG1,2019,444441,0.10828242368246803
"Analyzing Sequential, Multiple Assignment, Randomized Trials in the Presence of Partial Compliance Project Summary: The cyclical and heterogeneous nature of many substance use disorders highlights the need to adapt the type or the dose of treatment to accommodate the specific and changing needs of individuals. This proposal is motivated by the Extending Treatment Effectiveness of Naltrexone and the Adaptive Treatment for Cocaine Dependence trials, sequential multiple assignment randomized trials (SMART) designed to find a (personalized) rescue treatment for alcohol or/and cocaine dependent patients. One of the main challenges in these trials is the high rate of noncompliance to the assigned treatments. This feature has made it virtually impossible for investigators to fully explore the possibility of building high quality treatment strategies using the data. Our overarching aim is to address this particular challenge through developing and subsequently applying new statistical methods to the data. A SMART trial is a multi-stage trial that can inform the design of an adaptive treatment strategy (ATS) which formalizes an individualized treatment plan and where current treatment strategy can depend on a patient's past medical and treatment history. An optimal ATS is one that maximizes a specified health outcome of interest. Existing methods in analyzing SMART data are limited to intention-to-treat (ITT) analyses. That is the treatment effect at each stage is estimated based on the treatment group to which an individual was randomized at that stage regardless of whether the individual complied with their assigned treatment. One major concern is that the relationship between the experimental manipulation and the outcome may be confounded by treatment noncompliance. We develop methodologies that can be used to adjust for noncompliance in analyzing data collected in SMARTs. Specifically, we extend the principal strata framework and Bayesian Copulas to multi-stage randomized trials setting and propose novel procedures that estimate the mean outcome under different ATSs. We also propose a novel Bayesian machine learning approach that can be used to construct deeply tailored (i.e., individualized) treatment strategies that take into account patients' demographic factors, measures of mental health and alcohol use, obsessive-compulsive drinking and alcohol craving scales, physical composite scores. Finally, we will develop easy-to-use, publicly available open-source software leveraging the R and Python languages that implements our methods. This will provide an expandable platform that will assist researchers in developing new optimal ATSs for patients suffering from alcoholism and other substance use disorders. Narrative: This project aims to address the need for robust, rigorous and computationally efficient methods for analysis of sequential multiple assignment randomized trials (SMARTs) data in the presence of partial compliance. The methods developed in this project will improve the usefulness, interpretability and generalizability of the results obtained by SMARTs and help mental health and substance use disorder scientists to develop more potent adaptive treatment strategies to guide the individualization of mental health and substance use disorder treatments.","Analyzing Sequential, Multiple Assignment, Randomized Trials in the Presence of Partial Compliance",9734801,R01DA048764,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcoholism', 'Bayesian Method', 'Bayesian learning', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Cocaine', 'Cocaine Dependence', 'Code', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Demographic Factors', 'Dose', 'Educational workshop', 'Effectiveness', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Individual', 'Intention', 'Joints', 'Language', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Mental Health', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Naltrexone', 'Nature', 'Obsessive compulsive behavior', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Periodicity', 'Procedures', 'Pythons', 'Randomized', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research Personnel', 'Scheme', 'Scientist', 'Software Tools', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stratification', 'Structure', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Time', 'Treatment Effectiveness', 'alcohol abuse therapy', 'alcohol craving', 'arm', 'base', 'compliance behavior', 'design', 'dosage', 'drinking', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'non-compliance', 'novel', 'open source', 'patient response', 'randomized trial', 'repository', 'response', 'statistics', 'symposium', 'therapy design', 'tool', 'treatment effect', 'treatment group', 'treatment planning', 'treatment response', 'treatment strategy', 'trial design', 'virtual']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF ROCHESTER,R01,2019,422197,0.09014412714951718
"ABCD-USA Consortium: Research Project DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Adolescence is a critical neurodevelopmental period associated with dramatic increases in rates of substance use. Identifying the pathways to substance use and its effects on child and adolescent development is critically important, as the effects of substance use during ongoing maturation likely have long-lasting effects on brain functioning and behavioral, health, and psychological outcomes. This Research Project Site application from the University of California, San Diego and Laureate Institute for Brain Research is in response to RFA-DA-15-015 as part of the ABCD-USA Consortium (5/13), to prospectively determine the neurodevelopmental and behavioral predictors and consequences of substance use on children and adolescents. A representative community sample of 1086 9-10 year olds enriched for high- risk characteristics will be recruited, contributing to the sample of 11,111 to be collected from 11 hubs across the ABCD- USA Consortium. All participants will undergo a comprehensive baseline assessment, including state-of-the-art brain imaging, comprehensive neuropsychological testing, bioassays, mobile monitoring and careful assessment of substance use, environment, psychopathological symptoms, and social functioning every 2 years. Interim annual interviews and quarterly web-based assessments will provide refined temporal resolution of behaviors, development, and life events with minimal participant burden. These Consortium-wide data obtained during the course of this project will elucidate: 1) the effects of substance use patterns on the adolescent brain; 2) the effects of substance use on behavioral and health outcomes; 3) the bidirectional relationship between psychopathology and substance use patterns; 4) the effects of individual genetic, behavioral, neurobiological, and environmental differences on risk profiles and substance use outcomes; and 5) the ""gateway interactions"" between use of different substances. This hub's Research Project focuses on mechanisms of substance use disorder, special populations with high use prevalence, and the use of drugs other than marijuana. (1) We will determine whether individual differences in neural processing of antireward (i.e., negative reinforcement mechanisms) in amygdala, insula, and anterior cingulate are associated with increased negative emotionality and pain, predict initiation of use and problem use, and are in turn further dysregulated by substance use. (2) We will determine whether protective environment factors and ethnic identification in minority youth are linked to healthier antireward processing and better substance use outcomes. (3) We will determine whether antireward neural processing predicts increased use of illicit drugs other than MJ including misuse of prescription drugs, if such use predicts subsequent exaggerated antireward processing, and if gateway interactions exist between substances. Finally, we will use machine learning approaches to develop a youth-specific risk calculator that will enable us to identify individually- based modifiable risk factor, providing brain-based targets of future novel prevention and intervention approaches. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The ABCD-USA Consortium will use multimodal brain imaging, cognitive and clinical assessments, bioassays, mobile monitoring, and careful assessment of substance use, environment, psychopathological symptoms, and social functioning in 11,111 adolescents followed over 10 years to determine the effects of substance use on adolescent brain and cognitive development. Our 5/13 ABCD-USA Consortium: Research Project will recruit and assess 1086 youth age 9-10 at project entry.

"2/4: Leveraging EHR-linked biobanks for deep phenotyping, polygenic risk score modeling, and outcomes analysis in psychiatric disorders PROJECT ABSTRACT Major depressive disorder (MDD), anxiety disorders, and substance use disorders (SUDs) are common, complex psychiatric traits that frequently co-occur and are associated with significant functional impairment, increased healthcare utilization and cost, and higher mortality risk. Not only are these three conditions highly prevalent in the general population and generate a huge societal burden, but recent studies by our team and others have shown that shared covariance from common genetic variation significantly contributes to these psychiatric comorbidities. Large data sets are needed to understand how the multifaceted interplay of genetics, including polygenic risk scores (PRSs), and social determinants of health, such as employment and educational attainment, can impact the risk of these psychiatric disorders and clinical outcomes, such as multiple psychiatric hospitalizations. PRSs have shown potential for risk prediction, but the clinical utility of PRSs for psychiatric conditions is just starting to be explored. Research utilizing Electronic Health Records (EHRs) offers the promise of large data sets to examine these relationships in cohorts of patients seen in clinical practice. However, the use of EHRs is in its infancy in the study of psychiatric disorders and their treatment. This study will address critical knowledge gaps in âgenotype-psychiatric phenotypeâ relationships in large, demographically and geographically diverse population-based samples derived from EHR-linked biobanks across four medical centers - Columbia, Cornell, Mayo Clinic and Mount Sinai. Our objectives are to (1) develop improved methods for EHR phenotyping of MDD, anxiety, and SUDs, and related outcomes based on a data-set of >30 million EHRs, (2) evaluate associations between PRSs and these conditions, and (3) assess the association between PRSs and outcomes including treatment resistance in MDD and healthcare utilization in patients with MDD, anxiety and SUD. The PRS analyses will utilize data from biobanks with >50,000 persons with both EHR and GWAS data. Successful completion of this study will substantially advance our understanding of the clinical utility of PRSs for commonly occurring psychiatric disorders.

"Classifying addictions using machine learning analysis of multidimensional data ABSTRACT This Independent Scientist Award will significantly enhance my research capabilities, enabling me to become a leading quantitative investigator in the field of substance use disorders (SUDs). Specifically, it will allow me to increase my knowledge in the areas of SUD phenotypes, treatment and genetics. SUDs are clinically and etiologically heterogeneous and their classification has been difficult. This application reflects my ongoing commitment to developing an innovative and interdisciplinary research program on the classification of SUDs through quantitative analysis of multidimensional data. My extensive training in computational science and prior research on biomedical informatics have provided me with the skills to design, implement and evaluate advanced algorithms and sophisticated analyses to solve challenging problems in classifying SUDs. My ongoing NIDA-funded R01 employs a large (n=~12,000) sample aggregated from multiple genetic studies of cocaine, opioid, and alcohol dependence to develop and evaluate novel statistical models to generate clinical SUD subtypes that are optimized for gene finding. This K02 proposal extends that work to evaluate treatment outcome in refined subgroups of SUD populations using data from treatment studies for cocaine, opioid, alcohol and multiple substance dependence. This project will integrate data from diagnostic behavioral variables and genotypes, as well as biological/neurobiological features of the disorders and repeated measures of treatment outcome. The primary career development goals of this application are to: (1) understand the reliability, validity and functional mechanisms of various phenotyping methods; (2) to continue training in the genetics of addictions; and (3) to gain greater knowledge of different treatment approaches and their efficacy. A solid foundation in these areas will enhance my ability to realize the full potential of the data collected and aggregated from multiple dimensions, and to use the data to design the most clinically useful analysis and generate innovative solutions to diagnostic and predictive challenges in SUD research. Through formal coursework, directed readings, individual tutoring and intensive multidisciplinary collaboration with a diverse team of world-renowned researchers, I will receive training and collect pilot data for future R01 projects by examining (Aim I): whether clinically-defined highly heritable subtypes derived in my current R01 project predict differential treatment response; (Aim II) whether new statistical models that directly combine treatment data with behavioral, biological, and genomic data identify refined subtypes with confirmatory multilevel evidence; and (Aim III) whether there are genetic and social moderators of treatment outcome by subtype. The overall goal of this proposal is to further my independent and multidisciplinary research program in the development of statistical methods for refined classification of SUDs. The K02 award will provide me with the protected time necessary to fully engage in the training activities described that will enhance my knowledge and skills to enable me to make important, novel contributions to the genetics and treatment of SUD. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project will develop novel statistical and quantitative tools to identify homogeneous subtypes of substance use disorders (SUDs) and other complex diseases to enhance gene finding and treatment matching. The proposed project will perform secondary analyses of existing data from treatment studies of cocaine, opioid, alcohol, and mixed SUDs. The proposed novel approaches are expected to advance precision medicine approaches to SUDs by enabling treatment matching and a more refined SUD classification to gene finding.",Classifying addictions using machine learning analysis of multidimensional data,9625118,K02DA043063,"['Adherence', 'Aftercare', 'Alcohol dependence', 'Alcohols', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biosensor', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Cocaine', 'Cocaine Dependence', 'Collaborations', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Complex', 'Computational Science', 'DSM-IV', 'DSM-V', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Drug Use Disorder', 'Electroencephalography', 'Etiology', 'Foundations', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Markers', 'Genetic study', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Heritability', 'Heterogeneity', 'Independent Scientist Award', 'Individual', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Investigation', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'Neurobiology', 'Opiate Addiction', 'Opioid', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmacogenetics', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Reading', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Solid', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Subgroup', 'Substance Addiction', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Treatment outcome', 'Work', 'addiction', 'alcohol use disorder', 'biomarker performance', 'biomedical informatics', 'career development', 'cocaine use', 'contingency management', 'design', 'disease classification', 'disorder subtype', 'endophenotype', 'genetic association', 'genomic data', 'imaging genetics', 'improved', 'innovation', 'multidimensional data', 'neural correlate', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'opioid use disorder', 'outcome prediction', 'personalized medicine', 'precision medicine', 'programs', 'recruit', 'secondary analysis', 'skills', 'social', 'tool', 'treatment planning', 'treatment response', 'tutoring']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF CONNECTICUT STORRS,K02,2019,162123,0.07416387016693718
"Technology-supported, measurement-based supervision for Motivational Interviewing Millions of Americans receive evidence-based counseling for substance use problems each year. Many evidence-based treatments for substance abuse are âtalk basedâ therapies, such as motivational interviewing (MI), but the existing research-based methodology for evaluating counseling quality is to record sessions and use human rating teams to evaluate them. However, using humans as the assessment tool via behavioral coding is prohibitive in cost and time, can be error prone, and is virtually never used in the real world. Technology is needed that can analyze the speech patterns and spoken language of counseling sessions, provide automatic and intuitive quality scores, and summarize these in actionable feedback. Rapid, performance-based quality metrics could support training, ongoing supervision, and quality assurance for millions of evidence-based counseling sessions for substance abuse each year. Lyssn.io is a start-up targeting the development of implementation-focused technology to support evidence-based counseling. Our goal is to develop innovative health technology solutions that are objective, scalable, and cost efficient. Lyssn.io includes expertise in speech signal processing, machine learning, user-centered design, software engineering, and clinical expertise in evidence-based counseling. Previous NIH-funded research laid a computational foundation for generating MI quality metrics from speech and language features in MI sessions, and led to a prototype of a clinical software support tool, the Counselor Observer Ratings Expert for MI (CORE-MI). The current Fast-Track SBIR proposal includes Phase I, which will focus on understanding clinical workflows, assessing usability, and initial validation of machine learning of MI fidelity measures in the opioid treatment program at Evergreen Treatment Services (ETS) clinic in Seattle, WA. Phase II will focus on robust validation of the speech and language technologies underlying the CORE-MI tool, and development of scalable supervision protocols that integrate CORE-MI supported feedback for counselors. Finally, we will conduct a quasi-experimental evaluation of CORE-MI supported supervision and training at a second ETS clinic in the Puget Sound, focusing on acceptability, usability, and adoption, the impact on supervision, improved MI fidelity and preliminary evidence of increased client retention. The successful execution of this project will break the reliance on human judgment for providing performance-based feedback to MI and will massively expand the capacity to train, supervise, and provide quality assurance in MI for substance abuse. Most evidence-based treatments for substance abuse are in-person psychotherapy and counseling interventions, such as motivational interviewing. There are currently no methods for evaluating the quality of such counseling interventions in the real world to support training, supervision, and quality assurance. Building on an existing prototype, Lyssn.io â a technology start-up focused on scalable and cost-efficient human-centered technologies â will enhance and evaluate a cloud-based, HIPAA-compliant clinical support software tool that uses automated speech recognition and machine learning in an community based opioid replacement clinic.","Technology-supported, measurement-based supervision for Motivational Interviewing",9741887,R44DA046243,"['Adherence', 'Administrator', 'Adoption', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Assessment tool', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Benchmarking', 'Client', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Consumption', 'Counseling', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'E-learning', 'Enhancement Technology', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Evidence based treatment', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Feedback', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act', 'Health Technology', 'Human', 'Intervention', 'Intuition', 'Judgment', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'Needs Assessment', 'Online Systems', 'Opioid', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Process', 'Professional counselor', 'Protocols documentation', 'Provider', 'Psychology', 'Psychotherapy', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Site', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Software Engineering', 'Software Tools', 'Speech', 'Stream', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Suicide', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Support', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Update', 'Utah', 'Validation', 'Work', 'addiction', 'automated speech recognition', 'automobile accident', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'cloud based', 'community setting', 'cost', 'cost efficient', 'dashboard', 'design', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'gun homicide', 'implementation research', 'improved', 'innovation', 'motivational enhancement therapy', 'novel', 'opioid abuse', 'opioid treatment program', 'overdose death', 'prediction algorithm', 'protocol development', 'prototype', 'quality assurance', 'research and development', 'signal processing', 'skills', 'sound', 'speech processing', 'substance abuse treatment', 'support tools', 'technological innovation', 'tool', 'tool development', 'treatment services', 'usability', 'user centered design', 'virtual', 'visual feedback']",NIDA,"LYSSN.IO, INC.",R44,2019,553403,0.00956140776346447
"Predicting Substance Use and Related Antisocial Behavior with Psychiatric, Socioeconomic, and Brain Measures in Women Offenders Project Summary/Abstract Substance use costs society $740 billion dollars each year, placing an enormous burden on our nationâs health care and criminal justice systems. Approximately 85% of incarcerated offenders in the United States have a history of substance use and/or are imprisoned for crimes involving or motivated by alcohol and/or drug use. Incarcerated individuals tend to show poorer outcomes following substance use treatment, and forced abstinence via imprisonment is associated with risk for future substance use, which likely contributes to substance-related antisocial behavior following imprisonment. Over the past few decades, women have been sentenced to prison for drug-related reasons at alarming rates, with a growth rate exceeding that for men. Further, women offenders tend to be impacted more heavily by substance use with co-morbid psychopathology, placing greater demands on the system in terms of substance use and mental health treatments. Using the worldâs largest forensic neuroimaging database on women offenders (SWANC-F), this proposal investigates substance use and related antisocial behavior following release from prison in a large sample of women offenders, with a focus on neurobiological mechanisms, to demonstrate the utility of brain measures in estimating long-term substance use outcomes in at-risk women. Substance-related antisocial behavior, defined as committing crime(s) related to substance use after release from prison, will be obtained from re-arrest data in institutional files and comprehensive background checks on all women enrolled in the study. A random sample (n = 100) will then be followed-up with via phone to gather data on substance use and obtain supplemental information to corroborate re-arrest data from files and background checks. Employing regression analyses and machine learning/pattern classifier approaches, models will be compared testing effects of psychiatric and socioeconomic variables, along with resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) brain measures, to examine unique and combined effects in differentiating among heterogeneous etiological mechanisms driving substance use outcomes of interest in women. Specifically, this proposal seeks to test the extent to which psychiatric and socioeconomic factors confer risk for substance-related antisocial behavior following release from prison in women (Aim 1), and integrates and compares the utility of rsFC brain measures in improving these prediction models (Aim 2). Then, similar methods will be applied to test the prediction of substance use following release from prison (Aim 3). It is expected that psychiatric risk factors and socioeconomic protective factors, as well as rsFC brain measures, will be useful in predicting substance use and related antisocial behavior following incarceration, along with time elapsed between release from prison and initiation of substance use and related behavior. Testing factors that aid in predicting these behaviors in women has the potential to be far-reaching by informing the development of targeted treatments, including those that help to account for sex differences and co-morbid conditions related to substance use. Project Narrative Women represent one of the fastest growing segments of substance users in the United States, with a growth rate of substance-related offending exceeding that of men; however, women continue to be one of the most underserved populations in substance use research. This proposal will compare statistical models testing effects of psychiatric and socioeconomic factors, along with resting-state functional connectivity in and between cognitive control, decision-making, and reward-processing neural circuitry, to examine unique and combined effects in differentiating among heterogeneous etiological mechanisms driving substance use outcomes in women. The primary goal of this proposal is to examine the utility of brain measures in estimating long-term substance use outcomes in at-risk women in an effort to help inform future treatment efforts.","Predicting Substance Use and Related Antisocial Behavior with Psychiatric, Socioeconomic, and Brain Measures in Women Offenders",9758947,F31DA047048,"['4-aminospiroperidol', 'Abstinence', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Anterior', 'Anxiety', 'Automobile Driving', 'Behavior', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Crime', 'Criminal Justice', 'Data', 'Data Files', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Drug usage', 'Economics', 'Education', 'Employment', 'Enrollment', 'Etiology', 'Fibrinogen', 'Forensic Medicine', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Healthcare', 'Image', 'Imprisonment', 'Individual', 'Insula of Reil', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Logistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Marital Status', 'Measures', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Moods', 'Odds Ratio', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Personality', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Play', 'Predictive Factor', 'Prisons', 'Psychopathology', 'Recording of previous events', 'Regression Analysis', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Sex Differences', 'Societies', 'Socioeconomic Factors', 'Statistical Models', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technology', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Underserved Population', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Woman', 'Work', 'anti social', 'antisocial behavior', 'anxiety symptoms', 'base', 'cognitive control', 'cost', 'data structure', 'design', 'flexibility', 'follow-up', 'hazard', 'improved', 'interest', 'machine learning algorithm', 'men', 'neural circuit', 'neurobiological mechanism', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'offender', 'outcome prediction', 'pediatric trauma', 'predictive modeling', 'protective factors', 'psychopathic personality', 'reward processing', 'social', 'socioeconomics']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF NEW MEXICO,F31,2019,35547,0.1847522652711971
"Using Administrative and Clinical Data to Detect Drug Use and HIV Risk in Foster Care USING ADMINISTRATIVE AND CLINICAL DATA TO DETECT DRUG USE AND HIV RISK IN FOSTER CARE Project Summary  The candidate's goal is to develop an independent research career as a developmental psychologist focused on identifying mechanisms to prevent the onset of pervasive and detrimental health risk behaviors, including substance abuse and HIV risk behaviors, among adolescents and young adults involved in foster care. She has experience in examining psychosocial and behavioral processes during this period of development and a strong publication record for the current phase in her career. Her previous training has emphasized development during adolescence and the transition to adulthood and health behaviors during this timeframe. In the K01, she proposes to expand her training to become an expert leader in team science approaches to address substance use and HIV risk behaviors during adolescence and the transition to adulthood, specifically focusing on foster youth, using child welfare administrative data and electronic medical records (EMR). Her training will emphasize: 1) development as an independent researcher and leader in interdisciplinary approaches to addressing health and development among foster youth, 2) substantive training in child maltreatment, substance use, and HIV risk behaviors, and 3) the use of machine learning to distinguish youth at risk, with the end goal of identifying opportunities for prevention. This will be accomplished through seminars and journal clubs offered at Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center (CCHMC), attending regional and national conferences and trainings on substantive topics, and completion of coursework in child maltreatment and machine learning. Finally, she will complete coursework and seminars addressing the ethical conduct of research. Dr. Beal's goal is to submit an R01, as PI, during the third year of this grant.  CCHMC, one of the top three pediatric research hospitals in the nation, is committed to Dr. Beal's career development. The research environment at CCHMC and within the Division of Behavioral Medicine and Clinical Psychology, and the mentors and collaborators identified in this proposal, are well-suited to Dr. Beal's interests and research goals. Dr. Beal will be co-mentored by Dr. Jennie Noll and Dr. Robert Ammerman. Dr. Noll has extensive experience as a researcher examining the impact of child maltreatment on adolescent development, particularly around sexual risk behaviors. Dr. Ammerman is a well-established researcher with expertise in prevention and intervention programs for high-risk populations. Her advisory committee includes Dr. Melissa Jonson-Reid, an internationally recognized researcher in child welfare and the use of administrative records, Dr. John Schulenberg, developmental psychologist and authority in adolescent and young adult substance use, Dr. Jessica Kahn, expert in adolescent medicine and sexual and HIV risk behaviors, and Dr. John Pestian, leader in machine learning and its application to clinical care. These individuals have made a commitment to mentor and guide Dr. Beal in research and career development.  The objective of this research program is to fill a gap in our current understanding of which adolescents in foster care are at greatest risk for substance use and HIV while simultaneously providing a means for establishing Dr. Beal's independence as a researcher. There are two aims of this proposal. Aim 1 uses discrete time survival analyses and linked child welfare and EMR data to examine the onset and prevalence of substance use and HIV risk behaviors for youth ages 10-20 in foster care compared to matched Medicaid-eligible youth not in foster care (Foster care n=2836; 1-to-1 matched comparison from ~9585 primary care patients). Findings will provide estimates of the rates of substance use and HIV risk behaviors across ages 10-20 and when they increase/decrease, which is critical for identifying the ideal time to begin prevention and intervention efforts. Aim 2 will draw on causal inference techniques and machine learning to identify youth who are substance using or at substantial risk for developing HIV prior to age 21 based on two categories of risk factors: 1 â those common in adolescence, including parental substance use and mental health diagnoses; and 2 â risk factors unique to foster care, including extended time in foster care and placement instability. Analyses will be conducted using structural equation modeling to identify predictors of substance use and HIV risk behaviors. Machine learning will be used to develop classifiers that distinguish youth likely to use substances and contract HIV. This approach will, for the first time, provide a means to identify youth at risk for these negative health outcomes before youth experience these consequences. Via this approach, clinicians and front-line workers will be able to easily distinguish youth at risk and dedicate more time to prevention efforts. The proposed program of training and research will provide a clear pathway for Dr. Beal to transition as an independent researcher. This unique program of research merges her expertise in developmental science and health during adolescence and the transition to adulthood with research in child maltreatment, substance use, and HIV risk behaviors to support interdisciplinary, innovative team science approaches to prevent poor health outcomes among foster youth. The proposed studies in this application are significant because the findings take a developmental perspective to provide clinically useful information about which youth are at risk for poor health outcomes. Such an approach is innovative and will transform prevention delivery efforts for vulnerable foster youth. PROJECT NARRATIVE (PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE) Teens in foster care are at increased risk for substance abuse and contracting HIV compared to their peers, in addition to experiencing poor education, work, and psychosocial outcomes; leveraging administrative child welfare data linked to electronic medical records data for foster youth affords the opportunity to examine key factors that contribute to risk. The goal if this application is to identify youth at risk for substance abuse and HIV, with an eye toward designing intervention and prevention efforts that front-line workers and providers can enact for foster youth prior to age 18 to increase the likelihood that substance abuse and HIV in adulthood can be prevented. The concepts learned through this grant, as well as the career development pursued by the investigator, will be readily applicable to foster youth in child welfare and healthcare settings and could lead to innovations previously unachieved with this challenging and vulnerable adolescent population.",Using Administrative and Clinical Data to Detect Drug Use and HIV Risk in Foster Care,9636556,K01DA041620,"['21 year old', 'Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adolescent Development', 'Adolescent Medicine', 'Adolescent Risk Behavior', 'Adolescent and Young Adult', 'Adoption', 'Adult', 'Advisory Committees', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Algorithms', 'Bees', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Medicine', 'Caring', 'Categories', 'Child Abuse and Neglect', 'Child Welfare', 'Child health care', 'Chronic', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Psychology', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Contracts', 'County', 'Dangerousness', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Drug usage', 'Education', 'Environment', 'Equation', 'Ethics', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Eye', 'Family', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'HIV', 'HIV Infections', 'HIV risk', 'Health', 'Health behavior', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Investments', 'Journals', 'Justice', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Medicaid', 'Medicaid services', 'Medical center', 'Melissa', 'Mental Health', 'Mental Health Services', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Occupations', 'Ohio', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Pediatric Research', 'Phase', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Pregnancy', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Prevention program', 'Preventive', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Primary Health Care', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Psychologist', 'Publications', 'Race', 'Recording of previous events', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Behaviors', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Schools', 'Science', 'Services', 'Sexually Transmitted Diseases', 'Signal Transduction', 'Solid', 'Structure', 'Substance Addiction', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Survival Analysis', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Teenagers', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Translating', 'Voluntary Programs', 'Work', 'Youth', 'adolescent health', 'authority', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'caregiving', 'clinical care', 'discrete time', 'experience', 'falls', 'foster care', 'health care settings', 'high risk population', 'indicated prevention', 'innovation', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'interest', 'intervention program', 'maltreatment', 'peer', 'prevent', 'programs', 'psychosocial', 'public health relevance', 'reproductive', 'research and development', 'sexual risk behavior', 'statistics', 'substance abuse treatment', 'success', 'symposium', 'therapy design', 'volunteer', 'vulnerable adolescent']",NIDA,CINCINNATI CHILDRENS HOSP MED CTR,K01,2019,168497,0.03097573462856159
"Optimal dynamic treatment strategies for controlling alcohol use: novel methods for selecting and incorporating effect modifiers Project Summary: The cyclical and heterogeneous nature of many substance use disorders highlights the need to adapt the type or the dose of treatment to accommodate the specific and changing needs of individuals. This proposal is motivated by the Extending Treatment Effectiveness of Naltrexone (ExTENd) trial, a sequential multiple assignment randomized trial (SMART) designed to find a (personalized) rescue treatment for those who are non-responsive to initial Naltrexone. One of the main challenges in this trial is the presence of the many variables available for consideration when making treatment decisions at each stage of the trial. This feature has made it virtually impossible for investigators to fully explore the possibility of building high quality treatment strategies using the data. Our overarching aim is to address this particular challenge through developing and subsequently applying new statistical methods to the ExTENd trial data. A SMART trial is a multi-stage trial that can inform the design of a dynamic treatment regime (DTR) which formalizes an individualized treatment plan and where current treatment strategy can depend on a patient's past medical and treatment history. An optimal DTR is one that maximizes a specified health outcome of interest. Q-learning can be used with data from both SMARTs and observational studies to estimate an optimal DTR. However, like other model-based approaches, model misspecification can seriously affect the results and lead to the identification of suboptimal DTRs. The potential for misspecification increases with the number of variables that may influence treatment decisions through, e.g., incorrect assumptions on the relationship of variables to the outcome and the inclusion (exclusion) of unimportant (important) variables. These features represent the main analytical challenges for the ExTENd trial. We propose a new approach to Q-learning that leverages machine learning approaches to reduce the chances of misspecifying the relationship between the expected outcome and a given set of variables. We also develop a variable selection technique specifically designed for Q-learning that enables investigators to select the important variables from a long list of possibilities (e.g., genetic and demographic information, medical history over time) when estimating an optimal DTR. In both settings, we will develop new methods for conducting valid inferences (e.g., confidence intervals and p-values), including when there exist patients for whom treatment is neither beneficial nor harmful at a given decision stage (i.e., when an important technical assumption, âuniquenessâ, is violated). Finally, we will develop easy-to-use, publicly available software in the R language that implements our methods. This will allow re-analysis of the ExTENd trial data with a goal of constructing a DTR that improves upon the current rescue treatment strategy for those non-responsive to initial Naltrexone. It will also provide an expandable platform that will assist researchers in developing new optimal DTRs for patients suffering from alcoholism and other substance use disorders. Narrative: This project aims to address the need for robust, rigorous and computationally efficient methods for estimating the optimal treatment regime in substance use disorder. We will develop a variable selection technique that enables investigators to select important variables for the decision- making process among a long list of variables (e.g., patientâs genetic information, demographic characteristics, and medical history over time). We will also leverage statistical machine learning approaches to improve the quality of the constructed optimal treatment regimes while providing valid statistical inference.",Optimal dynamic treatment strategies for controlling alcohol use: novel methods for selecting and incorporating effect modifiers,9721702,R21AA027571,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohol dependence', 'Alcoholism', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Characteristics', 'Code', 'Computer software', 'Confidence Intervals', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Dose', 'Exclusion', 'Fibrinogen', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Individual', 'Language', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Medical', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Medical History', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Naltrexone', 'Nature', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Periodicity', 'Phenotype', 'Process', 'Prognostic Factor', 'Randomized', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Software Tools', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Statistical Methods', 'Subgroup', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Treatment Effectiveness', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Work', 'alcohol use disorder', 'base', 'care providers', 'clinical care', 'clinical decision-making', 'design', 'dosage', 'expectation', 'falls', 'genetic information', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'interest', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'open source', 'optimal treatments', 'overtreatment', 'personalized medicine', 'randomized trial', 'repository', 'response', 'treatment planning', 'treatment strategy', 'trial design', 'virtual']",NIAAA,UNIVERSITY OF ROCHESTER,R21,2019,237402,0.06940955052798725
"MISSION U: A MULTIMEDIA TRAINING TOOL FOR TREATING INDIVIDUALS WITH CO-OCCURRING MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS Co-occurring mental health and substance use disorders (COD) are common in the United States and providers have been challenged to provide effective treatments. As a consequence, their clients with COD may experience poor treatment engagement, symptom exacerbation and cycle in and out of emergency services. This is particularly true for underrepresented populations with a COD including individuals whom are homeless and involved in the criminally justice system. Research shows that integrated and coordinated community- based services for COD can improve client outcomes. However, healthcare workforce has a gap in training staff on such treatment techniques, which we aim to close via this Phase II STTR project.  Maintaining Independence and Sobriety through Systems Integration, Outreach and Networking (MISSION) is a unique evidence-based, trans-disciplinary treatment designed to address the complex needs of individuals with CODs and includes manuals for high risk populations of civilian and veteran homeless individuals as well as those involved in the criminally justice system. Listed in the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Service Administration-Registry for Evidence Based Practices (NREPP), MISSION has had substantial impact. The Veterans Health Administration has deployed it in their national plan to end Veteran Homelessness. Massachusetts has used it in its Statewide Plan to End Homelessness and written it into Public Law for delivery alongside Veterans Treatment courts. While MISSION is a manualized treatment, a recent multisite implementation study identified the need for more comprehensive training tools. With NIAAA support, the University of Massachusetts Medical School (MISSION developers) partnered with Praxis on a Phase I STTR to (1) develop the MISSION University online training platform, (2) show proof of concept by implementing two training modules and an e-simulation case study, and (3) conduct a pilot randomized trial which demonstrated that training-as-usual Distance Learning (DL) + Technical Assistance (TA) outperformed TA alone.  In Phase II, we will complete MISSION U by developing and testing five new MISSION modules and companion e-simulations tools that test knowledge acquisition and application. We will first do a formative evaluation with 20 learners who will provide feedback on MISSION U modules. This will be followed by a randomized controlled trial similar to Phase I in which 60 learners will be randomized to the DL or the DL+TA conditions. In preparation for future scalability, we will uniquely conduct a qualitative process evaluation using the Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, Maintenance framework with 42 MISSION U participants to look at facilitators and barriers to implementation. Lastly, we will pilot test machine learning techniques with our 60 individuals who participated in the randomized trial in an effort to help personalize the MISSION U training experience for commercialization. !1 âMISSION U: A Multimedia Training Tool for Treatment of Individuals with Co-occurring Mental Health and Substance Use Disordersâ is aimed at training providers of services for these individuals. MISSION U challenges prevailing provider training methodology that relies mainly on on-site provider training and/or online training using typical classroom-type materials. This project not only addresses the growing need for new provider training methodologies, but also offers the promise of improving clinical efficacy and reducing training costs and medical expenditures overall.! !",MISSION U: A MULTIMEDIA TRAINING TOOL FOR TREATING INDIVIDUALS WITH CO-OCCURRING MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS,9774983,R42AA026751,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Administrator', 'Adoption', 'Adult', 'Assertiveness', 'Caring', 'Case Manager', 'Case Study', 'Client', 'Clinical', 'Community Outreach', 'Companions', 'Complex', 'Criminal Justice', 'Data', 'Development', 'Distance Learning', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Effectiveness', 'Emergency medical service', 'England', 'Evaluation', 'Evidence based practice', 'Evidence based program', 'Expenditure', 'Feedback', 'Focus Groups', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Health Personnel', 'Health Professional', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Homelessness', 'Imprisonment', 'Individual', 'Instruction', 'Knowledge', 'Knowledge acquisition', 'Laws', 'Learning Module', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Manuals', 'Massachusetts', 'Materials Testing', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Mental Health', 'Methodology', 'Multimedia', 'National Health Services', 'National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Population', 'Pre-Post Tests', 'Preparation', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Psychosocial Influences', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Services', 'Site', 'Small Business Technology Transfer Research', 'Specialist', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Systems Integration', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Training Programs', 'Underrepresented Populations', 'United States', 'United States Department of Veterans Affairs', 'United States Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration', 'Universities', 'Veterans', 'Videoconferences', 'Work', 'arm', 'base', 'behavioral health', 'clinical efficacy', 'commercialization', 'community based service', 'computer science', 'cost', 'court', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'field study', 'formative assessment', 'health administration', 'health care service utilization', 'high risk population', 'improved', 'medical schools', 'multidisciplinary', 'operation', 'outreach', 'peer', 'peer support', 'phase I trial', 'programs', 'prototype', 'provider networks', 'randomized trial', 'satisfaction', 'service providers', 'simulation', 'skills', 'sobriety', 'suicidal risk', 'therapy design', 'tool', 'usability']",NIAAA,"PRAXIS, INC.",R42,2019,751223,0.05076658704953024
"ABCD-USA Consortium:Research Project DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Adolescence is a critical neurodevelopmental period that is associated with dramatic increases in rates of substance use. Identifying predictors of substance use and its effects on child and adolescent development is critically important, as substance-related decrements incurred during ongoing maturation could have long- lasting effects on brain functioning and behavioral, health, and psychological outcomes. In response to RFA- DA-15-015, this application proposes the University of Pittsburgh Research Project Site component [12/13] of the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD)-USA consortium to prospectively determine the neurodevelopmental and behavioral effects of substance on children and adolescents. In Pittsburgh, a representative community sample of 550 9-10 year old substance-naÃ¯ve children will be recruited (total ABCD- USA n=11,111 from 11 total sites) and will undergo a baseline assessment and two to three follow-ups over a five year period. At each assessment period, participants will undergo state-of-the-art brain imaging, comprehensive neuropsychological testing, and extensive assessment of substance use patterns and mental health functioning. The brain, behavioral, psychological, social, genetic, and environmental data collected during the course of this project will elucidate: 1) the effects o substance use patterns on the adolescent brain; 2) the effects of substance use on behavioral and health outcomes; 3) the bidirectional relationship between psychopathology and substance use patterns; 4) the effects of individual genetic, behavioral, neurobiological, and environmental differences on risk profiles and substance use outcomes; and 5) the ""gateway interactions"" between use of different substances. Elements Unique to This Site: In addition, ABCD-USA Pittsburgh will provide a unique focus determining how the cognitive dimensions of working memory and inhibitory control and the maturation of corticostriatal systems can inform our understanding of the risks for and effects of early adolescent marijuana use. Working memory and inhibitory control improve during adolescence in parallel with maturation of underlying corticostriatal neurocircuitry. An understanding of these areas of adolescent brain and cognitive development provide critical information in models determining vulnerabilities for and consequences of marijuana and other substance use. In Y03, Pittsburgh will focus on analyses examining working memory and inhibitory control phenotypes and neurodevelopmental characteristics prior to substance use. In Y04-Y05, these neurocognitive characteristics will be examined as risks for early adolescent marijuana use trajectories and, in Y10, accelerated adolescent marijuana use trajectories. Machine Learning will be applied to integrating cognitive and neuroimaging features to characterize a model of risks for early adolescent marijuana use. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The ABCD-USA Consortium will use multimodal brain imaging, cognitive and clinical assessments, bioassays, mobile monitoring, and careful assessment of substance use, environment, psychopathological symptoms, and social functioning in 11,111 adolescents followed over 10 years to determine the effects of substance use on adolescent brain and cognitive development. Our 12/13 ABCD-USA Consortium: Research Project will recruit and assess 550 youth age 9-10 at project entry.

"Real-time Assessment of Dialogue in Motivational Interviewing training (ReadMI) Project Summary/Abstract  Substance misuse is inconsistently addressed in routine medical practice. Primary care physicians frequently fail to diagnose substance abuse when presented with early symptoms of alcohol or drug use. Patients report that less than one-third of primary care physicians carefully screen them for substance abuse, in spite of available and effective screening protocols. Screening, Brief Intervention, and Referral to Treatment (SBIRT) is an integrated, evidence-based approach aimed at delivering early intervention for drug and alcohol misuse in medical settings and has been demonstrated to reduce substance misuse. Motivational Interviewing (MI), an underlying component of SBIRT, is an evidence-based, brief interventional approach that has been demonstrated to be highly effective in triggering change in high-risk lifestyle behaviors. Unfortunately, the MI approach is very difficult to teach to practitioners as it is counterintuitive to most providers who commonly take a directive approach with patients. Because of ineffective training, MI and SBIRT are under-utilized.  The primary goal of this project is to transform MI and SBIRT training with a software-based training solution that analyzes practitioner responses and gives immediate feedback to improve MI skills. Our team has been developing and testing a training tool that uses natural language processing (NLP) to provide Real-time Assessment of Dialogue in Motivational Interviewing (ReadMI). ReadMI is a low cost, ultra-portable solution for accurate and automatic real-time assessment of dialog during the course of MI training. It makes use of the latest advances in deep-learning-based speech recognition and mobile and cloud computing technologies to enable instantaneous MI training assessment and analysis. Currently functioning with 92% accuracy, ReadMI provides immediate feedback to MI and SBIRT trainees regarding the number of open- and closed-ended questions asked, provider-vs-patient conversation time, and other integral components of MI.  ReadMI will advance the skill development of physicians and other healthcare professionals in their use of MI and SBIRT, minimizing the need for time-consuming reviews of recorded training sessions. Our aims are: 1) develop ReadMI to provide MI training metrics with 95% accuracy and 2) test ReadMI in a randomized controlled trial (RCT) with 200 medical students and residents, 100 who will receive SBIRT/MI training with ReadMI and 100 who will serve as the control group, receiving customary SBIRT/MI training.  The prospective applications of ReadMI extend far beyond substance use disorder (SUD) prevention, detection, and intervention. The effectiveness of all chronic disease management is largely dependent on patient behavior. MI is a patient-focused conversation between the provider and the patient that reinforces the patient's motivation to make positive changes in health-related behavior. By making efficient MI training available to more health professionals, ReadMI will improve healthcare quality as providers are better equipped in their efforts to help patients make healthy lifestyle changes. Project Narrative Motivational Interviewing (MI) is an evidence-based approach that has been demonstrated to be highly effective in triggering change in high-risk lifestyle behaviors, including substance misuse. However, MI and a specific application of MI to substance misuse known as SBIRT (Screening, Brief Intervention, and Referral to Treatment) are underutilized because of inadequate training of health professionals. This research aims to revolutionize MI and SBIRT training with a software-based training solution that uses natural language processing to provide Real-time Assessment of Dialogue in Motivational Interviewing (ReadMI).",Real-time Assessment of Dialogue in Motivational Interviewing training (ReadMI),9824096,R21HS026548,[' '],AHRQ,WRIGHT STATE UNIVERSITY,R21,2019,174994,0.08391338565983965
"Telemedicine for Treatment of Opioid Use Disorder PROJECT SUMMARY: A key challenge in combating the opioid epidemic has been connecting individuals with opioid use disorder to evidence-based treatments. The President's Commission on Combating Drug Addiction and the Opioid Crisis and others have suggested that telemedicine for substance use disorder (âtele- SUDâ) may be part of the solution. In preliminary analyses, we have found that tele-SUD use is growing rapidly, and there is widespread policy interest in Congress and state legislatures in how to accelerate this growth. The SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act, signed into law in October 2018, includes several provisions intended to reduce barriers to tele-SUD use and will likely increase the availability of and reimbursement for tele-SUD. However, despite the widespread interest and growing use, there has never been a rigorous assessment of tele-SUD. For example, what are the different tele-SUD models being used to treat opioid use disorder, what barriers exist to greater use of tele-SUD, and is tele-SUD use associated with improved (or potentially worse) quality of care for people with opioid use disorder? To fill this knowledge gap, we propose a comprehensive national evaluation of telemedicine for opioid use disorder using data through 2021 from Medicaid, Medicare, and commercial insurance as well as a series of qualitative interviews. Our Aims are to: (1) describe the different models of how tele-SUD is being incorporated into opioid use disorder care and how this is changing over time, (2) identify regional factors associated with greater tele-SUD use for opioid use disorder, (3) examine the association between tele-SUD use and quality of opioid use disorder care received and whether this varies by model, and (4) describe existing tele-SUD programs, and identify barriers and facilitators to tele-SUD adoption and sustainability. The proposed mixed-methods study will help providers interested in using tele-SUD and inform ongoing debates about regulations and reimbursement for tele-SUD in Congress and state legislatures. Our goal is to highlight policies and practices that drive greater use of tele-SUD and explore its potential role in improving access to, and quality of, care for individuals with opioid use disorder. Our research will help inform how tele- SUD may be leveraged to combat the opioid epidemic as well as other substance use disorders, such as alcohol and methamphetamine use disorders. PROJECT NARRATIVE: Many patients with opioid use disorder have great difficulty accessing substance use disorder (SUD) treatment. Telemedicine for SUD (âtele-SUDâ) is one potential solution, and many states and the Congress are considering laws and regulations to encourage greater tele-SUD use. In this project, our goal is to understand how tele-SUD is being used for patients, what drives the variation in use, whether tele-SUD is associated with better care, and how some providers have successfully used tele-SUD.",Telemedicine for Treatment of Opioid Use Disorder,9835697,R01DA048533,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Alcohol consumption', 'American', 'Buprenorphine', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Congresses', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Drug Addiction', 'Enrollment', 'Epidemic', 'Evaluation', 'Evidence based treatment', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Improve Access', 'Individual', 'Insurance', 'Internet', 'Interview', 'Knowledge', 'Laws', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medicaid', 'Medicare', 'Mental disorders', 'Methadone', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Naltrexone', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physically Handicapped', 'Play', 'Policies', 'Privacy', 'Provider', 'Quality of Care', 'Recommendation', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Role', 'Series', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Telemedicine', 'Time', 'Transportation', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'United States Food and Drug Administration', 'Variant', 'Visit', 'Work', 'base', 'combat', 'design', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'methamphetamine use', 'opioid epidemic', 'opioid mortality', 'opioid use disorder', 'programs', 'randomized trial', 'rural area', 'screening', 'treatment duration']",NIDA,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,R01,2019,735192,0.10269643126733353
"ABCD-USA Consortium: Data Analysis Center DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The ABCD-USA Consortium proposes a study designed to permit the scientific community to answer important questions about the effects of substance use (SU) patterns on behavioral and brain development of adolescents. We have assembled a team of investigators with unparalleled research experience with children and adolescents, and specific expertise in adolescent SU, child and adolescent development, developmental psychopathology, longitudinal multi-site imaging, developmental neuroimaging, developmental cognitive neuroscience, genetics and imaging genetics, bioassays, epidemiology, survey research, bioinformatics, and mobile assessment technologies. We propose a comprehensive, nationwide study to be conducted at 21 sites organized into 11 hubs (over 89 million Americans, 29% of the US population, live within 50 miles of our geographically spread sites), that, uniquely, can provide a nationally representative sample and a large twin sample that together can help distinguish environmental, sociocultural, and genetic factors relevant to SU. We ensure cohesion and standardization by employing a recruitment strategy designed by a professional survey company (experience with Monitoring the Future); standardized environmental, neurocognitive and mental health assessments, MRI assessments with all scanners using harmonized Human Connectome Project procedures, and computerized data collection with real-time quality control. Developmentally tailored assessments will have stable sensitivity and construct validity across the childhood and adolescent developmental period. They minimize participant burden, yet capture even subtle changes over time in substance use, mental health, neurocognition, development, and environment, and we employ novel state-of-the-art bioassays and passive data collection from mobile devices. A detailed retention plan builds on the experience and success of our investigators. This application describes the ABCD-USA Data Analysis and Informatics Center (DAIC), which will: establish a harmonized MRI acquisition protocol, compatible with all major scanner platforms, taking advantage of recent technological advances in structural and functional MRI; establish rigorous quality control and quantitative calibration procedures to ensure accuracy and comparability of derived imaging measures across scanners and across time; implement advanced computational analysis workflows for all imaging data; implement reliable data entry, quality control, and monitoring tools for the substance use questionnaire, neurocognitive assessments, bioassay-derived measures, and mobile technologies assessment data; implement the state- of-the-art statistical analysis tools and procedures needed to integrate information across measures and modalities; and implement infrastructure and procedures for public sharing of raw- and derived data and associated tools and computational workflows, and enable interactive data exploration and analytics through a web-based Portal.

In this proposal, the investigators intend to deploy the RAE system- consisting of a wearable sensor, a smartphone app, and a clinical portal- to provide individuals in recovery and their treatment providers with an opportunity to identify moments of high risk for relapse and to access real time intervention opportunities. Wearable biosensors are small, noninvasive devices that continuously record physiology. These sensors have the ability to detect digital biomarkers of drug use and stress, the latter of which herald an increased risk of relapse. RAE aims to utilize this capability to create a real-time solution for individuals in recovery. The components of RAE are: 1) The Empatica Embrace, a wrist mounted sensor similar in form factor to a smart watch, that continuously monitors skin temperature, electrodermal activity (EDA) and locomotion. Detection algorithms for stress and drug use will be embedded on the Embrace firmware. 2) The RAE smartphone application (app), for the individual in recovery. The app will be triggered either by detection of an event on the Embrace or manually by the user when needed and will provide multiple options for annotations, stress reduction techniques and immediate contact with individuals in the pre-defined support system via call or SMS text. The app will also log sleep, physical activity, and geographic location of events. 3) The RAE Portal, for the treatment provider, will deliver immediate alerts when an event is detected on the userâs device for the opportunity to intervene in real time and will also provide metrics on the userâs recorded activities. The research plan has two Specific Aims: Aim 1) To deploy and optimize the RAE system in a population of individuals in treatment for substance use disorder and Aim 2) To demonstrate the impact of the RAE system on outcomes in substance use treatment. To achieve these aims the investigators will first deploy the technology in a population of individuals in recovery and collect data on accuracy, usability and functionality (Aim 1). The data from Aim 1 will be used to optimize the system and achieve millstones prior to transition to Aim 2 which will include sensitivity, specify, accuracy and user compliance targets. The investigators will then undertake a multi-site, randomized controlled trial (Aim 2) to evaluate the efficacy of RAE on key outcomes including rates of relapse, retention in treatment programs, and psychosocial wellbeing. The investigators have assembled a leadership team and advisory team with the necessary expertise in business, medicine, wearable technology and engineering to develop RAE into a tool that dramatically improves the success of treatment for substance use disorder, promotes sustained sobriety, and reduces morbidity and mortality from relapse to substance use. PROJECT NARRATIVE Morbidity and mortality related to substance use disorder has reached staggering proportions, and treatment options suffer from high rates of relapse. RAE (Realize, Analyze, Engage) is a mobile based solution that combines a wearable sensor, a smartphone app and a cloud based clinical portal to detect stress and drug use in individuals in treatment for substance use disorder. The goal of the RAE system is to provide real-time intervention tools for patients, to allow clinicians to personalize the treatment approach for each patient, and ultimately to reduce morbidity and mortality from substance use disorder by improving the success of treatment programs.","RAE (Realize, Analyze, Engage)- A Digital Biomarker Based Detection and Intervention System for Stress and Craving During Recovery from Substance Abuse Disorders",9545385,R44DA046151,"['Advisory Committees', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Algorithms', 'Anxiety', 'Award', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Biological Markers', 'Biosensor', 'Businesses', 'Car Phone', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Disease', 'Drug usage', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Explosion', 'Foundations', 'Geographic Locations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act', 'Health Personnel', 'Healthcare', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Italy', 'Journals', 'Leadership', 'Link', 'Location', 'Locomotion', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Opioid', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Persons', 'Physical activity', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Precipitating Factors', 'Predisposition', 'Provider', 'Psychosocial Factor', 'Publishing', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recovery', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Research Project Summaries', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Seizures', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Site', 'Skin Temperature', 'Sleep', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Stream', 'Stress', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Suicide', 'Support System', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Time', 'User Compliance', 'Wireless Technology', 'Wrist', 'active method', 'addiction', 'base', 'cloud based', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'craving', 'design', 'digital', 'experience', 'handheld mobile device', 'high risk', 'improved', 'mobile application', 'mortality', 'personalized medicine', 'prevent', 'psychosocial', 'relapse risk', 'sensor', 'service providers', 'signal processing', 'smart watch', 'smartphone Application', 'sobriety', 'software development', 'stress management', 'stress reduction', 'substance abuse treatment', 'success', 'tool', 'treatment program', 'usability', 'wearable device', 'wearable technology']",NIDA,"CONTINUEYOU, LLC",R44,2019,224991,0.1390034058307754
"Missing Data Matters: Substance Use Disorder Clinical Trials Program Director/Principal Investigator (Last, First, Middle): Scharfstein, Daniel, Oscar Project Summary/Abstract Missing outcome data threaten the validity of randomized clinical trials because inference about treatment effects then necessarily relies on untestable assumptions, which wrongly stated can lead to incorrect conclusions. While it is widely recognized that evaluating the sensitivity of trial results to assumptions about the missing data mech- anism should be a mandatory component of reporting, rigorous sensitivity analyses are not routinely reported. Likely explanations include inadequate knowledge translation by statistical methodologists to both principal in- vestigators and their statistical collaborators as well as lack of software. Substance use disorder clinical trials are known to suffer from high rates of missing data. Unlike regulatory trials where missing data are primarily the result of premature study withdrawal, individuals in substance use disorder trials tend to intermittently skip their scheduled outcome assessments. This produces an explosion of ânon-monotoneâ missing data patterns that makes sensitivity analysis methodologically and computationally chal- lenging. There has been relatively little research on sensitivity analysis procedures for analyzing such data and the procedures that have been developed are anchored to assumptions that are problematic. Thus, investigators are faced with challenging analytic barriers and the conclusions they draw from their trials may be ï¬awed. In this three-year proposal, we will reanalyze 29 clinical trials conducted by NIDA's Clinical Trials Network (CTN), and made publicly available on NIDA's DataShare website, to evaluate their robustness to missing data assump- tions through rigorous sensitivity analysis. Since adequate tools for conducting sensitivity analysis of studies with highly non-monotone missing data patterns do not yet exist, we plan to develop, implement and dissemi- nate (through journal articles, short courses and webinars) an innovative sensitivity analysis methodology and open-source, user-friendly software to evaluate the robustness, to missing data assumptions, of trials in which binary outcomes (e.g., substance use) are scheduled to be repeatedly collected at ï¬xed points in time after ran- domization and participants intermittently skip their scheduled assessments. Our tool will be developed by an interdisciplinary team of biostatisticians and substance use disorder treatment experts, with input from an advi- sory board comprised of highly regarded statistical experts and leading scientists in the substance use disorder community. Through reanalysis of the NIDA's CTN trials using our tool, we will be better able to understand the impact of missing data assumptions on the evaluation of the studied interventions. Additionally, demonstrat- ing the importance and utility of our tool to our advisory board and to the substance use disorder community more broadly stands to increase the likelihood of adoption. Finally, the development, testing, and dissemination of this innovative statistical tool can serve as a template for other scientiï¬c domains, making âstress-testingâ to untestable missing data assumptions a more routine component of scientiï¬c reporting. Program Director/Principal Investigator (Last, First, Middle): Scharfstein, Daniel, Oscar Project Narrative We will develop, implement and disseminate an innovative sensitivity analysis methodology and open-source, user-friendly software tool to evaluate the robustness to missing data assumptions of clinical trials in which binary outcomes are collected at ï¬xed points over time but where participants intermittently miss their scheduled assess- ments, as frequently occurs in addiction research. We will utilize this tool to reanalyze data from 29 substance abuse clinical trials conducted by NIDA's Clinical Trials Network and available publicly on NIDA's DataShare web- site. As a result, we will be better able to understand the impact of missing data assumptions on the evaluation of the studied interventions and, by demonstrating the importance and utility of our tool to an advisory board comprised of study investigators and to the substance use disorder community more broadly, we aim to make âstress-testingâ to untestable missing data assumptions a more routine part of scientiï¬c reporting.",Missing Data Matters: Substance Use Disorder Clinical Trials,9756356,R01DA046534,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Case Study', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Network', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Conduct Clinical Trials', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation Studies', 'Explosion', 'Future', 'Goals', 'HIV', 'HIV risk', 'Health', 'Health system', 'Individual', 'Intervention Studies', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Movement', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Assessment', 'Outcome Measure', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Principal Investigator', 'Procedures', 'Property', 'Publishing', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk Behaviors', 'Schedule', 'Scientist', 'Software Tools', 'Source', 'Stress Tests', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Uncertainty', 'Urine', 'Withdrawal', 'Work', 'addiction', 'base', 'data sharing', 'flexibility', 'innovation', 'interest', 'journal article', 'knowledge translation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'novel', 'open data', 'open source', 'premature', 'prevent', 'programs', 'secondary analysis', 'simulation', 'software development', 'study characteristics', 'tool', 'treatment effect', 'user friendly software', 'user-friendly', 'web site', 'webinar']",NIDA,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,486320,0.14381931533215023
"Implementation of Technology-Based Evaluation of Motivational Interviewing ï»¿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Millions of Americans are receiving behavioral interventions for problematic alcohol use. In 2010, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) documented over 1.8 million treatment episodes for drug and alcohol problems, many involving group or individual psychotherapy. The tremendous service-delivery need has focused research on optimal training methods, to promote the dissemination of evidence-based interventions. A recent meta-analysis of motivational interviewing (MI) shows that ""post-training supports"" - such as performance-based feedback or coaching - are critical for maintaining counselor skills following training. However, the practical implementation of performance-based feedback for alcohol use disorders (AUDs) and problematic drinking is currently prohibitive in effort, time, and money. There is a critical need or technology to ""scale up"" performance-based feedback to counselors for AUDs and problematic drinking.  This competitive renewal builds on interdisciplinary research focused on automating the evaluation of MI fidelity for alcohol and substance use problems. This collaborative research brings together speech signal processing experts from electrical engineering and statistical text-mining and natural language processing experts from computer science with MI expert trainers and researchers. Our previous research laid a computational foundation for generating MI fidelity codes from semantic and vocal features, and the current proposal moves this work into direct clinical application. In collaboration with the University of Utah Counseling Center (UCC), we will develop and implement a clinical software support tool, the Counselor Observer Ratings Expert for MI (CORE-MI). The CORE-MI system will provide performance-based feedback focused on MI fidelity codes for training, supervision, and quality assurance for counselors treating clients struggling with alcohol and substance use problems.  The research will use a hybrid implementation-effectiveness design to pursue the following three aims: 1) Implement and calibrate the CORE-MI system at the UCC clinic to provide automated, performance-based feedback on MI; 2) Compare counselor fidelity to MI and client alcohol and substance use outcomes, before and after initiation of the CORE-MI system (approximately, N = 2,400 sessions); and 3) Using machine learning tools, computationally explore mechanisms of MI using semantic and vocal data, MI fidelity codes, and client outcomes from approximately 3,000 sessions. The successful execution of this project will break the reliance on human judgment for providing performance-based feedback to MI and will massively expand the capacity to train, supervise, and provide quality assurance. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    Performance-based feedback is an effective method for training and supervising counseling approaches for alcohol-related problems. However, current feedback methods rely on human raters and are not feasible in the real-world due to time and cost. The current study will implement a clinical support software tool that uses speech signal processing and computational models - instead of human judgment - to evaluate motivational interviewing for alcohol and substance use problems.",Implementation of Technology-Based Evaluation of Motivational Interviewing,9538549,R01AA018673,"['Acoustics', 'Addictive Behavior', 'Alcohol abuse', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Alcohols', 'American', 'Arousal', 'Assessment tool', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Calibration', 'Cause of Death', 'Client', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical effectiveness', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Counseling', 'Data', 'Development', 'Educational workshop', 'Effectiveness', 'Electrical Engineering', 'Empathy', 'Evaluation', 'Evidence based intervention', 'Feedback', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Group Psychotherapy', 'Homicide', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Individual', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention Studies', 'Judgment', 'Learning', 'Learning Skill', 'Life', 'Linguistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental Health', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Patient Outcomes Assessments', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Population', 'Process', 'Professional counselor', 'Psychologist', 'Psychotherapy', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Semantics', 'Software Tools', 'Speech', 'Standardization', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Suicide', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Support', 'United States Department of Veterans Affairs', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'United States Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration', 'Universities', 'Utah', 'Vision', 'Work', 'addiction', 'alcohol abuse therapy', 'alcohol intervention', 'alcohol related problem', 'alcohol use disorder', 'base', 'clinical application', 'clinical implementation', 'computer science', 'cost', 'design', 'drinking', 'high risk drinking', 'improved', 'motivational enhancement therapy', 'public health relevance', 'quality assurance', 'scale up', 'service delivery', 'signal processing', 'skills', 'support tools', 'technological innovation', 'technology validation', 'text searching', 'tool', 'vehicular accident', 'visual feedback', 'young adult']",NIAAA,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2018,602663,0.03252114040369104
"Classifying addictions using machine learning analysis of multidimensional data ABSTRACT This Independent Scientist Award will significantly enhance my research capabilities, enabling me to become a leading quantitative investigator in the field of substance use disorders (SUDs). Specifically, it will allow me to increase my knowledge in the areas of SUD phenotypes, treatment and genetics. SUDs are clinically and etiologically heterogeneous and their classification has been difficult. This application reflects my ongoing commitment to developing an innovative and interdisciplinary research program on the classification of SUDs through quantitative analysis of multidimensional data. My extensive training in computational science and prior research on biomedical informatics have provided me with the skills to design, implement and evaluate advanced algorithms and sophisticated analyses to solve challenging problems in classifying SUDs. My ongoing NIDA-funded R01 employs a large (n=~12,000) sample aggregated from multiple genetic studies of cocaine, opioid, and alcohol dependence to develop and evaluate novel statistical models to generate clinical SUD subtypes that are optimized for gene finding. This K02 proposal extends that work to evaluate treatment outcome in refined subgroups of SUD populations using data from treatment studies for cocaine, opioid, alcohol and multiple substance dependence. This project will integrate data from diagnostic behavioral variables and genotypes, as well as biological/neurobiological features of the disorders and repeated measures of treatment outcome. The primary career development goals of this application are to: (1) understand the reliability, validity and functional mechanisms of various phenotyping methods; (2) to continue training in the genetics of addictions; and (3) to gain greater knowledge of different treatment approaches and their efficacy. A solid foundation in these areas will enhance my ability to realize the full potential of the data collected and aggregated from multiple dimensions, and to use the data to design the most clinically useful analysis and generate innovative solutions to diagnostic and predictive challenges in SUD research. Through formal coursework, directed readings, individual tutoring and intensive multidisciplinary collaboration with a diverse team of world-renowned researchers, I will receive training and collect pilot data for future R01 projects by examining (Aim I): whether clinically-defined highly heritable subtypes derived in my current R01 project predict differential treatment response; (Aim II) whether new statistical models that directly combine treatment data with behavioral, biological, and genomic data identify refined subtypes with confirmatory multilevel evidence; and (Aim III) whether there are genetic and social moderators of treatment outcome by subtype. The overall goal of this proposal is to further my independent and multidisciplinary research program in the development of statistical methods for refined classification of SUDs. The K02 award will provide me with the protected time necessary to fully engage in the training activities described that will enhance my knowledge and skills to enable me to make important, novel contributions to the genetics and treatment of SUD. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project will develop novel statistical and quantitative tools to identify homogeneous subtypes of substance use disorders (SUDs) and other complex diseases to enhance gene finding and treatment matching. The proposed project will perform secondary analyses of existing data from treatment studies of cocaine, opioid, alcohol, and mixed SUDs. The proposed novel approaches are expected to advance precision medicine approaches to SUDs by enabling treatment matching and a more refined SUD classification to gene finding.",Classifying addictions using machine learning analysis of multidimensional data,9427988,K02DA043063,"['Adherence', 'Aftercare', 'Alcohol dependence', 'Alcohols', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biosensor', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Cocaine', 'Cocaine Dependence', 'Collaborations', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Complex', 'Computational Science', 'DSM-IV', 'DSM-V', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Drug Use Disorder', 'Electroencephalography', 'Etiology', 'Foundations', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Markers', 'Genetic study', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Heritability', 'Heterogeneity', 'Independent Scientist Award', 'Individual', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Investigation', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'Neurobiology', 'Opiate Addiction', 'Opioid', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmacogenetics', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Reading', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Solid', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Subgroup', 'Substance Addiction', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Treatment outcome', 'Work', 'addiction', 'alcohol use disorder', 'biomarker performance', 'biomedical informatics', 'career development', 'cocaine use', 'contingency management', 'design', 'disease classification', 'disorder subtype', 'endophenotype', 'genetic association', 'genomic data', 'imaging genetics', 'improved', 'innovation', 'neural correlate', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'opioid use disorder', 'outcome prediction', 'personalized medicine', 'precision medicine', 'programs', 'recruit', 'secondary analysis', 'skills', 'social', 'tool', 'treatment planning', 'treatment response', 'tutoring']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF CONNECTICUT STORRS,K02,2018,162800,0.07416387016693718
"Predicting Stimulant Use Relapse using Neuroimaging Techniques Project Summary / Abstract  Neuroimaging methodologies, including electroencephalography (EEG), event-related potentials (ERPs), and both structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging (s/fMRI) have emerged as significant predictors of substance use relapse. These neuroimaging techniques have helped provide an objective, sensitive, and predictive measure of substance use relapse propensity. As the capabilities of biological science advance, a lingering impediment to progress is the study of individual brain regions implicated in predicting substance use relapse. Important to note, individual brain regions rarely work independently; rather, such regions often work in concert, as specific networks, continually sending and receiving information to other regions, to help facilitate learning, memory, and other cognitive processes. The investigation of ICA-derived functional network connectivity between brain regions may lend incremental utility for classifying, diagnosing, and predicting substance use relapse.  Here, using the worldâs largest forensic database, which includes clinical and neuropsychological measures, electrophysiological measures, functional neuroimaging, and functional network connectivity measures, the primary goal of this project will be to delineate specific risk factors predictive of eventual stimulant use relapse propensity. This will be accomplished by integrating models incorporating logistic and Cox proportional-hazard regressions, and cross-validation machine learning pattern classifiers to predict stimulant use relapse one year after institutional release with an at-risk sample of adult incarcerated offenders.  First, we will examine the potential of various clinical and neuropsychological assessment measures in predicting stimulant use relapse. Second, we will investigate the predictive utility of error-monitoring neural measures using traditional ERPs and fMRI in predicting stimulant use relapse. Third, we will apply more agnostic, data-driven methods, including ICA-derived functional network connectivity analyses of fMRI data to measure functional connectivity between brain regions involved in error-processing to predict stimulant use relapse. Ultimately, this research will lend incremental utility in the successful prediction of stimulant use relapse, providing a more sensitive and predictive measure compared to previous investigations. The ultimate goal of the proposed training fellowship is to help provide a more biologically informed taxonomy of neurocognitive deficits associated with those prone to stimulant use relapse. Project Narrative  Prevalence estimates indicate that roughly half of incarcerated offenders meet criteria for previous history of substance use disorders (SUDs) (Center for Behavioral Health Statistics and Quality, 2015), with a majority (66.7%) relapsing within three years of institutional release (Langan & Levin, 2002). Identifying specific risk factors, including neurocognitive measures involved in predicting stimulant use relapse following release from custody could lead to important insights into this high-risk sample. The research proposed here will examine brain anatomy, function and connectivity, and psychological traits using the world's largest multi- modal database of its kind from an incarcerated sample to directly aid the development of more contemporary, scientifically-validated taxonomy of the pathophysiology related to neurocognitive deficits associated with stimulant use relapse propensity.",Predicting Stimulant Use Relapse using Neuroimaging Techniques,9565939,F31DA043328,"['Adult', 'Age-Years', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Anatomy', 'Anterior', 'Anxiety', 'Attention', 'Basal Ganglia', 'Biological', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Biological Sciences', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Clinical', 'Clinical assessments', 'Cognitive', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dorsal', 'Education', 'Electroencephalography', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Event-Related Potentials', 'Fellowship', 'Forensic Medicine', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Image Analysis', 'Imprisonment', 'Impulsivity', 'Individual', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Logistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurocognitive Deficit', 'Neuropsychology', 'New Mexico', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Populations at Risk', 'Predictive Factor', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Prevalence', 'Recording of previous events', 'Regression Analysis', 'Relapse', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Taxonomy', 'Techniques', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Work', 'behavioral health', 'cingulate cortex', 'cognitive process', 'court', 'depressive symptoms', 'experience', 'hazard', 'hemodynamics', 'high risk', 'imaging study', 'independent component analysis', 'insight', 'instrument', 'neuroimaging', 'offender', 'predictive modeling', 'psychologic', 'psychopathic personality', 'relapse prediction', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'statistics', 'stimulant use', 'symptomatology', 'trait']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF NEW MEXICO,F31,2018,27846,0.04917604484763801
"Using Administrative and Clinical Data to Detect Drug Use and HIV Risk in Foster Care USING ADMINISTRATIVE AND CLINICAL DATA TO DETECT DRUG USE AND HIV RISK IN FOSTER CARE Project Summary  The candidate's goal is to develop an independent research career as a developmental psychologist focused on identifying mechanisms to prevent the onset of pervasive and detrimental health risk behaviors, including substance abuse and HIV risk behaviors, among adolescents and young adults involved in foster care. She has experience in examining psychosocial and behavioral processes during this period of development and a strong publication record for the current phase in her career. Her previous training has emphasized development during adolescence and the transition to adulthood and health behaviors during this timeframe. In the K01, she proposes to expand her training to become an expert leader in team science approaches to address substance use and HIV risk behaviors during adolescence and the transition to adulthood, specifically focusing on foster youth, using child welfare administrative data and electronic medical records (EMR). Her training will emphasize: 1) development as an independent researcher and leader in interdisciplinary approaches to addressing health and development among foster youth, 2) substantive training in child maltreatment, substance use, and HIV risk behaviors, and 3) the use of machine learning to distinguish youth at risk, with the end goal of identifying opportunities for prevention. This will be accomplished through seminars and journal clubs offered at Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center (CCHMC), attending regional and national conferences and trainings on substantive topics, and completion of coursework in child maltreatment and machine learning. Finally, she will complete coursework and seminars addressing the ethical conduct of research. Dr. Beal's goal is to submit an R01, as PI, during the third year of this grant.  CCHMC, one of the top three pediatric research hospitals in the nation, is committed to Dr. Beal's career development. The research environment at CCHMC and within the Division of Behavioral Medicine and Clinical Psychology, and the mentors and collaborators identified in this proposal, are well-suited to Dr. Beal's interests and research goals. Dr. Beal will be co-mentored by Dr. Jennie Noll and Dr. Robert Ammerman. Dr. Noll has extensive experience as a researcher examining the impact of child maltreatment on adolescent development, particularly around sexual risk behaviors. Dr. Ammerman is a well-established researcher with expertise in prevention and intervention programs for high-risk populations. Her advisory committee includes Dr. Melissa Jonson-Reid, an internationally recognized researcher in child welfare and the use of administrative records, Dr. John Schulenberg, developmental psychologist and authority in adolescent and young adult substance use, Dr. Jessica Kahn, expert in adolescent medicine and sexual and HIV risk behaviors, and Dr. John Pestian, leader in machine learning and its application to clinical care. These individuals have made a commitment to mentor and guide Dr. Beal in research and career development.  The objective of this research program is to fill a gap in our current understanding of which adolescents in foster care are at greatest risk for substance use and HIV while simultaneously providing a means for establishing Dr. Beal's independence as a researcher. There are two aims of this proposal. Aim 1 uses discrete time survival analyses and linked child welfare and EMR data to examine the onset and prevalence of substance use and HIV risk behaviors for youth ages 10-20 in foster care compared to matched Medicaid-eligible youth not in foster care (Foster care n=2836; 1-to-1 matched comparison from ~9585 primary care patients). Findings will provide estimates of the rates of substance use and HIV risk behaviors across ages 10-20 and when they increase/decrease, which is critical for identifying the ideal time to begin prevention and intervention efforts. Aim 2 will draw on causal inference techniques and machine learning to identify youth who are substance using or at substantial risk for developing HIV prior to age 21 based on two categories of risk factors: 1 â those common in adolescence, including parental substance use and mental health diagnoses; and 2 â risk factors unique to foster care, including extended time in foster care and placement instability. Analyses will be conducted using structural equation modeling to identify predictors of substance use and HIV risk behaviors. Machine learning will be used to develop classifiers that distinguish youth likely to use substances and contract HIV. This approach will, for the first time, provide a means to identify youth at risk for these negative health outcomes before youth experience these consequences. Via this approach, clinicians and front-line workers will be able to easily distinguish youth at risk and dedicate more time to prevention efforts. The proposed program of training and research will provide a clear pathway for Dr. Beal to transition as an independent researcher. This unique program of research merges her expertise in developmental science and health during adolescence and the transition to adulthood with research in child maltreatment, substance use, and HIV risk behaviors to support interdisciplinary, innovative team science approaches to prevent poor health outcomes among foster youth. The proposed studies in this application are significant because the findings take a developmental perspective to provide clinically useful information about which youth are at risk for poor health outcomes. Such an approach is innovative and will transform prevention delivery efforts for vulnerable foster youth. PROJECT NARRATIVE (PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE) Teens in foster care are at increased risk for substance abuse and contracting HIV compared to their peers, in addition to experiencing poor education, work, and psychosocial outcomes; leveraging administrative child welfare data linked to electronic medical records data for foster youth affords the opportunity to examine key factors that contribute to risk. The goal if this application is to identify youth at risk for substance abuse and HIV, with an eye toward designing intervention and prevention efforts that front-line workers and providers can enact for foster youth prior to age 18 to increase the likelihood that substance abuse and HIV in adulthood can be prevented. The concepts learned through this grant, as well as the career development pursued by the investigator, will be readily applicable to foster youth in child welfare and healthcare settings and could lead to innovations previously unachieved with this challenging and vulnerable adolescent population.",Using Administrative and Clinical Data to Detect Drug Use and HIV Risk in Foster Care,9424658,K01DA041620,"['21 year old', 'Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adolescent Development', 'Adolescent Medicine', 'Adolescent Risk Behavior', 'Adolescent and Young Adult', 'Adoption', 'Adult', 'Advisory Committees', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Algorithms', 'Bees', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Medicine', 'Caring', 'Categories', 'Child Abuse and Neglect', 'Child Welfare', 'Child health care', 'Chronic', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Psychology', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Contracts', 'County', 'Dangerousness', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Drug usage', 'Education', 'Environment', 'Equation', 'Ethics', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Eye', 'Family', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'HIV', 'HIV Infections', 'HIV risk', 'Health', 'Health behavior', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Investments', 'Journals', 'Justice', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Medicaid', 'Medicaid services', 'Medical center', 'Melissa', 'Mental Health', 'Mental Health Services', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Occupations', 'Ohio', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Pediatric Research', 'Phase', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Pregnancy', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Prevention program', 'Preventive', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Primary Health Care', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Psychologist', 'Publications', 'Race', 'Recording of previous events', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Behaviors', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Schools', 'Science', 'Services', 'Sexually Transmitted Diseases', 'Signal Transduction', 'Solid', 'Substance Addiction', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Survival Analysis', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Teenagers', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Translating', 'Voluntary Programs', 'Work', 'Youth', 'adolescent health', 'authority', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'caregiving', 'clinical care', 'discrete time', 'experience', 'falls', 'foster care', 'health care settings', 'high risk population', 'indicated prevention', 'innovation', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'interest', 'intervention program', 'maltreatment', 'peer', 'prevent', 'programs', 'psychosocial', 'public health relevance', 'reproductive', 'research and development', 'sex risk', 'statistics', 'substance abuse treatment', 'success', 'symposium', 'therapy design', 'volunteer', 'vulnerable adolescent']",NIDA,CINCINNATI CHILDRENS HOSP MED CTR,K01,2018,171483,0.03097573462856159
"ABCD-USA Consortium:Research Project DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Adolescence is a critical neurodevelopmental period that is associated with dramatic increases in rates of substance use. Identifying predictors of substance use and its effects on child and adolescent development is critically important, as substance-related decrements incurred during ongoing maturation could have long- lasting effects on brain functioning and behavioral, health, and psychological outcomes. In response to RFA- DA-15-015, this application proposes the University of Pittsburgh Research Project Site component [12/13] of the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD)-USA consortium to prospectively determine the neurodevelopmental and behavioral effects of substance on children and adolescents. In Pittsburgh, a representative community sample of 550 9-10 year old substance-naÃ¯ve children will be recruited (total ABCD- USA n=11,111 from 11 total sites) and will undergo a baseline assessment and two to three follow-ups over a five year period. At each assessment period, participants will undergo state-of-the-art brain imaging, comprehensive neuropsychological testing, and extensive assessment of substance use patterns and mental health functioning. The brain, behavioral, psychological, social, genetic, and environmental data collected during the course of this project will elucidate: 1) the effects o substance use patterns on the adolescent brain; 2) the effects of substance use on behavioral and health outcomes; 3) the bidirectional relationship between psychopathology and substance use patterns; 4) the effects of individual genetic, behavioral, neurobiological, and environmental differences on risk profiles and substance use outcomes; and 5) the ""gateway interactions"" between use of different substances. Elements Unique to This Site: In addition, ABCD-USA Pittsburgh will provide a unique focus determining how the cognitive dimensions of working memory and inhibitory control and the maturation of corticostriatal systems can inform our understanding of the risks for and effects of early adolescent marijuana use. Working memory and inhibitory control improve during adolescence in parallel with maturation of underlying corticostriatal neurocircuitry. An understanding of these areas of adolescent brain and cognitive development provide critical information in models determining vulnerabilities for and consequences of marijuana and other substance use. In Y03, Pittsburgh will focus on analyses examining working memory and inhibitory control phenotypes and neurodevelopmental characteristics prior to substance use. In Y04-Y05, these neurocognitive characteristics will be examined as risks for early adolescent marijuana use trajectories and, in Y10, accelerated adolescent marijuana use trajectories. Machine Learning will be applied to integrating cognitive and neuroimaging features to characterize a model of risks for early adolescent marijuana use. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The ABCD-USA Consortium will use multimodal brain imaging, cognitive and clinical assessments, bioassays, mobile monitoring, and careful assessment of substance use, environment, psychopathological symptoms, and social functioning in 11,111 adolescents followed over 10 years to determine the effects of substance use on adolescent brain and cognitive development. Our 12/13 ABCD-USA Consortium: Research Project will recruit and assess 550 youth age 9-10 at project entry.

"ABCD-USA Consortium: Research Project DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Adolescence is a critical neurodevelopmental period associated with dramatic increases in rates of substance use. Identifying the pathways to substance use and its effects on child and adolescent development is critically important, as the effects of substance use during ongoing maturation likely have long-lasting effects on brain functioning and behavioral, health, and psychological outcomes. This Research Project Site application from the University of California, San Diego and Laureate Institute for Brain Research is in response to RFA-DA-15-015 as part of the ABCD-USA Consortium (5/13), to prospectively determine the neurodevelopmental and behavioral predictors and consequences of substance use on children and adolescents. A representative community sample of 1086 9-10 year olds enriched for high- risk characteristics will be recruited, contributing to the sample of 11,111 to be collected from 11 hubs across the ABCD- USA Consortium. All participants will undergo a comprehensive baseline assessment, including state-of-the-art brain imaging, comprehensive neuropsychological testing, bioassays, mobile monitoring and careful assessment of substance use, environment, psychopathological symptoms, and social functioning every 2 years. Interim annual interviews and quarterly web-based assessments will provide refined temporal resolution of behaviors, development, and life events with minimal participant burden. These Consortium-wide data obtained during the course of this project will elucidate: 1) the effects of substance use patterns on the adolescent brain; 2) the effects of substance use on behavioral and health outcomes; 3) the bidirectional relationship between psychopathology and substance use patterns; 4) the effects of individual genetic, behavioral, neurobiological, and environmental differences on risk profiles and substance use outcomes; and 5) the ""gateway interactions"" between use of different substances. This hub's Research Project focuses on mechanisms of substance use disorder, special populations with high use prevalence, and the use of drugs other than marijuana. (1) We will determine whether individual differences in neural processing of antireward (i.e., negative reinforcement mechanisms) in amygdala, insula, and anterior cingulate are associated with increased negative emotionality and pain, predict initiation of use and problem use, and are in turn further dysregulated by substance use. (2) We will determine whether protective environment factors and ethnic identification in minority youth are linked to healthier antireward processing and better substance use outcomes. (3) We will determine whether antireward neural processing predicts increased use of illicit drugs other than MJ including misuse of prescription drugs, if such use predicts subsequent exaggerated antireward processing, and if gateway interactions exist between substances. Finally, we will use machine learning approaches to develop a youth-specific risk calculator that will enable us to identify individually- based modifiable risk factor, providing brain-based targets of future novel prevention and intervention approaches.

"ABCD-USA Consortium: Research Project DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Adolescence is a critical neurodevelopmental period associated with dramatic increases in rates of substance use. Identifying the pathways to substance use and its effects on child and adolescent development is critically important, as the effects of substance use during ongoing maturation likely have long-lasting effects on brain functioning and behavioral, health, and psychological outcomes. This Research Project Site application from the University of California, San Diego and Laureate Institute for Brain Research is in response to RFA-DA-15-015 as part of the ABCD-USA Consortium (5/13), to prospectively determine the neurodevelopmental and behavioral predictors and consequences of substance use on children and adolescents. A representative community sample of 1086 9-10 year olds enriched for high- risk characteristics will be recruited, contributing to the sample of 11,111 to be collected from 11 hubs across the ABCD- USA Consortium. All participants will undergo a comprehensive baseline assessment, including state-of-the-art brain imaging, comprehensive neuropsychological testing, bioassays, mobile monitoring and careful assessment of substance use, environment, psychopathological symptoms, and social functioning every 2 years. Interim annual interviews and quarterly web-based assessments will provide refined temporal resolution of behaviors, development, and life events with minimal participant burden. These Consortium-wide data obtained during the course of this project will elucidate: 1) the effects of substance use patterns on the adolescent brain; 2) the effects of substance use on behavioral and health outcomes; 3) the bidirectional relationship between psychopathology and substance use patterns; 4) the effects of individual genetic, behavioral, neurobiological, and environmental differences on risk profiles and substance use outcomes; and 5) the ""gateway interactions"" between use of different substances. This hub's Research Project focuses on mechanisms of substance use disorder, special populations with high use prevalence, and the use of drugs other than marijuana. (1) We will determine whether individual differences in neural processing of antireward (i.e., negative reinforcement mechanisms) in amygdala, insula, and anterior cingulate are associated with increased negative emotionality and pain, predict initiation of use and problem use, and are in turn further dysregulated by substance use. (2) We will determine whether protective environment factors and ethnic identification in minority youth are linked to healthier antireward processing and better substance use outcomes. (3) We will determine whether antireward neural processing predicts increased use of illicit drugs other than MJ including misuse of prescription drugs, if such use predicts subsequent exaggerated antireward processing, and if gateway interactions exist between substances. Finally, we will use machine learning approaches to develop a youth-specific risk calculator that will enable us to identify individually- based modifiable risk factor, providing brain-based targets of future novel prevention and intervention approaches.

"Missing Data Matters: Substance Use Disorder Clinical Trials Program Director/Principal Investigator (Last, First, Middle): Scharfstein, Daniel, Oscar Project Summary/Abstract Missing outcome data threaten the validity of randomized clinical trials because inference about treatment effects then necessarily relies on untestable assumptions, which wrongly stated can lead to incorrect conclusions. While it is widely recognized that evaluating the sensitivity of trial results to assumptions about the missing data mech- anism should be a mandatory component of reporting, rigorous sensitivity analyses are not routinely reported. Likely explanations include inadequate knowledge translation by statistical methodologists to both principal in- vestigators and their statistical collaborators as well as lack of software. Substance use disorder clinical trials are known to suffer from high rates of missing data. Unlike regulatory trials where missing data are primarily the result of premature study withdrawal, individuals in substance use disorder trials tend to intermittently skip their scheduled outcome assessments. This produces an explosion of ânon-monotoneâ missing data patterns that makes sensitivity analysis methodologically and computationally chal- lenging. There has been relatively little research on sensitivity analysis procedures for analyzing such data and the procedures that have been developed are anchored to assumptions that are problematic. Thus, investigators are faced with challenging analytic barriers and the conclusions they draw from their trials may be ï¬awed. In this three-year proposal, we will reanalyze 29 clinical trials conducted by NIDA's Clinical Trials Network (CTN), and made publicly available on NIDA's DataShare website, to evaluate their robustness to missing data assump- tions through rigorous sensitivity analysis. Since adequate tools for conducting sensitivity analysis of studies with highly non-monotone missing data patterns do not yet exist, we plan to develop, implement and dissemi- nate (through journal articles, short courses and webinars) an innovative sensitivity analysis methodology and open-source, user-friendly software to evaluate the robustness, to missing data assumptions, of trials in which binary outcomes (e.g., substance use) are scheduled to be repeatedly collected at ï¬xed points in time after ran- domization and participants intermittently skip their scheduled assessments. Our tool will be developed by an interdisciplinary team of biostatisticians and substance use disorder treatment experts, with input from an advi- sory board comprised of highly regarded statistical experts and leading scientists in the substance use disorder community. Through reanalysis of the NIDA's CTN trials using our tool, we will be better able to understand the impact of missing data assumptions on the evaluation of the studied interventions. Additionally, demonstrat- ing the importance and utility of our tool to our advisory board and to the substance use disorder community more broadly stands to increase the likelihood of adoption. Finally, the development, testing, and dissemination of this innovative statistical tool can serve as a template for other scientiï¬c domains, making âstress-testingâ to untestable missing data assumptions a more routine component of scientiï¬c reporting. Program Director/Principal Investigator (Last, First, Middle): Scharfstein, Daniel, Oscar Project Narrative We will develop, implement and disseminate an innovative sensitivity analysis methodology and open-source, user-friendly software tool to evaluate the robustness to missing data assumptions of clinical trials in which binary outcomes are collected at ï¬xed points over time but where participants intermittently miss their scheduled assess- ments, as frequently occurs in addiction research. We will utilize this tool to reanalyze data from 29 substance abuse clinical trials conducted by NIDA's Clinical Trials Network and available publicly on NIDA's DataShare web- site. As a result, we will be better able to understand the impact of missing data assumptions on the evaluation of the studied interventions and, by demonstrating the importance and utility of our tool to an advisory board comprised of study investigators and to the substance use disorder community more broadly, we aim to make âstress-testingâ to untestable missing data assumptions a more routine part of scientiï¬c reporting.",Missing Data Matters: Substance Use Disorder Clinical Trials,9576900,R01DA046534,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Algorithms', 'Case Study', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Network', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Conduct Clinical Trials', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation Studies', 'Explosion', 'Future', 'Goals', 'HIV', 'HIV risk', 'Health', 'Health system', 'Individual', 'Intervention Studies', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Movement', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Assessment', 'Outcome Measure', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Principal Investigator', 'Procedures', 'Property', 'Publishing', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk Behaviors', 'Schedule', 'Scientist', 'Software Tools', 'Source', 'Stress Tests', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Uncertainty', 'Urine', 'Withdrawal', 'Work', 'addiction', 'base', 'data sharing', 'flexibility', 'innovation', 'interest', 'journal article', 'knowledge translation', 'novel', 'open data', 'open source', 'premature', 'prevent', 'programs', 'secondary analysis', 'simulation', 'software development', 'study characteristics', 'tool', 'treatment effect', 'user friendly software', 'user-friendly', 'web site', 'webinar']",NIDA,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,543369,0.14381931533215023
"ABCD-USA Consortium: Data Analysis Center ï»¿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The ABCD-USA Consortium proposes a study designed to permit the scientific community to answer important questions about the effects of substance use (SU) patterns on behavioral and brain development of adolescents. We have assembled a team of investigators with unparalleled research experience with children and adolescents, and specific expertise in adolescent SU, child and adolescent development, developmental psychopathology, longitudinal multi-site imaging, developmental neuroimaging, developmental cognitive neuroscience, genetics and imaging genetics, bioassays, epidemiology, survey research, bioinformatics, and mobile assessment technologies. We propose a comprehensive, nationwide study to be conducted at 21 sites organized into 11 hubs (over 89 million Americans, 29% of the US population, live within 50 miles of our geographically spread sites), that, uniquely, can provide a nationally representative sample and a large twin sample that together can help distinguish environmental, sociocultural, and genetic factors relevant to SU. We ensure cohesion and standardization by employing a recruitment strategy designed by a professional survey company (experience with Monitoring the Future); standardized environmental, neurocognitive and mental health assessments, MRI assessments with all scanners using harmonized Human Connectome Project procedures, and computerized data collection with real-time quality control. Developmentally tailored assessments will have stable sensitivity and construct validity across the childhood and adolescent developmental period. They minimize participant burden, yet capture even subtle changes over time in substance use, mental health, neurocognition, development, and environment, and we employ novel state-of-the-art bioassays and passive data collection from mobile devices. A detailed retention plan builds on the experience and success of our investigators. This application describes the ABCD-USA Data Analysis and Informatics Center (DAIC), which will: establish a harmonized MRI acquisition protocol, compatible with all major scanner platforms, taking advantage of recent technological advances in structural and functional MRI; establish rigorous quality control and quantitative calibration procedures to ensure accuracy and comparability of derived imaging measures across scanners and across time; implement advanced computational analysis workflows for all imaging data; implement reliable data entry, quality control, and monitoring tools for the substance use questionnaire, neurocognitive assessments, bioassay-derived measures, and mobile technologies assessment data; implement the state- of-the-art statistical analysis tools and procedures needed to integrate information across measures and modalities; and implement infrastructure and procedures for public sharing of raw- and derived data and associated tools and computational workflows, and enable interactive data exploration and analytics through a web-based Portal.

"eDarkTrends: monitoring cryptomarkets to identify emerging trends of illicit synthetic opioids use PROJECT SUMMARY Over the past few years, there has been a significant increase in the number of seizures and unintentional overdose fatalities related to illicit synthetic opioids in multiple states across the U.S. Submitted in response to NIDA PAR-16-055, Research Area 1 (Responses to sudden and severe emerging drug issues), this time-sensitive R21 application builds on interdisciplinary collaboration between researchers at the Center for Interventions, Treatment and Additions Research (CITAR) and the Ohio Center of Excellence in Knowledge-enabled Computing (Kno.e.sis) at Wright State University. The overall purposes of the proposed study are to (a) characterize illicit synthetic opioid marketing characteristics and trends, and (b) identify new, emerging illicit synthetic opioid terms (e.g., substance names, product forms) from three ""cryptomarkets"" located in the Deep Web. The Specific Aims of the study are to: 1) Develop a semi-automated knowledge-based system, eDarkTrends, to collect and process data about illicit synthetic opioids supplied on cryptomarkets; 2a) Describe and monitor US-based supply trends of illicit synthetic opioids on cryptomarkets (e.g., trends in availability of non-pharmaceutical fentanyl analogs, U-47700, MT-45), including types of illicit synthetic opioids, prices, advertised purity, dosage and product forms, quantity supplied, and drug combinations; 2b) Identify new illicit synthetic opioid substances and product forms soon after they appear on cryptomarkets. The proposed study is significant because it will provide new information about illicit synthetic opioids and will identify new illicit synthetic opioids as soon as they appear on those markets. The key innovation is the development of a semi-automated system able to a) collect and analyze advertisement data from cryptomarkets and b) identify new emerging substances advertised on these markets. PROJECT NARRATIVE  The study will collect and analyze data extracted from Deep Web cryptomarkets to characterize illicit synthetic opioid marketing characteristics and trends in the U.S, and will identify new, emerging illicit synthetic opioid-related terms (e.g., substance names, product forms) as soon as they appear on these markets. It will be the first system to apply semi-automated computational techniques to monitor the supply of illicit synthetic opioids on cryptomarkets. The findings will inform public health interventions and policy responses.",eDarkTrends: monitoring cryptomarkets to identify emerging trends of illicit synthetic opioids use,9487238,R21DA044518,"['Address', 'Advertisements', 'Area', 'Award', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical Laboratory Information Systems', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Computational Technique', 'Country', 'Data', 'Development', 'Drug Addiction', 'Drug Combinations', 'Ensure', 'Epidemiologic Monitoring', 'Epidemiology', 'European', 'Fentanyl', 'Forensic Medicine', 'Goals', 'Government Agencies', 'Grant', 'Health Professional', 'Illicit Drugs', 'Infodemiology', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Law Enforcement', 'Liquid substance', 'Marketing', 'Measures', 'Monitor', 'Names', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nose', 'Ohio', 'Ontology', 'Opioid', 'Overdose', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Policies', 'Powder dose form', 'Prevention', 'Price', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Security', 'Seizures', 'Semantics', 'Sentinel', 'Side', 'Source', 'Surface', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Time trend', 'Transact', 'U-47700', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Vendor', 'addiction', 'analog', 'base', 'carfentanil', 'design', 'dosage', 'drug market', 'drug testing', 'encryption', 'innovation', 'interdisciplinary collaboration', 'knowledge base', 'lexical', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'opioid use', 'overdose death', 'public health intervention', 'response', 'social media', 'tool', 'trend']",NIDA,WRIGHT STATE UNIVERSITY,R21,2018,184658,0.05565978530952324
"Implementation of Technology-Based Evaluation of Motivational Interviewing ï»¿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Millions of Americans are receiving behavioral interventions for problematic alcohol use. In 2010, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) documented over 1.8 million treatment episodes for drug and alcohol problems, many involving group or individual psychotherapy. The tremendous service-delivery need has focused research on optimal training methods, to promote the dissemination of evidence-based interventions. A recent meta-analysis of motivational interviewing (MI) shows that ""post-training supports"" - such as performance-based feedback or coaching - are critical for maintaining counselor skills following training. However, the practical implementation of performance-based feedback for alcohol use disorders (AUDs) and problematic drinking is currently prohibitive in effort, time, and money. There is a critical need or technology to ""scale up"" performance-based feedback to counselors for AUDs and problematic drinking.  This competitive renewal builds on interdisciplinary research focused on automating the evaluation of MI fidelity for alcohol and substance use problems. This collaborative research brings together speech signal processing experts from electrical engineering and statistical text-mining and natural language processing experts from computer science with MI expert trainers and researchers. Our previous research laid a computational foundation for generating MI fidelity codes from semantic and vocal features, and the current proposal moves this work into direct clinical application. In collaboration with the University of Utah Counseling Center (UCC), we will develop and implement a clinical software support tool, the Counselor Observer Ratings Expert for MI (CORE-MI). The CORE-MI system will provide performance-based feedback focused on MI fidelity codes for training, supervision, and quality assurance for counselors treating clients struggling with alcohol and substance use problems.  The research will use a hybrid implementation-effectiveness design to pursue the following three aims: 1) Implement and calibrate the CORE-MI system at the UCC clinic to provide automated, performance-based feedback on MI; 2) Compare counselor fidelity to MI and client alcohol and substance use outcomes, before and after initiation of the CORE-MI system (approximately, N = 2,400 sessions); and 3) Using machine learning tools, computationally explore mechanisms of MI using semantic and vocal data, MI fidelity codes, and client outcomes from approximately 3,000 sessions. The successful execution of this project will break the reliance on human judgment for providing performance-based feedback to MI and will massively expand the capacity to train, supervise, and provide quality assurance. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    Performance-based feedback is an effective method for training and supervising counseling approaches for alcohol-related problems. However, current feedback methods rely on human raters and are not feasible in the real-world due to time and cost. The current study will implement a clinical support software tool that uses speech signal processing and computational models - instead of human judgment - to evaluate motivational interviewing for alcohol and substance use problems.",Implementation of Technology-Based Evaluation of Motivational Interviewing,9334680,R01AA018673,"['Acoustics', 'Addictive Behavior', 'Alcohol abuse', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Alcohols', 'American', 'Arousal', 'Assessment tool', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Calibration', 'Cause of Death', 'Client', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical effectiveness', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Counseling', 'Data', 'Development', 'Educational workshop', 'Effectiveness', 'Electrical Engineering', 'Empathy', 'Evaluation', 'Evidence based intervention', 'Feedback', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Group Psychotherapy', 'Homicide', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Individual', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention Studies', 'Judgment', 'Learning', 'Learning Skill', 'Life', 'Linguistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental Health', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Patient Outcomes Assessments', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Population', 'Process', 'Professional counselor', 'Psychologist', 'Psychotherapy', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Semantics', 'Services', 'Software Tools', 'Speech', 'Standardization', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Suicide', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Support', 'United States Department of Veterans Affairs', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'United States Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration', 'Universities', 'Utah', 'Vision', 'Work', 'addiction', 'alcohol abuse therapy', 'alcohol intervention', 'alcohol related problem', 'alcohol use disorder', 'base', 'clinical application', 'computer science', 'cost', 'design', 'drinking', 'high risk drinking', 'improved', 'motivational enhancement therapy', 'public health relevance', 'quality assurance', 'scale up', 'signal processing', 'skills', 'support tools', 'technological innovation', 'technology validation', 'text searching', 'tool', 'vehicular accident', 'visual feedback', 'young adult']",NIAAA,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2017,644254,0.03252114040369104
"Classifying addictions using machine learning analysis of multidimensional data ABSTRACT This Independent Scientist Award will significantly enhance my research capabilities, enabling me to become a leading quantitative investigator in the field of substance use disorders (SUDs). Specifically, it will allow me to increase my knowledge in the areas of SUD phenotypes, treatment and genetics. SUDs are clinically and etiologically heterogeneous and their classification has been difficult. This application reflects my ongoing commitment to developing an innovative and interdisciplinary research program on the classification of SUDs through quantitative analysis of multidimensional data. My extensive training in computational science and prior research on biomedical informatics have provided me with the skills to design, implement and evaluate advanced algorithms and sophisticated analyses to solve challenging problems in classifying SUDs. My ongoing NIDA-funded R01 employs a large (n=~12,000) sample aggregated from multiple genetic studies of cocaine, opioid, and alcohol dependence to develop and evaluate novel statistical models to generate clinical SUD subtypes that are optimized for gene finding. This K02 proposal extends that work to evaluate treatment outcome in refined subgroups of SUD populations using data from treatment studies for cocaine, opioid, alcohol and multiple substance dependence. This project will integrate data from diagnostic behavioral variables and genotypes, as well as biological/neurobiological features of the disorders and repeated measures of treatment outcome. The primary career development goals of this application are to: (1) understand the reliability, validity and functional mechanisms of various phenotyping methods; (2) to continue training in the genetics of addictions; and (3) to gain greater knowledge of different treatment approaches and their efficacy. A solid foundation in these areas will enhance my ability to realize the full potential of the data collected and aggregated from multiple dimensions, and to use the data to design the most clinically useful analysis and generate innovative solutions to diagnostic and predictive challenges in SUD research. Through formal coursework, directed readings, individual tutoring and intensive multidisciplinary collaboration with a diverse team of world-renowned researchers, I will receive training and collect pilot data for future R01 projects by examining (Aim I): whether clinically-defined highly heritable subtypes derived in my current R01 project predict differential treatment response; (Aim II) whether new statistical models that directly combine treatment data with behavioral, biological, and genomic data identify refined subtypes with confirmatory multilevel evidence; and (Aim III) whether there are genetic and social moderators of treatment outcome by subtype. The overall goal of this proposal is to further my independent and multidisciplinary research program in the development of statistical methods for refined classification of SUDs. The K02 award will provide me with the protected time necessary to fully engage in the training activities described that will enhance my knowledge and skills to enable me to make important, novel contributions to the genetics and treatment of SUD. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project will develop novel statistical and quantitative tools to identify homogeneous subtypes of substance use disorders (SUDs) and other complex diseases to enhance gene finding and treatment matching. The proposed project will perform secondary analyses of existing data from treatment studies of cocaine, opioid, alcohol, and mixed SUDs. The proposed novel approaches are expected to advance precision medicine approaches to SUDs by enabling treatment matching and a more refined SUD classification to gene finding.",Classifying addictions using machine learning analysis of multidimensional data,9224405,K02DA043063,"['Adherence', 'Aftercare', 'Alcohol dependence', 'Alcohols', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biosensor', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Cocaine', 'Cocaine Dependence', 'Collaborations', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Complex', 'Computational Science', 'DSM-IV', 'DSM-V', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Drug Use Disorder', 'Electroencephalography', 'Etiology', 'Foundations', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Markers', 'Genetic study', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Heritability', 'Heterogeneity', 'Independent Scientist Award', 'Individual', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Investigation', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'Neurobiology', 'Opiate Addiction', 'Opioid', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmacogenetics', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Reading', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Solid', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Subgroup', 'Substance Addiction', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Treatment outcome', 'Work', 'addiction', 'alcohol use disorder', 'biomedical informatics', 'career development', 'cocaine use', 'contingency management', 'design', 'disease classification', 'disorder subtype', 'endophenotype', 'genetic association', 'genomic data', 'imaging genetics', 'improved', 'innovation', 'neural correlate', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'opioid use disorder', 'outcome prediction', 'personalized medicine', 'precision medicine', 'programs', 'secondary analysis', 'skills', 'social', 'tool', 'treatment planning', 'treatment response', 'tutoring']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF CONNECTICUT STORRS,K02,2017,163452,0.07416387016693718
"Predicting Stimulant Use Relapse using Neuroimaging Techniques Project Summary / Abstract  Neuroimaging methodologies, including electroencephalography (EEG), event-related potentials (ERPs), and both structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging (s/fMRI) have emerged as significant predictors of substance use relapse. These neuroimaging techniques have helped provide an objective, sensitive, and predictive measure of substance use relapse propensity. As the capabilities of biological science advance, a lingering impediment to progress is the study of individual brain regions implicated in predicting substance use relapse. Important to note, individual brain regions rarely work independently; rather, such regions often work in concert, as specific networks, continually sending and receiving information to other regions, to help facilitate learning, memory, and other cognitive processes. The investigation of ICA-derived functional network connectivity between brain regions may lend incremental utility for classifying, diagnosing, and predicting substance use relapse.  Here, using the worldâs largest forensic database, which includes clinical and neuropsychological measures, electrophysiological measures, functional neuroimaging, and functional network connectivity measures, the primary goal of this project will be to delineate specific risk factors predictive of eventual stimulant use relapse propensity. This will be accomplished by integrating models incorporating logistic and Cox proportional-hazard regressions, and cross-validation machine learning pattern classifiers to predict stimulant use relapse one year after institutional release with an at-risk sample of adult incarcerated offenders.  First, we will examine the potential of various clinical and neuropsychological assessment measures in predicting stimulant use relapse. Second, we will investigate the predictive utility of error-monitoring neural measures using traditional ERPs and fMRI in predicting stimulant use relapse. Third, we will apply more agnostic, data-driven methods, including ICA-derived functional network connectivity analyses of fMRI data to measure functional connectivity between brain regions involved in error-processing to predict stimulant use relapse. Ultimately, this research will lend incremental utility in the successful prediction of stimulant use relapse, providing a more sensitive and predictive measure compared to previous investigations. The ultimate goal of the proposed training fellowship is to help provide a more biologically informed taxonomy of neurocognitive deficits associated with those prone to stimulant use relapse. Project Narrative  Prevalence estimates indicate that roughly half of incarcerated offenders meet criteria for previous history of substance use disorders (SUDs) (Center for Behavioral Health Statistics and Quality, 2015), with a majority (66.7%) relapsing within three years of institutional release (Langan & Levin, 2002). Identifying specific risk factors, including neurocognitive measures involved in predicting stimulant use relapse following release from custody could lead to important insights into this high-risk sample. The research proposed here will examine brain anatomy, function and connectivity, and psychological traits using the world's largest multi- modal database of its kind from an incarcerated sample to directly aid the development of more contemporary, scientifically-validated taxonomy of the pathophysiology related to neurocognitive deficits associated with stimulant use relapse propensity.",Predicting Stimulant Use Relapse using Neuroimaging Techniques,9394654,F31DA043328,"['Adult', 'Age-Years', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Anatomy', 'Anterior', 'Anxiety', 'Attention', 'Basal Ganglia', 'Biological', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Biological Sciences', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Clinical', 'Clinical assessments', 'Cognitive', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dorsal', 'Education', 'Electroencephalography', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Event-Related Potentials', 'Fellowship', 'Forensic Medicine', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Image Analysis', 'Imprisonment', 'Impulsivity', 'Individual', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Logistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurocognitive Deficit', 'Neuropsychology', 'New Mexico', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Populations at Risk', 'Predictive Factor', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Prevalence', 'Recording of previous events', 'Regression Analysis', 'Relapse', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Taxonomy', 'Techniques', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Work', 'behavioral health', 'cingulate cortex', 'cognitive process', 'court', 'depressive symptoms', 'experience', 'hazard', 'hemodynamics', 'high risk', 'imaging study', 'independent component analysis', 'insight', 'instrument', 'neuroimaging', 'offender', 'psychologic', 'psychopathic personality', 'relapse prediction', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'statistics', 'symptomatology', 'trait']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF NEW MEXICO,F31,2017,31856,0.04917604484763801
"Using Administrative and Clinical Data to Detect Drug Use and HIV Risk in Foster Care USING ADMINISTRATIVE AND CLINICAL DATA TO DETECT DRUG USE AND HIV RISK IN FOSTER CARE Project Summary  The candidate's goal is to develop an independent research career as a developmental psychologist focused on identifying mechanisms to prevent the onset of pervasive and detrimental health risk behaviors, including substance abuse and HIV risk behaviors, among adolescents and young adults involved in foster care. She has experience in examining psychosocial and behavioral processes during this period of development and a strong publication record for the current phase in her career. Her previous training has emphasized development during adolescence and the transition to adulthood and health behaviors during this timeframe. In the K01, she proposes to expand her training to become an expert leader in team science approaches to address substance use and HIV risk behaviors during adolescence and the transition to adulthood, specifically focusing on foster youth, using child welfare administrative data and electronic medical records (EMR). Her training will emphasize: 1) development as an independent researcher and leader in interdisciplinary approaches to addressing health and development among foster youth, 2) substantive training in child maltreatment, substance use, and HIV risk behaviors, and 3) the use of machine learning to distinguish youth at risk, with the end goal of identifying opportunities for prevention. This will be accomplished through seminars and journal clubs offered at Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center (CCHMC), attending regional and national conferences and trainings on substantive topics, and completion of coursework in child maltreatment and machine learning. Finally, she will complete coursework and seminars addressing the ethical conduct of research. Dr. Beal's goal is to submit an R01, as PI, during the third year of this grant.  CCHMC, one of the top three pediatric research hospitals in the nation, is committed to Dr. Beal's career development. The research environment at CCHMC and within the Division of Behavioral Medicine and Clinical Psychology, and the mentors and collaborators identified in this proposal, are well-suited to Dr. Beal's interests and research goals. Dr. Beal will be co-mentored by Dr. Jennie Noll and Dr. Robert Ammerman. Dr. Noll has extensive experience as a researcher examining the impact of child maltreatment on adolescent development, particularly around sexual risk behaviors. Dr. Ammerman is a well-established researcher with expertise in prevention and intervention programs for high-risk populations. Her advisory committee includes Dr. Melissa Jonson-Reid, an internationally recognized researcher in child welfare and the use of administrative records, Dr. John Schulenberg, developmental psychologist and authority in adolescent and young adult substance use, Dr. Jessica Kahn, expert in adolescent medicine and sexual and HIV risk behaviors, and Dr. John Pestian, leader in machine learning and its application to clinical care. These individuals have made a commitment to mentor and guide Dr. Beal in research and career development.  The objective of this research program is to fill a gap in our current understanding of which adolescents in foster care are at greatest risk for substance use and HIV while simultaneously providing a means for establishing Dr. Beal's independence as a researcher. There are two aims of this proposal. Aim 1 uses discrete time survival analyses and linked child welfare and EMR data to examine the onset and prevalence of substance use and HIV risk behaviors for youth ages 10-20 in foster care compared to matched Medicaid-eligible youth not in foster care (Foster care n=2836; 1-to-1 matched comparison from ~9585 primary care patients). Findings will provide estimates of the rates of substance use and HIV risk behaviors across ages 10-20 and when they increase/decrease, which is critical for identifying the ideal time to begin prevention and intervention efforts. Aim 2 will draw on causal inference techniques and machine learning to identify youth who are substance using or at substantial risk for developing HIV prior to age 21 based on two categories of risk factors: 1 â those common in adolescence, including parental substance use and mental health diagnoses; and 2 â risk factors unique to foster care, including extended time in foster care and placement instability. Analyses will be conducted using structural equation modeling to identify predictors of substance use and HIV risk behaviors. Machine learning will be used to develop classifiers that distinguish youth likely to use substances and contract HIV. This approach will, for the first time, provide a means to identify youth at risk for these negative health outcomes before youth experience these consequences. Via this approach, clinicians and front-line workers will be able to easily distinguish youth at risk and dedicate more time to prevention efforts. The proposed program of training and research will provide a clear pathway for Dr. Beal to transition as an independent researcher. This unique program of research merges her expertise in developmental science and health during adolescence and the transition to adulthood with research in child maltreatment, substance use, and HIV risk behaviors to support interdisciplinary, innovative team science approaches to prevent poor health outcomes among foster youth. The proposed studies in this application are significant because the findings take a developmental perspective to provide clinically useful information about which youth are at risk for poor health outcomes. Such an approach is innovative and will transform prevention delivery efforts for vulnerable foster youth. PROJECT NARRATIVE (PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE) Teens in foster care are at increased risk for substance abuse and contracting HIV compared to their peers, in addition to experiencing poor education, work, and psychosocial outcomes; leveraging administrative child welfare data linked to electronic medical records data for foster youth affords the opportunity to examine key factors that contribute to risk. The goal if this application is to identify youth at risk for substance abuse and HIV, with an eye toward designing intervention and prevention efforts that front-line workers and providers can enact for foster youth prior to age 18 to increase the likelihood that substance abuse and HIV in adulthood can be prevented. The concepts learned through this grant, as well as the career development pursued by the investigator, will be readily applicable to foster youth in child welfare and healthcare settings and could lead to innovations previously unachieved with this challenging and vulnerable adolescent population.",Using Administrative and Clinical Data to Detect Drug Use and HIV Risk in Foster Care,9235662,K01DA041620,"['21 year old', 'Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adolescent Development', 'Adolescent Medicine', 'Adolescent Risk Behavior', 'Adolescent and Young Adult', 'Adoption', 'Adult', 'Advisory Committees', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Algorithms', 'Bees', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Medicine', 'Caring', 'Categories', 'Child Abuse and Neglect', 'Child Welfare', 'Chronic', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Psychology', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Contracts', 'County', 'Dangerousness', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Drug usage', 'Education', 'Eligibility Determination', 'Environment', 'Equation', 'Ethics', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Eye', 'Family', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'HIV', 'HIV Infections', 'HIV risk', 'Health', 'Health behavior', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Investments', 'Journals', 'Justice', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Medicaid', 'Medical center', 'Melissa', 'Mental Health', 'Mental Health Services', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Occupations', 'Ohio', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Pediatric Research', 'Phase', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Pregnancy', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Prevention program', 'Preventive', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Primary Health Care', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Psychologist', 'Publications', 'Race', 'Recording of previous events', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Behaviors', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Schools', 'Science', 'Services', 'Sexually Transmitted Diseases', 'Signal Transduction', 'Solid', 'Substance Addiction', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Survival Analysis', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Teenagers', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Translating', 'Voluntary Programs', 'Work', 'Youth', 'adolescent health', 'authority', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'caregiving', 'clinical care', 'discrete time', 'experience', 'falls', 'foster care', 'high risk population', 'indicated prevention', 'innovation', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'interest', 'intervention program', 'maltreatment', 'peer', 'prevent', 'programs', 'psychosocial', 'public health relevance', 'reproductive', 'research and development', 'sex risk', 'statistics', 'substance abuse treatment', 'success', 'symposium', 'therapy design', 'volunteer', 'vulnerable adolescent']",NIDA,CINCINNATI CHILDRENS HOSP MED CTR,K01,2017,173475,0.03097573462856159
"ABCD-USA Consortium:Research Project ï»¿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Adolescence is a critical neurodevelopmental period that is associated with dramatic increases in rates of substance use. Identifying predictors of substance use and its effects on child and adolescent development is critically important, as substance-related decrements incurred during ongoing maturation could have long- lasting effects on brain functioning and behavioral, health, and psychological outcomes. In response to RFA- DA-15-015, this application proposes the University of Pittsburgh Research Project Site component [12/13] of the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD)-USA consortium to prospectively determine the neurodevelopmental and behavioral effects of substance on children and adolescents. In Pittsburgh, a representative community sample of 550 9-10 year old substance-naÃ¯ve children will be recruited (total ABCD- USA n=11,111 from 11 total sites) and will undergo a baseline assessment and two to three follow-ups over a five year period. At each assessment period, participants will undergo state-of-the-art brain imaging, comprehensive neuropsychological testing, and extensive assessment of substance use patterns and mental health functioning. The brain, behavioral, psychological, social, genetic, and environmental data collected during the course of this project will elucidate: 1) the effects o substance use patterns on the adolescent brain; 2) the effects of substance use on behavioral and health outcomes; 3) the bidirectional relationship between psychopathology and substance use patterns; 4) the effects of individual genetic, behavioral, neurobiological, and environmental differences on risk profiles and substance use outcomes; and 5) the ""gateway interactions"" between use of different substances. Elements Unique to This Site: In addition, ABCD-USA Pittsburgh will provide a unique focus determining how the cognitive dimensions of working memory and inhibitory control and the maturation of corticostriatal systems can inform our understanding of the risks for and effects of early adolescent marijuana use. Working memory and inhibitory control improve during adolescence in parallel with maturation of underlying corticostriatal neurocircuitry. An understanding of these areas of adolescent brain and cognitive development provide critical information in models determining vulnerabilities for and consequences of marijuana and other substance use. In Y03, Pittsburgh will focus on analyses examining working memory and inhibitory control phenotypes and neurodevelopmental characteristics prior to substance use. In Y04-Y05, these neurocognitive characteristics will be examined as risks for early adolescent marijuana use trajectories and, in Y10, accelerated adolescent marijuana use trajectories. Machine Learning will be applied to integrating cognitive and neuroimaging features to characterize a model of risks for early adolescent marijuana use. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The ABCD-USA Consortium will use multimodal brain imaging, cognitive and clinical assessments, bioassays, mobile monitoring, and careful assessment of substance use, environment, psychopathological symptoms, and social functioning in 11,111 adolescents followed over 10 years to determine the effects of substance use on adolescent brain and cognitive development. Our 12/13 ABCD-USA Consortium: Research Project will recruit and assess 550 youth age 9-10 at project entry.

"SNS-based Data Mining to Understand MSM Substance use and HIV Risk Behavior ï»¿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): HIV incidence among gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men (hereafter MSM) continues to rise, driven in part by substance use. MSM are increasingly using social networking sites (SNS) to find substance use and sexual partners. However, no studies currently exist that use automated, real-time data collection and analysis procedures to monitor substance use and sexual partner seeking across the range of SNS platforms used by MSM to inform intervention development. This project will build on Routine Activities Theory to conduct research using SNS interactions to aid in understanding patterns of substance use and HIV risk behavior among MSM. During Phase 1, focus groups of MSM (n=~8/focus group; N=24) will be used to develop a lexicon for identifying substance use and sexual partner seeking among MSM via diverse SNS platforms. These findings will guide the development of a culturally congruent data collection and mining module (DCMM; internet software that systematically searches SNS to gather data in an analyzable format) with iterative feedback from a community advisory board (CAB) and pilot testing by MSM (n=6). During Phase 2, the DCMM will gather data from 50 MSM on SNS use (e.g., frequency, intensity) substance use and HIV risk/protective behaviors (e.g., content of profiles, postings). Risk behaviors will be assessed weekly via self- report and validated with biomarkers of risk behaviors to be collected at the end of the study period using a rapid oral HIV test and drug test via nail sample. This research will result in a subsequent R34 application to develop and test a just-in-time adaptive intervention (JTAI) using machine learning technology. The specific aims of the proposed research are to: (1) Develop and assess the utility of a culturally congruent DCMM to study the SNS use patterns, substance use and HIV risk and protective behaviors of MSM; (2) Determine associations between patterns of technology use, substance use and HIV risk behaviors among a sample of 50 MSM using a culturally congruent DCMM, self-report data collection and biomarkers for substance use and HIV; and (3) Evaluate the feasibility and the computational requirements of a just-in-time adaptive intervention to reduce substance use and HIV risk behavior among MSM. By devising and testing a culturally congruent DCMM to capture SNS data on MSM substance use and sexual partner seeking this study lays the building blocks to developing technology-based substance use and HIV prevention and treatment efforts tailored specifically for MSM. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men (hereafter MSM) use social networking sites (SNS) to locate substance use and sexual partners, which can increase their risk for HIV acquisition and transmission. This study will devise and test a culturally congruent data collection and mining module (DCMM) to capture large quantities of SNS data on MSM substance use and sexual partner seeking. This formative research has high public health significance as it can clarify the SNS partner seeking dynamics driving MSM's substance use and sexual risk behaviors to inform culturally congruent technology-based substance use and HIV prevention and treatment efforts tailored specifically for MSM.",SNS-based Data Mining to Understand MSM Substance use and HIV Risk Behavior,9303328,R03DA039752,"['AIDS prevention', 'Address', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Alcohols', 'Automobile Driving', 'Behavior', 'Biological Markers', 'Bisexual', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Drug usage', 'Feedback', 'Focus Groups', 'Frequencies', 'Gays', 'General Population', 'HIV', 'HIV Infections', 'HIV risk', 'Human immunodeficiency virus test', 'Incidence', 'Informed Consent', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Language', 'Law Enforcement', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'NIH Office of AIDS Research', 'Nail plate', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Procedures', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Qualitative Research', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Behaviors', 'Sampling', 'Sexual Partners', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'base', 'cost', 'data mining', 'digital', 'drug testing', 'high risk population', 'individualized medicine', 'innovation', 'men', 'men who have sex with men', 'oral HIV', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'protective behavior', 'public health relevance', 'reduced substance use', 'sex risk', 'sexual risk taking', 'social media', 'social networking website', 'theories', 'therapy development', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'web site']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R03,2017,154000,0.08582302549218837
"ABCD-USA Consortium: Research Project ï»¿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Adolescence is a critical neurodevelopmental period associated with dramatic increases in rates of substance use. Identifying the pathways to substance use and its effects on child and adolescent development is critically important, as the effects of substance use during ongoing maturation likely have long-lasting effects on brain functioning and behavioral, health, and psychological outcomes. This Research Project Site application from the University of California, San Diego and Laureate Institute for Brain Research is in response to RFA-DA-15-015 as part of the ABCD-USA Consortium (5/13), to prospectively determine the neurodevelopmental and behavioral predictors and consequences of substance use on children and adolescents. A representative community sample of 1086 9-10 year olds enriched for high- risk characteristics will be recruited, contributing to the sample f 11,111 to be collected from 11 hubs across the ABCD- USA Consortium. All participants will undergo a comprehensive baseline assessment, including state-of-the-art brain imaging, comprehensive neuropsychological testing, bioassays, mobile monitoring and careful assessment of substance use, environment, psychopathological symptoms, and social functioning every 2 years. Interim annual interviews and quarterly web-based assessments will provide refined temporal resolution of behaviors, development, and life events with minimal participant burden. These Consortium-wide data obtained during the course of this project will elucidate: 1) the effects of substance use patterns on the adolescent brain; 2) the effects of substance use on behavioral and health outcomes; 3) the bidirectional relationship between psychopathology and substance use patterns; 4) the effects of individual genetic, behavioral, neurobiological, and environmental differences on risk profiles and substance use outcomes; and 5) the ""gateway interactions"" between use of different substances. This hub's Research Project focuses on mechanisms of substance use disorder, special populations with high use prevalence, and the use of drugs other than marijuana. (1) We will determine whether individual differences in neural processing of antireward (i.e., negative reinforcement mechanisms) in amygdala, insula, and anterior cingulate are associated with increased negative emotionality and pain, predict initiation of use and problem use, and are in turn further dysregulated by substance use. (2) We will determine whether protective environment factors and ethnic identification in minority youth are linked to healthier antireward processing and better substance use outcomes. (3) We will determine whether antireward neural processing predicts increased use of illicit drugs other than MJ including misuse of prescription drugs, if such use predicts subsequent exaggerated antireward processing, and if gateway interactions exist between substances. Finally, we will use machine learning approaches to develop a youth-specific risk calculator that will enable us to identify individually- based modifiable risk factor, providing brain-based targets of future novel prevention and intervention approaches.

"ABCD-USA Consortium: Data Analysis Center ï»¿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The ABCD-USA Consortium proposes a study designed to permit the scientific community to answer important questions about the effects of substance use (SU) patterns on behavioral and brain development of adolescents. We have assembled a team of investigators with unparalleled research experience with children and adolescents, and specific expertise in adolescent SU, child and adolescent development, developmental psychopathology, longitudinal multi-site imaging, developmental neuroimaging, developmental cognitive neuroscience, genetics and imaging genetics, bioassays, epidemiology, survey research, bioinformatics, and mobile assessment technologies. We propose a comprehensive, nationwide study to be conducted at 21 sites organized into 11 hubs (over 89 million Americans, 29% of the US population, live within 50 miles of our geographically spread sites), that, uniquely, can provide a nationally representative sample and a large twin sample that together can help distinguish environmental, sociocultural, and genetic factors relevant to SU. We ensure cohesion and standardization by employing a recruitment strategy designed by a professional survey company (experience with Monitoring the Future); standardized environmental, neurocognitive and mental health assessments, MRI assessments with all scanners using harmonized Human Connectome Project procedures, and computerized data collection with real-time quality control. Developmentally tailored assessments will have stable sensitivity and construct validity across the childhood and adolescent developmental period. They minimize participant burden, yet capture even subtle changes over time in substance use, mental health, neurocognition, development, and environment, and we employ novel state-of-the-art bioassays and passive data collection from mobile devices. A detailed retention plan builds on the experience and success of our investigators. This application describes the ABCD-USA Data Analysis and Informatics Center (DAIC), which will: establish a harmonized MRI acquisition protocol, compatible with all major scanner platforms, taking advantage of recent technological advances in structural and functional MRI; establish rigorous quality control and quantitative calibration procedures to ensure accuracy and comparability of derived imaging measures across scanners and across time; implement advanced computational analysis workflows for all imaging data; implement reliable data entry, quality control, and monitoring tools for the substance use questionnaire, neurocognitive assessments, bioassay-derived measures, and mobile technologies assessment data; implement the state- of-the-art statistical analysis tools and procedures needed to integrate information across measures and modalities; and implement infrastructure and procedures for public sharing of raw- and derived data and associated tools and computational workflows, and enable interactive data exploration and analytics through a web-based Portal.

"eDarkTrends: monitoring cryptomarkets to identify emerging trends of illicit synthetic opioids use PROJECT SUMMARY Over the past few years, there has been a significant increase in the number of seizures and unintentional overdose fatalities related to illicit synthetic opioids in multiple states across the U.S. Submitted in response to NIDA PAR-16-055, Research Area 1 (Responses to sudden and severe emerging drug issues), this time-sensitive R21 application builds on interdisciplinary collaboration between researchers at the Center for Interventions, Treatment and Additions Research (CITAR) and the Ohio Center of Excellence in Knowledge-enabled Computing (Kno.e.sis) at Wright State University. The overall purposes of the proposed study are to (a) characterize illicit synthetic opioid marketing characteristics and trends, and (b) identify new, emerging illicit synthetic opioid terms (e.g., substance names, product forms) from three ""cryptomarkets"" located in the Deep Web. The Specific Aims of the study are to: 1) Develop a semi-automated knowledge-based system, eDarkTrends, to collect and process data about illicit synthetic opioids supplied on cryptomarkets; 2a) Describe and monitor US-based supply trends of illicit synthetic opioids on cryptomarkets (e.g., trends in availability of non-pharmaceutical fentanyl analogs, U-47700, MT-45), including types of illicit synthetic opioids, prices, advertised purity, dosage and product forms, quantity supplied, and drug combinations; 2b) Identify new illicit synthetic opioid substances and product forms soon after they appear on cryptomarkets. The proposed study is significant because it will provide new information about illicit synthetic opioids and will identify new illicit synthetic opioids as soon as they appear on those markets. The key innovation is the development of a semi-automated system able to a) collect and analyze advertisement data from cryptomarkets and b) identify new emerging substances advertised on these markets. PROJECT NARRATIVE  The study will collect and analyze data extracted from Deep Web cryptomarkets to characterize illicit synthetic opioid marketing characteristics and trends in the U.S, and will identify new, emerging illicit synthetic opioid-related terms (e.g., substance names, product forms) as soon as they appear on these markets. It will be the first system to apply semi-automated computational techniques to monitor the supply of illicit synthetic opioids on cryptomarkets. The findings will inform public health interventions and policy responses.",eDarkTrends: monitoring cryptomarkets to identify emerging trends of illicit synthetic opioids use,9384827,R21DA044518,"['Address', 'Advertisements', 'Area', 'Award', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical Laboratory Information Systems', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Computational Technique', 'Country', 'Data', 'Development', 'Drug Addiction', 'Drug Combinations', 'Ensure', 'Epidemiologic Monitoring', 'Epidemiology', 'European', 'Fentanyl', 'Forensic Medicine', 'Goals', 'Government Agencies', 'Grant', 'Health Professional', 'Illicit Drugs', 'Infodemiology', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Law Enforcement', 'Liquid substance', 'Marketing', 'Measures', 'Monitor', 'Names', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nose', 'Ohio', 'Ontology', 'Opioid', 'Overdose', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Policies', 'Powder dose form', 'Prevention', 'Price', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Security', 'Seizures', 'Semantics', 'Sentinel', 'Side', 'Source', 'Surface', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Time trend', 'Transact', 'U-47700', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Vendor', 'addiction', 'analog', 'base', 'carfentanil', 'design', 'dosage', 'drug market', 'drug testing', 'encryption', 'innovation', 'interdisciplinary collaboration', 'knowledge base', 'lexical', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'opioid use', 'overdose death', 'public health intervention', 'response', 'social media', 'tool', 'trend']",NIDA,WRIGHT STATE UNIVERSITY,R21,2017,223715,0.05565978530952324
"Implementation of Technology-Based Evaluation of Motivational Interviewing ï»¿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Millions of Americans are receiving behavioral interventions for problematic alcohol use. In 2010, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) documented over 1.8 million treatment episodes for drug and alcohol problems, many involving group or individual psychotherapy. The tremendous service-delivery need has focused research on optimal training methods, to promote the dissemination of evidence-based interventions. A recent meta-analysis of motivational interviewing (MI) shows that ""post-training supports"" - such as performance-based feedback or coaching - are critical for maintaining counselor skills following training. However, the practical implementation of performance-based feedback for alcohol use disorders (AUDs) and problematic drinking is currently prohibitive in effort, time, and money. There is a critical need or technology to ""scale up"" performance-based feedback to counselors for AUDs and problematic drinking.  This competitive renewal builds on interdisciplinary research focused on automating the evaluation of MI fidelity for alcohol and substance use problems. This collaborative research brings together speech signal processing experts from electrical engineering and statistical text-mining and natural language processing experts from computer science with MI expert trainers and researchers. Our previous research laid a computational foundation for generating MI fidelity codes from semantic and vocal features, and the current proposal moves this work into direct clinical application. In collaboration with the University of Utah Counseling Center (UCC), we will develop and implement a clinical software support tool, the Counselor Observer Ratings Expert for MI (CORE-MI). The CORE-MI system will provide performance-based feedback focused on MI fidelity codes for training, supervision, and quality assurance for counselors treating clients struggling with alcohol and substance use problems.  The research will use a hybrid implementation-effectiveness design to pursue the following three aims: 1) Implement and calibrate the CORE-MI system at the UCC clinic to provide automated, performance-based feedback on MI; 2) Compare counselor fidelity to MI and client alcohol and substance use outcomes, before and after initiation of the CORE-MI system (approximately, N = 2,400 sessions); and 3) Using machine learning tools, computationally explore mechanisms of MI using semantic and vocal data, MI fidelity codes, and client outcomes from approximately 3,000 sessions. The successful execution of this project will break the reliance on human judgment for providing performance-based feedback to MI and will massively expand the capacity to train, supervise, and provide quality assurance.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    Performance-based feedback is an effective method for training and supervising counseling approaches for alcohol-related problems. However, current feedback methods rely on human raters and are not feasible in the real-world due to time and cost. The current study will implement a clinical support software tool that uses speech signal processing and computational models - instead of human judgment - to evaluate motivational interviewing for alcohol and substance use problems.            ",Implementation of Technology-Based Evaluation of Motivational Interviewing,9104711,R01AA018673,"['Acoustics', 'Addictive Behavior', 'Alcohol abuse', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Alcohols', 'American', 'Arousal', 'Assessment tool', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Calibration', 'Cause of Death', 'Client', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical effectiveness', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Counseling', 'Data', 'Development', 'Educational workshop', 'Effectiveness', 'Electrical Engineering', 'Empathy', 'Evaluation', 'Evidence based intervention', 'Feedback', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Group Psychotherapy', 'Homicide', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Individual', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention Studies', 'Judgment', 'Learning', 'Learning Skill', 'Life', 'Linguistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental Health', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Patient Outcomes Assessments', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Population', 'Process', 'Professional counselor', 'Psychologist', 'Psychotherapy', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Semantics', 'Services', 'Software Tools', 'Speech', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Suicide', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Support', 'United States Department of Veterans Affairs', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'United States Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration', 'Universities', 'Utah', 'Vision', 'Work', 'addiction', 'alcohol related problem', 'alcohol use disorder', 'base', 'clinical application', 'computer science', 'cost', 'design', 'drinking', 'high risk drinking', 'improved', 'meetings', 'motivational enhancement therapy', 'public health relevance', 'quality assurance', 'scale up', 'signal processing', 'skills', 'support tools', 'technological innovation', 'technology validation', 'text searching', 'tool', 'vehicular accident', 'visual feedback', 'young adult']",NIAAA,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2016,647176,0.03252114040369104
"ABCD-USA Consortium:Research Project ï»¿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Adolescence is a critical neurodevelopmental period that is associated with dramatic increases in rates of substance use. Identifying predictors of substance use and its effects on child and adolescent development is critically important, as substance-related decrements incurred during ongoing maturation could have long- lasting effects on brain functioning and behavioral, health, and psychological outcomes. In response to RFA- DA-15-015, this application proposes the University of Pittsburgh Research Project Site component [12/13] of the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD)-USA consortium to prospectively determine the neurodevelopmental and behavioral effects of substance on children and adolescents. In Pittsburgh, a representative community sample of 550 9-10 year old substance-naÃ¯ve children will be recruited (total ABCD- USA n=11,111 from 11 total sites) and will undergo a baseline assessment and two to three follow-ups over a five year period. At each assessment period, participants will undergo state-of-the-art brain imaging, comprehensive neuropsychological testing, and extensive assessment of substance use patterns and mental health functioning. The brain, behavioral, psychological, social, genetic, and environmental data collected during the course of this project will elucidate: 1) the effects o substance use patterns on the adolescent brain; 2) the effects of substance use on behavioral and health outcomes; 3) the bidirectional relationship between psychopathology and substance use patterns; 4) the effects of individual genetic, behavioral, neurobiological, and environmental differences on risk profiles and substance use outcomes; and 5) the ""gateway interactions"" between use of different substances. Elements Unique to This Site: In addition, ABCD-USA Pittsburgh will provide a unique focus determining how the cognitive dimensions of working memory and inhibitory control and the maturation of corticostriatal systems can inform our understanding of the risks for and effects of early adolescent marijuana use. Working memory and inhibitory control improve during adolescence in parallel with maturation of underlying corticostriatal neurocircuitry. An understanding of these areas of adolescent brain and cognitive development provide critical information in models determining vulnerabilities for and consequences of marijuana and other substance use. In Y03, Pittsburgh will focus on analyses examining working memory and inhibitory control phenotypes and neurodevelopmental characteristics prior to substance use. In Y04-Y05, these neurocognitive characteristics will be examined as risks for early adolescent marijuana use trajectories and, in Y10, accelerated adolescent marijuana use trajectories. Machine Learning will be applied to integrating cognitive and neuroimaging features to characterize a model of risks for early adolescent marijuana use. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The ABCD-USA Consortium will use multimodal brain imaging, cognitive and clinical assessments, bioassays, mobile monitoring, and careful assessment of substance use, environment, psychopathological symptoms, and social functioning in 11,111 adolescents followed over 10 years to determine the effects of substance use on adolescent brain and cognitive development. Our 12/13 ABCD-USA Consortium: Research Project will recruit and assess 550 youth age 9-10 at project entry.

"SNS-based Data Mining to Understand MSM Substance use and HIV Risk Behavior ï»¿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): HIV incidence among gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men (hereafter MSM) continues to rise, driven in part by substance use. MSM are increasingly using social networking sites (SNS) to find substance use and sexual partners. However, no studies currently exist that use automated, real-time data collection and analysis procedures to monitor substance use and sexual partner seeking across the range of SNS platforms used by MSM to inform intervention development. This project will build on Routine Activities Theory to conduct research using SNS interactions to aid in understanding patterns of substance use and HIV risk behavior among MSM. During Phase 1, focus groups of MSM (n=~8/focus group; N=24) will be used to develop a lexicon for identifying substance use and sexual partner seeking among MSM via diverse SNS platforms. These findings will guide the development of a culturally congruent data collection and mining module (DCMM; internet software that systematically searches SNS to gather data in an analyzable format) with iterative feedback from a community advisory board (CAB) and pilot testing by MSM (n=6). During Phase 2, the DCMM will gather data from 50 MSM on SNS use (e.g., frequency, intensity) substance use and HIV risk/protective behaviors (e.g., content of profiles, postings). Risk behaviors will be assessed weekly via self- report and validated with biomarkers of risk behaviors to be collected at the end of the study period using a rapid oral HIV test and drug test via nail sample. This research will result in a subsequent R34 application to develop and test a just-in-time adaptive intervention (JTAI) using machine learning technology. The specific aims of the proposed research are to: (1) Develop and assess the utility of a culturally congruent DCMM to study the SNS use patterns, substance use and HIV risk and protective behaviors of MSM; (2) Determine associations between patterns of technology use, substance use and HIV risk behaviors among a sample of 50 MSM using a culturally congruent DCMM, self-report data collection and biomarkers for substance use and HIV; and (3) Evaluate the feasibility and the computational requirements of a just-in-time adaptive intervention to reduce substance use and HIV risk behavior among MSM. By devising and testing a culturally congruent DCMM to capture SNS data on MSM substance use and sexual partner seeking this study lays the building blocks to developing technology-based substance use and HIV prevention and treatment efforts tailored specifically for MSM.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men (hereafter MSM) use social networking sites (SNS) to locate substance use and sexual partners, which can increase their risk for HIV acquisition and transmission. This study will devise and test a culturally congruent data collection and mining module (DCMM) to capture large quantities of SNS data on MSM substance use and sexual partner seeking. This formative research has high public health significance as it can clarify the SNS partner seeking dynamics driving MSM's substance use and sexual risk behaviors to inform culturally congruent technology-based substance use and HIV prevention and treatment efforts tailored specifically for MSM.        ",SNS-based Data Mining to Understand MSM Substance use and HIV Risk Behavior,9137371,R03DA039752,"['AIDS prevention', 'Address', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Alcohols', 'Automobile Driving', 'Behavior', 'Biological Markers', 'Bisexual', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Drug usage', 'Feedback', 'Focus Groups', 'Frequencies', 'Gays', 'HIV', 'HIV Infections', 'HIV risk', 'Human immunodeficiency virus test', 'Incidence', 'Informed Consent', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Language', 'Law Enforcement', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Monitor', 'NIH Office of AIDS Research', 'Nail plate', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Procedures', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Qualitative Research', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Behaviors', 'Sampling', 'Sexual Partners', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'base', 'cost', 'data mining', 'digital', 'drug testing', 'high risk', 'individualized medicine', 'innovation', 'men', 'men who have sex with men', 'oral HIV', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'programs', 'protective behavior', 'public health relevance', 'reduced substance use', 'sex', 'sex risk', 'sexual risk taking', 'social media', 'social networking website', 'theories', 'therapy development', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'web site']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R03,2016,154000,0.08582302549218837
"ABCD-USA Consortium: Research Project ï»¿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Adolescence is a critical neurodevelopmental period associated with dramatic increases in rates of substance use. Identifying the pathways to substance use and its effects on child and adolescent development is critically important, as the effects of substance use during ongoing maturation likely have long-lasting effects on brain functioning and behavioral, health, and psychological outcomes. This Research Project Site application from the University of California, San Diego and Laureate Institute for Brain Research is in response to RFA-DA-15-015 as part of the ABCD-USA Consortium (5/13), to prospectively determine the neurodevelopmental and behavioral predictors and consequences of substance use on children and adolescents. A representative community sample of 1086 9-10 year olds enriched for high- risk characteristics will be recruited, contributing to the sample f 11,111 to be collected from 11 hubs across the ABCD- USA Consortium. All participants will undergo a comprehensive baseline assessment, including state-of-the-art brain imaging, comprehensive neuropsychological testing, bioassays, mobile monitoring and careful assessment of substance use, environment, psychopathological symptoms, and social functioning every 2 years. Interim annual interviews and quarterly web-based assessments will provide refined temporal resolution of behaviors, development, and life events with minimal participant burden. These Consortium-wide data obtained during the course of this project will elucidate: 1) the effects of substance use patterns on the adolescent brain; 2) the effects of substance use on behavioral and health outcomes; 3) the bidirectional relationship between psychopathology and substance use patterns; 4) the effects of individual genetic, behavioral, neurobiological, and environmental differences on risk profiles and substance use outcomes; and 5) the ""gateway interactions"" between use of different substances. This hub's Research Project focuses on mechanisms of substance use disorder, special populations with high use prevalence, and the use of drugs other than marijuana. (1) We will determine whether individual differences in neural processing of antireward (i.e., negative reinforcement mechanisms) in amygdala, insula, and anterior cingulate are associated with increased negative emotionality and pain, predict initiation of use and problem use, and are in turn further dysregulated by substance use. (2) We will determine whether protective environment factors and ethnic identification in minority youth are linked to healthier antireward processing and better substance use outcomes. (3) We will determine whether antireward neural processing predicts increased use of illicit drugs other than MJ including misuse of prescription drugs, if such use predicts subsequent exaggerated antireward processing, and if gateway interactions exist between substances. Finally, we will use machine learning approaches to develop a youth-specific risk calculator that will enable us to identify individually- based modifiable risk factor, providing brain-based targets of future novel prevention and intervention approaches. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The ABCD-USA Consortium will use multimodal brain imaging, cognitive and clinical assessments, bioassays, mobile monitoring, and careful assessment of substance use, environment, psychopathological symptoms, and social functioning in 11,111 adolescents followed over 10 years to determine the effects of substance use on adolescent brain and cognitive development.

We propose a comprehensive, nationwide study to be conducted at 21 sites organized into 11 hubs (over 89 million Americans, 29% of the US population, live within 50 miles of our geographically spread sites), that, uniquely, can provide a nationally representative sample and a large twin sample that together can help distinguish environmental, sociocultural, and genetic factors relevant to SU. We ensure cohesion and standardization by employing a recruitment strategy designed by a professional survey company (experience with Monitoring the Future); standardized environmental, neurocognitive and mental health assessments, MRI assessments with all scanners using harmonized Human Connectome Project procedures, and computerized data collection with real-time quality control. Developmentally tailored assessments will have stable sensitivity and construct validity across the childhood and adolescent developmental period. They minimize participant burden, yet capture even subtle changes over time in substance use, mental health, neurocognition, development, and environment, and we employ novel state-of-the-art bioassays and passive data collection from mobile devices.

"ABCD-USA Consortium:Research Project ï»¿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Adolescence is a critical neurodevelopmental period that is associated with dramatic increases in rates of substance use. Identifying predictors of substance use and its effects on child and adolescent development is critically important, as substance-related decrements incurred during ongoing maturation could have long- lasting effects on brain functioning and behavioral, health, and psychological outcomes. In response to RFA- DA-15-015, this application proposes the University of Pittsburgh Research Project Site component [12/13] of the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD)-USA consortium to prospectively determine the neurodevelopmental and behavioral effects of substance on children and adolescents. In Pittsburgh, a representative community sample of 550 9-10 year old substance-naÃ¯ve children will be recruited (total ABCD- USA n=11,111 from 11 total sites) and will undergo a baseline assessment and two to three follow-ups over a five year period. At each assessment period, participants will undergo state-of-the-art brain imaging, comprehensive neuropsychological testing, and extensive assessment of substance use patterns and mental health functioning. The brain, behavioral, psychological, social, genetic, and environmental data collected during the course of this project will elucidate: 1) the effects o substance use patterns on the adolescent brain; 2) the effects of substance use on behavioral and health outcomes; 3) the bidirectional relationship between psychopathology and substance use patterns; 4) the effects of individual genetic, behavioral, neurobiological, and environmental differences on risk profiles and substance use outcomes; and 5) the ""gateway interactions"" between use of different substances. Elements Unique to This Site: In addition, ABCD-USA Pittsburgh will provide a unique focus determining how the cognitive dimensions of working memory and inhibitory control and the maturation of corticostriatal systems can inform our understanding of the risks for and effects of early adolescent marijuana use. Working memory and inhibitory control improve during adolescence in parallel with maturation of underlying corticostriatal neurocircuitry. An understanding of these areas of adolescent brain and cognitive development provide critical information in models determining vulnerabilities for and consequences of marijuana and other substance use. In Y03, Pittsburgh will focus on analyses examining working memory and inhibitory control phenotypes and neurodevelopmental characteristics prior to substance use. In Y04-Y05, these neurocognitive characteristics will be examined as risks for early adolescent marijuana use trajectories and, in Y10, accelerated adolescent marijuana use trajectories. Machine Learning will be applied to integrating cognitive and neuroimaging features to characterize a model of risks for early adolescent marijuana use.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The ABCD-USA Consortium will use multimodal brain imaging, cognitive and clinical assessments, bioassays, mobile monitoring, and careful assessment of substance use, environment, psychopathological symptoms, and social functioning in 11,111 adolescents followed over 10 years to determine the effects of substance use on adolescent brain and cognitive development. Our 12/13 ABCD-USA Consortium: Research Project will recruit and assess 550 youth age 9-10 at project entry.

"ABCD-USA Consortium: Research Project ï»¿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Adolescence is a critical neurodevelopmental period associated with dramatic increases in rates of substance use. Identifying the pathways to substance use and its effects on child and adolescent development is critically important, as the effects of substance use during ongoing maturation likely have long-lasting effects on brain functioning and behavioral, health, and psychological outcomes. This Research Project Site application from the University of California, San Diego and Laureate Institute for Brain Research is in response to RFA-DA-15-015 as part of the ABCD-USA Consortium (5/13), to prospectively determine the neurodevelopmental and behavioral predictors and consequences of substance use on children and adolescents. A representative community sample of 1086 9-10 year olds enriched for high- risk characteristics will be recruited, contributing to the sample f 11,111 to be collected from 11 hubs across the ABCD- USA Consortium. All participants will undergo a comprehensive baseline assessment, including state-of-the-art brain imaging, comprehensive neuropsychological testing, bioassays, mobile monitoring and careful assessment of substance use, environment, psychopathological symptoms, and social functioning every 2 years. Interim annual interviews and quarterly web-based assessments will provide refined temporal resolution of behaviors, development, and life events with minimal participant burden. These Consortium-wide data obtained during the course of this project will elucidate: 1) the effects of substance use patterns on the adolescent brain; 2) the effects of substance use on behavioral and health outcomes; 3) the bidirectional relationship between psychopathology and substance use patterns; 4) the effects of individual genetic, behavioral, neurobiological, and environmental differences on risk profiles and substance use outcomes; and 5) the ""gateway interactions"" between use of different substances. This hub's Research Project focuses on mechanisms of substance use disorder, special populations with high use prevalence, and the use of drugs other than marijuana. (1) We will determine whether individual differences in neural processing of antireward (i.e., negative reinforcement mechanisms) in amygdala, insula, and anterior cingulate are associated with increased negative emotionality and pain, predict initiation of use and problem use, and are in turn further dysregulated by substance use. (2) We will determine whether protective environment factors and ethnic identification in minority youth are linked to healthier antireward processing and better substance use outcomes. (3) We will determine whether antireward neural processing predicts increased use of illicit drugs other than MJ including misuse of prescription drugs, if such use predicts subsequent exaggerated antireward processing, and if gateway interactions exist between substances. Finally, we will use machine learning approaches to develop a youth-specific risk calculator that will enable us to identify individually- based modifiable risk factor, providing brain-based targets of future novel prevention and intervention approaches.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The ABCD-USA Consortium will use multimodal brain imaging, cognitive and clinical assessments, bioassays, mobile monitoring, and careful assessment of substance use, environment, psychopathological symptoms, and social functioning in 11,111 adolescents followed over 10 years to determine the effects of substance use on adolescent brain and cognitive development.

"Building an open-source cloud-based computational platform to improve data access   We propose to develop a novel, cost-effective, cloud-based data and analytics platform that will provide efficient data storage solutions and enhanced analytics, annotation and reporting capabilities for supporting and accelerating clinical and molecular research in the treatment of substance use disorders (SUD). This open source platform, which leverages existing BioDX technology, will provide a centralized, multi-user environment that enables and encourages collaborative research and information dissemination among team members.  One of the unmet infrastructural challenges of modern molecular research is the availability of computational platforms that allow the management of large databases, easy access to data, the availability of powerful customizable tools for data mining, analysis and visualization, and integration of different data sources to allow successful analysis of complex data problems. Such problems are commonplace in high- throughput molecular research. This proposal aims to fill this gap by developing a robust platform that integrates state-of-the-art open-source technologies for data storage, data access, data mining and analysis, annotation, visualization and reporting.  We previously developed a cloud-based BioDatomics platform for Next Generation Sequencing (NGS), BioDX, which has been successful and has been used commercially by several clients. This proposal aims to develop a new platform leveraging our experience with the BioDX platform that integrates: data storage and real-time data querying using Cloudera Impala; powerful and customizable analytics tools using R and its derivative Bioconductor suite of programs for bioinformatics; annotation integration and reporting which is an existing feature of BioDX; and a visual programming interface that will simplify and enhance the development and maintenance of reproducible analytics workflows. We believe this powerful integrated data platform, if successful, will enable real-time collaboration, dramatically reduce data repository costs, and increase the efficiency and efficacy of data analyses for translating experimental data into actionable research products.  We are committed to analyzing stakeholder needs and optimizing hardware, software and information technology systems to meet their demands. This platform will enhance stakeholder capabilities for developing, implementing and testing various models for substance addiction, risky behavior, discovery of molecular targets for treatment, genomic profiling of patients and other relevant scientific questions. Users will have access to modern statistical, machine learning, data mining and visualization tools.  The initial phase of work will involve development of the platform, optimizing performance on the cloud and testing the integration of new technology. BioDatomics is committed to funding the next phase of work which will include usability testing and finalizing a commercial product, following which full commercialization will proceed. Preliminary commercialization plans have demonstrated that the project has the capacity to generate a million dollars in revenue during the first full year after commercial release.  The ultimate beneficiaries of this platform will be government agencies, academic researchers and pharmaceutical companies pursuing collaborative projects to discover treatments for substance abuse disorders. This open source platform will enable significant savings to the end users in terms of data storage and analytic capabilities, and promises to have a major impact in increasing the success of molecular, clinical and translational research for substance abuse disorders.

"Development and Use of rtfMRI for Self-control of Nicotine Craving  Project Summary Abstract This proposal aims to study the application of functional magnetic resonance imaging in real time (rtfMRI) as an operant training feedback mechanism for treating substance use disorders. Recent data suggest that individuals can reduce activity in some brain regions (e.g. anterior cingulate cortex, anterior insula, auditory cortex when they are presented with information about activation in that brain region. Experimental and clinical pain have been reduced with rtfMRI signal feedback from the rostral anterior cingulate in a manner proportional to reductions in the blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) signal from that region. These regions overlap with those involved in the effets of substances of abuse and the development of substance use disorders (SUDs). The initial information opens the possibility of applying neurofeedback to improve treatment outcomes in patient samples. The present application seeks to expand the investigation of these processes and validate their applicability to substance dependent volunteers. In initial studies we will examine the capacity of nicotine dependent volunteers to reduce their craving for cigarettes. This substance was selected for its high retention rates and prevalence and public health burden in the general population, but it is expected that future studies would explore other forms of addiction (e.g. cocaine, opiates). Our multidisciplinary team proposes to advance current knowledge in this area by: (1) using data not from a single brain region, but from networks involved in nicotine craving and dependence, thereby accounting for inter- individual differences in brain regional activation patterns during nicotine craving; (2) developing a quantifiable method by using arterial spin labeling (ASL); and (3) determining the influence of individual expectations on these processes (e.g. assessing the degree to which these effects are attributable to placebo-related responding). The developmental and experimental elements of this proposal will lead to new avenues for treatment that would be readily generalizable to other forms of drug addiction besides nicotine, and potentially impacting on the outcomes of the substantial numbers of individuals seeking substance abuse treatment.

"Research Education in Statistical Genetics of Substance Abuse This application seeks support from the National Institute on Drug Abuse R25 mechanism for pre-doctoral and postdoctoral research positions at the Virginia Institute for Psychiatric and Behavioral Genetics (VIPBG) at Virginia Commonwealth University (VCU). The overall goal of this research education program is to provide an environment that encourages the development and application of statistical genetics at the highest levels. To accomplish this goal, a research education program in statistical genetics will been developed to foster interdisciplinary research, a key tenet of the NIDA mission, and which we believe is essential to conducting research in this field. Two areas of research focus are identified: Advanced Genetic Epidemiology and Statistical Molecular Genetics. These areas are synergistic and address a diverse variety of statistical methods, both those in current use and those under development. The research education program consists of pre-doctoral and postdoctoral components. Pre-doctoral participants will pursue degrees in either Human and Molecular Genetics or Biostatistics. This component is designed to recruit, at the earliest time in their careers, potential future investigators to research in statistical genetics focused on substance use, abuse and dependence (SUAD). The aim is to create a cohort of PhD graduates who are have been extensively exposed to, and begun to publish research in, this area at the outset of their research training. The postdoctoral component recognizes that many promising young researchers have training in areas relevant to, but not focused on, the statistical genetics of substance use and abuse. This flexible 2-3 year postdoctoral training component will help guide young investigators to this field of study and will provide them with integrated and focused training that will enable them to pursue careers in statistical genetics of SUAD. Research education is intended for individuals with training in mathematics, statistics, biostatistics, genetics, psychology or pharmacology and to those who have completed their clinical requirements for the MD degree. The goal of the postdoctoral component is to educate independent investigators who will contribute to the efforts to identify and characterize the genetic and environmental determinants of SUAD; they are expected to do so at VCU and at other institutions nationwide. To accomplish the overall program goal we will: i) Offer and carefully monitor a multidisciplinary integrated research training program with a range of research opportunities; ii) Meet the needs for training in emerging research areas in SUAD; iii) Provide training to researchers from diverse academic and ethnic backgrounds and intensive mentoring; iv) Provide a specialized curriculum that will merge strengths in SUAD research at our institution; and v) Disseminate course materials, developed software, user guides and example scripts to the wider community by teaching workshops and establishing a website with web casts, pod casts and script libraries. This project seeks support from the NIDA R25 research education program in statistical genetics of substance abuse. Two predoctoral and three postdoctoral participants will pursue individualized courses of training in statistical genetics, and participate in active research projects in the Virginia Institute for Psychiatric and Behavioral Genetics at Virginia Commonwealth University.",Research Education in Statistical Genetics of Substance Abuse,8305142,R25DA026119,"['Addictive Behavior', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Alcohols', 'Animal Model', 'Area', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Genetics', 'Biometry', 'Clinical', 'Commit', 'Communities', 'Comorbidity', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Education', 'Education Projects', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Educational workshop', 'Environment', 'Epidemiologist', 'Exposure to', 'Faculty', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Programming', 'Genetic Research', 'Genetics and Medicine', 'Genome Scan', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Human', 'Human Genetics', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Institution', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Internet', 'Knowledge', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Measurable', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Biology', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Monitor', 'Mus', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'O-(glucuronic acid 2-sulfate)-(1--4)-O-(2,5)-anhydromannitol 6-sulfate', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Pharmacology and Toxicology', 'Phenotype', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Predisposing Factor', 'Prevention', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychology', 'Psychometrics', 'Publishing', 'Queensland', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Research Training', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Students', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Twin Multiple Birth', 'Universities', 'Virginia', 'Work', 'Writing', 'addiction', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'cohort', 'computer science', 'design', 'experience', 'field study', 'flexibility', 'genetic epidemiology', 'genome wide association study', 'human subject', 'medical specialties', 'meetings', 'model development', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'population based', 'post-doctoral training', 'pre-doctoral', 'professor', 'programs', 'psychogenetics', 'software development', 'statistics', 'tool', 'web site']",NIDA,VIRGINIA COMMONWEALTH UNIVERSITY,R25,2012,379949,0.032294820714663414

"Substance Abuse Continuing Care through Mobile Assessment and Messaging. DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This Phase I SBIR application entitled ""Substance Abuse Continuing Care through Mobile Assessment and Messaging"" is designed to create a low cost, continuous care decision support text messaging intervention to increase treatment adherence, decrease drop-out and prevent the recurrence of problem drug use during and following professionally facilitated addiction treatment. Based on the high drop-out rates during treatment and relapse rates following treatment, it has been proposed that addiction should be treated similarly to other chronic illnesses that require long-term intensive monitoring and care. Recent research on adaptive phone-based continuing care interventions supports the use of a chronic care addictions treatment model both for those attempting to change illicit substance abuse and society as a whole. There is an emerging literature on the use of text messaging and ecological momentary assessment through mobile phones for low cost automated disease management of chronic illnesses like asthma and diabetes. Text messaging is ideally suited to addiction continuous care because the mobile phone is capable of providing low cost adaptive monitoring and feedback wherever and whenever relapse is most likely to occur. The proposed study is designed to develop the content, structure, programming and user interface of an automated interactive drug treatment continuous care text messaging intervention that can be modulated by the severity of symptoms during and following substance abuse treatment. The intervention will include web-based assessment, ecological momentary assessment (EMA), adaptive supportive messaging based on assessment results and counselor/social network alerts. The intervention is designed to both retain persons in treatment and help them sustain long-term change following treatment. We will obtain outside feedback and review of the preliminary intervention through focus groups with a heterogeneous group of clients enrolled in substance abuse treatment. Thought leaders with expertise in addiction, continuous care, text messaging and ecological momentary assessment will help develop the core content and features of the intervention. Specific content and programming benchmarks for success will determine Phase II feasibility. If successful this messaging program has the potential to significantly improve outcomes for the 2.2 million chronic illicit substance users who seek treatment each year without the financial burden and/or time commitment needed to implement traditional counselor based continuing care interventions. Additionally, the program can be used by clients of private addiction specialists and could be adapted to reach substance abusers in earlier stages of change as a stepped care intervention. Despite the emerging literature on the importance and effectiveness of continuing care  interventions for drug abuse, few treatment programs implement these strategies into care  due to lack of resources and financial incentive. We propose to create a low cost adaptive  continuing care text messaging support and monitoring program through the mobile phone  to help reduce drug abuse treatment drop-out and relapse among illicit drug users  attempting to change. If study aims are achieved, the proposed intervention could be easily  disseminated to providers, improve long-term psychosocial and health outcomes for  substance users and reduce overall healthcare costs related to substance abuse.",Substance Abuse Continuing Care through Mobile Assessment and Messaging.,7998538,R43DA029359,"['Abstinence', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Asthma', 'Back', 'Behavioral Research', 'Benchmarking', 'Body Weight decreased', 'Car Phone', 'Caring', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Care', 'Chronic Disease', 'Client', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease Management', 'Drops', 'Drug abuse', 'Drug usage', 'Drug user', 'Effectiveness', 'Enrollment', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Expenditure', 'Feedback', 'Focus Groups', 'Fostering', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Personnel', 'Health behavior', 'Illicit Drugs', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Literature', 'Long-Term Care', 'Marketing', 'Memory', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motivation', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Principal Investigator', 'Professional counselor', 'Provider', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recurrence', 'Relapse', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Running', 'Secure', 'Severities', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Smoking', 'Social Network', 'Societies', 'Specialist', 'Staging', 'Stimulus Generalization', 'Structure', 'Substance Addiction', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technology', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'United States Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration', 'addiction', 'base', 'cost', 'data management', 'design', 'disorder later incidence prevention', 'financial incentive', 'improved', 'meetings', 'prevent', 'programs', 'prototype', 'psychosocial', 'response', 'substance abuse treatment', 'substance abuser', 'success', 'treatment adherence', 'treatment program', 'volunteer']",NIDA,"MOBILE HEALTH INTERVENTIONS, LLC",R43,2010,119348,0.03882378230408305

"Adolescent Psychopathology and Alcohol Use Disorders DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This K02 competitive continuation application proposes to advance understanding of adolescent alcohol use disorders (AUDs) through examination of adult outcomes with innovative statistical techniques for longitudinal data. In Years 6 through 10, the program focus evolves from statistical techniques for categorical variables to techniques based on finite mixture models. The programmatic focus shifts from relationships among adolescent characteristics to adult outcomes. The project will emphasize person-centered statistical strategies to predict adult outcomes among adolescents characterized by substance involvement trajectories, psychopathology latent classes, childhood maltreatment histories, and treatment participation.      With NIAAA and NIDA support, the Pittsburgh Adolescent Alcohol Research Center (PAARC) is completing adult follow-up assessments in adolescents with AUDs and a reference group. The hypotheses consider the confluence of behavioral, cognitive, and affective dysregulation in predicting AUD course, complications, and outcomes. Adult outcomes examined include AUDs, other substance use disorders, psychopathology,) personality disorders, academic achievement, work performance, family status, somatic symptoms, liver injury, and sexually transmitted diseases. Complementary data from the Center for Education and Drug Abuse Research (NIDA P50: PI Tarter, Co-PI Clark), a study of children at risk for alcohol and drug use disorders followed through adolescence into adulthood, will also be utilized. Incorporating categorical variables pertinent to symptom and diagnostic categories, the statistical strategies applied will include multivariate survival analysis, general growth mixture models, and Bayesian instance-based machine learning. These methods will be specifically optimized to construct clinically relevant models applicable to individual patients, serving as the basis for more thorough phenotype description, more effective prevention programs, and individually tailored treatment interventions. n/a",Adolescent Psychopathology and Alcohol Use Disorders,7481099,K02AA000291,"['Academic achievement', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Affective', 'Age', 'Age of Onset', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohol dependence', 'Alcohols', 'Behavioral', 'Cannabis', 'Categories', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Child Abuse and Neglect', 'Childhood', 'Chronic', 'Class', 'Classification', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Drug Use Disorder', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Family', 'Fathers', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Health Status', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Liver', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Performance at work', 'Personality Disorders', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Prevention program', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychopathology', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Severities', 'Sexually Transmitted Diseases', 'Spouses', 'Structure', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Survival Analysis', 'Symptoms', 'TNFRSF5 gene', 'Techniques', 'Teenagers', 'adolescent substance use', 'alcohol research', 'alcohol use disorder', 'base', 'boys', 'clinically relevant', 'drug abuse education', 'follow-up', 'girls', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'person centered', 'programs', 'psychosocial', 'treatment program', 'underage drinking', 'young adult']",NIAAA,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,K02,2008,143320,0.028580251435826962

The developmental and experimental elements of this application will lead to new avenues for treatment that would be readily generalizable to other forms of drug addiction besides nicotine, and potentially impacting on the outcomes of the substantial numbers of individuals seeking substance abuse treatment.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The development of new methodology for the treatment of patients with substance use disorders would represent a significant advance in the therapeutics of these disorders.

"Data Driven Strategies for Substance Misuse Identification in Hospitalized Patients PROJECT SUMMARY  The rate of substance use-related hospital visits in the US continues to increase, and now outpaces visits for heart disease and respiratory failure. The prevalence of substance misuse (nonmedical use of opioids and/or benzodiazepines, illicit drugs, and/or alcohol) in hospitalized patients is estimated to be 15%-25% and far exceeds the prevalence in the general population. With over 35 million hospitalized patients per year, tens of millions of patients are not screened for substance misuse during their stay. Despite the recommendation for self-report questionnaires (single-question universal screens, Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test [AUDIT], Drug Abuse Screening Tool [DAST]), screening rates remains low in hospitals. Current screening methods are resource-intensive, so a comprehensive and automated approach to substance misuse screening that will augment current clinical workflow would therefore be of great utility.  In the advent of Meaningful Use in the electronic health record (EHR), efficiency for substance misuse detection may be improved by leveraging data collected during usual care. Documentation of substance use is common and occurs in 97% of provider admission notes, but their free text format renders them difficult to mine and analyze. Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning are subfields of artificial intelligence (AI) that provide a solution to analyze text data in the EHR to identify substance misuse. Modern NLP has fused with machine learning, another sub-field of AI focused on learning from data. In particular, the most powerful NLP methods rely on supervised learning, a type of machine learning that takes advantage of current reference standards to make predictions about unseen cases  In our earlier version of an NLP and machine learning tool, our opioid and alcohol misuse classifiers successfully used data from clinical notes collected in the first 24 hours of hospital admission to reach a sensitivity and specificity above 75% for detecting alcohol or opioid misuse. We will improve the performance of our baseline, individual NLP single-substance classifiers for alcohol and opioid misuse by implementing multi-label and multi-task machine learning methods. These methods will take advantage of information shared across different types of substance misuse and better capture the state of a patient within a single model. The resulting classifier will be capable of jointly inferring all types of substance misuse (alcohol misuse, opioid misuse, and non-opioid illicit misuse) including polysubstance use, and cater to each individual patientâs substance use treatment needs.  We aim to train and test our substance misuse classifiers at Rush in a retrospective dataset of over 35,000 hospitalizations that have been manually screened with the universal screen, AUDIT, and DAST. The top performing classifier will then be tested prospectively to: (1) externally validate its screening performance in a hospital without established screening; and (2) test its effectiveness against usual care at a hospital with questionnaire-based substance misuse screening. We hypothesize that a single-model NLP substance misuse classifier will provide a standardized, interoperable, and accurate approach for universal screening in hospitalized patients and guiding interventions. PROJECT NARRATIVE We anticipate that the research proposed will provide novel and critically important tools in artificial intelligence for the detection of substance misuse from the electronic health record (EHR). Development and validation of the substance misuse classifier would enable a standardized approach to perform screening on all patient encounters on a daily basis in health systems. We will rigorously develop and test substance misuse classifier retrospectively and then examine its performance prospectively in both a naÃ¯ve and mature screening program. This will serve as the first step towards a comprehensive universal screener that leverages available data in the EHR.",Data Driven Strategies for Substance Misuse Identification in Hospitalized Patients,10026785,R01DA051464,"['Admission activity', 'Adopted', 'Adult', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Alcohols', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Benzodiazepines', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Consult', 'Costs and Benefits', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Documentation', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Felis catus', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Health Care Sector', 'Health system', 'Heart Diseases', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Illicit Drugs', 'Individual', 'Inpatients', 'Intake', 'Interruption', 'Intervention', 'Interviewer', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Prevalence', 'Primary Health Care', 'Provider', 'Publishing', 'Questionnaires', 'Recommendation', 'Reference Standards', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Respiratory Failure', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Screening procedure', 'Semantics', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Series', 'Social Work', 'Source', 'Standardization', 'Substance Abuse Detection', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'Trust', 'Validation', 'Visit', 'addiction', 'alcohol misuse', 'alcohol use disorder', 'base', 'clinical decision support', 'cohort', 'comparison intervention', 'design', 'effectiveness evaluation', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'interoperability', 'machine learning method', 'multitask', 'non-opioid analgesic', 'novel', 'opioid misuse', 'prospective', 'prospective test', 'response', 'routine care', 'screening', 'screening program', 'substance misuse', 'supervised learning', 'support tools', 'tool', 'treatment as usual', 'trend', 'unstructured data']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R01,2020,663889,0.09105812444410455

"Great Lakes Node of the Drug Abuse Clinical Trials Network PROJECT SUMMARY  Individuals with substance use disorders are disproportionately experiencing homelessness, poverty, and chronic medical conditions (diabetes and hypertension), which are emerging risk factors for contracting SARS-CoV-2 (official name for the virus that causes COVID-19). Different types of substance use have been associated with development of respiratory infections and progression to severe respiratory failure, also known as Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). However, complex syndromes like ARDS and behavioral conditions like substance misuse are difficult to identify from the electronic health record. Clinical notes and radiology reports provide a rich source of information that may be used to identify cases of substance misuse and ARDS. This information is routinely recorded during hospital care, and automated, data-driven solutions with natural language processing (NLP) can extract semantics and important risk factors from the unstructured data of clinical notes. The computational methods of NLP derive meaning from clinical notes, from which machine learning can predict risk factors for patients leaving AMA or progressing to respiratory failure. Our team developed tools with >80% sensitivity/specificity to identify individual types of substance misuse using NLP with machine learning (ML). Our single-center models delineated risk factors embedded in the notes (e.g., mental health conditions, socioeconomic indicators). Further, we have developed and externally validated a machine learning tool to identify cases of ARDS with high accuracy for early treatment. We aim to expand this work by pooling data across health systems and build a generalizable and comprehensive classifier that captures multiple types of substance misuse for use in risk stratification and prognostication during the COVID pandemic.  We hypothesize that a single-model NLP substance misuse classifier will provide a standardized, interoperable, and accurate approach for universal analysis of hospitalized patients, and that such information can be used to identify those at risk for disrupted care and those at risk for respiratory failure. We aim to train and test our substance misuse classifiers at Rush in a retrospective dataset of over 60,000 hospitalizations that have been manually screened with the universal screen, AUDIT, and DAST. This Administrative Supplement will allow us to examine the correlations between substances of misuse and risk for COVID-19 as well as development of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) in the context of these phenomena. PROJECT NARRATIVE We anticipate that the research proposed will provide novel and critically important tools in artificial intelligence for the detection of substance misuse and COVID-19 from the electronic health record (EHR). Development and validation of a digital classifier would enable a standardized approach to perform screening on all patient encounters on a daily basis in health systems. We will rigorously develop and test the classifier retrospectively on an existing dataset of 60,000 patients. This will serve as the first step towards a comprehensive universal screener that leverages available data in the EHR.",Great Lakes Node of the Drug Abuse Clinical Trials Network,10173503,UG1DA049467,"['2019-nCoV', 'Accident and Emergency department', 'Administrative Supplement', 'Adult', 'Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome', 'Affect', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavioral', 'COVID-19', 'COVID-19 pandemic', 'Caring', 'Chronic', 'Cities', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials Network', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Consumption', 'Contracts', 'Data', 'Data Pooling', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disasters', 'Drug abuse', 'Drug usage', 'Early treatment', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Epidemic', 'Equipment', 'Felis catus', 'General Population', 'Health', 'Health Services', 'Health Status', 'Health system', 'Heart Diseases', 'Home environment', 'Homelessness', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Hurricane', 'Hypertension', 'Illicit Drugs', 'Individual', 'Label', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Medical', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Names', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Overdose', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Poverty', 'Prevention', 'Public Health', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Respiratory Failure', 'Respiratory Tract Infections', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk stratification', 'Semantics', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Social support', 'Source', 'Standardization', 'Sterility', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Syndrome', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Treatment outcome', 'Triage', 'Validation', 'Virus', 'Visit', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Withdrawal', 'Work', 'behavioral health', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'coronavirus disease', 'digital', 'drug market', 'experience', 'high risk', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'interoperability', 'machine learning method', 'marijuana use', 'mortality risk', 'non-opioid analgesic', 'novel', 'opioid misuse', 'overdose death', 'pandemic disease', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'screening', 'social', 'social exclusion', 'social stigma', 'socioeconomics', 'substance misuse', 'success', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'unstructured data']",NIDA,RUSH UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,UG1,2020,139752,0.0701911077867358

"A software product that empowers individuals affected by substance use disorders and their care teams with health and social resources Project Summary Access to community resources such as housing, food, transportation and medication also known as social determinants of health (SDOH) has been shown to be critical for a successful treatment and recovery of substance use disorders (SUD). Therefore, case managers and social workers at various points-of-care (e.g. law enforcement sobering centers, primary health centers) dedicate time to identify community resources that may address their patientsâ health and social barriers. However, identifying competent community resources remains a challenge as they are usually stored in manual âreferral bindersâ which are highly duplicated and fragmented across organizations. Therefore, this significantly contributes to lack of direct access to recovery capital for individuals affected by SUD. Based on preliminary data and interviews with case managers and social workers, this SBIR Phase I study has two objectives. 1) Evaluate whether a co-creation led business model that will leverage partnerships with organizations that have SUD subject matter expertise (e.g. Houston Recovery Center - https://houstonrecoverycenter.org/) can provide enhanced access to SUD treatment services and community resources at the point-of-care. This is important as most points-of-care particularly primary health centers may not have care teams highly experienced in curating SUD related resources. Therefore, our innovation will facilitate the flow of SUD related community resources from organizations with SUD subject matter expertise to those without, such as primary health centers. 2) Establish the feasibility of a novel computational natural language processing (NLP) algorithm in matching health and social needs identified at the point-of-care to relevant and competent community resources. Our hypothesis is that the co-creation led business model coupled with a novel computational natural language processing (NLP) algorithm will lead to enhanced access to appropriate SUD recovery and healthcare resources. Finally, upon successful completion of Phase I, a future Phase II project will focus on establishing whether these innovations have a positive impact on the utilization of SUD recovery support services, encounters with law enforcement and EMS services. Project Narrative Social factors such as housing, transportation and medication have a significant impact on substance use treatment and recovery outcomes. This Phase I proposal will establish a novel co-creation model that leverages local community partnerships to curate community resources. In addition, our novel software technology prototype will match patientsâ health and social needs with resources at the point-of-care to improve the quality of care for patients with substance use disorders.",A software product that empowers individuals affected by substance use disorders and their care teams with health and social resources,9984913,R43DA051063,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Agreement', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Algorithms', 'Appointment', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Businesses', 'Capital', 'Caring', 'Case Manager', 'Client', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Counseling', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Distal', 'Employment', 'Food', 'Future', 'Health', 'Health Services', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Health care facility', 'Healthcare', 'Hour', 'Housing', 'Individual', 'Interview', 'Label', 'Law Enforcement', 'Licensing', 'Manuals', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Quality of Care', 'Recovery', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Schools', 'Services', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Social Impacts', 'Social Work', 'Social Workers', 'Software Engineering', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Transportation', 'United States', 'Work', 'application programming interface', 'base', 'commercialization', 'community partnership', 'cost', 'crowdsourcing', 'experience', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'novel', 'opioid overdose', 'outreach', 'peer', 'phase 1 study', 'point of care', 'programs', 'prototype', 'relapse risk', 'social', 'social factors', 'social health determinants', 'societal costs', 'tool', 'treatment services']",NIDA,"MEDICAL INNOVATORS COMPANY, LLC",R43,2020,224865,0.03300126742068106
"Using Machine Learning Approaches to Examine Emotion-Related Brain Activity and Substance Use Among Adolescents Project Summary/Abstract  Substance use and substance use disorder are leading causes of death and disability worldwide. Importantly, most adults with substance use disorder begin using substances as adolescents, making adolescence an important period for the development of substance use disorder. Thus, it is critical to identify factors related to substance use among adolescents, consistent with NIDA objective 1.1. One factor linked to adolescent substance use is negative emotion processing. As adolescents undergo significant biological and psychosocial changes across development they may experience altered negative emotion processing that can lead to substance use if not appropriately regulated. Unfortunately, there is limited understanding in how neural level differences in negative emotion processing is related to substance use among adolescents. Moreover, extant neuroimaging research on negative emotion processing and substance use has employed univariate methods instead of multivariate methods. In contrast to univariate methods, multivariate methods are more sensitive in detecting patterns of neural activation across voxels and yield more generalizable and replicable findings overall. In addition, this research has employed standardized negative emotion paradigms, which have high experimental control, but may be less likely to reflect negative emotion processing as it occurs in the real world. To address these gaps in the literature, the proposed study will use multivariate machine learning approaches (i.e., multivoxel pattern analysis) to classify patterns of neural activation in a standardized negative emotion processing task and in a novel naturalistic negative emotion processing task that differentiate substance using adolescents from non-using adolescents, as well as predict substance use disorder risk factors. Additionally, the proposed study will use machine learning approaches to examine sex differences in emotion-related neural activation to these tasks in relation to substance use. This research will be conducted on a sample of 326 12-13 year old adolescents from Sponsorâs (Chaplin) competing renewal grant (RO1 DA033431-06A1). Knowledge from the proposed study will be used to identify emotion-related neurobiological markers of adolescent substance use. Ultimately, these markers can be used to target at-risk adolescents in need of substance use prevention and intervention efforts. The goals of the proposed study will be accomplished within a research training plan aimed at developing multidisciplinary expertise in affective neuroscience, particularly in multivariate machine learning methods, and developmental models of substance use. The training plan includes completion of relevant coursework, attendance at targeted workshops, individual mentorship by experts in the field of development and neuroscience, and scientific writing and presentation experience. Project Narrative  This project uses machine learning fMRI approaches to investigate patterns of neural activation during negative emotion processing to classify and predict adolescent substance use. The goal of this research is to identify emotion-related neurobiological markers of substance use. This knowledge will be used to target at-risk adolescents in need of substance use prevention and intervention efforts.",Using Machine Learning Approaches to Examine Emotion-Related Brain Activity and Substance Use Among Adolescents,9991091,F31DA051154,"['13 year old', 'Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anterior', 'Arousal', 'Award', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Cause of Death', 'Clinical', 'Clip', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Data', 'Development', 'Educational workshop', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Expectancy', 'Face', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Insula of Reil', 'Interview', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'National Research Service Awards', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurosciences', 'Parents', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Peptide Initiation Factors', 'Persons', 'Precipitating Factors', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Psychopathology', 'Questionnaires', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Research Training', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Sex Differences', 'Social Change', 'Standardization', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Symptoms', 'Training', 'Urine', 'Writing', 'Youth', 'adolescent substance use', 'affective neuroscience', 'boys', 'cingulate cortex', 'critical period', 'disability', 'disorder prevention', 'disorder risk', 'early adolescence', 'emotional stimulus', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'girls', 'learning classifier', 'machine learning method', 'multidisciplinary', 'neural patterning', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'programs', 'psychosocial', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sex', 'social', 'social stressor', 'substance use prevention', 'substance using adolescents']",NIDA,GEORGE MASON UNIVERSITY,F31,2020,38803,0.16072643062043143
"Analyzing Online Reviews to Evaluate Quality of Care at Substance Use Disorder Treatment Facilities In the United States (US), an estimated 20 million adults have been diagnosed with substance use disorder (SUD). A major challenge for patients is to identify the most appropriate treatment with the best outcomes. Patients receive care in outpatient and inpatient facilities yet quality metrics at the level of these individual facilities are not publicly available.  In the era of digital data, the Internet and peer-to-peer resources are often the first place where individuals look to find information about healthcare resources. Online reviews on sites like Google and Yelp provide narratives about healthcare facilities and assign easily interpretable star ratings ranging from one to five stars. These reviews of healthcare facilities provide information about patient experience, structure (e.g. physical education) facility, organizational characteristics, payment methods), process (e.g. diagnosis, treatment, patient and outcomes (e.g. knowledge, health-related quality of life morbidity, mortality).  Prior work has demonstrated that online ratings of hospitals correlate with ratings from the national Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (HCAHPS) survey. Little work however has evaluated the utility of unvalidated, spontaneously generated, but widely accessible online reviews of SUD treatment facilities. These reviews could fill a niche with providing patients and their family members with useful information about the questions and experiences that are most important to them. Or these reviews could be limited and provide misinformation or only biased perspectives. To date, less is known about the potential value or usefulness of this emerging data source.  For this proposal we aim to study online reviews of SUD treatment facilities in the US to identify the areas of care that are reported as most important to patients and family members. For Aim 1, we will first extract approximately 50,000 online reviews of SUD treatment facilities and code them for themes using qualitative methodologies that involve manual coding and big data analytics using machine learning and natural language processing. We hypothesize that these online narratives will include qualitative data about patient experience and the type and quality of care (e.g. evidence-based treatments) provided at SUD treatment facilities. For Aim 2, we will then assess how star ratings differentiate facilities relative to structure and process measures reported in the National Survey of Substance Abuse Treatment Services.  Overall, emerging online data resources have the potential to provide new information about a critically vulnerable population affected by the opioid and more broadly the SUD crisis. Our project seeks to rigorously study these new patient-centric data sources viewed by millions of individuals for the purposes of better understanding the needs of patients and family members. These efforts can lay the groundwork for future work in developing measures of quality for a critically important healthcare resource, SUD treatment facilities. Narrative We aim to evaluate narratives and star ratings from online reviews to assess how this consumer generated, data can inform our understanding of care delivery for substance use disorder (SUD). Identifying the themes and measures of quality revealed in these reviews and how they relate to traditional measures of quality could inform future development of patient centric performance measures and ratings for SUD treatment facilities.",Analyzing Online Reviews to Evaluate Quality of Care at Substance Use Disorder Treatment Facilities,9956035,R21DA050761,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Ambulatory Care', 'Area', 'Big Data', 'Big Data Methods', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Code', 'Communication', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Drug Addiction', 'Equilibrium', 'Evidence based practice', 'Evidence based treatment', 'Family', 'Family member', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Government', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Health care facility', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Inpatients', 'Internet', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Misinformation', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nursing Homes', 'Opioid', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Outpatients', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Physical Education', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Process Measure', 'Provider', 'Qualitative Methods', 'Quality of Care', 'Recovery', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'Time', 'United States', 'Visit', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Work', 'base', 'care delivery', 'cost', 'data resource', 'digital', 'empowered', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'health related quality of life', 'improved', 'insight', 'medication-assisted treatment', 'mortality', 'opioid abuse', 'opioid epidemic', 'opioid mortality', 'opioid use disorder', 'patient engagement', 'payment', 'peer', 'satisfaction', 'substance abuse treatment', 'treatment center', 'treatment program', 'treatment services', 'urgent care', 'web site']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R21,2020,243000,0.03675407639718669
"Implementation of Technology-Based Evaluation of Motivational Interviewing ï»¿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Millions of Americans are receiving behavioral interventions for problematic alcohol use. In 2010, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) documented over 1.8 million treatment episodes for drug and alcohol problems, many involving group or individual psychotherapy. The tremendous service-delivery need has focused research on optimal training methods, to promote the dissemination of evidence-based interventions. A recent meta-analysis of motivational interviewing (MI) shows that ""post-training supports"" - such as performance-based feedback or coaching - are critical for maintaining counselor skills following training. However, the practical implementation of performance-based feedback for alcohol use disorders (AUDs) and problematic drinking is currently prohibitive in effort, time, and money. There is a critical need or technology to ""scale up"" performance-based feedback to counselors for AUDs and problematic drinking.  This competitive renewal builds on interdisciplinary research focused on automating the evaluation of MI fidelity for alcohol and substance use problems. This collaborative research brings together speech signal processing experts from electrical engineering and statistical text-mining and natural language processing experts from computer science with MI expert trainers and researchers. Our previous research laid a computational foundation for generating MI fidelity codes from semantic and vocal features, and the current proposal moves this work into direct clinical application. In collaboration with the University of Utah Counseling Center (UCC), we will develop and implement a clinical software support tool, the Counselor Observer Ratings Expert for MI (CORE-MI). The CORE-MI system will provide performance-based feedback focused on MI fidelity codes for training, supervision, and quality assurance for counselors treating clients struggling with alcohol and substance use problems.  The research will use a hybrid implementation-effectiveness design to pursue the following three aims: 1) Implement and calibrate the CORE-MI system at the UCC clinic to provide automated, performance-based feedback on MI; 2) Compare counselor fidelity to MI and client alcohol and substance use outcomes, before and after initiation of the CORE-MI system (approximately, N = 2,400 sessions); and 3) Using machine learning tools, computationally explore mechanisms of MI using semantic and vocal data, MI fidelity codes, and client outcomes from approximately 3,000 sessions. The successful execution of this project will break the reliance on human judgment for providing performance-based feedback to MI and will massively expand the capacity to train, supervise, and provide quality assurance. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    Performance-based feedback is an effective method for training and supervising counseling approaches for alcohol-related problems. However, current feedback methods rely on human raters and are not feasible in the real-world due to time and cost. The current study will implement a clinical support software tool that uses speech signal processing and computational models - instead of human judgment - to evaluate motivational interviewing for alcohol and substance use problems.",Implementation of Technology-Based Evaluation of Motivational Interviewing,9988982,R01AA018673,"['Acoustics', 'Addictive Behavior', 'Alcohol abuse', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Alcohols', 'American', 'Arousal', 'Assessment tool', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Calibration', 'Cause of Death', 'Client', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical effectiveness', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Computer Models', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Counseling', 'Data', 'Development', 'Educational workshop', 'Electrical Engineering', 'Empathy', 'Evaluation', 'Evidence based intervention', 'Feedback', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Group Psychotherapy', 'Homicide', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention Studies', 'Judgment', 'Learning', 'Learning Skill', 'Life', 'Linguistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental Health', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Patient Outcomes Assessments', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Population', 'Process', 'Professional counselor', 'Psychologist', 'Psychotherapy', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Semantics', 'Software Tools', 'Speech', 'Standardization', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Suicide', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Support', 'United States Department of Veterans Affairs', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'United States Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration', 'Universities', 'Utah', 'Vision', 'Work', 'addiction', 'alcohol abuse therapy', 'alcohol intervention', 'alcohol related problem', 'alcohol use disorder', 'base', 'clinical application', 'clinical implementation', 'computer science', 'cost', 'design', 'drinking', 'effectiveness implementation study', 'high risk drinking', 'improved', 'motivational enhancement therapy', 'public health relevance', 'quality assurance', 'scale up', 'service delivery', 'signal processing', 'skills', 'software infrastructure', 'support tools', 'technological innovation', 'technology validation', 'text searching', 'tool', 'vehicular accident', 'visual feedback', 'young adult']",NIAAA,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2020,562148,0.03252114040369104
"Using Machine Learning and Blockchain Technology to Reduce Drug Diversion in Hospitals Drug diversion, defined as âthe transfer of a controlled substance from a lawful to an unlawful channel of distribution or use,â is a challenging issue in today's healthcare systems. Based on an analysis, the volume of dosage lost due to diversion increased from 21 million in 2017 to 47 million in 2018, a 126% increase. This resulted in over $450M loss to healthcare systems due to drug diversion, a 50% increase compared to 2017. Hospitals and medical centers constitute the single largest category affected by drug diversion accounting for 33% of all cases and 94% of drug diversion incidents involved opioids. Addressing the drug diversion problem is a multi-faceted problem involving many components ranging from provider training to implementation of hardware and software systems to manage access to controlled substances. However, despite recent improvements in controlling and monitoring access to controlled substances, the process of identifying drug diversion is complicated and time consuming. In this Phase I project, we propose to build on our earlier work in machine learning and automated technologies in healthcare and consensus in a distributed and decentralized architecture to develop a technology based on blockchains to track and document transportation and administration of controlled substances in a hospital environment. The proposed system involves using a smartphone app to scan uniquely generated barcodes for vials of controlled substances during the transport process, digitally sign medication transfers between staff using secure digital certificates to eliminate current paper-based systems, and finally document administration of a controlled substance to the patient by scanning the unique barcode assigned to the vial and recording an after administration picture of the empty vial. Specific Aims: 1) Developing and validating an in silico model of drug transport/diversion in the hospital; we will develop a stochastic model of controlled substance vial movement in the hospital between a series of locations at the hospital. The vials are exchanged between these locations by agents that represent clinical staff. 2) Developing a blockchain-based framework to track medications; we will use the Hyperledger Fabric, an open-source blockchain framework geared towards enterprise applications to design and implement a blockchain framework. We will develop a software interface to record data in and retrieve data from the blockchain (and in a potential Phase II, retrieve data from EMRs and automated dispensing cabinets) for further processing. Finally, we will use the in silico model to quantify the computational power and storage requirements for the blockchain framework discussed above; and 3) Development of an algorithm to identify diversion, the goal of this specific aim is to develop a computational engine that uses data (recorded in the blockchain) to detect drug diversion. We propose to use a framework based on machine learning to detect anomalies in data (i.e., drug diversion). ! Addressing the drug diversion problem is a multi-faceted problem involving many components ranging from provider training to implementation of hardware and software systems to manage access to controlled substances. However, despite recent improvements in controlling and monitoring access to controlled substances, the process of identifying drug diversion and ensuring compliance is complicated and time consuming. A system is proposed that uses a smartphone app to scan uniquely generated barcodes for vials of controlled substances during the transport process, digitally sign medication transfers between staff using secure digital certificates to eliminate current paper-based systems, and document administration of a controlled substance, while a computation engine uses the rich data generated through the process to identify drug diversion.!",Using Machine Learning and Blockchain Technology to Reduce Drug Diversion in Hospitals,9987189,R43DA051084,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Bar Codes', 'Categories', 'Certification', 'Clinical', 'Computer software', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Consensus', 'Consumption', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Management Resources', 'Data Set', 'Decentralization', 'Detection', 'Drug Modelings', 'Drug Transport', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Life', 'Link', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical center', 'Medication Management', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Movement', 'Opioid', 'Paper', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Scanning', 'Secure', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Series', 'System', 'Technology', 'Textiles', 'Time', 'Training', 'Transport Process', 'Transportation', 'Vial device', 'Work', 'algorithm development', 'base', 'blockchain', 'design', 'digital', 'distributed ledger', 'dosage', 'in silico', 'intelligent algorithm', 'open source', 'prevent', 'simulation', 'smartphone Application', 'software systems', 'statistics']",NIDA,"AUTONOMOUS HEALTHCARE, INC.",R43,2020,224954,0.03304225422452218
"Reducing racial disparities in the treatment of opioid use disorder using machine learning-based causal analysis PROJECT SUMMARY  The opioid overdose crisis emerged in predominantly White communities, but the opioid-related mortality rate is increasing most rapidly in the Black population. A key driver of the crisis is opioid use disorder, which affects over 2 million Americans. Despite their effectiveness, medications for opioid use disorder remain underused, especially among Black Americans. Compared to White Americans, Black Americans have lower access to medications for opioid use disorder, are one-third as likely to initiate treatment, and have lower retention in care. Black Americans face unique structural obstacles to care, such as mistrust of the health care system, lack of representation among medical providers, and racially-biased providersâ perceptions. There is a critical gap in our understanding of the structural factors associated with treatment initiation and retention in care for Black patients with OUD. The scientific objective of this research plan is to identify modifiable structural factors at the community, provider, and facility levels that affect treatment initiation and retention in care for opioid use disorder in the Black population. This innovative project proposes to leverage machine learning-based causal inference methods with a combination of large national electronic medical records, corporate data warehouses, and publicly available data. By combining multiple data sources, this project will empirically evaluate modifiable factors such as provider characteristics (e.g., years of experience, patient satisfaction scores), facility characteristics (e.g., mental health staffing to patient ratios, number of buprenorphine-eligible prescribers), and patient-provider characteristics (e.g., number of previous visits or interactions). While focused on promoting equitable access to treatment for opioid use disorder in Black Americans, the public health implications of this proposal are expected to apply broadly to ameliorate the overall health burden of substance use disorders and reduce health disparities. This research plan is complemented by a career development plan that builds on the applicantâs background in epidemiology and biostatistics. Specifically, this career development plan outlines new training in three areas: (1) the clinical treatment of opioid use disorder, (2) analysis of the massive data of electronic medical records, and (3) machine learning-based causal inference methods. The combined research and training plan will prepare the applicant for a successful independent research career identifying, evaluating, and implementing multilevel interventions to reduce racial/ethnic inequalities in treatment for substance use disorders. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Opioid use disorder is a key driver of the U.S. opioid overdose crisis, yet treatment remains both underused and unequal. The proposed research is relevant to public health because it focuses on identifying modifiable structural predictors of treatment initiation and retention in care for opioid use disorder. The results of this project are expected to inform multilevel interventions equitably deliver treatment for opioid use disorder, ameliorate the overall health burden of substance use disorders, and reduce health disparities.",Reducing racial disparities in the treatment of opioid use disorder using machine learning-based causal analysis,10039535,K99DA051534,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Affordable Care Act', 'African American', 'American', 'Area', 'Big Data', 'Biometry', 'Buprenorphine', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Client satisfaction', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Communities', 'Community Surveys', 'Complement', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Critical Care', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development Plans', 'Effectiveness', 'Epidemiology', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Ethnic group', 'Face', 'Foundations', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Health Resources', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Individual', 'Inequality', 'Intervention', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Mental Health', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Natural experiment', 'Opioid', 'Patients', 'Perception', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Race', 'Research', 'Research Training', 'Specialist', 'Structure', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Treatment outcome', 'Veterans', 'Visit', 'Work', 'barrier to care', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'caucasian American', 'data warehouse', 'design', 'electronic data', 'experience', 'forest', 'health administration', 'health disparity', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'machine learning method', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'multiple data sources', 'novel strategies', 'opioid overdose', 'opioid use disorder', 'prescription opioid', 'racial and ethnic', 'racial bias', 'racial disparity', 'skills', 'social', 'standard of care', 'success', 'treatment disparity']",NIDA,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,K99,2020,179582,0.09166274539038129
"Analyzing Sequential, Multiple Assignment, Randomized Trials in the Presence of Partial Compliance Project Summary: The cyclical and heterogeneous nature of many substance use disorders highlights the need to adapt the type or the dose of treatment to accommodate the specific and changing needs of individuals. This proposal is motivated by the Extending Treatment Effectiveness of Naltrexone and the Adaptive Treatment for Cocaine Dependence trials, sequential multiple assignment randomized trials (SMART) designed to find a (personalized) rescue treatment for alcohol or/and cocaine dependent patients. One of the main challenges in these trials is the high rate of noncompliance to the assigned treatments. This feature has made it virtually impossible for investigators to fully explore the possibility of building high quality treatment strategies using the data. Our overarching aim is to address this particular challenge through developing and subsequently applying new statistical methods to the data. A SMART trial is a multi-stage trial that can inform the design of an adaptive treatment strategy (ATS) which formalizes an individualized treatment plan and where current treatment strategy can depend on a patient's past medical and treatment history. An optimal ATS is one that maximizes a specified health outcome of interest. Existing methods in analyzing SMART data are limited to intention-to-treat (ITT) analyses. That is the treatment effect at each stage is estimated based on the treatment group to which an individual was randomized at that stage regardless of whether the individual complied with their assigned treatment. One major concern is that the relationship between the experimental manipulation and the outcome may be confounded by treatment noncompliance. We develop methodologies that can be used to adjust for noncompliance in analyzing data collected in SMARTs. Specifically, we extend the principal strata framework and Bayesian Copulas to multi-stage randomized trials setting and propose novel procedures that estimate the mean outcome under different ATSs. We also propose a novel Bayesian machine learning approach that can be used to construct deeply tailored (i.e., individualized) treatment strategies that take into account patients' demographic factors, measures of mental health and alcohol use, obsessive-compulsive drinking and alcohol craving scales, physical composite scores. Finally, we will develop easy-to-use, publicly available open-source software leveraging the R and Python languages that implements our methods. This will provide an expandable platform that will assist researchers in developing new optimal ATSs for patients suffering from alcoholism and other substance use disorders. Narrative: This project aims to address the need for robust, rigorous and computationally efficient methods for analysis of sequential multiple assignment randomized trials (SMARTs) data in the presence of partial compliance. The methods developed in this project will improve the usefulness, interpretability and generalizability of the results obtained by SMARTs and help mental health and substance use disorder scientists to develop more potent adaptive treatment strategies to guide the individualization of mental health and substance use disorder treatments.","Analyzing Sequential, Multiple Assignment, Randomized Trials in the Presence of Partial Compliance",10017030,R01DA048764,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcoholism', 'Bayesian Method', 'Bayesian learning', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Cocaine', 'Cocaine Dependence', 'Code', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Demographic Factors', 'Dose', 'Educational workshop', 'Effectiveness', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Individual', 'Intention', 'Joints', 'Language', 'Lead', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Mental Health', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Naltrexone', 'Nature', 'Obsessive compulsive behavior', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Periodicity', 'Procedures', 'Pythons', 'Randomized', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research Personnel', 'Scheme', 'Scientist', 'Sequential Multiple Assignment Randomized Trial', 'Software Tools', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stratification', 'Structure', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Time', 'Treatment Effectiveness', 'alcohol abuse therapy', 'alcohol craving', 'arm', 'base', 'compliance behavior', 'design', 'dosage', 'drinking', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'interest', 'machine learning method', 'non-compliance', 'novel', 'open source', 'patient response', 'randomized trial', 'repository', 'response', 'statistics', 'symposium', 'therapy design', 'tool', 'treatment effect', 'treatment group', 'treatment planning', 'treatment response', 'treatment strategy', 'trial design', 'virtual']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF ROCHESTER,R01,2020,191907,0.09014412714951718
"Predicting Substance Use and Related Antisocial Behavior with Psychiatric, Socioeconomic, and Brain Measures in Women Offenders Project Summary/Abstract Substance use costs society $740 billion dollars each year, placing an enormous burden on our nationâs health care and criminal justice systems. Approximately 85% of incarcerated offenders in the United States have a history of substance use and/or are imprisoned for crimes involving or motivated by alcohol and/or drug use. Incarcerated individuals tend to show poorer outcomes following substance use treatment, and forced abstinence via imprisonment is associated with risk for future substance use, which likely contributes to substance-related antisocial behavior following imprisonment. Over the past few decades, women have been sentenced to prison for drug-related reasons at alarming rates, with a growth rate exceeding that for men. Further, women offenders tend to be impacted more heavily by substance use with co-morbid psychopathology, placing greater demands on the system in terms of substance use and mental health treatments. Using the worldâs largest forensic neuroimaging database on women offenders (SWANC-F), this proposal investigates substance use and related antisocial behavior following release from prison in a large sample of women offenders, with a focus on neurobiological mechanisms, to demonstrate the utility of brain measures in estimating long-term substance use outcomes in at-risk women. Substance-related antisocial behavior, defined as committing crime(s) related to substance use after release from prison, will be obtained from re-arrest data in institutional files and comprehensive background checks on all women enrolled in the study. A random sample (n = 100) will then be followed-up with via phone to gather data on substance use and obtain supplemental information to corroborate re-arrest data from files and background checks. Employing regression analyses and machine learning/pattern classifier approaches, models will be compared testing effects of psychiatric and socioeconomic variables, along with resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) brain measures, to examine unique and combined effects in differentiating among heterogeneous etiological mechanisms driving substance use outcomes of interest in women. Specifically, this proposal seeks to test the extent to which psychiatric and socioeconomic factors confer risk for substance-related antisocial behavior following release from prison in women (Aim 1), and integrates and compares the utility of rsFC brain measures in improving these prediction models (Aim 2). Then, similar methods will be applied to test the prediction of substance use following release from prison (Aim 3). It is expected that psychiatric risk factors and socioeconomic protective factors, as well as rsFC brain measures, will be useful in predicting substance use and related antisocial behavior following incarceration, along with time elapsed between release from prison and initiation of substance use and related behavior. Testing factors that aid in predicting these behaviors in women has the potential to be far-reaching by informing the development of targeted treatments, including those that help to account for sex differences and co-morbid conditions related to substance use. Project Narrative Women represent one of the fastest growing segments of substance users in the United States, with a growth rate of substance-related offending exceeding that of men; however, women continue to be one of the most underserved populations in substance use research. This proposal will compare statistical models testing effects of psychiatric and socioeconomic factors, along with resting-state functional connectivity in and between cognitive control, decision-making, and reward-processing neural circuitry, to examine unique and combined effects in differentiating among heterogeneous etiological mechanisms driving substance use outcomes in women. The primary goal of this proposal is to examine the utility of brain measures in estimating long-term substance use outcomes in at-risk women in an effort to help inform future treatment efforts.","Predicting Substance Use and Related Antisocial Behavior with Psychiatric, Socioeconomic, and Brain Measures in Women Offenders",10001326,F31DA047048,"['Abstinence', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Anterior', 'Anxiety', 'Automobile Driving', 'Behavior', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Crime', 'Criminal Justice', 'Data', 'Data Files', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Drug usage', 'Economics', 'Education', 'Employment', 'Enrollment', 'Etiology', 'Fibrinogen', 'Forensic Medicine', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Healthcare', 'Image', 'Imprisonment', 'Individual', 'Insula of Reil', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Logistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Marital Status', 'Measures', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Moods', 'Odds Ratio', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Personality', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Play', 'Predictive Factor', 'Prisons', 'Psychopathology', 'Recording of previous events', 'Regression Analysis', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Sex Differences', 'Societies', 'Socioeconomic Factors', 'Statistical Models', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technology', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Underserved Population', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Woman', 'Work', 'anti social', 'antisocial behavior', 'anxiety symptoms', 'base', 'cognitive control', 'comorbidity', 'cost', 'data structure', 'design', 'feature selection', 'flexibility', 'follow-up', 'hazard', 'improved', 'interest', 'machine learning algorithm', 'men', 'neural circuit', 'neurobiological mechanism', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'offender', 'outcome prediction', 'pediatric trauma', 'predictive modeling', 'protective factors', 'psychopathic personality', 'reward processing', 'social', 'socioeconomics', 'structured data', 'support vector machine']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF NEW MEXICO,F31,2020,36051,0.1847522652711971
"4/4: Leveraging EHR-linked biobanks for deep phenotyping, polygenic risk score modeling, and outcomes analysis in psychiatric disorders PROJECT ABSTRACT Major depressive disorder (MDD), anxiety disorders, and substance use disorders (SUDs) are common, complex psychiatric traits that frequently co-occur and are associated with significant functional impairment, increased healthcare utilization and cost, and higher mortality risk. Not only are these three conditions highly prevalent in the general population and generate a huge societal burden, but recent studies by our team and others have shown that shared covariance from common genetic variation significantly contributes to these psychiatric comorbidities. Large data sets are needed to understand how the multifaceted interplay of genetics, including polygenic risk scores (PRSs), and social determinants of health, such as employment and educational attainment, can impact the risk of these psychiatric disorders and clinical outcomes, such as multiple psychiatric hospitalizations. PRSs have shown potential for risk prediction, but the clinical utility of PRSs for psychiatric conditions is just starting to be explored. Research utilizing Electronic Health Records (EHRs) offers the promise of large data sets to examine these relationships in cohorts of patients seen in clinical practice. However, the use of EHRs is in its infancy in the study of psychiatric disorders and their treatment. This study will address critical knowledge gaps in âgenotype-psychiatric phenotypeâ relationships in large, demographically and geographically diverse population-based samples derived from EHR-linked biobanks across four medical centers - Columbia, Cornell, Mayo Clinic and Mount Sinai. Our objectives are to (1) develop improved methods for EHR phenotyping of MDD, anxiety, and SUDs, and related outcomes based on a data-set of >30 million EHRs, (2) evaluate associations between PRSs and these conditions, and (3) assess the association between PRSs and outcomes including treatment resistance in MDD and healthcare utilization in patients with MDD, anxiety and SUD. The PRS analyses will utilize data from biobanks with >50,000 persons with both EHR and GWAS data. Successful completion of this study will substantially advance our understanding of the clinical utility of PRSs for commonly occurring psychiatric disorders.

The team has a PI with expertise in computational science and the development and implementation of innovative statistical algorithms to understand multidimensional data; a PI with extensive experience in systems, imaging and addiction neuroscience; and a co-I who has expertise in the genetics of SUDs. Our previous R01 project employed a sample of ~12,000 individuals aggregated from multiple genetic studies of alcohol and drug dependence to generate SUD subtypes based on clinical symptoms. Because clinical manifestations are distal endpoints in the biological pathway, the genetic effects identified are often weak and inconsistent, and consequently difficult to detect even in large samples. As championed by the NIMH Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) research, the etiologies of psychiatric disorders, including SUDs, can be fruitfully characterized by dimensional neural features. This project thus extends our ongoing work to include imaging neural features in the classification of SUDs. Specifically, we will utilize a large database from the UK Biobank Project that provides both genetic and multi-modality magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data. Building on our work with the US Human Connectome Project, we aim in the current project to integrate clinical, imaging, and genotype data to investigate the neurobiological substrates of SUD diagnostic labels, and to derive SUD subtypes that are optimized for gene finding. Methodologically, we replace the classic statistical analysis that is confirmatory and biased to an a priori hypothesis by an approach that emphasizes pattern discoveries from big data. Our specific aims are to: (I): identify neuroimaging features that represent robust markers of addiction and differentiate SUD subtypes that can be confirmed by multi-modality evidence; (II) employ a novel brain connectivity model, on the basis of graph convolutional neural networks, to identify neural markers that precisely characterize the differences in structural changes and functional circuits related to SUDs; and (III) derive an innovative machine learning model to identify highly heritable neurobiological subtypes of SUDs that facilitate investigation of the genetic basis of addiction. We will focus on alcohol and nicotine use disorders to demonstrate the conceptual and methodological approaches. We believe that, by providing a productive conceptual and methodological platform to integrate imaging and genetic data to understand the etiologies of SUDs, this research is highly responsive to the RFA âLeveraging Big Data Science to Elucidate the Neural Mechanisms of Addiction and SUD.â The machine learning tools developed for this project will provide an innovative and reliable foundation to enhance the aggregation and analysis of multidimensional data, and to meet the diagnostic and predictive challenges in mental health research. PROJECT NARRATIVE We will develop novel statistical and quantitative tools to identify and differentiate subtypes of alcohol and nicotine use disorders by combining neural markers, genotype data, and clinical diagnostic information. The proposed analytics will be tested in a large database of alcohol and nicotine use disorders from the UK Biobank project. The proposed approaches will advance precision medicine by refining disease classification and facilitating gene finding for addictive and other mental disorders.",Multi-level statistical classification of substance use disorder,10056455,R01DA051922,"['Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohol dependence', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain region', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Collaborations', 'Computational Science', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Distal', 'Drug Addiction', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Etiology', 'Exhibits', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Markers', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic study', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Heritability', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision (ICD-10)', 'Investigation', 'Label', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurosciences', 'Nicotine Use Disorder', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Process', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Rewards', 'Sampling', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Statistical Algorithm', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Variant', 'Work', 'addiction', 'base', 'big-data science', 'biobank', 'clinical diagnostics', 'cocaine use', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'connectome', 'convolutional neural network', 'data structure', 'disease classification', 'disorder subtype', 'endophenotype', 'executive function', 'experience', 'falls', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'gray matter', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging genetics', 'imaging modality', 'individual variation', 'innovation', 'multidimensional data', 'multimodal data', 'multimodality', 'network models', 'neural correlate', 'neurogenetics', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'novel', 'precision medicine', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'risk variant', 'statistical and machine learning', 'structured data', 'tool', 'trait', 'treatment response', 'whole genome']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF CONNECTICUT STORRS,R01,2020,465370,0.016187672002364602
"Technology-supported, measurement-based supervision for Motivational Interviewing Millions of Americans receive evidence-based counseling for substance use problems each year. Many  evidence-based treatments for substance abuse are âtalk basedâ therapies, such as motivational  interviewing (MI), but the existing research-based methodology for evaluating counseling quality is  to record sessions and use human rating teams to evaluate them. However, using humans as the  assessment tool via behavioral coding is prohibitive in cost and time, can be error prone, and is  virtually never used in the real world. Technology is needed that can analyze the speech patterns and spoken language of counseling  sessions, provide automatic and intuitive quality scores, and summarize these in actionable  feedback. Rapid, performance-based quality metrics could support training, ongoing supervision, and  quality assurance for millions of evidence-based counseling sessions for substance abuse each year. Lyssn.io is a start-up targeting the development of implementation-focused technology to support  evidence-based counseling.  Our goal is to develop innovative health technology solutions that are  objective, scalable, and cost efficient. Lyssn.io includes expertise in speech signal processing,  machine learning, user-centered design, software engineering, and clinical expertise in evidence-based counseling.  Previous NIH-funded research laid a computational foundation for generating MI quality metrics from  speech and language features in MI sessions, and led to a prototype of a clinical software support  tool, the Counselor Observer Ratings Expert for MI (CORE-MI). The current Fast-Track SBIR proposal includes Phase I, which will focus on understanding clinical  workflows, assessing usability, and initial validation of machine learning of MI fidelity measures  in the opioid treatment program at Evergreen Treatment Services (ETS) clinic in Seattle, WA. Phase  II will focus on robust validation of the speech and language technologies underlying the CORE-MI  tool, and development of scalable supervision protocols that integrate CORE-MI supported feedback  for counselors. Finally, we will conduct a quasi-experimental evaluation of CORE-MI supported  supervision and training at a second ETS clinic in the Puget Sound, focusing on acceptability,  usability, and adoption, the impact on supervision, improved MI fidelity and preliminary evidence  of increased client retention.  The successful execution of this project will break the reliance on  human judgment for providing performance-based feedback to MI and will massively expand the  capacity to train, supervise, and provide quality assurance in MI for substance abuse. Most evidence-based treatments for substance abuse are in-person psychotherapy and counseling  interventions, such as motivational interviewing. There are currently no methods for evaluating the  quality of such counseling interventions in the real world to support training, supervision, and  quality assurance. Building on an existing prototype, Lyssn.io â a technology start-up focused on  scalable and cost-efficient human-centered technologies â will enhance and evaluate a cloud-based, HIPAA-compliant clinical support software tool that uses automated speech recognition and machine learning in an community  based opioid replacement clinic.","Technology-supported, measurement-based supervision for Motivational Interviewing",9930480,R44DA046243,"['Administrator', 'Adoption', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'American', 'Assessment tool', 'Behavioral', 'Client', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Counseling', 'Development', 'Evaluation', 'Evidence based treatment', 'Feedback', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act', 'Health Personnel', 'Health Technology', 'Human', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Intuition', 'Judgment', 'Language', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Opioid', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Primary Health Care', 'Professional counselor', 'Protocols documentation', 'Provider', 'Psychotherapy', 'Research', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Software Engineering', 'Software Tools', 'Speech', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Supervision', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Support', 'Transcript', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'automated speech recognition', 'base', 'cloud based', 'commercialization', 'cost', 'cost efficient', 'design', 'evidence base', 'improved', 'innovation', 'motivational enhancement therapy', 'opioid treatment program', 'primary care setting', 'prototype', 'quality assurance', 'signal processing', 'sound', 'substance abuse treatment', 'support tools', 'technology validation', 'tool development', 'treatment services', 'usability', 'user centered design', 'virtual']",NIDA,"LYSSN.IO, INC.",R44,2020,134649,0.00956140776346447
"The Ohio Valley Node of the Clinical Trials Network Project Summary (Abstract): Since its establishment in 2000, the Ohio Valley Node (OVN) has been one of the most productive of NIDA's Clinical Trials Network (CTN) nodes, both in leading and participating in multi-site trials. The OVN includes successful partnerships with four healthcare systems, two pharmacy networks, and six addiction specialty/ infectious disease programs. These collaborating sites span a seven-state region including some of the states most heavily impacted by opioid (Ohio, Kentucky, and West Virginia) and methamphetamine (Missouri, Kentucky, and North Dakota) use. The OVN includes Midwestern, Appalachian, Upper South, and Native American representation, which significantly enhances the geographical and cultural diversity of the CTN. The OVN Research Core is the driving force of the OVN and is led by Dr. Winhusen, one of the foremost experts in conducting multi-site addiction clinical trials in clinical practice settings. The OVN investigators have extensive expertise in substance use disorders (Winhusen, Brown, Burlew, Lyons, Montgomery, Lofwall, Walsh) and bioinformatics (Kaelber, Xu). The six members of the OVN research-implementation team bring > 60 years of combined experience conducting CTN clinical trials. If funded, our overall goal would be to utilize the wealth of experience and expertise gained over the past 19 years to conduct the research needed to address public health care crises, including the opioid use epidemic and the alarming increase in stimulant use. To this end, we would work with our healthcare partners to engage a diverse set of patients and service systems in areas highly impacted by substance use in CTN research. We would also contribute our expertise in conducting efficacy, effectiveness, and implementation trials testing the full range of interventions, from medications to behavioral interventions and health service innovations, for both opioid and stimulant use disorders. Moreover, we would contribute our expertise in the use of electronic health records for prospective and retrospective research studies, including the application of artificial intelligence to large healthcare datasets. In sum, we seek to continue providing scientific leadership, particularly on studies that could meaningfully impact clinical practice, and to effectively collaborate with a variety of professionals including treatment providers, investigators from diverse institutions, and staff of the Center for CTN (CCTN), clinical coordinating center (CCC) and data and statistics center (DSC) in support of the CTN mission.

"Classifying addictions using machine learning analysis of multidimensional data ABSTRACT This Independent Scientist Award will significantly enhance my research capabilities, enabling me to become a leading quantitative investigator in the field of substance use disorders (SUDs). Specifically, it will allow me to increase my knowledge in the areas of SUD phenotypes, treatment and genetics. SUDs are clinically and etiologically heterogeneous and their classification has been difficult. This application reflects my ongoing commitment to developing an innovative and interdisciplinary research program on the classification of SUDs through quantitative analysis of multidimensional data. My extensive training in computational science and prior research on biomedical informatics have provided me with the skills to design, implement and evaluate advanced algorithms and sophisticated analyses to solve challenging problems in classifying SUDs. My ongoing NIDA-funded R01 employs a large (n=~12,000) sample aggregated from multiple genetic studies of cocaine, opioid, and alcohol dependence to develop and evaluate novel statistical models to generate clinical SUD subtypes that are optimized for gene finding. This K02 proposal extends that work to evaluate treatment outcome in refined subgroups of SUD populations using data from treatment studies for cocaine, opioid, alcohol and multiple substance dependence. This project will integrate data from diagnostic behavioral variables and genotypes, as well as biological/neurobiological features of the disorders and repeated measures of treatment outcome. The primary career development goals of this application are to: (1) understand the reliability, validity and functional mechanisms of various phenotyping methods; (2) to continue training in the genetics of addictions; and (3) to gain greater knowledge of different treatment approaches and their efficacy. A solid foundation in these areas will enhance my ability to realize the full potential of the data collected and aggregated from multiple dimensions, and to use the data to design the most clinically useful analysis and generate innovative solutions to diagnostic and predictive challenges in SUD research. Through formal coursework, directed readings, individual tutoring and intensive multidisciplinary collaboration with a diverse team of world-renowned researchers, I will receive training and collect pilot data for future R01 projects by examining (Aim I): whether clinically-defined highly heritable subtypes derived in my current R01 project predict differential treatment response; (Aim II) whether new statistical models that directly combine treatment data with behavioral, biological, and genomic data identify refined subtypes with confirmatory multilevel evidence; and (Aim III) whether there are genetic and social moderators of treatment outcome by subtype. The overall goal of this proposal is to further my independent and multidisciplinary research program in the development of statistical methods for refined classification of SUDs. The K02 award will provide me with the protected time necessary to fully engage in the training activities described that will enhance my knowledge and skills to enable me to make important, novel contributions to the genetics and treatment of SUD. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project will develop novel statistical and quantitative tools to identify homogeneous subtypes of substance use disorders (SUDs) and other complex diseases to enhance gene finding and treatment matching. The proposed project will perform secondary analyses of existing data from treatment studies of cocaine, opioid, alcohol, and mixed SUDs. The proposed novel approaches are expected to advance precision medicine approaches to SUDs by enabling treatment matching and a more refined SUD classification to gene finding.",Classifying addictions using machine learning analysis of multidimensional data,9851853,K02DA043063,"['Adherence', 'Aftercare', 'Alcohol dependence', 'Alcohols', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biosensor', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Cocaine', 'Cocaine Dependence', 'Collaborations', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Complex', 'Computational Science', 'DSM-IV', 'DSM-V', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Drug Use Disorder', 'Electroencephalography', 'Etiology', 'Foundations', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Markers', 'Genetic study', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Heritability', 'Heterogeneity', 'Independent Scientist Award', 'Individual', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Investigation', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'Neurobiology', 'Opiate Addiction', 'Opioid', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmacogenetics', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Reading', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Solid', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Subgroup', 'Substance Addiction', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Treatment outcome', 'Work', 'addiction', 'alcohol use disorder', 'biomarker performance', 'biomedical informatics', 'career development', 'cocaine use', 'contingency management', 'design', 'disease classification', 'disorder subtype', 'endophenotype', 'genetic association', 'genomic data', 'imaging genetics', 'improved', 'innovation', 'multidimensional data', 'neural correlate', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'opioid use disorder', 'outcome prediction', 'personalized medicine', 'precision medicine', 'programs', 'recruit', 'secondary analysis', 'skills', 'social', 'tool', 'treatment planning', 'treatment response', 'tutoring']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF CONNECTICUT STORRS,K02,2020,161422,0.07416387016693718
"DAT- Implementing routine screening for cannabis and other drug use disorders in primary care: impact on diagnosis and treatment in a randomized pragmatic trial in 22 clinics PROJECT SUMMARY DAT18-06 The personal, social, and public health burdens of substance use disorders (SUDs) in the United States have been compounded by the opioid epidemic and legalization of recreational and medical cannabis use. Traditionally, healthcare systems have referred patients with SUDs to specialists. Although SUD treatment is associated with improved outcomes, most people with SUDs remain unidentified and untreated. The magnitude of unmet need has led experts to recommend incorporating screening and assessment for SUDs into routine primary care (PC), to increase rates of diagnosis and treatment of SUDs. Despite extensive observational research, to our knowledge no randomized controlled trial has evaluated the impact of PC-based programs of screening and assessment on new SUD treatment. The proposed study takes advantage of a unique and fortuitous opportunity to evaluate the impact of a PC program of screening and assessment for SUDs on new diagnosis and treatment of SUDs. The Sustained Patient-centered Alcohol Related Care (SPARC) trial, completed in July 2018, was a rigorously-designed randomized implementation trial testing a multifaceted approach to improving care for unhealthy alcohol use. However, at the request of clinical leaders at Kaiser Permanente Washington (KPWA) where the SPARC program was implemented, routine screening and assessment for opioid, cannabis, and other drug use disorders (CUD, OUD, and DUD, respectively) were added before the trial was launched in 22 KPWA PC clinics. As a result, the SPARC trial's implementation programâconsisting of practice coaching, electronic health record (EHR) support, performance monitoring and feedback, and provider trainingâalso targeted SUDs. Data from health system monitoring reports indicate the trial achieved high, sustained rates of screening for SUDs, exceeding the target of 80% of patients with PC visits. However, the SPARC trial was only funded to evaluate alcohol-related outcomes. The proposed study will rigorously evaluate the SPARC program's impact on the clinically meaningful primary outcome of new SUD treatment within 90 days of a primary care visit (Aim 1). To illuminate potential continued gaps in the quality of SUD care (Aim 2), we will use natural language processing (NLP) to extract and quantify reasons why: 1) patients reporting â¥4 DSM-5 symptoms of SUDs do not receive formal coded diagnoses of OUD, CUD, or DUD, and 2) why patients with newly diagnosed OUDs, CUDs, and DUDs do not received treatment. Most people with OUDs, CUDs, and other DUDs are never treated. An estimated 2.5-3.9% of US adults have past-year SUDs, and nearly 90% report no SUD treatment. Yet >84% of US adults have outpatient visits annually, and over half of these visits are in PC. If the proposed innovative study demonstrates that screening and assessment in PC increase SUD treatment, it would provide support for a widely endorsed yet previously untested approach to addressing a critically important gap in the quality of care for SUDs. PROJECT NARRATIVE Drug use disorders associated with unhealthy opioid, cannabis, and other drug use are major public health concerns but most people with these disorders remain untreated. Experts recommend systematic screening and assessment in primary care as a way to improve SUD treatment, but the effectiveness of such programs is unknown. This study rigorously evaluates such a program through an opportunity created when screening and assessment for drug use disorders were unexpectedly added to a randomized, stepped wedge, 22-clinic trial originally planned to focus exclusively on alcohol use disorders.",DAT- Implementing routine screening for cannabis and other drug use disorders in primary care: impact on diagnosis and treatment in a randomized pragmatic trial in 22 clinics,9884229,R01DA047312,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Alcohols', 'Cannabis', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'DSM-IV', 'DSM-V', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Documentation', 'Drug Screening', 'Drug Use Disorder', 'Drug usage', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Feedback', 'Funding', 'Health system', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Individual', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'International Classification of Disease Codes', 'Knowledge', 'Legal', 'Medical', 'Medical Marijuana', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Observational Study', 'Opioid', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Preventive screening', 'Primary Health Care', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Quality of Care', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Risk', 'Shame', 'Site', 'Specialist', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Effectiveness', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States', 'Visit', 'Washington', 'addiction', 'alcohol misuse', 'alcohol use disorder', 'base', 'brief intervention', 'care providers', 'design', 'disability', 'health data', 'high risk', 'implementation strategy', 'implementation trial', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'insurance claims', 'marijuana use', 'neglect', 'opioid epidemic', 'opioid use', 'patient oriented', 'pragmatic trial', 'primary outcome', 'programs', 'routine screening', 'screening', 'screening guidelines', 'screening program', 'social', 'social stigma', 'therapy design']",NIDA,KAISER FOUNDATION RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2020,323000,0.02983494699405501
"Optimal dynamic treatment strategies for controlling alcohol use: novel methods for selecting and incorporating effect modifiers Project Summary: The cyclical and heterogeneous nature of many substance use disorders highlights the need to adapt the type or the dose of treatment to accommodate the specific and changing needs of individuals. This proposal is motivated by the Extending Treatment Effectiveness of Naltrexone (ExTENd) trial, a sequential multiple assignment randomized trial (SMART) designed to find a (personalized) rescue treatment for those who are non-responsive to initial Naltrexone. One of the main challenges in this trial is the presence of the many variables available for consideration when making treatment decisions at each stage of the trial. This feature has made it virtually impossible for investigators to fully explore the possibility of building high quality treatment strategies using the data. Our overarching aim is to address this particular challenge through developing and subsequently applying new statistical methods to the ExTENd trial data. A SMART trial is a multi-stage trial that can inform the design of a dynamic treatment regime (DTR) which formalizes an individualized treatment plan and where current treatment strategy can depend on a patient's past medical and treatment history. An optimal DTR is one that maximizes a specified health outcome of interest. Q-learning can be used with data from both SMARTs and observational studies to estimate an optimal DTR. However, like other model-based approaches, model misspecification can seriously affect the results and lead to the identification of suboptimal DTRs. The potential for misspecification increases with the number of variables that may influence treatment decisions through, e.g., incorrect assumptions on the relationship of variables to the outcome and the inclusion (exclusion) of unimportant (important) variables. These features represent the main analytical challenges for the ExTENd trial. We propose a new approach to Q-learning that leverages machine learning approaches to reduce the chances of misspecifying the relationship between the expected outcome and a given set of variables. We also develop a variable selection technique specifically designed for Q-learning that enables investigators to select the important variables from a long list of possibilities (e.g., genetic and demographic information, medical history over time) when estimating an optimal DTR. In both settings, we will develop new methods for conducting valid inferences (e.g., confidence intervals and p-values), including when there exist patients for whom treatment is neither beneficial nor harmful at a given decision stage (i.e., when an important technical assumption, âuniquenessâ, is violated). Finally, we will develop easy-to-use, publicly available software in the R language that implements our methods. This will allow re-analysis of the ExTENd trial data with a goal of constructing a DTR that improves upon the current rescue treatment strategy for those non-responsive to initial Naltrexone. It will also provide an expandable platform that will assist researchers in developing new optimal DTRs for patients suffering from alcoholism and other substance use disorders. Narrative: This project aims to address the need for robust, rigorous and computationally efficient methods for estimating the optimal treatment regime in substance use disorder. We will develop a variable selection technique that enables investigators to select important variables for the decision- making process among a long list of variables (e.g., patientâs genetic information, demographic characteristics, and medical history over time). We will also leverage statistical machine learning approaches to improve the quality of the constructed optimal treatment regimes while providing valid statistical inference.",Optimal dynamic treatment strategies for controlling alcohol use: novel methods for selecting and incorporating effect modifiers,9953933,R21AA027571,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohol dependence', 'Alcoholism', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Characteristics', 'Code', 'Computer software', 'Confidence Intervals', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Dose', 'Exclusion', 'Fibrinogen', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Individual', 'Language', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Medical', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Medical History', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Naltrexone', 'Nature', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Periodicity', 'Phenotype', 'Process', 'Prognostic Factor', 'Randomized', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Sequential Multiple Assignment Randomized Trial', 'Software Tools', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Statistical Methods', 'Subgroup', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Treatment Effectiveness', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Work', 'alcohol use disorder', 'base', 'care providers', 'clinical care', 'clinical decision-making', 'design', 'dosage', 'expectation', 'falls', 'genetic information', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'interest', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'open source', 'optimal treatments', 'overtreatment', 'personalized medicine', 'repository', 'response', 'statistical and machine learning', 'treatment planning', 'treatment strategy', 'trial design', 'virtual']",NIAAA,UNIVERSITY OF ROCHESTER,R21,2020,185591,0.06940955052798725
"Using Administrative and Clinical Data to Detect Drug Use and HIV Risk in Foster Care USING ADMINISTRATIVE AND CLINICAL DATA TO DETECT DRUG USE AND HIV RISK IN FOSTER CARE Project Summary  The candidate's goal is to develop an independent research career as a developmental psychologist focused on identifying mechanisms to prevent the onset of pervasive and detrimental health risk behaviors, including substance abuse and HIV risk behaviors, among adolescents and young adults involved in foster care. She has experience in examining psychosocial and behavioral processes during this period of development and a strong publication record for the current phase in her career. Her previous training has emphasized development during adolescence and the transition to adulthood and health behaviors during this timeframe. In the K01, she proposes to expand her training to become an expert leader in team science approaches to address substance use and HIV risk behaviors during adolescence and the transition to adulthood, specifically focusing on foster youth, using child welfare administrative data and electronic medical records (EMR). Her training will emphasize: 1) development as an independent researcher and leader in interdisciplinary approaches to addressing health and development among foster youth, 2) substantive training in child maltreatment, substance use, and HIV risk behaviors, and 3) the use of machine learning to distinguish youth at risk, with the end goal of identifying opportunities for prevention. This will be accomplished through seminars and journal clubs offered at Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center (CCHMC), attending regional and national conferences and trainings on substantive topics, and completion of coursework in child maltreatment and machine learning. Finally, she will complete coursework and seminars addressing the ethical conduct of research. Dr. Beal's goal is to submit an R01, as PI, during the third year of this grant.  CCHMC, one of the top three pediatric research hospitals in the nation, is committed to Dr. Beal's career development. The research environment at CCHMC and within the Division of Behavioral Medicine and Clinical Psychology, and the mentors and collaborators identified in this proposal, are well-suited to Dr. Beal's interests and research goals. Dr. Beal will be co-mentored by Dr. Jennie Noll and Dr. Robert Ammerman. Dr. Noll has extensive experience as a researcher examining the impact of child maltreatment on adolescent development, particularly around sexual risk behaviors. Dr. Ammerman is a well-established researcher with expertise in prevention and intervention programs for high-risk populations. Her advisory committee includes Dr. Melissa Jonson-Reid, an internationally recognized researcher in child welfare and the use of administrative records, Dr. John Schulenberg, developmental psychologist and authority in adolescent and young adult substance use, Dr. Jessica Kahn, expert in adolescent medicine and sexual and HIV risk behaviors, and Dr. John Pestian, leader in machine learning and its application to clinical care. These individuals have made a commitment to mentor and guide Dr. Beal in research and career development.  The objective of this research program is to fill a gap in our current understanding of which adolescents in foster care are at greatest risk for substance use and HIV while simultaneously providing a means for establishing Dr. Beal's independence as a researcher. There are two aims of this proposal. Aim 1 uses discrete time survival analyses and linked child welfare and EMR data to examine the onset and prevalence of substance use and HIV risk behaviors for youth ages 10-20 in foster care compared to matched Medicaid-eligible youth not in foster care (Foster care n=2836; 1-to-1 matched comparison from ~9585 primary care patients). Findings will provide estimates of the rates of substance use and HIV risk behaviors across ages 10-20 and when they increase/decrease, which is critical for identifying the ideal time to begin prevention and intervention efforts. Aim 2 will draw on causal inference techniques and machine learning to identify youth who are substance using or at substantial risk for developing HIV prior to age 21 based on two categories of risk factors: 1 â those common in adolescence, including parental substance use and mental health diagnoses; and 2 â risk factors unique to foster care, including extended time in foster care and placement instability. Analyses will be conducted using structural equation modeling to identify predictors of substance use and HIV risk behaviors. Machine learning will be used to develop classifiers that distinguish youth likely to use substances and contract HIV. This approach will, for the first time, provide a means to identify youth at risk for these negative health outcomes before youth experience these consequences. Via this approach, clinicians and front-line workers will be able to easily distinguish youth at risk and dedicate more time to prevention efforts. The proposed program of training and research will provide a clear pathway for Dr. Beal to transition as an independent researcher. This unique program of research merges her expertise in developmental science and health during adolescence and the transition to adulthood with research in child maltreatment, substance use, and HIV risk behaviors to support interdisciplinary, innovative team science approaches to prevent poor health outcomes among foster youth. The proposed studies in this application are significant because the findings take a developmental perspective to provide clinically useful information about which youth are at risk for poor health outcomes. Such an approach is innovative and will transform prevention delivery efforts for vulnerable foster youth. PROJECT NARRATIVE (PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE) Teens in foster care are at increased risk for substance abuse and contracting HIV compared to their peers, in addition to experiencing poor education, work, and psychosocial outcomes; leveraging administrative child welfare data linked to electronic medical records data for foster youth affords the opportunity to examine key factors that contribute to risk. The goal if this application is to identify youth at risk for substance abuse and HIV, with an eye toward designing intervention and prevention efforts that front-line workers and providers can enact for foster youth prior to age 18 to increase the likelihood that substance abuse and HIV in adulthood can be prevented. The concepts learned through this grant, as well as the career development pursued by the investigator, will be readily applicable to foster youth in child welfare and healthcare settings and could lead to innovations previously unachieved with this challenging and vulnerable adolescent population.",Using Administrative and Clinical Data to Detect Drug Use and HIV Risk in Foster Care,9851871,K01DA041620,"['21 year old', 'Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adolescent Development', 'Adolescent Medicine', 'Adolescent Risk Behavior', 'Adolescent and Young Adult', 'Adoption', 'Adult', 'Advisory Committees', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Algorithms', 'Bees', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Medicine', 'Caring', 'Categories', 'Child Abuse and Neglect', 'Child Welfare', 'Child health care', 'Chronic', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Psychology', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Contracts', 'County', 'Dangerousness', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Drug usage', 'Education', 'Environment', 'Equation', 'Ethics', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Eye', 'Family', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'HIV', 'HIV Infections', 'HIV risk', 'Health', 'Health behavior', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Investments', 'Journals', 'Justice', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Medicaid', 'Medicaid services', 'Medical center', 'Melissa', 'Mental Health', 'Mental Health Services', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Occupations', 'Ohio', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Pediatric Research', 'Phase', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Pregnancy', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Prevention program', 'Preventive', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Primary Health Care', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Psychologist', 'Publications', 'Race', 'Recording of previous events', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Behaviors', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Schools', 'Science', 'Services', 'Sexually Transmitted Diseases', 'Signal Transduction', 'Solid', 'Structure', 'Substance Addiction', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Survival Analysis', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Teenagers', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Translating', 'Voluntary Programs', 'Work', 'Youth', 'adolescent health', 'authority', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'caregiving', 'clinical care', 'discrete time', 'experience', 'falls', 'foster care', 'health care settings', 'high risk population', 'indicated prevention', 'innovation', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'interest', 'intervention program', 'maltreatment', 'peer', 'prevent', 'programs', 'psychosocial', 'public health relevance', 'reproductive', 'research and development', 'sexual risk behavior', 'statistics', 'substance abuse treatment', 'success', 'symposium', 'therapy design', 'volunteer', 'vulnerable adolescent']",NIDA,CINCINNATI CHILDRENS HOSP MED CTR,K01,2020,165510,0.03097573462856159
"Real-time Assessment of Dialogue in Motivational Interviewing training (ReadMI) Project Summary/Abstract  Substance misuse is inconsistently addressed in routine medical practice. Primary care physicians frequently fail to diagnose substance abuse when presented with early symptoms of alcohol or drug use. Patients report that less than one-third of primary care physicians carefully screen them for substance abuse, in spite of available and effective screening protocols. Screening, Brief Intervention, and Referral to Treatment (SBIRT) is an integrated, evidence-based approach aimed at delivering early intervention for drug and alcohol misuse in medical settings and has been demonstrated to reduce substance misuse. Motivational Interviewing (MI), an underlying component of SBIRT, is an evidence-based, brief interventional approach that has been demonstrated to be highly effective in triggering change in high-risk lifestyle behaviors. Unfortunately, the MI approach is very difficult to teach to practitioners as it is counterintuitive to most providers who commonly take a directive approach with patients. Because of ineffective training, MI and SBIRT are under-utilized.  The primary goal of this project is to transform MI and SBIRT training with a software-based training solution that analyzes practitioner responses and gives immediate feedback to improve MI skills. Our team has been developing and testing a training tool that uses natural language processing (NLP) to provide Real-time Assessment of Dialogue in Motivational Interviewing (ReadMI). ReadMI is a low cost, ultra-portable solution for accurate and automatic real-time assessment of dialog during the course of MI training. It makes use of the latest advances in deep-learning-based speech recognition and mobile and cloud computing technologies to enable instantaneous MI training assessment and analysis. Currently functioning with 92% accuracy, ReadMI provides immediate feedback to MI and SBIRT trainees regarding the number of open- and closed-ended questions asked, provider-vs-patient conversation time, and other integral components of MI.  ReadMI will advance the skill development of physicians and other healthcare professionals in their use of MI and SBIRT, minimizing the need for time-consuming reviews of recorded training sessions. Our aims are: 1) develop ReadMI to provide MI training metrics with 95% accuracy and 2) test ReadMI in a randomized controlled trial (RCT) with 200 medical students and residents, 100 who will receive SBIRT/MI training with ReadMI and 100 who will serve as the control group, receiving customary SBIRT/MI training.  The prospective applications of ReadMI extend far beyond substance use disorder (SUD) prevention, detection, and intervention. The effectiveness of all chronic disease management is largely dependent on patient behavior. MI is a patient-focused conversation between the provider and the patient that reinforces the patient's motivation to make positive changes in health-related behavior. By making efficient MI training available to more health professionals, ReadMI will improve healthcare quality as providers are better equipped in their efforts to help patients make healthy lifestyle changes. Project Narrative Motivational Interviewing (MI) is an evidence-based approach that has been demonstrated to be highly effective in triggering change in high-risk lifestyle behaviors, including substance misuse. However, MI and a specific application of MI to substance misuse known as SBIRT (Screening, Brief Intervention, and Referral to Treatment) are underutilized because of inadequate training of health professionals. This research aims to revolutionize MI and SBIRT training with a software-based training solution that uses natural language processing to provide Real-time Assessment of Dialogue in Motivational Interviewing (ReadMI).",Real-time Assessment of Dialogue in Motivational Interviewing training (ReadMI),9980343,R21HS026548,[' '],AHRQ,WRIGHT STATE UNIVERSITY,R21,2020,118134,0.08391338565983965
"Northeast Node of the National Drug Abuse Clinical Trials Network Project Summary/Abstract  This proposal is a competing renewal application of the Northeast Node of the National Drug Abuse Treatment Clinical Trials Network (CTN), which joined the CTN in 2015. The Northeast Node brought hundreds of community and healthcare partners across the states of New Hampshire, Vermont, and Maine to the CTN community for the first time. These states have among the very highest rates of substance use in the U.S., including opioid use, and they include some of the most rural communities in the U.S. The Node has brought significant expertise to the CTN in conducting practical, rigorous, innovative, and highly impactful trials focused on improving the treatment of substance use disorders (SUDs) in community systems in the Northeast and in partnership with other CTN Nodes across the nation. Node Investigators have extensive experience in leading national and multi-national clinical trials, digital technology; medication and behavioral treatments for opioid use disorder; co-occurring SUDs and mental health disorders; SUD and chronic pain; SUD in pregnant women; opioid, cannabis, tobacco, alcohol, stimulant, and polydrug treatment; SUD prevention and treatment among youth; and implementation science. The Northeast Node is embedded within the Center for Technology and Behavioral Health (CTBH), a NIDA-funded P30 âCenter of Excellenceâ. The Node thus brings significant expertise in developing, evaluating, and implementing digital treatments for SUDs, with a focus on overcoming the striking disparities in treatment access and treatment quality evident in healthcare across the globe.  In the renewal period, the Node proposes to enhance its activities and contributions to the national CTN to embrace advances in scientific discovery and research innovations that offer great promise for increasing the reach and effectiveness of treatments for SUDs. The Node will engage a broader group of investigators that bring additional expertise in data science (bioinformatics, predictive modeling, artificial intelligence, social media, data privacy/security) and experimental design (micro-randomized trials, adaptive designs, and implementation/systems science). With this expanded group of partners, it will support and grow a productive research agenda in the CTN with a focus on (a) digital health and data analytics, including research focused on providing personalized, science-based resources to individuals with SUD via digital technology and (b) expanding low threshold access to science-based SUD care, particularly in rural contexts (e.g., general medical settings; pharmacies; and community organizations). And the Node will lead an expansion of CTN research on the (c) rapidly evolving landscape of cannabis use as well as (d) co-morbid SUD and mental health disorders. The Node will establish Community and Policy Advisory Boards to complement the existing communication infrastructure between Node investigators and their partners, with a focus on identifying the most significant and timely SUD needs in our communities and scaling-up and sustaining best practices. Project Narrative The proposed activities of the Northeast Node of the National Drug Abuse Treatment Clinical Trials Network (CTN) embrace advances in scientific discovery and research innovations that offer great promise for increasing the reach and effectiveness of treatments for substance use disorders (SUD).

"Technology-supported, measurement-based supervision for Motivational Interviewing Millions of Americans receive evidence-based counseling for substance use problems each year. Many evidence-based treatments for substance abuse are âtalk basedâ therapies, such as motivational interviewing (MI), but the existing research-based methodology for evaluating counseling quality is to record sessions and use human rating teams to evaluate them. However, using humans as the assessment tool via behavioral coding is prohibitive in cost and time, can be error prone, and is virtually never used in the real world. Technology is needed that can analyze the speech patterns and spoken language of counseling sessions, provide automatic and intuitive quality scores, and summarize these in actionable feedback. Rapid, performance-based quality metrics could support training, ongoing supervision, and quality assurance for millions of evidence-based counseling sessions for substance abuse each year. Lyssn.io is a start-up targeting the development of implementation-focused technology to support evidence-based counseling. Our goal is to develop innovative health technology solutions that are objective, scalable, and cost efficient. Lyssn.io includes expertise in speech signal processing, machine learning, user-centered design, software engineering, and clinical expertise in evidence-based counseling. Previous NIH-funded research laid a computational foundation for generating MI quality metrics from speech and language features in MI sessions, and led to a prototype of a clinical software support tool, the Counselor Observer Ratings Expert for MI (CORE-MI). The current Fast-Track SBIR proposal includes Phase I, which will focus on understanding clinical workflows, assessing usability, and initial validation of machine learning of MI fidelity measures in the opioid treatment program at Evergreen Treatment Services (ETS) clinic in Seattle, WA. Phase II will focus on robust validation of the speech and language technologies underlying the CORE-MI tool, and development of scalable supervision protocols that integrate CORE-MI supported feedback for counselors. Finally, we will conduct a quasi-experimental evaluation of CORE-MI supported supervision and training at a second ETS clinic in the Puget Sound, focusing on acceptability, usability, and adoption, the impact on supervision, improved MI fidelity and preliminary evidence of increased client retention. The successful execution of this project will break the reliance on human judgment for providing performance-based feedback to MI and will massively expand the capacity to train, supervise, and provide quality assurance in MI for substance abuse. Most evidence-based treatments for substance abuse are in-person psychotherapy and counseling interventions, such as motivational interviewing. There are currently no methods for evaluating the quality of such counseling interventions in the real world to support training, supervision, and quality assurance. Building on an existing prototype, Lyssn.io â a technology start-up focused on scalable and cost-efficient human-centered technologies â will enhance and evaluate a cloud-based, HIPAA-compliant clinical support software tool that uses automated speech recognition and machine learning in an community based opioid replacement clinic.","Technology-supported, measurement-based supervision for Motivational Interviewing",9847959,R44DA046243,"['Adherence', 'Administrator', 'Adoption', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Assessment tool', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Benchmarking', 'Client', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Consumption', 'Counseling', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'E-learning', 'Enhancement Technology', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Evidence based treatment', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Feedback', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act', 'Health Technology', 'Human', 'Intervention', 'Intuition', 'Judgment', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'Needs Assessment', 'Online Systems', 'Opioid', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Process', 'Professional counselor', 'Protocols documentation', 'Provider', 'Psychology', 'Psychotherapy', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Site', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Software Engineering', 'Software Tools', 'Speech', 'Stream', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Suicide', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Support', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Update', 'Utah', 'Validation', 'Work', 'addiction', 'automated speech recognition', 'automobile accident', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'cloud based', 'community setting', 'cost', 'cost efficient', 'dashboard', 'design', 'encryption', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'gun homicide', 'implementation research', 'improved', 'innovation', 'motivational enhancement therapy', 'novel', 'opioid abuse', 'opioid treatment program', 'overdose death', 'prediction algorithm', 'protocol development', 'prototype', 'quality assurance', 'research and development', 'signal processing', 'skills', 'sound', 'speech processing', 'substance abuse treatment', 'support tools', 'technological innovation', 'tool', 'tool development', 'treatment services', 'usability', 'user centered design', 'virtual', 'visual feedback']",NIDA,"LYSSN.IO, INC.",R44,2020,394059,0.00956140776346447

"MISSION U: A MULTIMEDIA TRAINING TOOL FOR TREATING INDIVIDUALS WITH CO-OCCURRING MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS Co-occurring mental health and substance use disorders (COD) are common in the United States and providers have been challenged to provide effective treatments. As a consequence, their clients with COD may experience poor treatment engagement, symptom exacerbation and cycle in and out of emergency services. This is particularly true for underrepresented populations with a COD including individuals whom are homeless and involved in the criminally justice system. Research shows that integrated and coordinated community- based services for COD can improve client outcomes. However, healthcare workforce has a gap in training staff on such treatment techniques, which we aim to close via this Phase II STTR project.  Maintaining Independence and Sobriety through Systems Integration, Outreach and Networking (MISSION) is a unique evidence-based, trans-disciplinary treatment designed to address the complex needs of individuals with CODs and includes manuals for high risk populations of civilian and veteran homeless individuals as well as those involved in the criminally justice system. Listed in the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Service Administration-Registry for Evidence Based Practices (NREPP), MISSION has had substantial impact. The Veterans Health Administration has deployed it in their national plan to end Veteran Homelessness. Massachusetts has used it in its Statewide Plan to End Homelessness and written it into Public Law for delivery alongside Veterans Treatment courts. While MISSION is a manualized treatment, a recent multisite implementation study identified the need for more comprehensive training tools. With NIAAA support, the University of Massachusetts Medical School (MISSION developers) partnered with Praxis on a Phase I STTR to (1) develop the MISSION University online training platform, (2) show proof of concept by implementing two training modules and an e-simulation case study, and (3) conduct a pilot randomized trial which demonstrated that training-as-usual Distance Learning (DL) + Technical Assistance (TA) outperformed TA alone.  In Phase II, we will complete MISSION U by developing and testing five new MISSION modules and companion e-simulations tools that test knowledge acquisition and application. We will first do a formative evaluation with 20 learners who will provide feedback on MISSION U modules. This will be followed by a randomized controlled trial similar to Phase I in which 60 learners will be randomized to the DL or the DL+TA conditions. In preparation for future scalability, we will uniquely conduct a qualitative process evaluation using the Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, Maintenance framework with 42 MISSION U participants to look at facilitators and barriers to implementation.

"Telemedicine for Treatment of Opioid Use Disorder PROJECT SUMMARY: A key challenge in combating the opioid epidemic has been connecting individuals with opioid use disorder to evidence-based treatments. The President's Commission on Combating Drug Addiction and the Opioid Crisis and others have suggested that telemedicine for substance use disorder (âtele- SUDâ) may be part of the solution. In preliminary analyses, we have found that tele-SUD use is growing rapidly, and there is widespread policy interest in Congress and state legislatures in how to accelerate this growth. The SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act, signed into law in October 2018, includes several provisions intended to reduce barriers to tele-SUD use and will likely increase the availability of and reimbursement for tele-SUD. However, despite the widespread interest and growing use, there has never been a rigorous assessment of tele-SUD. For example, what are the different tele-SUD models being used to treat opioid use disorder, what barriers exist to greater use of tele-SUD, and is tele-SUD use associated with improved (or potentially worse) quality of care for people with opioid use disorder? To fill this knowledge gap, we propose a comprehensive national evaluation of telemedicine for opioid use disorder using data through 2021 from Medicaid, Medicare, and commercial insurance as well as a series of qualitative interviews. Our Aims are to: (1) describe the different models of how tele-SUD is being incorporated into opioid use disorder care and how this is changing over time, (2) identify regional factors associated with greater tele-SUD use for opioid use disorder, (3) examine the association between tele-SUD use and quality of opioid use disorder care received and whether this varies by model, and (4) describe existing tele-SUD programs, and identify barriers and facilitators to tele-SUD adoption and sustainability. The proposed mixed-methods study will help providers interested in using tele-SUD and inform ongoing debates about regulations and reimbursement for tele-SUD in Congress and state legislatures. Our goal is to highlight policies and practices that drive greater use of tele-SUD and explore its potential role in improving access to, and quality of, care for individuals with opioid use disorder. Our research will help inform how tele- SUD may be leveraged to combat the opioid epidemic as well as other substance use disorders, such as alcohol and methamphetamine use disorders.

"Virtual Reality Tools to Enhance Evidence Based Treatment of Substance Use Disorders (R41/R42 - Clinical Trial Optional) R&R Other Project Information 7. Project Summary/Abstract Neurobiological changes caused by addiction impair behavioral control and increase relapse risk (Volkow, Koob, & McLellan, 2016), substantiating the need for long-term care coordination and recovery engagement for individuals with Substance Use Disorders (SUD) (Humphreys, Malenka, Knutson, & MacCoun, 2017). Because addiction creates stress and reward system dysregulation impairing emotional regulation and executive functioning capacities when experiencing intense craving (Volkow, Koob & McLellan, 2016), traditional didactic relapse prevention strategies may have limited efficacy for those in early recovery when they transition back to their natural communitiesâ post-discharge from treatment, where they will be exposed to SUD-related stimuli. New recovery support models that detect implicit cue-induced neurophysiological dysregulation and restore real-time regulatory capacity to decrease relapse risk are of clinical significance. âThis feasibility Phase I study will use Virtual Reality (VR) technology to 1) simulate a patient-specific drug cue-triggering experience (VR_drug) to calibrate a personalized neurophysiological relapse risk set-point, captured in-session using fNIRS (âFunctional Near-Infrared Spectroscopyâ) sensors, a portable alternative to fMRI which will be integrated into the VR HMD (Head Mounted Display),â and physiological sensors (smartwatch Empatica E4) worn during the VR_drug scenario â(Aim 1); âand 2) simulate a recovery-regulation experience (VR_recovery) using patient-specific virtually-generated sober-supportive relationships, recovery-enhanced environmental conditions, and recovery-associated sensory cues, to calibrate a recovery-regulated neurophysiological set-point, captured by the same in-session neurophysiological sensors systems â(Aim 2)â. If successful, in Phase II, a mobile recovery support system product will be developed to help individuals in SUD recovery modulate real-time craving by monitoring their personalized neurophysiological relapse risk and activating their recovery-regulation intervention (VR_recovery) to alter urge reactivity in real-time. This type of mobile intervention that is immediately available to individuals in recovery as they leave treatment institutions and transition back into their natural communities may help manage in-the-moment drug urges in ways that allow engagement in other recovery-related activities (e.g., calling a sponsor, getting to a meeting), decreasing real-time relapse risk (Matto,& Seshaiyer, 2018; Matto, 2015; Matto, et al, 2014). R&R Other Project Information 8. Project Narrative Addiction is a self-regulation disorder where chronic exposure to and compulsive consumption of the drug creates dysregulation in the reward, stress and executive functioning regions of the brain, intensifying emotional reactivity and impairing cognitive and behavioral control (Volkow, Koob, & McLellan, 2016). This study seeks to examine the utility of using Virtual Reality (VR) simulations to calibrate person-specific neurophysiological relapse-risk and recovery regulation set-points. Results may lead to the development of a non-pharmacological mobile recovery support system to help individuals in SUD recovery manage implicit craving reactivity in ways that reduce relapse risk.",Virtual Reality Tools to Enhance Evidence Based Treatment of Substance Use Disorders (R41/R42 - Clinical Trial Optional),9898050,R41DA050225,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Back', 'Behavior Control', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Chronic', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cocaine', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Conscious', 'Consumption', 'Cues', 'DSM-V', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Drug Addiction', 'Emotional', 'Euphoria', 'Evidence based treatment', 'Exposure to', 'Feedback', 'Feeds', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Informal Social Control', 'Institution', 'Intelligence', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Lead', 'Long-Term Care', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motivation', 'Near-Infrared Spectroscopy', 'Neurobiology', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Prevention strategy', 'Protocols documentation', 'Recovery', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sensory', 'Stimulus', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Support System', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'addiction', 'base', 'behavioral impairment', 'care coordination', 'clinically significant', 'cognitive control', 'conditioning', 'craving', 'cue reactivity', 'disorder later incidence prevention', 'emotion regulation', 'executive function', 'experience', 'head mounted display', 'implicit memory', 'meetings', 'neurophysiology', 'phase 1 study', 'portability', 'profiles in patients', 'prototype', 'relapse risk', 'response', 'sensor', 'simulation', 'smart watch', 'sobriety', 'tool', 'virtual', 'virtual reality', 'virtual reality simulation']",NIDA,"BRIGHTLINE INTERACTIVE, LLC",R41,2020,218097,0.033187223581143885
"Missing Data Matters: Substance Use Disorder Clinical Trials Program Director/Principal Investigator (Last, First, Middle): Scharfstein, Daniel, Oscar Project Summary/Abstract Missing outcome data threaten the validity of randomized clinical trials because inference about treatment effects then necessarily relies on untestable assumptions, which wrongly stated can lead to incorrect conclusions. While it is widely recognized that evaluating the sensitivity of trial results to assumptions about the missing data mech- anism should be a mandatory component of reporting, rigorous sensitivity analyses are not routinely reported. Likely explanations include inadequate knowledge translation by statistical methodologists to both principal in- vestigators and their statistical collaborators as well as lack of software. Substance use disorder clinical trials are known to suffer from high rates of missing data. Unlike regulatory trials where missing data are primarily the result of premature study withdrawal, individuals in substance use disorder trials tend to intermittently skip their scheduled outcome assessments. This produces an explosion of ânon-monotoneâ missing data patterns that makes sensitivity analysis methodologically and computationally chal- lenging. There has been relatively little research on sensitivity analysis procedures for analyzing such data and the procedures that have been developed are anchored to assumptions that are problematic. Thus, investigators are faced with challenging analytic barriers and the conclusions they draw from their trials may be ï¬awed. In this three-year proposal, we will reanalyze 29 clinical trials conducted by NIDA's Clinical Trials Network (CTN), and made publicly available on NIDA's DataShare website, to evaluate their robustness to missing data assump- tions through rigorous sensitivity analysis. Since adequate tools for conducting sensitivity analysis of studies with highly non-monotone missing data patterns do not yet exist, we plan to develop, implement and dissemi- nate (through journal articles, short courses and webinars) an innovative sensitivity analysis methodology and open-source, user-friendly software to evaluate the robustness, to missing data assumptions, of trials in which binary outcomes (e.g., substance use) are scheduled to be repeatedly collected at ï¬xed points in time after ran- domization and participants intermittently skip their scheduled assessments. Our tool will be developed by an interdisciplinary team of biostatisticians and substance use disorder treatment experts, with input from an advi- sory board comprised of highly regarded statistical experts and leading scientists in the substance use disorder community. Through reanalysis of the NIDA's CTN trials using our tool, we will be better able to understand the impact of missing data assumptions on the evaluation of the studied interventions. Additionally, demonstrat- ing the importance and utility of our tool to our advisory board and to the substance use disorder community more broadly stands to increase the likelihood of adoption. Finally, the development, testing, and dissemination of this innovative statistical tool can serve as a template for other scientiï¬c domains, making âstress-testingâ to untestable missing data assumptions a more routine component of scientiï¬c reporting. Program Director/Principal Investigator (Last, First, Middle): Scharfstein, Daniel, Oscar Project Narrative We will develop, implement and disseminate an innovative sensitivity analysis methodology and open-source, user-friendly software tool to evaluate the robustness to missing data assumptions of clinical trials in which binary outcomes are collected at ï¬xed points over time but where participants intermittently miss their scheduled assess- ments, as frequently occurs in addiction research. We will utilize this tool to reanalyze data from 29 substance abuse clinical trials conducted by NIDA's Clinical Trials Network and available publicly on NIDA's DataShare web- site. As a result, we will be better able to understand the impact of missing data assumptions on the evaluation of the studied interventions and, by demonstrating the importance and utility of our tool to an advisory board comprised of study investigators and to the substance use disorder community more broadly, we aim to make âstress-testingâ to untestable missing data assumptions a more routine part of scientiï¬c reporting.",Missing Data Matters: Substance Use Disorder Clinical Trials,9923614,R01DA046534,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Case Study', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Network', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Conduct Clinical Trials', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation Studies', 'Explosion', 'Future', 'Goals', 'HIV', 'HIV risk', 'Health', 'Health system', 'Individual', 'Intervention Studies', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Movement', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Assessment', 'Outcome Measure', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Principal Investigator', 'Procedures', 'Property', 'Publishing', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk Behaviors', 'Schedule', 'Scientist', 'Software Tools', 'Source', 'Stress Tests', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Uncertainty', 'Urine', 'Withdrawal', 'Work', 'addiction', 'base', 'clinical trial analysis', 'data sharing', 'flexibility', 'innovation', 'interest', 'journal article', 'knowledge translation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'novel', 'open data', 'open source', 'premature', 'prevent', 'programs', 'secondary analysis', 'simulation', 'software development', 'study characteristics', 'tool', 'treatment effect', 'user friendly software', 'user-friendly', 'web site', 'webinar']",NIDA,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,100287,0.14381931533215023
"ABCD-USA Consortium: Data Analysis, Informatics and Resource Center Project Summary/Abstract In its initial funding period, the ABCD consortium used a rigorous epidemiological approach to recruit a diverse sample of 11,878 9-10-year-olds through our 21 research sites, of which 2136 are twins or triplets. ABCD has created a comprehensive yet efficient protocol for participating youth and parents, using standardized and state-of-the-art methods for neuroimaging, biospecimens, and assessments of substance use, mental and physical health, neurocognition, culture, and environment, using a fully digital platform and making use of mobile technologies. We ensure cohesion and standardization by having employed a recruitment strategy designed by a professional survey company (experience with Monitoring the Future); standardized environmental, neurocognitive and mental health assessments, MRI assessments with all scanners using harmonized Human Connectome Project procedures, and computerized data collection with real-time quality control. Developmentally tailored assessments will have stable sensitivity and construct validity across the childhood and adolescent developmental period. They minimize participant burden, yet capture even subtle changes over time in substance use, mental health, neurocognition, development, and environment, and we employ novel state-of-the-art bioassays and passive data collection from mobile devices. A detailed retention plan builds on the experience and success of our investigators. This application describes the ABCD Data Analysis, Informatics and Resource Center (DAIRC), which will: maintain and update the harmonized MRI acquisition protocol, compatible with all major scanner platforms, taking advantage of recent technological advances in structural and functional MRI; perform rigorous quality control and quantitative calibration procedures to ensure accuracy and comparability of derived imaging measures across scanners and across time; implement advanced computational analysis workflows for all imaging data; implement reliable data entry, quality control, and monitoring tools for the substance use questionnaire, neurocognitive assessments, bioassay- derived measures, and mobile technologies assessment data; implement the state-of-the-art statistical analysis tools and procedures needed to integrate information across measures and modalities; continue development of infrastructure and procedures for public sharing of raw and derived data and associated tools and computational workflows; and enable interactive data exploration and analytics through a web-based Portal. PROJECT NARRATIVE The ABCD Consortium will use multimodal brain imaging, cognitive and clinical assessments, bioassays, mobile monitoring, and careful assessment of substance use, environment, psychopathological symptoms, and social functioning in 11,878 adolescents followed over 10 years to determine the effects of substance use on adolescent brain and cognitive development. Our ABCD Data Analysis, Informatics and Resource Center (DAIRC) will maintain and update harmonized MRI protocols across sites and scanners, perform quality control of raw and derived data, and implement the informatics and computational infrastructure needed for the overall project.","ABCD-USA Consortium: Data Analysis, Informatics and Resource Center",9981957,U24DA041123,"['10 year old', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Affect', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Alcohols', 'Athletic Injuries', 'Biological Assay', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Caffeine', 'Calibration', 'Childhood', 'Clinical assessments', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Collection', 'Development', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Emotional', 'Enrollment', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genetic study', 'Guidelines', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Information Dissemination', 'Infrastructure', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Marijuana', 'Measures', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurocognition', 'Neurocognitive', 'Nicotine', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Physical activity', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quality Control', 'Questionnaires', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Severities', 'Site', 'Sleep', 'Social Functioning', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'Technology Assessment', 'Time', 'Triplet Multiple Birth', 'Twin Multiple Birth', 'Update', 'Youth', 'cognitive development', 'cognitive testing', 'cohesion', 'cohort', 'computer infrastructure', 'computerized', 'connectome', 'data archive', 'data dissemination', 'data exploration', 'data quality', 'data resource', 'data sharing', 'design', 'digital', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'gene interaction', 'handheld mobile device', 'health assessment', 'high standard', 'improved', 'informatics infrastructure', 'infrastructure development', 'mobile computing', 'multidimensional data', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'open data', 'physical conditioning', 'recruit', 'retention rate', 'success', 'tool', 'tv watching', 'web portal']",NIDA,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",U24,2020,1020000,0.13438477100644478
