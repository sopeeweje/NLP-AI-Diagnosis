"Data-driven subtyping to find patients with drug interactions leading to stroke Project Summary Stroke is a highly heterogeneous and complex disease and is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Identification of the cause of disease is essential for risk stratification and optimal treatment, but can be difficult, as up to 35% of causes are undetermined by traditional subtyping criteria and very few causative genetic variants have been found. In addition, certain causes may be hidden within the clinical picture of a patient, such as an adverse drug reaction. Using data-driven approaches to analyze the medical records of patients may uncover novel patterns of risk factors and clinical features leading to stroke. The long-term goal of this research is to identify novel subtypes of highly heterogeneous diseases such as stroke and to reduce the genetic heterogeneity of a disease cohort by identifying patients with the same subtype. The objective of this application is to propose a pipeline that applies a data-driven analysis of medical notes to identify novel subtypes of stroke, focus on a subtype caused by an adverse drug reaction or drug pair interaction, validate the subtype in a genotyped study cohort, and look for gene variant enrichment in this cohort. This application’s central hypothesis is that applying deep learning to the electronic health record (EHR) of acute ischemic stroke patients will form subtypes based on more granular information than currently implemented and with reduced genetic heterogeneity by identifying novel patterns of risk factors and clinical picture leading to the stroke. In addition, we hypothesize that at least one subtype will identify patients whose stroke is an adverse drug reaction or drug-drug interaction. To do this, Aim 1 will first identify all acute ischemic stroke patients in the EHR by developing a machine learning classifier trained on structured data in the EHR. Aim 2 will then build and train an unsupervised deep learning algorithm on text from medical notes to identify clusters, or subtypes, of patients with similar clinical pictures. Aim 3 will finally validate reduction in genetic heterogeneity of these cohorts by estimating observational heritability of all subtypes using a tool created in our lab and comparing this with the heritability estimates of subtypes derived from physician-based criteria. It will also focus on a not well-studied subtype, stroke due to an adverse drug reaction or drug-drug interaction, by identifying its enrichment in the novel subtypes, validating this subtype in a study cohort with genotyped data, and finally looking for enrichment of pharmacogenetic variants in this subtype. These aims will generate a computational pipeline that identifies novel subtypes of acute ischemic stroke, enabling improved future genetic studies by reducing genetic heterogeneity of cohorts and improved understanding of the underlying causes of the disease. Project Narrative Stroke is a highly complex disease that is a leading cause of death and severe disability. Identifying the cause of stroke is essential for risk stratification and optimal treatment, but up to a third of cases are of undetermined cause, and very few genetic variants have been identified due to the heterogeneity of the disease. To address this, this research proposal develops a computational pipeline that applies data-driven deep learning to medical notes to identify novel combinations of environmental, genetic, and medical risk factors causing the disease; this tool may clarify the etiology of unknown stroke cases, provide cohorts of patients enriched with similar genetic variants, and be expanded to subtype any disease.",Data-driven subtyping to find patients with drug interactions leading to stroke,9772123,F30HL140946,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Blood flow', 'Brain', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Categories', 'Cause of Death', 'Cerebrovascular Disorders', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Cohort Studies', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Disease', 'Drug Interactions', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Etiology', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Heterogeneity', 'Genetic study', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Hemorrhage', 'Heritability', 'Internet', 'Ischemic Stroke', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Medical', 'Medical Records', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Nervous System Physiology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacogenetics', 'Physicians', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Proposals', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk stratification', 'Semantics', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Training', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'acute stroke', 'adverse drug reaction', 'automated analysis', 'base', 'case control', 'cohort', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'disability', 'disease diagnosis', 'disease heterogeneity', 'experience', 'falls', 'genetic risk factor', 'genetic variant', 'improved', 'learning algorithm', 'learning strategy', 'mortality', 'novel', 'optimal treatments', 'patient population', 'patient subsets', 'population based', 'random forest', 'stroke patient', 'stroke recovery', 'supervised learning', 'tool', 'unsupervised learning']",NHLBI,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,F30,2019,50016,0.14963983100186376
"A Machine Learning Approach to Classifying Time Since Stroke using Medical Imaging PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Stroke is a leading cause of mortality and morbidity in the United States, with approximately 795,000 Americans experiencing a new or recurrent stroke each year. Intravenous tissue plasminogen activator (IV tPA) is the dominant and most proven treatment option, but its use is only indicated within 4.5 hours following a stroke. Unfortunately, up to 30% of stroke patients present with an unknown time since stroke (TSS) symptom onset, which makes them ineligible to receive IV tPA. Many of these individuals could be spared severe morbidity or mortality if there existed an alternative method for establishing TSS, allowing them to be identified and treated. This proposal will develop machine learning methods to create a physiologically grounded method for predicting TSS based on multiparametric magnetic resonance (MR) and computed tomography (CT) imaging data. We believe our proposed techniques will outperform state-of-the-art methods that are based on subjective image interpretation, and have the potential to provide an objective data point that may be used in conjunction with the subjective assessments of experts, or in clinical environments that lack expertise in stroke imaging Research has established that MR and CT imaging captures information that correlates with TSS. However, existing methods for extracting this information are based on a physician subjectively interpreting the images and delineating regions of interest, processes that have been documented to have only weak to moderate agreement across trained expert reviewers. An automated approach that comprehensively analyzes the spectrum of imaging data could identify complex relationships across channels that more accurately classify TSS. For example, in MR, diffusion-weighted, perfusion-weighted, and fluid attenuated inversion recovery imaging all play important roles in characterizing a stroke, but a deep understanding of how each channel may be combined to describe TSS is unknown. We propose to establish new deep learning methods for fusing this information. Specifically, we will: 1) develop a machine learning framework for classifying TSS; 2) develop a deep convolutional autoencoder to generate novel multimodal image representations from MR and CT to improve classification; and 3) implement visualization techniques that elucidate the relationship between deep features and pathophysiological stroke processes. Under this project, we will use data from the UCLA and UCI Stroke Centers, allowing us to study different patient populations and imaging techniques. The successful completion of this research will provide a new method for estimating TSS from imaging, leading to new prospective trials for providing therapy to patients with unknown TSS. PROJECT NARRATIVE Stroke is a leading cause of death in the United States, with approximately 795,000 Americans experiencing a new or recurrent stroke each year; however patients who present with an unknown stroke onset time are ineli- gible for receiving the leading therapy. The focus of this research is to develop a novel method for classifying stroke onset time from imaging, enabling treatment for a new cohort of patients and potentially saving them from severe morbidity or mortality.",A Machine Learning Approach to Classifying Time Since Stroke using Medical Imaging,9687756,R01NS100806,"['Adverse event', 'Affect', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Alteplase', 'American', 'Area', 'Attenuated', 'Blood flow', 'Brain', 'California', 'Cause of Death', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Eligibility Determination', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Hemorrhage', 'Hour', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imagery', 'Imaging Device', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Individual', 'Infarction', 'Intravenous', 'Learning', 'Liquid substance', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Maps', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Neurologist', 'Patient imaging', 'Patients', 'Perfusion', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Process', 'Publishing', 'Recovery', 'Recurrence', 'Reperfusion Therapy', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Savings', 'Secondary to', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Spectrum Analysis', 'Stroke', 'Techniques', 'Thrombolytic Therapy', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Visualization software', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'acute stroke', 'artery occlusion', 'autoencoder', 'base', 'clinical imaging', 'cohort', 'deep learning', 'diffusion weighted', 'experience', 'improved', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'mortality', 'multimodality', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'patient population', 'perfusion imaging', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'radiologist', 'spatiotemporal', 'spectrograph', 'stroke patient', 'stroke symptom', 'tool']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2019,450969,0.22585002596340353
"A Machine Learning Approach For CTA-based Plaque Characterization and Stroke Risk Prediction in Carotid Artery Atherosclerosis PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Carotid artery atherosclerosis is a major vascular risk factor and accounts for approximately 15% of all strokes. A major risk marker in patients with carotid atherosclerosis has been the degree of narrowing, or stenosis, of the carotid artery lumen. While stenosis is often quantified via angiography, imaging can also provide detailed assessments of plaque. Our project is motivated by converging data that correlate vulnerable plaque elements, which can be captured with imaging, with increased stroke risk. Identifying high-risk or vulnerable carotid plaques before a stroke occurs is important because stroke prevention treatments, like carotid endarterectomy or stenting, carry risks and ideally should only be performed only those patients at highest risk of stroke. CTA (computed tomographic angiography) is an attractive tool for plaque imaging since it is not operator dependent, can be quickly performed, and is more widely available than MRI. Although CTA offers significant potential to evaluate these plaque features, small studies have not reached a consensus regarding their reliability and clinical relevance. In this project, we plan to explore the utility of CTA for the detailed carotid vessel wall imaging by employing a unique, large-scale clinical dataset and advanced algorithms. Our overarching objective in this R21 project is to conduct developmental and interdisciplinary research that will lay the foundation for the implementation and validation of novel CTA-based technologies that can be adopted in the risk stratification of patients with carotid atherosclerosis. Our central hypothesis is that there are CTA-based carotid plaque features that can be reliably extracted and used for stroke risk stratification, which will be more sensitive and specific than standard stenosis grading. To pursue our objective, we will pursue two specific aims: In Specific Aim 1 we plan to optimize the use of human reader defined plaque features in predicting culprit carotid plaques. We will perform a blinded, multi-reader study of CTA-derived carotid plaque features in a large scale clinical dataset to test the association between CTA-derived human-defined features and stroke, and compute accuracy metrics. In Specific Aim 2, we plan to develop algorithms to automatically characterize and discriminate culprit carotid plaque in CTA. We will implement and test image processing algorithms that automatically compute from a CTA scan stroke-associated carotid artery plaque features (from Aim 1), and then train a machine learning algorithm to distinguish culprit from asymptomatic carotid artery plaques. We believe that this R21 study is significant because it will establish a novel, machine learning-aided imaging strategy which can aid in identifying high-risk carotid artery plaques before they cause stroke and when they can be properly treated to prevent stroke from occurring in the future. PROJECT NARRATIVE  The proposed research is relevant to public health because the discovery of novel and treatable vascular risk factors will ultimately improve risk factor screening and stroke prevention efforts, thereby reducing the incidence of a disabling and lethal disease. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to the part of the NHLBI's mission that involves reducing the burden of vascular disease by fostering research on prevention.",A Machine Learning Approach For CTA-based Plaque Characterization and Stroke Risk Prediction in Carotid Artery Atherosclerosis,9655181,R21HL145427,"['Adopted', 'Algorithms', 'Angiography', 'Arterial Fatty Streak', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Biological Markers', 'Blinded', 'Carotid Arteries', 'Carotid Artery Plaques', 'Carotid Atherosclerotic Disease', 'Carotid Endarterectomy', 'Carotid Stenosis', 'Carotid stent', 'Clinical', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Hand', 'Hemorrhage', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging Device', 'Incidence', 'Institution', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Ischemia', 'Ischemic Stroke', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Medicine', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Prevention', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Reader', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Registries', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk Marker', 'Risk stratification', 'Scanning', 'Statistical Models', 'Stenosis', 'Stroke', 'Stroke prevention', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Ulcer', 'Validation', 'Vascular Diseases', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'attenuation', 'base', 'calcification', 'cerebrovascular', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'convolutional neural network', 'high risk', 'image processing', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning algorithm', 'novel', 'patient stratification', 'predictive modeling', 'radiologist', 'screening', 'stroke risk', 'systematic review', 'tool', 'vascular risk factor']",NHLBI,WEILL MEDICAL COLL OF CORNELL UNIV,R21,2019,121619,0.19986107061218716
"Motor cortex network dynamics driving stroke recovery PROJECT SUMMARY Ischemic stroke is the most common cause of disability in US, with motor impairment being the most common form of disability. Rehabilitation therapies remain a mainstay treatment during recovery, but are not very effective for those with moderate to severe upper extremity weakness. Physical and pharmacologic interventions could become more effective if recovery mechanisms were better understood. The studies proposed here will use cutting-edge techniques to dissect the mechanisms of post-stroke recovery at the level of cortical neuronal networks. The principal investigator (PI) is a board-certified neurologist, and has extensive training in neuroscience, stroke neurobiology, and clinical management of patients with neurological diseases. The long- term goal is to understand relationships between the cortical neural network and the motor behaviors with a focus on motor recovery. The proposed research and career development plans will provide the necessary training, mentorship and experience to launch the PI’s career as a successful, R01-funded clinician-scientist. The PI has recently developed deep learning (a branch of machine learning) tools for automated and unbiased analysis of animal behavioral imaging data. Preliminary data demonstrate that, by using these automated tools, 3D kinematics of paw movements can be obtained during a food pellet reaching task in a head-fixed mouse, distinct neural activity patterns emerge in the primary motor cortex (M1) during motor learning of the skilled reaching, and stroke induces changes in the kinematics of the reaching behavior. In the proposed studies, the following specific hypotheses will be tested: stable neuronal network activity patterns emerge in M1 during motor learning (Aim-1); these M1 activity patterns destabilize after a stroke and sensorimotor disconnection (Aim-2); and new M1 activity patterns emerge after post-stroke task-specific rehabilitation (Aim-3). The PI will use, and be further trained on state-of-the-art techniques to record neural population activity (two-photon calcium imaging), to label and silence projection neurons (retro-AAVs and designer-receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs), and to analyze the kinematics of the behavior (deep learning tools). For this purpose, he has assembled a strong mentorship team with experts in their respective fields: Primary mentor Dr. Peyman Golshani (two-photon calcium imaging and analysis in behaving animals), as well as co-mentors, Dr. S. Thomas Carmichael (stroke recovery research), Dr. Jonathan Kao (neural dynamics analysis in motor cortex), and clinically, Dr. Bruce Dobkin (translational neurorehabilitation). The mentored research will be complemented with course work on state-space methods, biostatistics, bioethics, deep learning, responsible conduct of research, and grant writing; as well as improvement of professional skills by publishing manuscripts, presenting at meetings, and participating in workshops on leadership and management. By the end of K08 award, it is expected that the PI will obtain R01 funding as a clinician-scientist and independent investigator, focused on understanding mechanisms of the neural networks that can be modulated to improve motor behavior after stroke. PROJECT NARRATIVE Understanding the mechanisms of motor recovery will ultimately lead to better therapies for stroke recovery. In the proposed research, we aim to elucidate the motor recovery process by investigating the precise activity patterns of brain cells during skilled reaching movements that will be kinematically analyzed by novel automated tools. These brain-behavior correlations will generate fundamental knowledge about stroke recovery to inform new interventions that can reduce the burden of disability caused by stroke.",Motor cortex network dynamics driving stroke recovery,9762241,K08NS109315,"['3-Dimensional', 'Adult', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Automobile Driving', 'Award', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Bioethics', 'Biometry', 'Brain region', 'Calcium', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Complement', 'Control Groups', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Development Plans', 'Educational workshop', 'Food', 'Forelimb', 'Foundations', 'Functional Imaging', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Impairment', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Ischemic Stroke', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuscripts', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Motor', 'Motor Cortex', 'Movement', 'Mus', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurologist', 'Neurons', 'Neurorehabilitation', 'Neurosciences', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmacology', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Population Dynamics', 'Principal Investigator', 'Process', 'Publishing', 'Recovery', 'Recovery of Function', 'Rehabilitation Research', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Sensory', 'Somatosensory Cortex', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Upper Extremity', 'Work', 'Writing', 'brain behavior', 'brain cell', 'career', 'career development', 'convolutional neural network', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs', 'disability', 'disability burden', 'experience', 'functional restoration', 'imaging modality', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'joint mobilization', 'kinematics', 'meetings', 'motor impairment', 'motor learning', 'motor recovery', 'nervous system disorder', 'network dysfunction', 'neural circuit', 'neural network', 'neuromechanism', 'neuron loss', 'neuronal circuitry', 'novel', 'post stroke', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'research and development', 'responsible research conduct', 'sensory cortex', 'skills', 'stroke recovery', 'stroke rehabilitation', 'stroke therapy', 'tool', 'two-photon']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,K08,2019,213840,0.16222387597377155
"Quantitative Rehabilitation after Stroke PROJECT SUMMARY Stroke causes significant disability, and recovery is often incomplete. In animal models of stroke, robust upper extremity (UE) motor recovery can be elicited if high doses of functional training are given early. In humans, however, the optimal training dose is unknown, because no quantitative dose-response trials have been undertaken in the first months after stroke. This deficiency stems from a lack of measurement instruments that can accurately and easily quantify UE functional training dose and recovery. To address this gap, this proposal will generate two new measurement tools to enable quantitative stroke recovery research. The first tool (Aim 1) will quantify the number of functional movements made during stroke rehabilitation, measuring UE training dose. The second tool (Aim 2) will quantify the abnormality of movements, measuring UE recovery and response to interventions. We will combine wireless motion capture and computational methodologies to create objective, precise, and user-friendly tools. Inertial measurement units, worn by individuals with stroke and healthy controls performing various activities, will capture upper body motion. In Aim 1, machine learning algorithms will be trained to identify and count functional movements in activities normally practiced during rehabilitation. In Aim 2, functional principal components analysis will quantify movement impairment and compensation in standardized motions. Validity will be determined by correlating tool outcomes with current gold standards. The proposed study will be conducted at New York University, in collaboration with investigators from the NYU Center for Data Science, Columbia University, and Washington University-St. Louis. Each have complementary expertise in machine learning, functional data analysis, and functional movement identification. This K02 Independent Scientist Award will provide the candidate with skill in advanced motion capture and analytical methodologies needed to study stroke rehabilitation and recovery. The career development plan includes personalized tutorials and coursework combined with longitudinal oversight of data analysis, providing an excellent foundation for launching an independent research career. Ultimately, the developed tools have the potential to immediately impact neurorehabilitation research, facilitating the rigorous dose-response trials so critically needed to change clinical practice and improve stroke outcomes. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research is relevant to public health, because it will enable the precise and feasible measurement of rehabilitation and recovery after stroke. The generated measurement tools will facilitate important stroke recovery research, which is expected to inform stroke rehabilitation practices and reduce the burden of stroke disability.",Quantitative Rehabilitation after Stroke,9778912,K02NS104207,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Collaborations', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Science', 'Development Plans', 'Dose', 'Dyskinetic syndrome', 'Ensure', 'Felis catus', 'Financial compensation', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Independent Scientist Award', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Motion', 'Movement', 'Neurorehabilitation', 'New York', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Public Health', 'Radial', 'Recovery', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Speed', 'Standardization', 'Stroke', 'Survivors', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Upper Extremity', 'Washington', 'Wireless Technology', 'Work', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical practice', 'clinically relevant', 'disability', 'experience', 'improved', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'kinematics', 'machine learning algorithm', 'motor impairment', 'motor recovery', 'novel', 'post stroke', 'response', 'skills', 'stem', 'stroke model', 'stroke outcome', 'stroke patient', 'stroke recovery', 'stroke rehabilitation', 'tool', 'user-friendly', 'wearable device']",NINDS,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,K02,2019,220478,0.24810703481983223
"Noninvasive Real-time Estimation of Cerebral Blood Flow for Personalized Stroke Assessment PROJECT SUMMARY Stroke is the second leading cause of death and the third leading cause of disability worldwide. Similar trends exist in the U.S., where it is estimated that every 40 seconds a stroke occurs, leading to a stroke-related death every 4 minutes. Afflicting approximately 800,000 Americans each year, time sensitive and widely practicable diagnostic algorithms are paramount. Despite increasing emphasis on the significance of blood flow characteristics in pursuing strokes, estimating regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) inside the skull is no trivial task. Imaging techniques that provide rCBF distribution may be unavailable due to time constraint or access to facilities, or simply the expenses attached to it. In our preliminary studies, we have developed a model that can give blood flow estimates in real-time for the entire brain vasculature. Here, we propose a novel hybrid computational model that utilizes high-performance computing and machine learning to simulate the entire brain vasculature, as well as provide real time measures of regional CBF. We will use novel mathematical methods to determine the vascular geometry of each subject using our existing imaging database that includes CTA and CBF images from stroke patients, and will subsequently validate our simulations against the same dataset. Finally, we will use machine learning algorithms to extract patterns in stroke patients' blood flow and give estimates for stroke severity predictors on patient- specific measurements. PROJECT NARRATIVE The objective of this project is to estimate blood flow properties in the brain and its correlation with stroke. We will simulate and validate a model to give similar information as the expensive perfusion scanning measurements. Through Machine Learning algorithms, we will provide severity estimates for stroke patients for more informed clinical decisions and better patient care.",Noninvasive Real-time Estimation of Cerebral Blood Flow for Personalized Stroke Assessment,9746155,R03NS108167,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Adoption', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Angiography', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Blood Vessels', 'Blood flow', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Calibration', 'Cause of Death', 'Cerebrovascular Circulation', 'Cerebrovascular system', 'Cerebrum', 'Certification', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Ensure', 'Gaussian model', 'Geometry', 'High Performance Computing', 'Hybrids', 'Hypertension', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Infarction', 'Intuition', 'Ischemic Stroke', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical Imaging', 'Modeling', 'Partner in relationship', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Perfusion', 'Physiology', 'Process', 'Property', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Risk Estimate', 'Scanning', 'Severities', 'Stroke', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thrombus', 'Time', 'Tissue Viability', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'blood flow measurement', 'brain tissue', 'cerebral hemodynamics', 'clinical translation', 'cranium', 'disability', 'hemodynamics', 'imaging capabilities', 'improved', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mathematical methods', 'novel', 'parallel computer', 'perfusion imaging', 'simulation', 'stroke patient', 'tool', 'trend']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA,R03,2019,82032,0.20128040692814572
"Enabling Comparative Effectiveness Research in Silent Brain Infarction Through Natural Language Processing and Big Data It is a common clinical occurrence that neuroimaging scans obtained in the course of routine clinical care discover a prior brain infarction in patients with no history of stroke or transient ischemic attack. Indeed, epidemiologic studies indicate that silent brain infarctions (SBI) are far more common than strokes; MRI- defined SBI can be detected in ~20% of the healthy elderly. In these studies based on screened patients, the findings have been shown to be associated with subtle, typically unrecognized, deficits in physical and cognitive function. These imaging findings are also strong, independent risk factors for future stroke and dementia. Despite the very high prevalence of SBI in screened populations, and their serious consequences, little is known about the significance or the appropriate management of SBI when discovered incidentally in routine care. While there is strong evidence that antiplatelet therapy and statin therapy are effective in preventing recurrent stroke in patients with prior stroke, the degree to which these results apply to patients with SBI is unclear. Because patients with SBI define a population that falls in between primary and secondary stroke prevention, the approach to these patients is marked by uncertainty and practice variation, making it an ideal condition for observational comparative effectiveness research. Nonetheless, there are serious challenges for the study of SBI. As patients have no overt symptoms, recruitment into a trial can be problematic. Comparative effectiveness research on SBI, using routinely collected data and leveraging the variation in care of these patients, is impeded by the fact that there are no ICD codes for SBI, and it is generally not included in structured fields of electronic health records (EHR) as it is typically considered an incidental finding. In order to establish the comparative effectiveness of treatment strategies for SBI in a large, heterogeneous population, we propose to develop Natural Language Processing (NLP) algorithms to identify individuals with SBI through the automated review of neuroradiology reports. We have performed preliminary work to demonstrate that such an approach is feasible. We will then apply state-of-the-science observational comparative effectiveness methods in a massive database with linked EHR and claims data to examine the effectiveness of statins and antiplatelet agents in preventing future stroke and dementia. Thus, our aims are: Aim 1: We will develop NLP algorithms that can accurately identify cases of SBI and white matter disease (WMD) in two different health systems. Aim 2: We will port, refine, and validate the NLP algorithm in a large heterogeneous database including more than 600 hospitals and 6500 clinics and identify a large cohort of patients with routinely-discovered SBI and WMD. Aim 3: We will characterize the cohort with respect to age- specific prevalence of SBI, management patterns, and the risk of future stroke and dementia associated with SBI and WMD. Aim 4: We will estimate the comparative effectiveness of preventive therapies (statins and antiplatelet agents) on the risk of future stroke and dementia in patients with incidentally-discovered SBI. The goal of this project is to improve the evidence base for the prevention of stroke in patients with “silent brain infarct”—i.e., a stroke on neuroimaging (head CT or MRI) but no clinical evidence of a stroke. We will develop a computer-based algorithm using a technology known as natural language processing that can accurately identify cases of silent brain infarction among a large population of adults on whom neuroimages have been obtained, but who are without a history of clinically-evident cerebrovascular disease. We will estimate the comparative effectiveness of medications (statins and antiplatelet agents) on the risk of future stroke and dementia in patients with incidentally discovered and reported SBI.",Enabling Comparative Effectiveness Research in Silent Brain Infarction Through Natural Language Processing and Big Data,9726113,R01NS102233,"['Adult', 'Age', 'Age-Years', 'Algorithms', 'American Heart Association', 'American Stroke Association', 'Antiplatelet Drugs', 'Big Data', 'Blood Vessels', 'Brain', 'Brain Infarction', 'Caring', 'Cerebrovascular Disorders', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Effectiveness', 'Elderly', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Health Personnel', 'Health system', 'Healthcare Systems', 'High Prevalence', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Incidental Findings', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'International Classification of Disease Codes', 'Knowledge', 'Lesion', 'Link', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Medical center', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physical Function', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention approach', 'Prevention trial', 'Preventive therapy', 'Process', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recurrence', 'Reporting', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Scanning', 'Science', 'Stroke', 'Stroke prevention', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Technology', 'Transient Ischemic Attack', 'Translating', 'Uncertainty', 'Variant', 'White Matter Disease', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'case finding', 'clinical care', 'clinical practice', 'cognitive function', 'cohort', 'comparative effectiveness', 'effectiveness research', 'epidemiology study', 'evidence base', 'falls', 'improved', 'learning progression', 'member', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'patient population', 'patient screening', 'prevent', 'recruit', 'repository', 'routine care', 'screening', 'treatment strategy']",NINDS,TUFTS MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2019,531215,0.18765106373277018
"Big Data Neuroimaging to Predict Motor Behavior After Stroke PROJECT SUMMARY  Stroke is a leading cause of serious long-term adult disability around the world. Despite intensive therapy, an estimated 2/3 of stroke survivors do not fully recover and are left unable to care for themselves independently. Growing research suggests that rehabilitation is not “one-size-fits-all”; variability among stroke survivors in terms of lesion location, age, gender, time since stroke and more may all affect a person's likelihood of recovery and response to different types of treatments. Personalized rehabilitation medicine to maximize each individual's recovery potential is thus desperately needed. However, in order to develop accurate, robust, and specific predictive models that can determine an individual's recovery potential and response to different treatments, large, heterogeneous datasets are needed. The current best predictors of stroke outcomes are neuroimaging (MRI) and behavioral biomarkers that look at brain structure/function and motor performance at baseline. Generating a large enough dataset of MRI and behavioral data is extremely difficult and expensive for any one site to do on its own. This proposal addresses this problem by generating a large, diverse dataset using a novel meta-analytic approach that harmonizes post-stroke data collected worldwide. In partnership with an international consortium comprised of over 500 researchers who produce the largest-known neuroimaging and genetic studies of over 18 different diseases (ENIGMA Center for Worldwide Medicine, Imaging, and Genomics), I propose to apply ENIGMA's powerful approach to answer critical questions in stroke recovery. Under this K01 career development award, I will develop skills in big data neuroimaging analytics, clinical research, and consortium building through my ENIGMA Stroke Recovery working group in order to ask questions about stroke recovery using a large dataset approach (goal n>3,000). This project has four specific aims: Aim 1 will leverage ENIGMA's existing methodology to develop the infrastructure, optimal methods, and analysis techniques for harmonizing a large dataset of post-stroke MRI and behavioral data. Aim 2 will use this large dataset to identify neural and behavioral biomarkers predicting recovery of motor impairment (e.g., actual arm movement ability) and recovery of function (e.g., ability to perform tasks, such as picking up objects with the affected arm). Aim 3 will use supervised machine learning to generate and fine-tune highly accurate predictive models of the relationship between these biomarkers and recovery of impairment versus function. Lastly, Aim 4 will use unsupervised machine learning techniques to examine shared properties of outliers from the predictive model and determine additional neurobiological mechanisms that may prevent individuals from recovering. This approach has the potential to revolutionize the way that rehabilitation research is validated, to ensure robust, reliable, and reproducible results. The methods developed here could be extended to other domains of recovery (language, gait), to study other predictors of recovery (functional brain activity, genomics), and to other clinical populations to improve rehabilitation overall. PROJECT NARRATIVE The overall goal of this project is to provide personalized, precise rehabilitation medicine to individuals after stroke by developing accurate predictive models that help us detect who will recover and best respond to different types of post-stroke treatments. Using a novel meta-analytic approach, this project will harmonize datasets of brain imaging and behavioral information across sites worldwide in order to develop a large dataset with thousands of participants. Advanced statistical and machine learning techniques will then be applied to this dataset in order to detect robust neural and behavioral biomarkers that can be used to predict stroke recovery and to personalize treatments across diverse populations.",Big Data Neuroimaging to Predict Motor Behavior After Stroke,9663209,K01HD091283,"['Activities of Daily Living', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Big Data Methods', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Corticospinal Tracts', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diffuse', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness of Interventions', 'Ensure', 'Future', 'Gait', 'Gender', 'Genetic study', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Injury', 'International', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Lead', 'Left', 'Lesion', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Motor Cortex', 'Nature', 'Neurorehabilitation', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Physical Medicine', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Precision Medicine Initiative', 'Property', 'Recovery', 'Recovery of Function', 'Rehabilitation Research', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Reproducibility', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Sensory', 'Site', 'Statistical Models', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'Task Performances', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Wolves', 'arm', 'arm movement', 'computerized tools', 'disability', 'functional disability', 'functional improvement', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'machine learning algorithm', 'motor impairment', 'motor recovery', 'muscle strength', 'neurobiological mechanism', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'personalized medicine', 'post stroke', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive test', 'prevent', 'relating to nervous system', 'research and development', 'response', 'skills', 'stroke outcome', 'stroke patient', 'stroke recovery', 'stroke rehabilitation', 'stroke survivor', 'stroke therapy', 'supervised learning', 'tool', 'treatment response', 'unsupervised learning', 'working group']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,K01,2019,133191,0.2154463737510364
"Antiplatelet in Stroke:  Safety and Effectiveness in Seniors (ASSESS) The current U.S. and European guidelines recommend antiplatelet therapy such as aspirin, clopidogrel, or dual antiplatelet therapy to reduce the risk of recurrent ischemic events in patients with noncardioembolic ischemic stroke. However, selection of antiplatelet agents can be a difficult decision to make for older patients. Not only older individuals are at increased risk for recurrent strokes, they also face risk for bleeding complications. While it is known that drug selection should be individualized, it remains unknown how to tailor antiplatelet therapy according to patient unique characteristics, preferences, needs, and values. The long-term goal is to use com- parative effectiveness research to improve primary and secondary prevention in cardiovascular disease and stroke. Leveraging the American Heart Association (AHA) Get With The Guidelines Stroke (GWTG) registry and Medicare claims, the overall objective in this application is to develop patient-centered evidence-based strategies to improve antiplatelet treatment selection for older individuals presenting with noncardioembolic ischemic stroke. The central hypothesis is that individuals differ in many characteristics, such as age, sex, presence of comorbid- ities, or concurrent medications, which can influence the potential benefits and harms associated with the treat- ment. Once the variability in response to treatment is known, selection of an antiplatelet agent can be made based on patient risk profiles, preferences, and known efficacy/safety of the agents, making treatment both safer and more effective. Guided by strong preliminary data, this hypothesis will be tested by pursuing three specific aims: 1) determine the long-term clinical effectiveness of different antiplatelet regimens in patients with noncar- dioembolic ischemic stroke; 2) determine the long-term safety of different antiplatelet regimens; and 3) balance benefits and harms of each antiplatelet regimen while incorporating patient preferences into decision-making. The proposed research is innovative in four key ways: 1) a patient-centered approach is used to address a real- life decisional dilemma facing stroke survivors and clinicians; 2) it shifts focus from selected samples in clinical trials to nationwide representative stroke population, including traditionally underrepresented subgroups in com- munity practice; 3) novel propensity score inverse probability weighting method using generalized boosted mod- els (a machine learning technique) will be employed to mimic a trial-type multi-treatment design, uncover treat- ment heterogeneity, and minimize selection bias in observational data; 4) beyond traditional mechanisms of scientific publications, the evidence generated from this study will be disseminated to stroke survivors, clinicians, and relevant stakeholders through the AHA GWTG-led national quality initiatives and patient-led efforts to insure a rapid translation of seminal findings into clinical practice. The proposed research is significant, because it is expected to help guide personalized antiplatelet therapy in older ischemic stroke survivors that could best meet their needs and lead to better outcomes most meaningful to patients. Ultimately, such knowledge has the poten- tial to inform evidence-based treatment decisions in stroke that now afflicts more than 7.2 million Americans. The proposed research will develop patient-centered evidence-based strategies to improve antiplatelet treatment selection for older individuals presenting with noncardioembolic ischemic stroke. It is relevant to public health because the development and adoption of personalized evidence-based antiplatelet therapy is expected to re- duce recurrent ischemic events, minimize treatment complications, and improve outcomes most meaningful to patients. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to the part of NIH’s mission that pertains to developing funda- mental knowledge that will help to enhance health and reduce the burdens of illness and disability.",Antiplatelet in Stroke:  Safety and Effectiveness in Seniors (ASSESS),9713571,R01AG062770,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Age', 'Aging', 'American', 'American Heart Association', 'Antiplatelet Drugs', 'Aspirin', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cause of Death', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical effectiveness', 'Coagulation Process', 'Community Practice', 'Comorbidity', 'Complication', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Dose', 'Effectiveness', 'Equilibrium', 'European', 'Event', 'Evidence based treatment', 'Face', 'Failure', 'Fright', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Heart', 'Hemorrhage', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Ischemia', 'Ischemic Stroke', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Level of Evidence', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Medicare claim', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Patient Preferences', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Primary Prevention', 'Probability', 'Public Health', 'Publications', 'Recurrence', 'Regimen', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'Sampling', 'Secondary Prevention', 'Selection Bias', 'Selection for Treatments', 'Seminal', 'Societies', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Stroke', 'Stroke prevention', 'Subgroup', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Translations', 'Treatment Failure', 'United States', 'United States Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Weight', 'Woman', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'cardiovascular disorder prevention', 'clinical practice', 'clopidogrel', 'comparative effectiveness', 'disability', 'effectiveness research', 'evidence base', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'individual patient', 'individualized medicine', 'innovation', 'novel', 'older patient', 'patient oriented', 'personalized medicine', 'preference', 'prevent', 'sex', 'stroke patient', 'stroke survivor', 'therapy design', 'treatment effect', 'treatment response']",NIA,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,510532,0.2010254855958326
"Whole Genome RNA Sequencing (RNAseq) of Blood from Patients with Lacunar Stroke Abstract  Lacunar strokes are small infarctions of deep penetrator end arteries that supply deep areas of brain including the basal ganglia, internal capsule, thalamus and pons. The “cause” of lacunar strokes has been controversial. C Miller Fisher was the first to suggest that hypertension was one cause, noting lipohyalinosis (inflammation, fibrinoid necrosis of vessel wall) in smaller penetrating arteries (<200um) occurred only in hypertensives. He also showed, however, that larger lacunar strokes were often associated with microatheroma associated narrowing of larger penetrating arteries. This pathology is now thought to be the most common and associated with lipid abnormalities and diabetes. Moreover, some lacunar strokes are now thought to be associated with intracranial atherosclerosis of the parent artery at the origin of the penetrators. Though lacunar strokes were not traditionally associated with large vessel extracranial atherosclerosis or cardioembolism, there are now a number of cases where lacunar strokes have been associated with large vessel atherosclerosis or cardiac causes. Indeed, in our own recent study we showed that as many as ~50% of small deep infarcts (>15mm in size) were predicted to be due to large vessel atherosclerosis or to cardioembolic disease. It is crucial to identify the correct causes of lacunar strokes because treatments differ: drugs for hypertension vs drugs for lipid abnormalities, surgery for large vessel carotid disease, anticoagulants for cardioembolic disease, and anti-platelet agents for lacunar strokes associated with hypertension or abnormal lipids or diabetes. The biology of lacunar strokes has been studied very little, and there are no accepted biomarkers for lacunar stroke or its causes. Our group, however, has begun to provide novel insights into how the immune and clotting profiles in peripheral blood differ in lacunar strokes compared to large vessel and cardioembolic strokes. We have shown that the immune response in large vessel and cardioembolic cortical strokes is mainly associated with neutrophil genes, whereas the immune response in lacunar stroke associated with hypertension /lipids/ diabetes is associated with inflammatory monocyte-related genes. However, since the preliminary studies were performed on whole blood, there is a great need to study individual immune cell types in these different causes of ischemic stroke. Therefore, in this study we will isolate neutrophils and monocytes in patients with lacunar stroke compared to large vessel and cardioembolic stroke. We will perform RNA sequencing on those cells in the following aims which allows us to measure expression levels of >250,000 alternatively spliced transcripts which are derived from the ~20,000 coding genes.  Specific Aim #1. Use RNAseq to demonstrate that alternatively spliced transcript level expression profiles in monocytes, neutrophils and whole blood differ for subcortical lacunar strokes associated with hypertension, abnormal lipids, diabetes, large vessel atherosclerosis, or cardioembolism compared to each other and compared to matched controls.  Specific Aim #2. Use RNAseq to demonstrate that alternatively spliced transcript level expression profiles for subcortical lacunar strokes with hypertension, lipids or diabetes are associated with monocytes, and differ from cortical large vessel and cardioembolic strokes which are associated mainly with neutrophils.  Specific Aim #3a. Use Support Vector Machine (SVM) to derive the minimum number of transcripts from Aim #1 that differentiate the different causes of lacunar strokes including hypertension, abnormal lipids, diabetes, large vessel atherosclerosis, or cardiac disease. Specific Aim #3b. Use the profiles derived in Aim #3a to predict the cause of lacunar stroke in a second cohort using qRT-PCR to measure expression and SVM to perform predictions with >85% sensitivity and specificity.  Significance: Identifying the causes of lacunar strokes based upon splice variant expression in individual blood cell types is important since it would affect therapy used for secondary stroke prevention. Narrative  This study will perform whole genome RNAsequencing of whole blood, neutrophils and monocytes from patients with lacunar strokes and correlate gene profiles with each cause of lacunar stroke. It will then show the lacunar stroke profiles differ from cortical strokes due to cardioembolism and large vessel atherosclerosis, and the profiles can be used to predict the cause of lacunar stroke in an independent validation cohort of patients which is important because different causes of lacunar strokes require different treatments.",Whole Genome RNA Sequencing (RNAseq) of Blood from Patients with Lacunar Stroke,9696420,R01NS101718,"['Affect', 'Alternative Splicing', 'Anticoagulants', 'Antiplatelet Drugs', 'Area', 'Arterial Fatty Streak', 'Arteries', 'Atherosclerosis', 'BCL6 gene', 'Basal Ganglia', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Blood', 'Blood Cells', 'Blood Platelets', 'Brain', 'CADASIL', 'CCL2 gene', 'CCL3 gene', 'CCL4 gene', 'Caliber', 'Cardiac', 'Carotid Atherosclerotic Disease', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Coagulation Process', 'Code', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Endothelial Cells', 'Expression Profiling', 'FPR1 gene', 'Fibrinoid necrosis', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Heart Diseases', 'Hyperlipidemia', 'Hypertension', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Individual', 'Infarction', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Internal Capsule', 'Intracranial Atheroscleroses', 'Ischemic Stroke', 'Lacunar Infarctions', 'Lipids', 'MMP9 gene', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Messenger RNA', 'Molecular', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Parents', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pontine structure', 'Quantitative Reverse Transcriptase PCR', 'RNA Splicing', 'Recurrence', 'S100P gene', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Stroke', 'Stroke prevention', 'Thalamic structure', 'Thrombosis', 'Transcript', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Whole Blood', 'base', 'cell type', 'cohort', 'insight', 'middle cerebral artery', 'monocyte', 'neutrophil', 'notch protein', 'novel', 'peripheral blood', 'rare genetic disorder', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'vascular risk factor', 'white matter', 'whole genome']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,R01,2019,125567,0.2918362372916003
"Center for the Study of Aphasia Recovery (C-STAR) ﻿    DESCRIPTION (Description as provided by applicant): Stroke is the leading cause of adult disability in the United States, making it a major public health concern (1). The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) estimates the annual cost of stroke in the United States to be $36.5 billion (1). Accordingly, it is clear that the negative personal and societal impact of stroke is vry high. Stroke is typically thought to affect older persons; however, many younger individuals also suffer strokes. For example, at least half of all stroke patients in the state of South Carolina ar under the age of 60 (2). Approximately a quarter of all chronic stroke survivors present with aphasia, a language disorder caused by damage to the speech and language areas of the brain (3, 4). The prevalence of chronic aphasia in the United States is estimated to be one million. Aphasia can vary in severity from very profound impairment that renders patients mute and without the ability to understand others' speech, to milder forms where patients have great difficulty retrieving specific words. In the chronic stage of stroke, aphasia has been identified a the strongest predictor of poor quality of life. Aphasia not only influences the ability to communicate with family and friends, but also drastically decreases education and employment opportunities. Although some degree of spontaneous recovery from aphasia is typical in the first weeks and months following stroke, many patients are left with devastating communication problems. Once aphasia has become a chronic condition, the only road to recovery is through aphasia therapy. Several meta-analysis studies suggest that aphasia therapy is effective. In spite of decades of research, very little is known about which patients benefit the most from treatment and what kind of treatment should be administered to patients with different impairment profiles. The overarching goal of the research proposed here is to improve aphasia treatment effectiveness as well as identify patient factors that can be used to improve diagnosis of language impairment, guide aphasia treatment, and predict prognosis. Specifically, the focus of our center (Center for the Study of Aphasia Recovery; C-STAR) is to examine the extent to which factors such as behavioral aphasia treatment, electrical brain stimulation, and residual brain function influence aphasia recovery. To accomplish our research goals, this project will rely on collaboration among four main investigators: Drs. Julius Fridriksson, Argye Hillis, Chris Rorden, and Greg Hickok. Projects led by Fridriksson (chronic patients) and Hillis (acute patients) will focus on factors that may promote improved outcome of aphasia therapy. Both projects will yield a vast, unique dataset including measures of brain status and response to aphasia treatment. Relying on this dataset, Rorden's project will predict recovery from aphasia using machine learning approaches whereas Hickok will utilize the same data to better understand aphasic impairment in relation to contemporary models of speech and language processing.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Stroke is the leading cause of adult disability in the United States; aphasia, an impairment of the ability to process language, is one of the most devastating results of left hemisphere stroke. The purpose of the work proposed here is to improve recovery from aphasia by better understanding how neurophysiology and anatomy as well as theory driven aphasia treatment relate to long-term outcome.            Subproject-1    Modeling treated recovery from aphasia    Lead Investigator: Julius Fridriksson, Ph.D.            DESCRIPTION (Description as provided by applicant): Stroke is the leading cause of serious adult disability in the United States. One of the most devastating impairments resulting from stroke is aphasia, a language impairment caused by left hemisphere damage involving cortical language areas. It is generally accepted that behavioral aphasia treatment is effective. Nevertheless, different patients experience very different degrees of benefit from aphasia treatment. Despite considerable differences in the response to aphasia treatment, the relationship between patient factors and treatment response is poorly understood and very few reliable prognostic indicators have been identified. This is a major problem, as both time and resources are wasted when clinicians do not know what patients are likely to respond to treatment, or which treatment best fits individual patients. The purpose of the current project is to develop a model that includes biographical and cognitive/linguistic factors to predict patients' response to aphasia treatment. Aphasia severity is one of the few factors that have been identified as a reliable predictor of performance in treatment; it is generally accepted that more severe aphasia is associated with poorer treatment outcomes. However, aphasia severity is a multidimensional construct and patients with similar overall severity scores might demonstrate very different language impairment profiles. To better understand how language impairment relates to treatment outcomes, the dual stream model (DS model;1) will be consulted. Specifically, we will test whether measures of proportional damage to the cortical areas that comprise the DS model improve prediction of aphasia treatment response, beyond biographical and cognitive/linguistic factors. Although the DS model is a functional model grounded in neuroanatomy, we expect measures of speech and language that assesses processes supported by the two major components of the DS model - the dorsal and ventral streams - might be redundant with measures of cortical damage. To understand whether our predictive model can be generalized across different kinds of treatment foci, each patient will undergo treatment devoted to phonological stimulation and a separate treatment phase focusing on semantic stimulation. Ultimately, the goal here is to construct a predictive model that will be made available on- line so that clinicians can enter test scores from individual patients to predic how likely a given patient is to respond to treatment, as well as the focus of that treatment.         There is a great need for prognostic indicators of aphasia treatment response. At the completion of our research, we will understand why some patients respond better to aphasia treatment than others. We have selected treatment approaches that are routinely used in clinical practice, allowing for immediate translation of the findings directly into patient management. The current project will yield a vast dataset that will be made publicly available allowing others to study further aphasia treatment response in relation to cognitive/linguistic and lesion factors.              ",Center for the Study of Aphasia Recovery (C-STAR),9674421,P50DC014664,"['Acute', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'American', 'Anatomy', 'Aphasia', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Biography', 'Brain', 'Brain Injuries', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Cerebrum', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Communication', 'Consult', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Dorsal', 'Education', 'Elderly', 'Electric Stimulation', 'Electrical Stimulation of the Brain', 'Employment', 'Employment Opportunities', 'Family', 'Friends', 'Goals', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Language', 'Language Disorders', 'Lead', 'Left', 'Lesion', 'Life', 'Life Expectancy', 'Linguistics', 'Literature', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Modeling', 'Neuroanatomy', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Perfusion', 'Phase', 'Prevalence', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Residual state', 'Resources', 'Savings', 'Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor', 'Semantics', 'Severities', 'Social isolation', 'South Carolina', 'Speech', 'Stream', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translations', 'Treatment Effectiveness', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States', 'Work', 'acute stroke', 'aphasia recovery', 'behavior test', 'chronic stroke', 'clinical practice', 'cost', 'disability', 'experience', 'fitness', 'hemisphere damage', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'individual patient', 'language impairment', 'language processing', 'mortality', 'neuroimaging', 'neurophysiology', 'outcome forecast', 'patient response', 'phonology', 'predicting response', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'speech processing', 'stroke patient', 'stroke survivor', 'success', 'theories', 'treatment response']",NIDCD,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA AT COLUMBIA,P50,2019,2193618,0.10730859519924366
"Learning invariant representation from high- dimensional data for quantitative stroke reha    Advances in wearable electronics, personal mobile devices, and sensor technology are opening the door to many promising applications in medical care and biomedical research. However, the resulting datasets are often challenging to process due to variability caused by extraneous effects unrelated to the tasks of interest, such as changes in environmental conditions, heteroscedasticity in measurement noise, or patient idiosyncrasies. These effects produce systematic differences between the data used to train machine- learning algorithms and the data on which they are applied in practice, impairing real-world performance. The proposed research will address the fundamental problem of factoring out extraneous effects associated with known nuisance variables. We will develop a novel methodology for extracting features that ar.e invariant to nuisance variables-and hence also to the associated extraneous effects-but that are still useful for classification or regression. The methodology is based on nonparametric deep-network models that perform automatic normalization of the data, and further enforce invariance via adversarial learning. We will apply the approach to an important problem in stroke rehabilitation, the quantitated dosing of motor training. Using a dataset of sensor-based motion data, we will train the model to identify and count functional movements in stroke patients performing rehabilitation activities. We expect to show that our approach can surmount patient variability to enable rigorous movement classification and quantitation. The proposed work is significant, because it will empower investigators to undertake the dosing trials critically needed in stroke rehabilitation. The proposed work is innovative, because it departs from traditional data preprocessing techniques by combining advanced data normalization and model calibration procedures. Our work is likely to have a positive impact on stroke rehabilitation by facilitating the research required to change clinical practice and improve stroke outcomes. Our quantitative approach is broadly generalizable to applications hindered by nuisance variables, such as medical diagnostics and genomics. The proposed research is relevant to public health, because it will enable the precise measurement of rehabilitation after stroke. This will facilitate important recovery research that is expected to inform stroke rehabilitation practices and reduce the burden of stroke disability. The quantitative methodology will advance data-driven discovery in the presence of nuisance variables, which is relevant to biomedical research applications such as diagnostics, genetics, and imaging.",Learning invariant representation from high- dimensional data for quantitative stroke reha   ,9916457,R01LM013316,"['Address', 'Biomedical Research', 'Calibration', 'Caring', 'Classification', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diagnostic', 'Dose', 'Due Process', 'Electronics', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Instruction', 'Learning', 'Measurement', 'Medical', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Noise', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Procedures', 'Public Health', 'Recovery', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Stroke', 'Techniques', 'Training', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'disability', 'handheld mobile device', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'machine learning algorithm', 'multidimensional data', 'network models', 'novel', 'patient variability', 'sensor', 'sensor technology', 'stroke outcome', 'stroke patient', 'stroke rehabilitation']",NLM,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,300000,0.21714276576583877
"Toward a Mechanistic Understanding of Optimization Principles Underlying Hemiparetic Gait This project seeks to identify how motor impairments in stroke survivors contribute to mobility deficits through the use of behavioral observations and computational models. Ultimately, this knowledge could be used to design more effective interventions to improve walking ability, increase functional independence, and reduce fall risk in individuals post-stroke. After a stroke, walking ability is affected by motor control deficits which are often characterized by hemiparesis, or weakness on one side of the body. During walking, hemiparesis is often associated with a visible limp that is due to differences in step lengths and stance times between the right and left sides of the body. Reducing these right-left asymmetries are a common objective of rehabilitation, and recently researchers have developed a number of approaches designed to reduce asymmetries such as acoustic pacing, unilateral step training, and split-belt treadmill training. Despite the recent clinical focus on reducing asymmetry, the potential functional benefits of improving symmetry have yet to be established. This research will address this gap by answering two fundamental questions: 1) Do improvements in symmetry lead to functional benefits such as a more efficient walking pattern or improvements in balance? 2) If stroke survivors retain the capacity to walk more symmetrically why do they choose to do otherwise? Although improvements in symmetry can no doubt reduce the potential stigma of walking with a limp, it is possible that a symmetric walking pattern could be less efficient or put patients at a higher risk of falls if it requires that they push the limits of their capacity. Alternatively, it is possible that, through repeated stepping practice, post- stroke individuals have reinforced a suboptimal pattern due to insufficient experience with a more optimal, symmetric pattern. Addressing these issues requires a thorough understanding of the processes by which stroke survivors optimize their walking pattern. Here, these issues are addressed using behavioral approaches to quantify tradeoffs between asymmetry and measures of walking ability such as stability and economy, and computational methods to identify the causal relationships linking these variables. Ultimately, the knowledge derived from this work will provide a mechanistic understanding of how the damaged brain optimizes movement, and may also inform the way in which clinicians develop personalized rehabilitation objectives for stroke survivors. Our findings may also inform cost/benefit analyses of walking in other patient populations known to have asymmetric walking patterns such as amputees or individuals with Parkinson's disease. Furthermore, providing a more mechanistic rationale for gait rehabilitation interventions could improve the efficiency of physical therapy, reduce health care costs, and ultimately help to better reintegrate individuals with neuromotor impairments into society by maximizing their mobility. Public Health Relevance Statement This project seeks to identify the how walking impairments in stroke survivors contribute to mobility deficits through the use of behavioral observations and computational models. The chosen approach integrates biomechanical analyses, physiological assessments and machine learning algorithms to explain how asymmetries during walking influence balance and the effort required to walk. Ultimately, the results of this work may lead to more personalized rehabilitation strategies to improve walking capacity and efficiency, and ultimately reduce fall risk in stroke survivors.",Toward a Mechanistic Understanding of Optimization Principles Underlying Hemiparetic Gait,9753311,R01HD091184,"['Acceleration', 'Acoustics', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Amputees', 'Automobile Driving', 'Behavioral', 'Biomechanics', 'Brain', 'Brain Injuries', 'Clinical', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Cost-Benefit Analysis', 'Development', 'Environment', 'Equilibrium', 'Exercise Physiology', 'Functional disorder', 'Gait', 'Gases', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Left', 'Length', 'Link', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Metabolic', 'Movement', 'Nervous system structure', 'Paresis', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physical therapy', 'Physiological', 'Process', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Reaction', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Side', 'Societies', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Speed', 'Step training', 'Stroke', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Uncertainty', 'Walking', 'Work', 'behavior observation', 'clinical practice', 'computer science', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'design', 'effective intervention', 'experience', 'fall risk', 'foot', 'functional independence', 'gait rehabilitation', 'hemiparesis', 'high risk', 'improved', 'injured', 'locomotor control', 'machine learning algorithm', 'motor control', 'motor impairment', 'novel strategies', 'patient population', 'post stroke', 'public health relevance', 'rehabilitation strategy', 'relating to nervous system', 'social stigma', 'spatiotemporal', 'stroke rehabilitation', 'stroke survivor', 'success', 'treadmill', 'treadmill training', 'visual feedback', 'walking speed']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,R01,2019,381129,0.17493708916388526
"Shaping Neural Population Dynamics to Facilitate Learning Project Summary Behavior and cognition emerge from the coordinated activity of populations of interacting neurons. To change behavior we must change the architecture of the network that drives behavior. What are the rules whereby the activity of populations of neurons can change during learning? If we could observe the neural population dynamics that underlie skill learning, we might be able to facilitate learning. This ability may eventually lead to improvements to neurally- based rehabilitation strategies that can facilitate the recovery from stroke.  We will use a neurofeedback paradigm to shape the neural population dynamics that underlie skill learning. To do this, we will record the activity of dozens of neurons in the motor cortex of Rhesus monkey subjects. Animals will control a cursor on a computer screen by generating neural command signals. This is neurofeedback because the animal directly observes a projection of his neural activity, in the form of the movement of the onscreen cursor. This paradigm allows us to study learning simply by perturbing the mapping from neural activity to cursor movement on the screen. Following such a perturbation the animal must discover how to generate new patterns of neural activity that are now appropriate to restore good control of the onscreen cursor.  We will ask two linked questions. First, how does the animal learn to generate new patterns of neural activity? And second, can we facilitate that process? Neurofeedback-based learning offers complementary advantages to arm movements for studying the neural population dynamics that accompany learning. Chieﬂy, only in a neurofeedback paradigm can we be certain that the learning-induced changes in neural activity we observe matter directly for behavior, because only the neurons we record directly impact behavior in this paradigm.  We will test classic theories of skill learning, converted into speciﬁc hypotheses about how neural activity patterns will change throughout the multi-day course of skill learning.  If our neurofeedback-based incremental training schemes do facilitate learning, then this research will inform the work of rehabilitation specialists who work with stroke patients. We (and others) believe that if neurofeedback-based therapies are coupled with standard behavioral therapies for stroke, rehabilitation outcomes will improve. Project Narrative Stroke can be a debilitating condition. Only ﬁfty percent of stroke survivors make a full recovery, and that is usually only after extensive rehabilitation. The recovery from stroke and skill learning are probably closely related. We propose to develop brain-computer interface neurofeedback paradigms to facilitate the learning of new skills.

"Contributions of spared brain structures and connections to aphasia recovery Language impairment, or aphasia, is a common problem after left hemisphere stroke, and causes significant long-term disability. After the initial period of healing, recovery from stroke relies on plasticity in brain networks spared from direct stroke damage. Thus, to improve behavioral and biological treatments for aphasia, we must understand how spared brain structures and connections contribute to recovery. Over a century of research has demonstrated that left hemisphere areas surrounding the stroke and right hemisphere areas symmetric to the normal left hemisphere language network participate in aphasia recovery. However, the mechanisms by which these areas are recruited and their roles in language recovery remain unclear, particularly for the “right hemisphere language network.” We propose to examine the role of spared brain structures and connections in recovery of core language functions in a large group of left hemisphere stroke survivors and matched controls. The innovative methods address major limitations of prior studies by accounting for individual differences in stroke severity, using task-independent brain structure and connectivity measures, and examining several core language functions as defined by statistical analysis of an extensive behavioral assessment battery. Preliminary studies using this new approach suggest that parts of the right hemisphere language network grow after stroke, and that these changes improve language outcomes. Based on these findings, we hypothesize that recruitment of the right hemisphere language network after left hemisphere stroke compensates for language deficits. We will test this hypothesis against multiple alternative hypotheses, using advanced brain imaging methods to test for effects throughout spared parts of the brain. Analyses will examine how spared brain structures and connections contribute to language recovery, accounting for individual differences in stroke severity. We will additionally test for signs of brain plasticity after stroke and test relationships between stroke location and patterns of brain plasticity to better understand the mechanisms of recovery.

"Sleep apnea after stroke: Implications for screening and treatment ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Abstract Stroke is the leading cause of adult disability and a leading cause of death in the US, and results in $21 billion in direct medical costs each year. Stroke disproportionately impacts minorities including Hispanics who have higher stroke risk, poorer outcomes after stroke, and a higher prevalence of post-stroke sleep-disordered breathing (SDB). Declining stroke mortality in combination with the aging US population will result in dramatic increases in the number of disabled stroke survivors, with the largest increases projected among Hispanics. New approaches to improve stroke outcomes are therefore urgently needed, and may be particularly important among Hispanics, the largest US minority population. One critical yet scarcely explored opportunity may exist through identification and treatment of SDB in individuals with stroke. SDB is highly prevalent after stroke, and its presence predicts poor functional outcome and higher mortality. Nonetheless, very few stroke patients are screened or treated for SDB. Little information is available about which patients are likely to have high risk SDB after stroke; the trajectory of SDB in this setting and how to predict it; and almost no data are available for Hispanics. This information may offer opportunities to improve critical post-stroke outcomes and lessen ethnic stroke disparities. Thus, the main goals of the research proposed are 1) develop risk stratification models for post-stroke patients with SDB, 2) provide novel insight into the trajectory that SDB takes after stroke to inform management decisions, 3) inform the design of a subsequent clinical trial that will assess the impact of treatment of high risk SDB on key post-stroke outcomes, and 4) explore a possible treatable cause for worse stroke outcomes in Hispanics. We plan to take advantage of an exceptional opportunity provided by the ongoing Brain Attack Surveillance in Corpus Christi (BASIC) project (R01 NS38916). In this population-based stroke surveillance study in a bi-ethnic community, all acute ischemic stroke patients are interviewed at baseline and followed prospectively for 3, 6 and 12 month outcomes. The current application will add longitudinal SDB assessments to BASIC using a validated portable SDB screening device. SDB severity will be assessed with the apnea/hypopnea index, as well as innovative measures derived from signal analysis. Use of BASIC provides a cost-effective opportunity to expand our knowledge about SDB after stroke in ways that can directly impact clinical care, future clinical trial design, and health disparities. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Sleep-disordered breathing (SDB), which affects over half of stroke patients, predicts poor outcomes after stroke. Leveraging the infrastructure of the BASIC project, we propose a longitudinal, population-based study of SDB and stroke outcomes to improve the identification and management of important SDB after stroke, provide critical data to plan future clinical trials, and explore a potential target to reduce an important ethnic health disparity.",Sleep apnea after stroke: Implications for screening and treatment,9609472,R01HL126700,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Aging', 'Apnea', 'Autonomic Dysfunction', 'Caring', 'Cause of Death', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'County', 'Data', 'Devices', 'Disabled Persons', 'Elements', 'Epidemiology', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'High Prevalence', 'Hispanics', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Investigation', 'Ischemic Stroke', 'Knowledge', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Neurological outcome', 'Not Hispanic or Latino', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Population', 'Population Study', 'Pulse Rates', 'Quality of life', 'Recurrence', 'Research', 'Resource Allocation', 'Risk', 'Risk stratification', 'Sampling', 'Selection Criteria', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sleep Apnea Syndromes', 'Stroke', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'acute stroke', 'base', 'clinical care', 'cost effective', 'design', 'disability', 'ethnic health disparity', 'experience', 'functional outcomes', 'health disparity', 'high risk', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'insight', 'mortality', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'patient screening', 'personalized medicine', 'population based', 'portability', 'post stroke', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'research clinical testing', 'screening', 'stroke outcome', 'stroke patient', 'stroke risk', 'stroke survivor', 'stroke trials', 'surveillance study']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2019,739858,0.29957750752869267
"Whole Transcriptome Studies of Patients with Transient Ischemic Attacks (TIAs) ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Transient ischemic attacks (TIA) are critical to identify because prevention therapy can reduce the risk of future vascular events by > 50%. Diagnostic testing and therapeutic intervention must start as soon as possible because 10-25% of TIAs have a stroke within 90 days. Because so many patients present emergently with transient neurological events the large majority of whom do not go on to have a stroke, methods for identifying TIAs at high risk for stroke have been sought so that work up and treatment can be targeted to those who need it most to save time, money and limited resources. Though the ABCD2 score and brain Diffusion Weighted Imaging-MRI (DWI-MRI) have improved prediction of which TIAs have a stroke, their sensitivity and specificity for prediction of individual cases i poor. In this proposal we propose that peripheral blood leukocytes and platelets play pivotal roles in which TIAs go on to have a stroke and by assessing RNA in whole blood we can evaluate leukocyte and platelet function in TIA patients who go on to have stroke versus those that do not have a stroke. We hypothesize that specific coagulation and immune genes are activated in TIA patients that predispose them to have a stroke by 90 days compared to those TIA patients who do NOT have a stroke by 90 days. A subset of these leukocyte and platelet mRNA genes will predict TIAs who have a stroke by 90 days. This hypothesis is addressed by the following specific aims. Aim #1 (Derivation Cohort): Demonstrate that mRNA expression measured using RNAseq from whole blood differs in a derivation cohort of TIAs that go on to have a stroke by 90 days compared to those TIAs who do not have a stroke by 90 days. Demonstrate that most mRNA found to be regulated using RNAseq are also significantly regulated when measured using qRT-PCR. Aim #2 (Derivation Cohort): Apply machine learning algorithms to the mRNA from Aim #1 to derive an optimal subset of mRNA regulated by both RNAseq and qRT-PCR that predict which TIAs have strokes by 90 days compared to those who do not with >95% sensitivity on cross-validation. Aim #3 (Validation Cohort): Use machine/prediction learning algorithms to demonstrate that the genes from Aim #2 when measured using qRT-PCR on an independent validation cohort predict which TIAs have a stroke by 90 days with >85% sensitivity. The goal of these studies is to discover mRNA profiles in blood that predict which TIA patients go on to have strokes by 90 days. When confirmed in future studies, this will direct in depth testing to those high risk TIAs most in need in order to prevent strokes, and decrease unnecessary testing in those with low risk of stroke. Equally as important, the genes discovered to be associated with high risk of stroke in TIA patients will represent potential novel stroke prevention targets. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will examine RNA in blood using RNAseq and qRT-PCR of human subjects with Transient Ischemic Attacks (TIAs) who have a stroke by 90 days compared to TIAs who do not have a stroke. The regulated mRNA, exons and alternatively spliced transcripts in a Derivation Cohort of TIA patients will be used to predict which TIAs have a stroke by 90 days in a Validation Cohort of TIA patients.",Whole Transcriptome Studies of Patients with Transient Ischemic Attacks (TIAs),9650647,R01NS097000,"['Address', 'Alternative Splicing', 'Area', 'Arterial Fatty Streak', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood Platelets', 'Blood Vessels', 'Brain', 'Cerebrum', 'Clinical', 'Coagulation Process', 'Data', 'Derivation procedure', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Epilepsy', 'Event', 'Exons', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Hour', 'Immune', 'Individual', 'Ischemic Stroke', 'Labyrinthine disorder', 'Leukocytes', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Messenger RNA', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Migraine', 'Neurologic', 'Patients', 'Play', 'Prevention therapy', 'Publishing', 'Quantitative Reverse Transcriptase PCR', 'RNA', 'ROC Curve', 'Recurrence', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Estimate', 'Role', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Site', 'Stroke', 'Stroke prevention', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Transcript', 'Transient Ischemic Attack', 'Validation', 'Whole Blood', 'base', 'cohort', 'emergency settings', 'gene discovery', 'high risk', 'human subject', 'improved', 'learning algorithm', 'mRNA Expression', 'machine learning algorithm', 'monocyte', 'neutrophil', 'novel', 'peripheral blood', 'platelet function', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'release factor', 'stroke risk', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,R01,2019,552408,0.2826061521768155
"Smartwatch Monitoring for Atrial Fibrillation After Stroke Project Summary / Abstract Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the world’s most common serious heart rhythm problem and causes 15% of all strokes, a major cause of disability and death among Americans. Long-term monitoring for early AF detection and treatment is recommended for many stroke patients, but although existing cardiac monitors are accurate, they suffer from methodologic and cost limitations that preclude their long-term use. In the proposed, “Smartwatch Monitoring for Atrial Fibrillation Real-Time in Stroke,” Study, our overall objective is to enhance paroxysmal AF (pAF) detection by enhancing and testing Pulsewatch, an innovative, smartwatch-based technology for long-term rhythm monitoring of stroke patients. For Aim 1, we embed our state-of-the art AF detection algorithms, interactive messaging to promote adherence, and novel contact and motion noise correction capabilities into a smartwatch to enable near-continuous pulse waveform analysis. We will further refine Pulsewatch through focus groups and a Hack-a-thon with stroke patients and their medical providers. For Aim 2, we will enroll 90 stroke survivors and provide them with a smartphone and smartwatch, both encoded with Pulsewatch. We will compare the performance of Pulsewatch when worn daily for 7 days to conventional 7-day cardiac monitoring for pAF detection. For Aim 3, we will determine the acceptability and usability of Pulsewatch through follow-up interviews and focus groups in 30 randomly selected participants from Aim 2 asked to continue wearing smartwatch daily for an additional 30 days. We will identify patient factors associated with adherence and evaluate the impact of Pulsewatch use on disease-specific quality of life, anxiety, and self- activation among the 30 users compared to 30 stroke patients treated with usual care through baseline and 1- month assessments. Our research will lead to the development of a highly acceptable, enabling cardiovascular monitoring technology designed by, and for, stroke patients that facilitates long-term non-invasive screening for pAF, as well as communication between stroke patients and their medical providers. PROJECT NARRATIVE Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the world’s most common serious heart rhythm problem and causes 15% of all strokes, a major cause of disability and death among Americans. Long-term monitoring for early AF detection and treatment is recommended for many stroke patients, but although existing cardiac monitors are accurate, they suffer from methodologic and cost limitations. Accordingly, we propose a series of prospective investigations involving stroke patients and their medical providers focused on developing, validating, and field-testing a new smartwatch-based AF detection platform, Pulsewatch, to create a mobile technology that can detect paroxysms of AF, accelerate their treatment, is user-centric, and is of great intrinsic acceptability.",Smartwatch Monitoring for Atrial Fibrillation After Stroke,9679513,R01HL137734,"['Adherence', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Anxiety', 'Atrial Fibrillation', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cellular Phone', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Elderly', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Electronic Mail', 'Engineering', 'Enhancement Technology', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Fingers', 'Focus Groups', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Geriatrics', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Heart Rate', 'Immigrant', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Interview', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Letters', 'Machine Learning', 'Market Research', 'Measurement', 'Medical', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Noise', 'Participant', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Representative', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Population', 'Provider', 'Publishing', 'Quality of life', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Self Efficacy', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Spottings', 'Stroke', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technology', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Transient Ischemic Attack', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Work', 'base', 'comparative efficacy', 'cost', 'cryptogenic stroke', 'design', 'disability', 'experience', 'field study', 'follow-up', 'heart rhythm', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'iterative design', 'lens', 'mHealth', 'mobile computing', 'non-invasive monitor', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'post stroke', 'preference', 'prospective', 'screening', 'sensor', 'signal processing', 'smart watch', 'smartphone Application', 'stroke patient', 'stroke survivor', 'tool', 'treatment as usual', 'usability']",NHLBI,UNIV OF MASSACHUSETTS MED SCH WORCESTER,R01,2019,740058,0.2096605911022095

Abstract The AHA Stroke Rehabilitation guideline states that in the current fiscal climate, “the provision of comprehensive rehabilitation programs with adequate resources, dose, and duration is an essential aspect of stroke care and should be a priority” [1]. While near and long-term rehabilitation goals should be guided by patient baseline motor status and potential for motor recovery [2-12], acute motor assessment and prognostication remain a clinically difficult task [13, 14]. Conventional clinical assessments (e.g. NIH Stroke Scale, Fugl-Meyer (FM) Scale) [15, 16] that power prognosis are highly dependent on the initial severity and care provider/point of care, and often reduced further to even coarser prognostic scales (e.g. Orpington Prognostic Scale (OPS)) [17]. Overall they lack the level of sophistication required to predict motor recovery and tailor rehabilitation due to ceiling effects, omission of fractionated and complex distal movements, and/or unequal weighting of the two extremities in assessments [18]. Furthermore, many survivors do not even receive comprehensive assessments prior to discharge, and telestroke approaches which are being implemented to address such issues are limited in their scope of care and still not fully developed for functional assessments [19-23]. This is critical because “all patients benefit from a formal assessment of the patient’s rehabilitation needs prior to discharge” [24]. To address these and other limitations the AHA guidelines specifically call for the development of “computer-adapted assessments for personalized and tailored interventions”, “newer technologies such as…body-worn sensors”, and “better predictor models to identify responders and nonresponders” [1]. To address these limitations, we propose to develop a system of multimodal, integrated sensors (i.e., motion capture cameras, force sensors, accelerometers, and gyroscopes) that will interface with a patient for recording their movement; a software suite with signal processing and data fusion algorithms to reduce data dimensionality and provide kinematic/kinetic based evaluations; and system software to track, classify, and predict patient disease severity. We will test this computational Integrated sensor-based Motion Analysis Suite (IMAS) in 30 stroke patients undergoing IMAS directed motor evaluations (repeated 4 times in a 2 day period) within 5 days post stroke and 6-8 weeks post stroke (after having undergone rehabilitation) focused on assessments identified as important to patient independence, activities of daily living, and ability to return to work. Quantitative kinematic/kinetic metrics descriptive of motor behavior will be derived from IMAS sensor recordings to characterize subjects’ motor performance (e.g., joint displacement, velocity, acceleration, jerk, and movement quality measures). Then, we will investigate the statistical relationships between the IMAS collected data (and with additional clinical data gathered during the patient assessments including demographics; imaging derived information; and FM, OPS, and Barthel index scores) to build statistical models to: 1. extract a low dimensional representation of disease state, 2. predict the FM scale, and 3. predict likelihood of motor recovery following treatment. Project Narrative Stroke is a major cause of death and the leading cause of disability. In the clinic, the lack of quantitative, objective methods for outcome assessment and outcome prediction considerably hamper management of the disease, ultimately leading to sub-optimal strategies for managing patient care. This study will develop a motion analysis suite for quantitative, objective outcome assessment and prediction in stroke patients.",Stroke Assessment Suite,9845982,R43NS113737,"['Acceleration', 'Accelerometer', 'Activities of Daily Living', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Authorization documentation', 'Behavior', 'Caring', 'Cause of Death', 'Classification', 'Climate', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical assessments', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Confidential Information', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Diffuse', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Disease model', 'Distal', 'Dose', 'Evaluation', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Image', 'Infarction', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Kinetics', 'Lesion', 'Limb structure', 'Linear Models', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Outcome Assessment', 'Patient Care Management', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Recovery', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Rights', 'Series', 'Severities', 'Severity of illness', 'Signal Transduction', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Source', 'Speed', 'Statistical Algorithm', 'Statistical Models', 'Stroke', 'Survivors', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Upper Extremity', 'Validation', 'Weight', 'Work', 'acute stroke', 'arm movement', 'base', 'care providers', 'commercialization', 'data reduction', 'demographics', 'deviant', 'disability', 'human subject', 'indexing', 'instrument', 'kinematics', 'long-term rehabilitation', 'model development', 'motor recovery', 'motor symptom', 'multidimensional data', 'multimodality', 'new technology', 'outcome forecast', 'outcome prediction', 'patient population', 'phase 2 study', 'point of care', 'portability', 'post stroke', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'programs', 'prototype', 'responders and non-responders', 'sensor', 'signal processing', 'software systems', 'stroke outcome', 'stroke patient', 'stroke rehabilitation', 'wearable device']",NINDS,"HIGHLAND INSTRUMENTS, INC.",R43,2019,224406,0.15011009786047913
"Fast and Easy Assessment of Stroke PROJECT SUMMARY The goal of this study is to develop an objective tool for the fast and easy assessment of stroke, by developing a novel analytics platform that quickly identifies potential stroke from movement signatures captured with wearable sensors. The tool uses unobtrusive wearable sensors and does not require medical training to operate, and thus will be valuable for families and caregivers of older Americans with high stroke risk who are either living at home or in an assisted living facility. Ischemic stroke affects nearly 700,000 Americans each year, costs approximately $33 billion annually, and is the fifth leading cause of death and a leading cause of disability in the US. IV tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) has been an FDA approved therapy for ischemic stroke since 1995, yet only 5-10% of eligible patients receive this therapy. Arrival time in the emergency room (ER) after initial stroke symptoms is directly associated with better outcomes after tPA and endovascular therapy, specifically 4.5 hours and up to 24 hours in select patients, respectively. It is well established that treatment with tPA decreases the lifetime cost of stroke to third party payers by $25,000 per patient. As a result, health plans will be the ultimate economic buyer for this new technology. Here, we are not developing a new therapy for stroke, where so many others have failed. We seek, rather, to fill a well-accepted and clear gap for stroke patients: the early recognition of stroke symptoms that prevents them from accessing PROVEN but time dependent treatments in stroke, whose impact on outcomes is well established. Early identification of symptoms and timely treatment is the single most important determinant of outcomes in ischemic stroke. However, despite massive public health campaigns, most people do not identify stroke symptoms, resulting in costly delays in calling 9-1-1 and patients arriving in the hospital too late to benefit from ischemic stroke treatments. This is a growing problem, given the aging US population of which a significant portion lives at home alone, the staffing crisis at assisted living and nursing facilities, and the prevalence of stroke which is expected to increase by 20% by 2030. Given these trends, administrators and aging experts are increasingly recognizing the value of remote monitoring and aging in place initiatives. Thus, there a clear and urgent, unmet need for a method to assist untrained stroke victims, their families and caregivers in the early recognition of stroke. Bridging this gap with a fast, easy and objective solution would have significant public health impact, because millions of patients could access therapies in a window that is already known to improve outcomes for brain injury. To address this problem, we have leveraged our team’s unique expertise in stroke neurology and developed a set of activation tasks coupled with a wearable solution to assess and quantify ischemic stroke. Once deployed, our solution will improve stroke emergency response and increase the number of patients receiving IV tPA and other reperfusion therapies in the acute setting. NARRATIVE Ischemic stroke affects nearly 700,000 Americans, costs approximately $33 billion annually, and is the fifth leading cause of death and a leading cause of disability in the US. Though treatment for stroke has been available for over 20 years, only a very small number of eligible patients receive it because individuals who have suffered a stroke do not reach the emergency room in time. We have developed a method for quick, easy, real-time assessment for stroke, which will dramatically improve the number of patients receiving timely therapy after stroke and improve the outcome for stroke.",Fast and Easy Assessment of Stroke,9847511,R43NS110338,"['Accelerometer', 'Accident and Emergency department', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Administrator', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Alteplase', 'American', 'Assisted Living Facilities', 'Brain Injuries', 'Cause of Death', 'Cellular Phone', 'Classification', 'Collaborations', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Coupled', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Discipline of Nursing', 'Early identification', 'Economics', 'Emergency Department Physician', 'Emergency response', 'FDA approved', 'Family', 'Family Caregiver', 'Feedback', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Health Campaign', 'Health care facility', 'Home environment', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Individual', 'Innovation Corps', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Ischemic Stroke', 'Limb structure', 'Long-Term Care', 'Machine Learning', 'Manufacturer Name', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Minor', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Neurologist', 'Nurses', 'Oranges', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Physician Executives', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevalence', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Quantitative Evaluations', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Reperfusion Therapy', 'Science', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Stroke', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Third-Party Payer', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Wireless Technology', 'Work', 'acute stroke', 'aging in place', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'cost', 'disability', 'health plan', 'healthy volunteer', 'hemiparesis', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'individual patient', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'life time cost', 'motor impairment', 'new technology', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'phase 1 study', 'post stroke', 'prevent', 'programs', 'research clinical testing', 'sensor', 'sex', 'societal costs', 'standard of care', 'stroke neurology', 'stroke outcome', 'stroke patient', 'stroke risk', 'stroke survivor', 'stroke symptom', 'stroke therapy', 'stroke victims', 'tool', 'trend', 'volunteer', 'wearable device']",NINDS,"ALVA HEALTH, INC.",R43,2019,256988,0.2959548349809316
"Center for the Study of Aphasia Recovery (C-STAR) To address the National Institute on Aging’s strategic aim of understanding mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of AD, related dementias, and neurodegenerative disorders of aging (Goal D-2), we propose an extension to Project 1 of the currently funded Center for the Study of Aphasia Recovery (C-STAR; P50 DC014664, referred to here as POLAR) to investigate further neurological and health-related factors that predict cognitive-linguistic decline in stroke survivors. Aphasia, a language impairment caused by damage to the brain's language regions, persists chronically in approximately 30% of stroke survivors. POLAR is a treatment study that aims to identify neuroanatomical, behavioral, genetic, and demographic predictors of treated aphasia recovery in individuals with chronic left hemisphere stroke. Preliminary analyses have shown that not all individuals improve, and recent evidence suggests that approximately one-quarter of individuals with post-stroke aphasia experience cognitive-linguistic decline over time. The purpose of this project is to extend the follow-up window for the POLAR study, to one-year post aphasia treatment. There is evidence to suggest that declining performance in stroke-induced aphasia is attributed to pathologic changes in the brain's white matter, referred to as leukoaraiosis. Leukoaraiosis is common in stroke survivors, and is often attributed to age, as well as cardiovascular health and other health concerns. In the general population, it has been associated with cognitive decline and loss of functional ability. By extending follow-up interval for the POLAR study, this study will address a new aim of evaluating the progression of leukoaraiosis and how it affects overall cognitive-linguistic ability in stroke survivors. To this end, participants will undergo the same speech/language and cognitive testing administered at study baseline. Participants will also undergo the same magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) protocol as at baseline (see the attached POLAR Research Strategy). The extent of behavioral change will be evaluated and related to neuroanatomical changes. The role of cognitive reserve and other personal factors in mediating the effects of leukoaraiosis will also be explored. The world’s population is aging, and with this trend, the global burden of stroke and dementia is also increasing. The study of leukoaraiosis in post-stroke aphasia is critical for identifying factors that may indicate cognitive-linguistic decline in stroke survivors, as doing so will also inform efforts to improve the evaluation of individuals at risk for developing cognitive impairment, AD, and other dementias (NIA Strategic Goal D-3). The world’s population is aging, and by 2050, it is expected that 17% of the world’s population (i.e., 1.6 billion people) will be over the age of 65 (1). Along with this increase in older individuals, the global burden of stroke (2) and dementia (3) is also increasing. The coming decades are expected to see a significant growth in the number of individuals living longer with post-stroke sequelae, attributed to the decline in stroke mortality rates (2, 4) and an increase in stroke rates in younger individuals (e.g., 20-44 years old (5); 45-64 years old (6)). In parallel, as individuals age, the prevalence of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and other dementias continues to increase (3). This epidemiological trend means that aging research must consider the effects of stroke on the aging brain – and likewise – stroke research must consider how processes associated with aging affect long term outcomes. In essence, stroke survivors are aging, and aging research must consider this population, especially considering that by 2030, the number of stroke survivors could reach 70 million people worldwide (2). Accordingly, to address the National Institute on Aging’s strategic aim of understanding mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of AD, related dementias, and neurodegenerative disorders of aging (Goal D-2), we propose an extension to Project 1 of the currently funded Center for the Study of Aphasia Recovery (CSTAR; P50 DC014664, referred to here as POLAR) to investigate further neurological and health-related factors that predict cognitive-linguistic decline in stroke survivors. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Stroke is the leading cause of adult disability in the United States; aphasia, an impairment of the ability to process language, is one of the most devastating results of left hemisphere stroke. The purpose of the work proposed here is to improve recovery from aphasia by better understanding how neurophysiology and anatomy as well as theory driven aphasia treatment relate to long-term outcome.            Subproject-1    Modeling treated recovery from aphasia    Lead Investigator: Julius Fridriksson, Ph.D.            DESCRIPTION (Description as provided by applicant): Stroke is the leading cause of serious adult disability in the United States. One of the most devastating impairments resulting from stroke is aphasia, a language impairment caused by left hemisphere damage involving cortical language areas. It is generally accepted that behavioral aphasia treatment is effective. Nevertheless, different patients experience very different degrees of benefit from aphasia treatment. Despite considerable differences in the response to aphasia treatment, the relationship between patient factors and treatment response is poorly understood and very few reliable prognostic indicators have been identified. This is a major problem, as both time and resources are wasted when clinicians do not know what patients are likely to respond to treatment, or which treatment best fits individual patients. The purpose of the current project is to develop a model that includes biographical and cognitive/linguistic factors to predict patients' response to aphasia treatment. Aphasia severity is one of the few factors that have been identified as a reliable predictor of performance in treatment; it is generally accepted that more severe aphasia is associated with poorer treatment outcomes. However, aphasia severity is a multidimensional construct and patients with similar overall severity scores might demonstrate very different language impairment profiles. To better understand how language impairment relates to treatment outcomes, the dual stream model (DS model;1) will be consulted. Specifically, we will test whether measures of proportional damage to the cortical areas that comprise the DS model improve prediction of aphasia treatment response, beyond biographical and cognitive/linguistic factors. Although the DS model is a functional model grounded in neuroanatomy, we expect measures of speech and language that assesses processes supported by the two major components of the DS model - the dorsal and ventral streams - might be redundant with measures of cortical damage. To understand whether our predictive model can be generalized across different kinds of treatment foci, each patient will undergo treatment devoted to phonological stimulation and a separate treatment phase focusing on semantic stimulation. Ultimately, the goal here is to construct a predictive model that will be made available on- line so that clinicians can enter test scores from individual patients to predic how likely a given patient is to respond to treatment, as well as the focus of that treatment.         There is a great need for prognostic indicators of aphasia treatment response. At the completion of our research, we will understand why some patients respond better to aphasia treatment than others. We have selected treatment approaches that are routinely used in clinical practice, allowing for immediate translation of the findings directly into patient management. The current project will yield a vast dataset that will be made publicly available allowing others to study further aphasia treatment response in relation to cognitive/linguistic and lesion factors.",Center for the Study of Aphasia Recovery (C-STAR),9951329,P50DC014664,"['Activities of Daily Living', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'American', 'Anatomy', 'Aphasia', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Genetics', 'Biography', 'Brain', 'Brain Injuries', 'Cerebrum', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Consult', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Dementia', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Dorsal', 'Electric Stimulation', 'Employment', 'Epidemiological trend', 'Evaluation', 'Funding', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Language', 'Language Disorders', 'Language Tests', 'Lead', 'Left', 'Lesion', 'Leukoaraiosis', 'Life', 'Life Expectancy', 'Linguistics', 'Literature', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Modeling', 'National Institute on Aging', 'Neuroanatomy', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurologic', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Perfusion', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Predictive Factor', 'Prevalence', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Residual state', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Savings', 'Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor', 'Semantics', 'Severities', 'Social isolation', 'Speech', 'Stream', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translations', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States', 'Work', 'acute stroke', 'aging brain', 'aphasia recovery', 'behavior test', 'cardiovascular health', 'chronic stroke', 'clinical practice', 'cognitive reserve', 'cognitive testing', 'disability', 'experience', 'fitness', 'follow-up', 'hemisphere damage', 'human old age (65+)', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'individual patient', 'language impairment', 'language processing', 'mortality', 'neuroimaging', 'neurophysiology', 'patient response', 'phonology', 'post stroke', 'predicting response', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'speech processing', 'stroke patient', 'stroke survivor', 'stroke-induced aphasia', 'success', 'theories', 'treatment response', 'trend', 'white matter']",NIDCD,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA AT COLUMBIA,P50,2019,372500,0.14926284909314058
"Development and Acceptability of an Ambient In-Home Activity Assessment Tool for Stroke 1. Project Summary/Abstract  Stroke is the leading cause of serious, long-term disability in the United States and those that do not exercise or engage in regular activity are at a 30% increased risk of experiencing a recurrent stroke. One-on- one rehabilitation sessions are frequently limited in number due to insurance regulations and therapists (physical and occupational) frequently prescribe home-based exercise programs. These programs historically have low adherence rates and patient report can often be biased, incomplete, or inaccurate. Wearable sensors can track amount of activity but these sensors are limited in scope and cannot discern between various activities. Depth sensors can be used in the home to detect falls and monitor in-home gait patterns of well older adults. Other researchers have used depth sensors to detect and discern activities in laboratories or mock home environments with a population without any disabilities. In this proposal, the Daily Activity Recognition and Assessment System (DARAS) will merge prior ambient depth sensor work with newly developed algorithms to objectively and accurately measure the amount and type of activity of people with stroke living at home. This will be completed in three specific aims. The DARAS algorithms will be developed and refined for recognizing activities of people with stroke in the kitchen environment using the Foresite depth sensor. These algorithms will be trained using real-world data from lab-based testing with individuals with stroke (n =10). We will refine the Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) based algorithm for accurately segmenting and recognizing activities from untrimmed processing of depth videos. The developed activity recognition system will be deployed in the homes of 10 individuals with stroke over the course of 1 year. To determine the impact on daily life and acceptability of the system and generated data, focus groups will be held with 10 individuals with stroke. The DARAS developed in this proposal will provide a novel outcome assessment for a variety of post-stroke interventions and provide occupational therapists the ability to detect declines in performance early on and intervene. 8. Project Narrative Stroke is the leading cause of serious, long-term disability in the United States and those that do not engage in regular activity are at a 30% increased risk of experiencing a second stroke. Self-monitoring and self-report of home-based activity and exercise is highly subjective and provides little value to rehabilitation clinicians and their clients with stroke.

"Enhancing Stroke Prehospital and Emergency Evaluation and Delivery (E-SPEED) Nearly 800,000 people in the United States (US) each year are affected by stroke, which remains the leading cause of adult disability and 5th leading cause of death. Despite the proliferation of stroke centers nationwide, access to timely stroke care and evidence-based therapies is still poor with multiple inefficiencies, redundancies, errors, and system-based barriers that lead to care fragmentation. A stroke system of care that integrates and coordinates care between non-stroke center hospitals, primary stroke centers, and comprehensive stroke centers has been recommended since it would reduce stroke-related deaths by 20,000 annually in the US and nearly 400,000 worldwide. This proposal is significant because it addresses two important gaps in knowledge about the acute evaluation and treatment of stroke patients: prehospital screening errors and delays in inter-hospital transfer. The Enhancing Stroke Prehospital and Emergency Evaluation and Delivery (E-SPEED) study will (1) enhance existing LVO screening tools, assess whether machine learning approaches improve LVO prediction, and evaluate the impact of an Enhanced LVO Screening Tool in the prehospital setting; and (2) use learning collaboratives and simulations to design, implement, and pilot test a new inter-hospital stroke transfer protocol. We bring together systems engineers and stroke health service researchers in a novel collaboration that will produce generalizable knowledge that can be widely applied to other urban regions of the country and provide preliminary data and demonstration of novel approaches that could be evaluated in large-scale comparative effectiveness studies across multiple regions.

"Longitudinal and quantitative MR plaque imaging for prediction of response to medical management in symptomatic intracranial atherosclerosis ABSTRACT Intracranial atherosclerotic disease (ICAD) is one of the most common causes of ischemic stroke worldwide. Despite intensive medical management, the current standard of care for secondary stroke prevention, the rate of recurrent stroke is 13% in the first year and as high as 35% in certain populations by 2 years. Currently, the initial and follow-up evaluations of these patients rely exclusively on assessments of clinical risk factors and, in some circumstances, the degree of luminal stenosis on imaging. However, this strategy may overlook subtle non-luminal changes within ICAD lesions. A tool that can directly probe atherosclerotic plaques and accurately quantify longitudinal changes of plaque features may help early identify non-responsive patients in whom an alternative therapy can be initiated. Magnetic resonance (MR) vessel wall imaging (VWI) has the potential to fulfill this role because of its compacity to directly visualize the vessel wall and characterize plaque features. However, there are several technical challenges associated with intracranial VWI: small size, tortuous course, and deep sitting warrant a high-resolution and 3D imaging approach; multiple lesion sites require a large imaging view; signals arising from neighboring blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) need to be adequately suppressed; relatively long imaging time and potential image corruption by patient motion; and lack of dedicated plaque analysis tools particularly for 3D dataset. In this proposal, we will develop a reliable 3D VWI- based MR plaque imaging (MRPI) strategy for prediction of response to medical management in symptomatic ICAD. Specifically, we will first develop a whole-brain 3D VWI sequence with intracranial vessel-dedicated motion compensation and motion-adaptive imaging acceleration (Aim1-Task1) and develop an automated intracranial vessel wall (IVA) tool integrating 3D vessel wall segmentation and computational algorithms for deriving quantitative plaque features (Aim1-Task2) followed by a validation study (Aim1-Task3). The validated techniques will then be used in a cross-sectional study to determine the MRPI-derived quantitative plaque features that are associated with ICAD lesions within the infarcted territory in patients with acute symptomatic ICAD (Aim 2). We will finally conduct a longitudinal study to determine the capacity of longitudinal and quantitative MRPI to predict response to medical management in symptomatic ICAD patients (Aim 3). Successful completion of the project will validate the compacity of VWI-based MRPI to quantitatively characterize ICAD and predict response to medical management in symptomatic ICAD patients. This will open the door to future clinical trials investigating the role of MRPI in developing personalized management paradigms and assessing new therapies. PROJECT NARRATIVE Atherosclerosis in the brain is an important cause of ischemic stroke worldwide and carries a high risk of recurrent stroke despite treatment.

"Direct 3D Reconstruction Methods for Electrical Impedance Tomography for Stroke Imaging Project Summary Every four minutes an American dies from stroke, equating to approximately 1 in every 19 US deaths annually. Strokes are classiﬁed as ischemic and hemorrhagic. Ischemic strokes make up 87% of all strokes and are caused by a blockage in a blood vessel (or artery) resulting in a lack of blood to the brain. A hemorrhagic stroke occurs when an artery in the brain leaks or ruptures releasing excess blood in or around the brain. Incorrect classiﬁcation can have dire consequences as treating a patient suffering from a hemorrhagic stroke (bleed) with anticoagulant drugs (used to dissolve blood clots for ischemic strokes) can prove fatal. Early action is of the utmost importance as each passing minute that brain cells lack the proper blood ﬂow additional cells die. Current classiﬁcation methods require tests performed at the hospital, e.g., CT or MRI scans of the patient's brain, leading to treatment delays. These delays are particularly lengthy for patients living in rural communities.  Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT) is an emerging medical imaging modality that is inexpensive, has no ionizing radiation, and provides portable high-contrast images using harmless surface current and voltage measurements (e.g., on the head using a ﬂexible hat) to recover the internal point-wise electrical properties (e.g., inside the brain). EIT can recover conductivity, a measure of how easily current ﬂows through a material, as well as permittivity, a measure of the ability of a material to store a charge. A hemorrhagic stroke corresponds to an area of abnormally high conductivity due to the bleed, whereas an ischemic stroke presents as an area of lower conductivity than expected due cellular swelling from energy failure.  The proposed project addresses the important problem of early, fast, portable stroke classiﬁcation with EIT. A critical barrier for the use of EIT for stroke imaging has been the sensitivity of the image reconstruction algorithms to incorrect domain modeling and noise in the data. Due to these challenges, most research has focused on monitoring applications, not helpful for the classiﬁcation task. By contrast, the D-bar reconstruction method proposed here is the only proven noise and modeling error robust reconstruction method capable of recovering the true conductivity/permittivity using a low-pass ﬁltering in a nonlinear Fourier domain. D-bar methods have been successful in 2D but their development in 3D is stunted. This proposal focuses on the development of fast, robust D-bar based reconstruction methods for the 3D partial boundary problem, critical to working with stroke EIT data. Numerical algorithms will be developed for the full and partial boundary problems in 3D and validated on simulated and experimental data. A priori information, from anatomical atlases, will be embedded into the methods for increased resolution and stability. As the low-pass ﬁltering in D-bar methods leads to blurred reconstructions, post-processing through Convolutional Neural Networks will provide improved image quality. This work will be the ﬁrst to develop robust computational algorithms for 3D EIT data, opening the door for stroke imaging. Project Narrative Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT), a portable imaging modality may provide early classiﬁcation of stroke type reducing treatment delays thus leading to improved patient outcomes. Existing image reconstruction algorithms for EIT are not robust to practical partial boundary data inherent to stroke imaging. Robust D-bar methods, aided with a priori information from anatomical atlases, will be developed in 3D to address the stroke classiﬁcation and monitoring tasks from practical EIT data.",Direct 3D Reconstruction Methods for Electrical Impedance Tomography for Stroke Imaging,9726802,R21EB028064,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Alteplase', 'Ambulances', 'American', 'Anatomy', 'Anticoagulants', 'Area', 'Arteries', 'Atlases', 'Benign', 'Blood', 'Blood Vessels', 'Blood flow', 'Brain', 'Brain hemorrhage', 'Brain imaging', 'Bypass', 'Cancerous', 'Cells', 'Cerebral hemisphere hemorrhage', 'Cessation of life', 'Charge', 'Chemicals', 'Classification', 'Computational algorithm', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Drug usage', 'Electric Conductivity', 'Electrodes', 'Failure', 'Fourier Transform', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Head', 'Health', 'Hemorrhage', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Image', 'Ionizing radiation', 'Ischemic Stroke', 'Lead', 'Location', 'MRI Scans', 'Mathematics', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Rupture', 'Rural Community', 'Scanning', 'Stroke', 'Surface', 'Swelling', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Validation', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'brain cell', 'cancer classification', 'contrast imaging', 'convolutional neural network', 'cranium', 'deep learning', 'electrical impedance tomography', 'electrical property', 'flexibility', 'follow-up', 'human subject', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'mathematical methods', 'portability', 'reconstruction', 'stroke patient', 'theories', 'tumor', 'voltage']",NIBIB,MARQUETTE UNIVERSITY,R21,2019,152334,0.22671018510738927
"Automated Assessment of Leptomeningeal Collaterals on CT Angiograms Abstract  The primary goal of this study is to develop an automated scoring system of leptomeningeal collaterals based on CT angiography (CTA) as a quantitative assessment of acute ischemic stroke. Leptomeningeal collaterals provide an alternate path of blood flow in the setting of a proximal vessel occlusion. The presence and effectiveness of leptomeningeal collaterals (i.e., “collateral status”) varies significantly from patient to patient. Collateral status has been shown to be correlated with both patient outcome and risk of hemorrhagic transformation, suggesting that rapid and accurate assessment of the collaterals would provide a powerful tool for treatment evaluation. The current gold standard for collateral scoring is performed by subjective analysis of retrograde filling in invasive digital subtraction angiograms (DSA). Though CTA is more limited than DSA in the direct evaluation of collaterals, the presence of collaterals may also be evaluated in CTA by the tree-pattern of vessel filling around the site of occlusion. Several manual assessment techniques based on CTA have been proposed in the literature, but all are subjective and require significant human intervention.  During Phase I, we deployed a web-based system for automated assessment of stroke collaterals based on CTA, and we used it in a preliminary study of collateral status for stroke assessment.  In this Phase II STTR proposal, the specific aims are (1) to improve the integration of our system with clinical workflows; (2) expand the system to also compute CT perfusion stroke measures, so as to provide a unified platform for comparing and combining CTA collateral and CT perfusion assessment metrics; and (3) test the hypotheses that the combined use of CTA collateral and CT perfusion measures outperforms either method independently for treatment efficacy prediction in stroke patients. Narrative  Leptomeningeal collateral vessels provide connections between vascular territories in the brain when occlusions occur, e.g., when a person suffers a stroke. The number and connectivity of collateral vessels varies significantly from patient to patient, and they have been shown to play an important role in stroke outcomes, providing blood flow to tissue at risk. Rapid and effective patient-specific determination of the presence and connectivity of collaterals is needed in acute stroke situations to determine which treatments will be effective. We propose to develop an automated system to evaluate collateral vessel trees from computed tomography angiography (CTA) images and to offer that system as an algorithms-as-a-service (AaaS) product.",Automated Assessment of Leptomeningeal Collaterals on CT Angiograms,9786246,R42NS086295,"['Academia', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Angiography', 'Blood Pressure', 'Blood Vessels', 'Blood flow', 'Brain', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffusion', 'Distal', 'Doctor of Medicine', 'Effectiveness', 'Evaluation', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Hemorrhage', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Hypertension', 'Image', 'Industry', 'Infarction', 'Intervention', 'Intraobserver Variability', 'Intravenous', 'Ischemic Stroke', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Odds Ratio', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Patient risk', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perfusion', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Privatization', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Recurrence', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Running', 'Security', 'Services', 'Site', 'Small Business Technology Transfer Research', 'Standardization', 'Stroke', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thrombolytic Therapy', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Trees', 'Triage', 'Visualization software', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'acute stroke', 'base', 'computer science', 'cost effective', 'deep learning algorithm', 'design', 'digital', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'innovation', 'open source', 'outcome prediction', 'post stroke', 'product development', 'prospective', 'prototype', 'research clinical testing', 'research study', 'statistics', 'stroke outcome', 'stroke patient', 'thrombolysis', 'tool', 'treatment arm', 'web services']",NINDS,"KITWARE, INC.",R42,2019,487383,0.17814192567430184
"DISCOVERY: Determinants of Incident Stroke Cognitive Outcomes and Vascular Effects on RecoverY Stroke is the major cause of an adult disability epidemic in the US, with a major contribution from post-stroke cognitive impairment and dementia (PSCID), the rates of which are disproportionally high among the health disparity populations. Despite the PSCID’s overwhelming impact on public health, a knowledge gap exists with regard to the complex interaction between the acute stroke event and highly prevalent pre-existing brain pathology related to cerebrovascular (VCID) and Alzheimer’s disease, or related dementia (AD/ADRD). Understanding the factors that modulate PSCID risk in relation to index stroke event is critically important for developing personalized prognostication of PSCID, targeted interventions to prevent PSCID, and informing future clinical trial design. In response to this critical challenge, we propose Determinants of Incident Stroke Cognitive Outcomes and Vascular Effects on RecoverY (DISCOVERY), a collaborative network of clinical sites with access to acute stroke populations and the expertise and capacity for systematic assessment of PSCID led by a team of recognized experts in VCID, AD, acute stroke, health disparities, and multi-center research. The overarching goal of this proposal is to determine which specific subsets of stroke events cause (or do not cause) PSCID and which additional demographic (sex, race, ethnicity), clinical factors and comorbidities that synergize with acute stroke to result in or prevent PSCID. The overall scientific objective of this study is to elucidate mechanisms of brain resilience/susceptibility to PSCID in diverse US populations based on complex interplay between life-course exposure to multiple vascular risk factors, pre-existing burden of microvascular and neurodegenerative pathology, the effect of strategic acute stroke lesions, and the mediating effect of genomic/epigenomic variation. We will achieve this goal by implementing the DISCOVERY Network of 30 clinical sites, which under the leadership of the Administrative Core and guided by the research strategy delineated by the Recruitment and Retention, Statistics, and Repository Cores, will conduct a prospective, multi- center, observational, nested-cohort study of 8,000 nondemented ischemic and hemorrhagic incident stroke patients within 72 hours of symptom onset, who will be followed for a minimum of 2 years, with serial cognitive evaluations and assessments of functional outcome, with subsets undergoing research MRI and PET and comprehensive genetic/genomic and fluid biomarker testing. In a series of systematic, hypothesis driven experiments we will: 1) identify the independent and combined effect of the acute stroke lesion, pre-existing burden of disease, and baseline markers of brain resilience on PSCID; 2) examine the role of acute stroke as a critical factor in accelerating AD/ADRD and VCID pathology leading to PSCID; and 3) develop two distinct generalizable personalized-medicine models for individual patient outcome prediction and patient selection for clinical trials. DISCOVERY will become a landmark study to unravel the mechanisms of post-stroke cognitive disability, early stroke recovery, and potential targets for personalized prevention, intervention, and rehabilitation. Stroke-related disability - including cognitive impairment and dementia - is a public health epidemic and a key national research priority in the United States. Because of its disproportionately high impact on health disparity populations, understanding the mechanisms of post-stroke cognitive decline is a matter of equitable health care delivery. DISCOVERY, the proposed collaborative nationwide network of clinical sites with access to diverse acute stroke US populations has the expertise, experience and capacity to execute a large prospective study that will unravel the mechanisms of post-stroke cognitive disability, early recovery after stroke, and potential targets for personalized prevention, intervention, and rehabilitation.",DISCOVERY: Determinants of Incident Stroke Cognitive Outcomes and Vascular Effects on RecoverY,9918026,U19NS115388,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Amyloid beta-Protein', 'Aneurysmal Subarachnoid Hemorrhages', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood Vessels', 'Brain', 'Brain Injuries', 'Brain Pathology', 'Caring', 'Cerebral hemisphere hemorrhage', 'Characteristics', 'Classification Scheme', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Cognitive', 'Cohort Studies', 'Comorbidity', 'Complex', 'Dementia', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemic', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Exposure to', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Hemorrhage', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Impaired cognition', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Trial', 'Ischemic Stroke', 'Knowledge', 'Leadership', 'Lesion', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Liquid substance', 'Location', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurable', 'Mediating', 'Methylation', 'Microvascular Dysfunction', 'Modeling', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Patient Selection', 'Patients', 'Perfusion', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Predisposition', 'Prevention trial', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Process', 'Prospective Studies', 'Public Health', 'Race', 'Recovery', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Research Priority', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Series', 'Serum', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translations', 'United States', 'Variant', 'acute stroke', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'cerebrovascular', 'clinical application', 'clinical research site', 'cognitive disability', 'cognitive load', 'cohort', 'deep learning', 'dementia risk', 'disability', 'epigenomics', 'exome sequencing', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'functional outcomes', 'genome wide association study', 'health care delivery', 'health disparity', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'indexing', 'individual patient', 'individualized prevention', 'morphometry', 'multiple omics', 'neuroimaging', 'non-demented', 'outcome prediction', 'patient stratification', 'personalized medicine', 'population based', 'post stroke', 'post stroke cognitive impairment', 'prevent', 'prognostic', 'prospective', 'recruit', 'repository', 'resilience', 'response', 'sex', 'statistics', 'stroke event', 'stroke patient', 'stroke recovery', 'tau Proteins', 'vascular risk factor']",NINDS,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,U19,2019,5026638,0.22095008443770606
"A Machine Learning Approach to Classifying Time Since Stroke using Medical Imaging PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Stroke is a leading cause of mortality and morbidity in the United States, with approximately 795,000 Americans experiencing a new or recurrent stroke each year. Intravenous tissue plasminogen activator (IV tPA) is the dominant and most proven treatment option, but its use is only indicated within 4.5 hours following a stroke. Unfortunately, up to 30% of stroke patients present with an unknown time since stroke (TSS) symptom onset, which makes them ineligible to receive IV tPA. Many of these individuals could be spared severe morbidity or mortality if there existed an alternative method for establishing TSS, allowing them to be identified and treated. This proposal will develop machine learning methods to create a physiologically grounded method for predicting TSS based on multiparametric magnetic resonance (MR) and computed tomography (CT) imaging data. We believe our proposed techniques will outperform state-of-the-art methods that are based on subjective image interpretation, and have the potential to provide an objective data point that may be used in conjunction with the subjective assessments of experts, or in clinical environments that lack expertise in stroke imaging Research has established that MR and CT imaging captures information that correlates with TSS. However, existing methods for extracting this information are based on a physician subjectively interpreting the images and delineating regions of interest, processes that have been documented to have only weak to moderate agreement across trained expert reviewers. An automated approach that comprehensively analyzes the spectrum of imaging data could identify complex relationships across channels that more accurately classify TSS. For example, in MR, diffusion-weighted, perfusion-weighted, and fluid attenuated inversion recovery imaging all play important roles in characterizing a stroke, but a deep understanding of how each channel may be combined to describe TSS is unknown. We propose to establish new deep learning methods for fusing this information. Specifically, we will: 1) develop a machine learning framework for classifying TSS; 2) develop a deep convolutional autoencoder to generate novel multimodal image representations from MR and CT to improve classification; and 3) implement visualization techniques that elucidate the relationship between deep features and pathophysiological stroke processes. Under this project, we will use data from the UCLA and UCI Stroke Centers, allowing us to study different patient populations and imaging techniques. The successful completion of this research will provide a new method for estimating TSS from imaging, leading to new prospective trials for providing therapy to patients with unknown TSS. PROJECT NARRATIVE Stroke is a leading cause of death in the United States, with approximately 795,000 Americans experiencing a new or recurrent stroke each year; however patients who present with an unknown stroke onset time are ineli- gible for receiving the leading therapy.

"Data-driven subtyping to find patients with drug interactions leading to stroke Project Summary Stroke is a highly heterogeneous and complex disease and is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Identification of the cause of disease is essential for risk stratification and optimal treatment, but can be difficult, as up to 35% of causes are undetermined by traditional subtyping criteria and very few causative genetic variants have been found. In addition, certain causes may be hidden within the clinical picture of a patient, such as an adverse drug reaction. Using data-driven approaches to analyze the medical records of patients may uncover novel patterns of risk factors and clinical features leading to stroke. The long-term goal of this research is to identify novel subtypes of highly heterogeneous diseases such as stroke and to reduce the genetic heterogeneity of a disease cohort by identifying patients with the same subtype. The objective of this application is to propose a pipeline that applies a data-driven analysis of medical notes to identify novel subtypes of stroke, focus on a subtype caused by an adverse drug reaction or drug pair interaction, validate the subtype in a genotyped study cohort, and look for gene variant enrichment in this cohort. This application’s central hypothesis is that applying deep learning to the electronic health record (EHR) of acute ischemic stroke patients will form subtypes based on more granular information than currently implemented and with reduced genetic heterogeneity by identifying novel patterns of risk factors and clinical picture leading to the stroke. In addition, we hypothesize that at least one subtype will identify patients whose stroke is an adverse drug reaction or drug-drug interaction. To do this, Aim 1 will first identify all acute ischemic stroke patients in the EHR by developing a machine learning classifier trained on structured data in the EHR. Aim 2 will then build and train an unsupervised deep learning algorithm on text from medical notes to identify clusters, or subtypes, of patients with similar clinical pictures. Aim 3 will finally validate reduction in genetic heterogeneity of these cohorts by estimating observational heritability of all subtypes using a tool created in our lab and comparing this with the heritability estimates of subtypes derived from physician-based criteria. It will also focus on a not well-studied subtype, stroke due to an adverse drug reaction or drug-drug interaction, by identifying its enrichment in the novel subtypes, validating this subtype in a study cohort with genotyped data, and finally looking for enrichment of pharmacogenetic variants in this subtype. These aims will generate a computational pipeline that identifies novel subtypes of acute ischemic stroke, enabling improved future genetic studies by reducing genetic heterogeneity of cohorts and improved understanding of the underlying causes of the disease. Project Narrative Stroke is a highly complex disease that is a leading cause of death and severe disability. Identifying the cause of stroke is essential for risk stratification and optimal treatment, but up to a third of cases are of undetermined cause, and very few genetic variants have been identified due to the heterogeneity of the disease. To address this, this research proposal develops a computational pipeline that applies data-driven deep learning to medical notes to identify novel combinations of environmental, genetic, and medical risk factors causing the disease; this tool may clarify the etiology of unknown stroke cases, provide cohorts of patients enriched with similar genetic variants, and be expanded to subtype any disease.",Data-driven subtyping to find patients with drug interactions leading to stroke,9469853,F30HL140946,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Blood flow', 'Brain', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Categories', 'Cause of Death', 'Cerebrovascular Disorders', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Cohort Studies', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Disease', 'Drug Interactions', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Etiology', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Heterogeneity', 'Genetic study', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Hemorrhage', 'Heritability', 'Internet', 'Ischemic Stroke', 'Learning', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Medical', 'Medical Records', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Nervous System Physiology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacogenetics', 'Physicians', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Reaction', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Proposals', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk stratification', 'Semantics', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Training', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'acute stroke', 'base', 'case control', 'cohort', 'deep learning', 'disability', 'disease diagnosis', 'disease heterogeneity', 'experience', 'falls', 'forest', 'genetic risk factor', 'genetic variant', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'mortality', 'novel', 'optimal treatments', 'patient population', 'patient subsets', 'population based', 'stroke patient', 'stroke recovery', 'tool', 'unsupervised learning']",NHLBI,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,F30,2018,49524,0.14963983100186376
"Motor cortex network dynamics driving stroke recovery PROJECT SUMMARY Ischemic stroke is the most common cause of disability in US, with motor impairment being the most common form of disability. Rehabilitation therapies remain a mainstay treatment during recovery, but are not very effective for those with moderate to severe upper extremity weakness. Physical and pharmacologic interventions could become more effective if recovery mechanisms were better understood. The studies proposed here will use cutting-edge techniques to dissect the mechanisms of post-stroke recovery at the level of cortical neuronal networks. The principal investigator (PI) is a board-certified neurologist, and has extensive training in neuroscience, stroke neurobiology, and clinical management of patients with neurological diseases. The long- term goal is to understand relationships between the cortical neural network and the motor behaviors with a focus on motor recovery. The proposed research and career development plans will provide the necessary training, mentorship and experience to launch the PI’s career as a successful, R01-funded clinician-scientist. The PI has recently developed deep learning (a branch of machine learning) tools for automated and unbiased analysis of animal behavioral imaging data. Preliminary data demonstrate that, by using these automated tools, 3D kinematics of paw movements can be obtained during a food pellet reaching task in a head-fixed mouse, distinct neural activity patterns emerge in the primary motor cortex (M1) during motor learning of the skilled reaching, and stroke induces changes in the kinematics of the reaching behavior. In the proposed studies, the following specific hypotheses will be tested: stable neuronal network activity patterns emerge in M1 during motor learning (Aim-1); these M1 activity patterns destabilize after a stroke and sensorimotor disconnection (Aim-2); and new M1 activity patterns emerge after post-stroke task-specific rehabilitation (Aim-3). The PI will use, and be further trained on state-of-the-art techniques to record neural population activity (two-photon calcium imaging), to label and silence projection neurons (retro-AAVs and designer-receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs), and to analyze the kinematics of the behavior (deep learning tools). For this purpose, he has assembled a strong mentorship team with experts in their respective fields: Primary mentor Dr. Peyman Golshani (two-photon calcium imaging and analysis in behaving animals), as well as co-mentors, Dr. S. Thomas Carmichael (stroke recovery research), Dr. Jonathan Kao (neural dynamics analysis in motor cortex), and clinically, Dr. Bruce Dobkin (translational neurorehabilitation). The mentored research will be complemented with course work on state-space methods, biostatistics, bioethics, deep learning, responsible conduct of research, and grant writing; as well as improvement of professional skills by publishing manuscripts, presenting at meetings, and participating in workshops on leadership and management. By the end of K08 award, it is expected that the PI will obtain R01 funding as a clinician-scientist and independent investigator, focused on understanding mechanisms of the neural networks that can be modulated to improve motor behavior after stroke. PROJECT NARRATIVE Understanding the mechanisms of motor recovery will ultimately lead to better therapies for stroke recovery. In the proposed research, we aim to elucidate the motor recovery process by investigating the precise activity patterns of brain cells during skilled reaching movements that will be kinematically analyzed by novel automated tools. These brain-behavior correlations will generate fundamental knowledge about stroke recovery to inform new interventions that can reduce the burden of disability caused by stroke.",Motor cortex network dynamics driving stroke recovery,9647161,K08NS109315,"['Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Automobile Driving', 'Award', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Bioethics', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Biometry', 'Brain region', 'Calcium', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Complement', 'Control Groups', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Development Plans', 'Educational workshop', 'Food', 'Forelimb', 'Foundations', 'Functional Imaging', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Impairment', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Ischemic Stroke', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuscripts', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Motor', 'Motor Cortex', 'Movement', 'Mus', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurologist', 'Neurons', 'Neurorehabilitation', 'Neurosciences', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmacology', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Population Dynamics', 'Principal Investigator', 'Process', 'Publishing', 'Recovery', 'Recovery of Function', 'Rehabilitation Research', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Sensory', 'Somatosensory Cortex', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Upper Extremity', 'Work', 'Writing', 'brain behavior', 'brain cell', 'career', 'career development', 'deep learning', 'designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs', 'disability', 'disability burden', 'experience', 'functional restoration', 'imaging modality', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'joint mobilization', 'kinematics', 'meetings', 'motor impairment', 'motor learning', 'motor recovery', 'nervous system disorder', 'network dysfunction', 'neural circuit', 'neuromechanism', 'neuron loss', 'neuronal circuitry', 'novel', 'post stroke', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'research and development', 'responsible research conduct', 'sensory cortex', 'skills', 'stroke recovery', 'stroke rehabilitation', 'stroke therapy', 'tool', 'two-photon']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,K08,2018,213840,0.16222387597377155
"Quantitative Rehabilitation after Stroke PROJECT SUMMARY Stroke causes significant disability, and recovery is often incomplete. In animal models of stroke, robust upper extremity (UE) motor recovery can be elicited if high doses of functional training are given early. In humans, however, the optimal training dose is unknown, because no quantitative dose-response trials have been undertaken in the first months after stroke. This deficiency stems from a lack of measurement instruments that can accurately and easily quantify UE functional training dose and recovery. To address this gap, this proposal will generate two new measurement tools to enable quantitative stroke recovery research. The first tool (Aim 1) will quantify the number of functional movements made during stroke rehabilitation, measuring UE training dose. The second tool (Aim 2) will quantify the abnormality of movements, measuring UE recovery and response to interventions. We will combine wireless motion capture and computational methodologies to create objective, precise, and user-friendly tools. Inertial measurement units, worn by individuals with stroke and healthy controls performing various activities, will capture upper body motion. In Aim 1, machine learning algorithms will be trained to identify and count functional movements in activities normally practiced during rehabilitation. In Aim 2, functional principal components analysis will quantify movement impairment and compensation in standardized motions. Validity will be determined by correlating tool outcomes with current gold standards. The proposed study will be conducted at New York University, in collaboration with investigators from the NYU Center for Data Science, Columbia University, and Washington University-St. Louis. Each have complementary expertise in machine learning, functional data analysis, and functional movement identification. This K02 Independent Scientist Award will provide the candidate with skill in advanced motion capture and analytical methodologies needed to study stroke rehabilitation and recovery. The career development plan includes personalized tutorials and coursework combined with longitudinal oversight of data analysis, providing an excellent foundation for launching an independent research career. Ultimately, the developed tools have the potential to immediately impact neurorehabilitation research, facilitating the rigorous dose-response trials so critically needed to change clinical practice and improve stroke outcomes. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research is relevant to public health, because it will enable the precise and feasible measurement of rehabilitation and recovery after stroke. The generated measurement tools will facilitate important stroke recovery research, which is expected to inform stroke rehabilitation practices and reduce the burden of stroke disability.",Quantitative Rehabilitation after Stroke,9552938,K02NS104207,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Collaborations', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Science', 'Development Plans', 'Dose', 'Dyskinetic syndrome', 'Ensure', 'Felis catus', 'Financial compensation', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Independent Scientist Award', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Motion', 'Movement', 'Neurorehabilitation', 'New York', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Public Health', 'Radial', 'Recovery', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Speed', 'Standardization', 'Stroke', 'Survivors', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Upper Extremity', 'Washington', 'Wireless Technology', 'Work', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical practice', 'clinically relevant', 'disability', 'experience', 'improved', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'kinematics', 'motor impairment', 'motor recovery', 'novel', 'response', 'sensor', 'skills', 'stem', 'stroke model', 'stroke outcome', 'stroke patient', 'stroke recovery', 'stroke rehabilitation', 'tool', 'user-friendly']",NINDS,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,K02,2018,208791,0.24810703481983223
"Enabling Comparative Effectiveness Research in Silent Brain Infarction Through Natural Language Processing and Big Data It is a common clinical occurrence that neuroimaging scans obtained in the course of routine clinical care discover a prior brain infarction in patients with no history of stroke or transient ischemic attack. Indeed, epidemiologic studies indicate that silent brain infarctions (SBI) are far more common than strokes; MRI- defined SBI can be detected in ~20% of the healthy elderly. In these studies based on screened patients, the findings have been shown to be associated with subtle, typically unrecognized, deficits in physical and cognitive function. These imaging findings are also strong, independent risk factors for future stroke and dementia. Despite the very high prevalence of SBI in screened populations, and their serious consequences, little is known about the significance or the appropriate management of SBI when discovered incidentally in routine care. While there is strong evidence that antiplatelet therapy and statin therapy are effective in preventing recurrent stroke in patients with prior stroke, the degree to which these results apply to patients with SBI is unclear. Because patients with SBI define a population that falls in between primary and secondary stroke prevention, the approach to these patients is marked by uncertainty and practice variation, making it an ideal condition for observational comparative effectiveness research. Nonetheless, there are serious challenges for the study of SBI. As patients have no overt symptoms, recruitment into a trial can be problematic. Comparative effectiveness research on SBI, using routinely collected data and leveraging the variation in care of these patients, is impeded by the fact that there are no ICD codes for SBI, and it is generally not included in structured fields of electronic health records (EHR) as it is typically considered an incidental finding. In order to establish the comparative effectiveness of treatment strategies for SBI in a large, heterogeneous population, we propose to develop Natural Language Processing (NLP) algorithms to identify individuals with SBI through the automated review of neuroradiology reports. We have performed preliminary work to demonstrate that such an approach is feasible. We will then apply state-of-the-science observational comparative effectiveness methods in a massive database with linked EHR and claims data to examine the effectiveness of statins and antiplatelet agents in preventing future stroke and dementia. Thus, our aims are: Aim 1: We will develop NLP algorithms that can accurately identify cases of SBI and white matter disease (WMD) in two different health systems. Aim 2: We will port, refine, and validate the NLP algorithm in a large heterogeneous database including more than 600 hospitals and 6500 clinics and identify a large cohort of patients with routinely-discovered SBI and WMD. Aim 3: We will characterize the cohort with respect to age- specific prevalence of SBI, management patterns, and the risk of future stroke and dementia associated with SBI and WMD. Aim 4: We will estimate the comparative effectiveness of preventive therapies (statins and antiplatelet agents) on the risk of future stroke and dementia in patients with incidentally-discovered SBI. The goal of this project is to improve the evidence base for the prevention of stroke in patients with “silent brain infarct”—i.e., a stroke on neuroimaging (head CT or MRI) but no clinical evidence of a stroke. We will develop a computer-based algorithm using a technology known as natural language processing that can accurately identify cases of silent brain infarction among a large population of adults on whom neuroimages have been obtained, but who are without a history of clinically-evident cerebrovascular disease. We will estimate the comparative effectiveness of medications (statins and antiplatelet agents) on the risk of future stroke and dementia in patients with incidentally discovered and reported SBI.",Enabling Comparative Effectiveness Research in Silent Brain Infarction Through Natural Language Processing and Big Data,9474690,R01NS102233,"['Adult', 'Age', 'Age-Years', 'Algorithms', 'American Heart Association', 'American Stroke Association', 'Antiplatelet Drugs', 'Big Data', 'Blood Vessels', 'Brain', 'Brain Infarction', 'Caring', 'Cerebrovascular Disorders', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Effectiveness', 'Elderly', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Health Personnel', 'Health system', 'Healthcare Systems', 'High Prevalence', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Incidental Findings', 'Individual', 'Infarction', 'Informatics', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'International Classification of Disease Codes', 'Knowledge', 'Lesion', 'Link', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Medical center', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physical Function', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention approach', 'Prevention trial', 'Preventive therapy', 'Process', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recurrence', 'Reporting', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Scanning', 'Science', 'Stroke', 'Stroke prevention', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Technology', 'Transient Ischemic Attack', 'Translating', 'Uncertainty', 'Variant', 'White Matter Disease', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'case finding', 'clinical care', 'clinical practice', 'cognitive function', 'cohort', 'comparative effectiveness', 'effectiveness research', 'epidemiology study', 'evidence base', 'falls', 'improved', 'learning progression', 'member', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'patient population', 'patient screening', 'prevent', 'recruit', 'repository', 'routine care', 'screening', 'treatment strategy']",NINDS,TUFTS MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2018,681151,0.18765106373277018
"A Functional Upper Limb Training and Assessment Tool to Enhance Efficacy and Scalability of Rehabilitation in Ecological Environments ABSTRACT Impairments following stroke make it one of the leading causes of disability. Many individuals with stroke do not recover complete function of the upper limb at time of discharge from clinical services . Moreover, early stage improvements may wane following the cessation of formal therapies. Regaining as much upper limb function as possible is important, as even mild impairments are associated with limitations in daily function and lower health- related quality of life. Thus, finding ways to augment functional mobility is important. The overarching purpose of this project is to use portable technology, affordable for home use, to provide objective feedback on performance of upper limb motor tasks to individuals with residual deficits following chronic conditions such as stroke. Objective feedback serves to better inform the participant of their progress and actively engage them in their rehabilitation, thus encouraging self-management of rehabilitation. Results from a recent survey shows therapists predominantly provide patients with stroke written home exercise programs at time of discharge from therapies. With this static approach, patients have a limited capacity to evaluate their motor performance and no encouragement to refine their movement. Creating automated systems that measure and provide feedback will promote a more proactive approach to maximizing function across the lifespan of individuals with chronic conditions. We propose that coupling smart technology found in readily available smartphones with three-dimensional (3D) printing provides a scalable option to provide feedback in long-term rehabilitation and advances the current standard of care, i.e. written home exercise programs. We will build upon our current research, further developing and validating a novel in-home rehabilitation system using 3D printing technologies, smart devices and machine learning algorithms. Specifically, we will use emerging low- cost 3D printing techniques to augment off-the-shelf smart devices (e.g., smartphones) into functional rehabilitation tools. The built-in sensors and our machine learning apps in smartphones can quantify characteristics of movement and provide actionable feedbacks to users during in-home rehabilitation. We hypothesize that feedback will result in improved functional mobility. We will examine performance changes in common activities of daily living (ADLs) trained with our system. With the portable devices, we are able to go further than reporting the typical time metric and also provide feedback on smoothness of movement represented as a normalized cumulative jerk (rate of change of acceleration) score. This assessment provides information on control of movement, an indication of impairment. Recording normalized jerk over time and across activities is a promising way to assess change in impairment. Overall, this scalable design offers an innovative approach to long-term rehabilitation needs of individuals with stroke. PROJECT NARRATIVE Interventions promoting optimum motor performance across the lifespan are a priority after a neurological insult such as stroke. The proposed research incorporates smart devices and 3D printing to create patient-centered rehabilitation devices that are scalable.

"Big Data Neuroimaging to Predict Motor Behavior After Stroke PROJECT SUMMARY  Stroke is a leading cause of serious long-term adult disability around the world. Despite intensive therapy, an estimated 2/3 of stroke survivors do not fully recover and are left unable to care for themselves independently. Growing research suggests that rehabilitation is not “one-size-fits-all”; variability among stroke survivors in terms of lesion location, age, gender, time since stroke and more may all affect a person's likelihood of recovery and response to different types of treatments. Personalized rehabilitation medicine to maximize each individual's recovery potential is thus desperately needed. However, in order to develop accurate, robust, and specific predictive models that can determine an individual's recovery potential and response to different treatments, large, heterogeneous datasets are needed. The current best predictors of stroke outcomes are neuroimaging (MRI) and behavioral biomarkers that look at brain structure/function and motor performance at baseline. Generating a large enough dataset of MRI and behavioral data is extremely difficult and expensive for any one site to do on its own. This proposal addresses this problem by generating a large, diverse dataset using a novel meta-analytic approach that harmonizes post-stroke data collected worldwide. In partnership with an international consortium comprised of over 500 researchers who produce the largest-known neuroimaging and genetic studies of over 18 different diseases (ENIGMA Center for Worldwide Medicine, Imaging, and Genomics), I propose to apply ENIGMA's powerful approach to answer critical questions in stroke recovery. Under this K01 career development award, I will develop skills in big data neuroimaging analytics, clinical research, and consortium building through my ENIGMA Stroke Recovery working group in order to ask questions about stroke recovery using a large dataset approach (goal n>3,000). This project has four specific aims: Aim 1 will leverage ENIGMA's existing methodology to develop the infrastructure, optimal methods, and analysis techniques for harmonizing a large dataset of post-stroke MRI and behavioral data. Aim 2 will use this large dataset to identify neural and behavioral biomarkers predicting recovery of motor impairment (e.g., actual arm movement ability) and recovery of function (e.g., ability to perform tasks, such as picking up objects with the affected arm). Aim 3 will use supervised machine learning to generate and fine-tune highly accurate predictive models of the relationship between these biomarkers and recovery of impairment versus function. Lastly, Aim 4 will use unsupervised machine learning techniques to examine shared properties of outliers from the predictive model and determine additional neurobiological mechanisms that may prevent individuals from recovering. This approach has the potential to revolutionize the way that rehabilitation research is validated, to ensure robust, reliable, and reproducible results. The methods developed here could be extended to other domains of recovery (language, gait), to study other predictors of recovery (functional brain activity, genomics), and to other clinical populations to improve rehabilitation overall. PROJECT NARRATIVE The overall goal of this project is to provide personalized, precise rehabilitation medicine to individuals after stroke by developing accurate predictive models that help us detect who will recover and best respond to different types of post-stroke treatments. Using a novel meta-analytic approach, this project will harmonize datasets of brain imaging and behavioral information across sites worldwide in order to develop a large dataset with thousands of participants.

"Big Data Neuroimaging to Predict Motor Behavior After Stroke PROJECT SUMMARY  Stroke is a leading cause of serious long-term adult disability around the world. Despite intensive therapy, an estimated 2/3 of stroke survivors do not fully recover and are left unable to care for themselves independently. Growing research suggests that rehabilitation is not “one-size-fits-all”; variability among stroke survivors in terms of lesion location, age, gender, time since stroke and more may all affect a person's likelihood of recovery and response to different types of treatments. Personalized rehabilitation medicine to maximize each individual's recovery potential is thus desperately needed. However, in order to develop accurate, robust, and specific predictive models that can determine an individual's recovery potential and response to different treatments, large, heterogeneous datasets are needed. The current best predictors of stroke outcomes are neuroimaging (MRI) and behavioral biomarkers that look at brain structure/function and motor performance at baseline. Generating a large enough dataset of MRI and behavioral data is extremely difficult and expensive for any one site to do on its own. This proposal addresses this problem by generating a large, diverse dataset using a novel meta-analytic approach that harmonizes post-stroke data collected worldwide.

"Whole Transcriptome Studies of Patients with Transient Ischemic Attacks (TIAs) ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Transient ischemic attacks (TIA) are critical to identify because prevention therapy can reduce the risk of future vascular events by > 50%. Diagnostic testing and therapeutic intervention must start as soon as possible because 10-25% of TIAs have a stroke within 90 days. Because so many patients present emergently with transient neurological events the large majority of whom do not go on to have a stroke, methods for identifying TIAs at high risk for stroke have been sought so that work up and treatment can be targeted to those who need it most to save time, money and limited resources. Though the ABCD2 score and brain Diffusion Weighted Imaging-MRI (DWI-MRI) have improved prediction of which TIAs have a stroke, their sensitivity and specificity for prediction of individual cases i poor. In this proposal we propose that peripheral blood leukocytes and platelets play pivotal roles in which TIAs go on to have a stroke and by assessing RNA in whole blood we can evaluate leukocyte and platelet function in TIA patients who go on to have stroke versus those that do not have a stroke. We hypothesize that specific coagulation and immune genes are activated in TIA patients that predispose them to have a stroke by 90 days compared to those TIA patients who do NOT have a stroke by 90 days. A subset of these leukocyte and platelet mRNA genes will predict TIAs who have a stroke by 90 days. This hypothesis is addressed by the following specific aims. Aim #1 (Derivation Cohort): Demonstrate that mRNA expression measured using RNAseq from whole blood differs in a derivation cohort of TIAs that go on to have a stroke by 90 days compared to those TIAs who do not have a stroke by 90 days. Demonstrate that most mRNA found to be regulated using RNAseq are also significantly regulated when measured using qRT-PCR. Aim #2 (Derivation Cohort): Apply machine learning algorithms to the mRNA from Aim #1 to derive an optimal subset of mRNA regulated by both RNAseq and qRT-PCR that predict which TIAs have strokes by 90 days compared to those who do not with >95% sensitivity on cross-validation. Aim #3 (Validation Cohort): Use machine/prediction learning algorithms to demonstrate that the genes from Aim #2 when measured using qRT-PCR on an independent validation cohort predict which TIAs have a stroke by 90 days with >85% sensitivity. The goal of these studies is to discover mRNA profiles in blood that predict which TIA patients go on to have strokes by 90 days. When confirmed in future studies, this will direct in depth testing to those high risk TIAs most in need in order to prevent strokes, and decrease unnecessary testing in those with low risk of stroke. Equally as important, the genes discovered to be associated with high risk of stroke in TIA patients will represent potential novel stroke prevention targets. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will examine RNA in blood using RNAseq and qRT-PCR of human subjects with Transient Ischemic Attacks (TIAs) who have a stroke by 90 days compared to TIAs who do not have a stroke. The regulated mRNA, exons and alternatively spliced transcripts in a Derivation Cohort of TIA patients will be used to predict which TIAs have a stroke by 90 days in a Validation Cohort of TIA patients.",Whole Transcriptome Studies of Patients with Transient Ischemic Attacks (TIAs),9441869,R01NS097000,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Alternative Splicing', 'Area', 'Arterial Fatty Streak', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood Platelets', 'Blood Vessels', 'Brain', 'Cerebrum', 'Clinical', 'Coagulation Process', 'Data', 'Derivation procedure', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Epilepsy', 'Event', 'Exons', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Hour', 'Immune', 'Individual', 'Ischemic Stroke', 'Labyrinthine disorder', 'Learning', 'Leukocytes', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Messenger RNA', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Migraine', 'Neurologic', 'Patients', 'Play', 'Prevention therapy', 'Publishing', 'Quantitative Reverse Transcriptase PCR', 'RNA', 'ROC Curve', 'Recurrence', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Estimate', 'Role', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Site', 'Stroke', 'Stroke prevention', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Transcript', 'Transient Ischemic Attack', 'Validation', 'Whole Blood', 'base', 'cohort', 'emergency settings', 'gene discovery', 'high risk', 'human subject', 'improved', 'mRNA Expression', 'monocyte', 'neutrophil', 'novel', 'peripheral blood', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'release factor', 'stroke risk', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,R01,2018,560820,0.2826061521768155
"Prehospital and Emergency Room Stroke Diagnosis Using Quantitative Cerebral Hemodynamics Large vessel acute ischemic stroke (AIS) is the leading cause of disability and fourth leading cause of death with approximately 250,000 per year in the United States alone. Although treatments including interventional (stentriever) and pharmaceutical (tPA) exist for large vessel occlusion (LVO), there is not a rapid prehospital tool for diagnoses which guides the use of the correct therapy. Because the time to treatment for stroke is critical, there is a large need for a device which can be used in ambulances and other prehospital environments so that patients are rapidly provided the correct care. Currently, computed tomography angiography (CTA) imaging is the standard of care but its use is limited to the hospital or in some cases multimillion dollar stroke on wheels ambulances which are not practical. There is a significant delay that occurs between stroke onset and diagnosis by the time CTA is performed and read resulting in unnecessary death or disability. More delay occurs when patients need to be transferred to a stroke center because the hospital they are at does not perform interventional therapy. Rapid diagnosis in a prehospital setting will enable patients to be taken to the correct hospital and provide LVO location to surgeons in the operating suite.  As the critical factor affecting cerebral anatomy in AIS patients is the limitation of blood flow to the brain the most likely technology to assist in diagnosis of LVO is one that can measure flow directly. Transcranial Doppler (TCD) has been used to directly measure blood flow velocity since 1982 but it relies on a trained operator skilled in both finding the affected vessel as well as interpreting a complicated waveform. Guidelines already exist for how to diagnose LVO with TCD and hospitals with a trained operator currently use it. However, it’s not used in smaller hospitals, urgent care or ambulance settings due to the training requirements.  This work will revolutionize TCD for stroke diagnosis because it removes the need for a trained operator; key for mass adoption of the technology. TCD is already small and portable so it can easily fit in an ambulance similar in size to an automated external defibrillator. This work will use machine learning techniques we have developed to analyze the morphology of TCD waveforms and provide diagnosis information. The key is the ability to remove the operator variability by understanding how waveform morphology of stroke changes based on depth relative to occlusion so that the need to measure in a precise location is eliminated. Our preliminary results show 95% accuracy for LVO diagnosis but we need to broaden our dataset while updating our algorithms. Phase I will use our FDA Cleared Lucid M1 Transcranial Doppler Ultrasound System to measure confirmed stroke subjects after CTA imaging and update our algorithm. Phase II will use algorithms developed in Phase I with a fully automated TCD system we have developed with investor funding that does not require an operator or trained sonographer. We currently have Western IRB approval and are upgrading usability features of the device for ease of use with minimal training. Large vessel acute ischemic stroke (AIS) is the leading cause of disability and fourth leading cause of death with approximately 250,000 per year in the United States alone. This work will reduce the time to treatment for stroke by developing necessary algorithms to diagnose AIS with a portable ultrasound technology which measures cerebral blood flow velocity.

"Whole Genome RNA Sequencing (RNAseq) of Blood from Patients with Lacunar Stroke Abstract  Lacunar strokes are small infarctions of deep penetrator end arteries that supply deep areas of brain including the basal ganglia, internal capsule, thalamus and pons. The “cause” of lacunar strokes has been controversial. C Miller Fisher was the first to suggest that hypertension was one cause, noting lipohyalinosis (inflammation, fibrinoid necrosis of vessel wall) in smaller penetrating arteries (<200um) occurred only in hypertensives. He also showed, however, that larger lacunar strokes were often associated with microatheroma associated narrowing of larger penetrating arteries. This pathology is now thought to be the most common and associated with lipid abnormalities and diabetes. Moreover, some lacunar strokes are now thought to be associated with intracranial atherosclerosis of the parent artery at the origin of the penetrators. Though lacunar strokes were not traditionally associated with large vessel extracranial atherosclerosis or cardioembolism, there are now a number of cases where lacunar strokes have been associated with large vessel atherosclerosis or cardiac causes. Indeed, in our own recent study we showed that as many as ~50% of small deep infarcts (>15mm in size) were predicted to be due to large vessel atherosclerosis or to cardioembolic disease. It is crucial to identify the correct causes of lacunar strokes because treatments differ: drugs for hypertension vs drugs for lipid abnormalities, surgery for large vessel carotid disease, anticoagulants for cardioembolic disease, and anti-platelet agents for lacunar strokes associated with hypertension or abnormal lipids or diabetes. The biology of lacunar strokes has been studied very little, and there are no accepted biomarkers for lacunar stroke or its causes. Our group, however, has begun to provide novel insights into how the immune and clotting profiles in peripheral blood differ in lacunar strokes compared to large vessel and cardioembolic strokes. We have shown that the immune response in large vessel and cardioembolic cortical strokes is mainly associated with neutrophil genes, whereas the immune response in lacunar stroke associated with hypertension /lipids/ diabetes is associated with inflammatory monocyte-related genes. However, since the preliminary studies were performed on whole blood, there is a great need to study individual immune cell types in these different causes of ischemic stroke. Therefore, in this study we will isolate neutrophils and monocytes in patients with lacunar stroke compared to large vessel and cardioembolic stroke. We will perform RNA sequencing on those cells in the following aims which allows us to measure expression levels of >250,000 alternatively spliced transcripts which are derived from the ~20,000 coding genes.  Specific Aim #1. Use RNAseq to demonstrate that alternatively spliced transcript level expression profiles in monocytes, neutrophils and whole blood differ for subcortical lacunar strokes associated with hypertension, abnormal lipids, diabetes, large vessel atherosclerosis, or cardioembolism compared to each other and compared to matched controls.  Specific Aim #2. Use RNAseq to demonstrate that alternatively spliced transcript level expression profiles for subcortical lacunar strokes with hypertension, lipids or diabetes are associated with monocytes, and differ from cortical large vessel and cardioembolic strokes which are associated mainly with neutrophils.  Specific Aim #3a. Use Support Vector Machine (SVM) to derive the minimum number of transcripts from Aim #1 that differentiate the different causes of lacunar strokes including hypertension, abnormal lipids, diabetes, large vessel atherosclerosis, or cardiac disease. Specific Aim #3b. Use the profiles derived in Aim #3a to predict the cause of lacunar stroke in a second cohort using qRT-PCR to measure expression and SVM to perform predictions with >85% sensitivity and specificity.  Significance: Identifying the causes of lacunar strokes based upon splice variant expression in individual blood cell types is important since it would affect therapy used for secondary stroke prevention. Narrative  This study will perform whole genome RNAsequencing of whole blood, neutrophils and monocytes from patients with lacunar strokes and correlate gene profiles with each cause of lacunar stroke. It will then show the lacunar stroke profiles differ from cortical strokes due to cardioembolism and large vessel atherosclerosis, and the profiles can be used to predict the cause of lacunar stroke in an independent validation cohort of patients which is important because different causes of lacunar strokes require different treatments.",Whole Genome RNA Sequencing (RNAseq) of Blood from Patients with Lacunar Stroke,9543581,R01NS101718,"['Affect', 'Alternative Splicing', 'Anticoagulants', 'Antiplatelet Drugs', 'Area', 'Arterial Fatty Streak', 'Arteries', 'Atherosclerosis', 'BCL6 gene', 'Basal Ganglia', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Blood', 'Blood Cells', 'Blood Platelets', 'Brain', 'CADASIL', 'CCL2 gene', 'CCL3 gene', 'CCL4 gene', 'Caliber', 'Cardiac', 'Carotid Atherosclerotic Disease', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Coagulation Process', 'Code', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Endothelial Cells', 'Expression Profiling', 'FPR1 gene', 'Fibrinoid necrosis', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Heart Diseases', 'Hyperlipidemia', 'Hypertension', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Individual', 'Infarction', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Internal Capsule', 'Intracranial Atheroscleroses', 'Ischemic Stroke', 'Lacunar Infarctions', 'Lipids', 'MMP9 gene', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Messenger RNA', 'Molecular', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Parents', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pontine structure', 'Quantitative Reverse Transcriptase PCR', 'RNA Splicing', 'Recurrence', 'S100P gene', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Stroke', 'Stroke prevention', 'Thalamic structure', 'Thrombosis', 'Transcript', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Whole Blood', 'base', 'cell type', 'cohort', 'insight', 'middle cerebral artery', 'monocyte', 'neutrophil', 'notch protein', 'novel', 'peripheral blood', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'vascular risk factor', 'white matter', 'whole genome']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,R01,2018,127821,0.2918362372916003
"Center for the Study of Aphasia Recovery (C-STAR) ﻿    DESCRIPTION (Description as provided by applicant): Stroke is the leading cause of adult disability in the United States, making it a major public health concern (1). The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) estimates the annual cost of stroke in the United States to be $36.5 billion (1). Accordingly, it is clear that the negative personal and societal impact of stroke is vry high. Stroke is typically thought to affect older persons; however, many younger individuals also suffer strokes. For example, at least half of all stroke patients in the state of South Carolina ar under the age of 60 (2). Approximately a quarter of all chronic stroke survivors present with aphasia, a language disorder caused by damage to the speech and language areas of the brain (3, 4). The prevalence of chronic aphasia in the United States is estimated to be one million. Aphasia can vary in severity from very profound impairment that renders patients mute and without the ability to understand others' speech, to milder forms where patients have great difficulty retrieving specific words. In the chronic stage of stroke, aphasia has been identified a the strongest predictor of poor quality of life. Aphasia not only influences the ability to communicate with family and friends, but also drastically decreases education and employment opportunities. Although some degree of spontaneous recovery from aphasia is typical in the first weeks and months following stroke, many patients are left with devastating communication problems. Once aphasia has become a chronic condition, the only road to recovery is through aphasia therapy. Several meta-analysis studies suggest that aphasia therapy is effective. In spite of decades of research, very little is known about which patients benefit the most from treatment and what kind of treatment should be administered to patients with different impairment profiles. The overarching goal of the research proposed here is to improve aphasia treatment effectiveness as well as identify patient factors that can be used to improve diagnosis of language impairment, guide aphasia treatment, and predict prognosis. Specifically, the focus of our center (Center for the Study of Aphasia Recovery; C-STAR) is to examine the extent to which factors such as behavioral aphasia treatment, electrical brain stimulation, and residual brain function influence aphasia recovery. To accomplish our research goals, this project will rely on collaboration among four main investigators: Drs. Julius Fridriksson, Argye Hillis, Chris Rorden, and Greg Hickok. Projects led by Fridriksson (chronic patients) and Hillis (acute patients) will focus on factors that may promote improved outcome of aphasia therapy. Both projects will yield a vast, unique dataset including measures of brain status and response to aphasia treatment. Relying on this dataset, Rorden's project will predict recovery from aphasia using machine learning approaches whereas Hickok will utilize the same data to better understand aphasic impairment in relation to contemporary models of speech and language processing.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Stroke is the leading cause of adult disability in the United States; aphasia, an impairment of the ability to process language, is one of the most devastating results of left hemisphere stroke. The purpose of the work proposed here is to improve recovery from aphasia by better understanding how neurophysiology and anatomy as well as theory driven aphasia treatment relate to long-term outcome.            Subproject-1    Modeling treated recovery from aphasia    Lead Investigator: Julius Fridriksson, Ph.D.            DESCRIPTION (Description as provided by applicant): Stroke is the leading cause of serious adult disability in the United States. One of the most devastating impairments resulting from stroke is aphasia, a language impairment caused by left hemisphere damage involving cortical language areas. It is generally accepted that behavioral aphasia treatment is effective. Nevertheless, different patients experience very different degrees of benefit from aphasia treatment. Despite considerable differences in the response to aphasia treatment, the relationship between patient factors and treatment response is poorly understood and very few reliable prognostic indicators have been identified. This is a major problem, as both time and resources are wasted when clinicians do not know what patients are likely to respond to treatment, or which treatment best fits individual patients. The purpose of the current project is to develop a model that includes biographical and cognitive/linguistic factors to predict patients' response to aphasia treatment. Aphasia severity is one of the few factors that have been identified as a reliable predictor of performance in treatment; it is generally accepted that more severe aphasia is associated with poorer treatment outcomes. However, aphasia severity is a multidimensional construct and patients with similar overall severity scores might demonstrate very different language impairment profiles. To better understand how language impairment relates to treatment outcomes, the dual stream model (DS model;1) will be consulted. Specifically, we will test whether measures of proportional damage to the cortical areas that comprise the DS model improve prediction of aphasia treatment response, beyond biographical and cognitive/linguistic factors. Although the DS model is a functional model grounded in neuroanatomy, we expect measures of speech and language that assesses processes supported by the two major components of the DS model - the dorsal and ventral streams - might be redundant with measures of cortical damage. To understand whether our predictive model can be generalized across different kinds of treatment foci, each patient will undergo treatment devoted to phonological stimulation and a separate treatment phase focusing on semantic stimulation. Ultimately, the goal here is to construct a predictive model that will be made available on- line so that clinicians can enter test scores from individual patients to predic how likely a given patient is to respond to treatment, as well as the focus of that treatment.         There is a great need for prognostic indicators of aphasia treatment response. At the completion of our research, we will understand why some patients respond better to aphasia treatment than others. We have selected treatment approaches that are routinely used in clinical practice, allowing for immediate translation of the findings directly into patient management. The current project will yield a vast dataset that will be made publicly available allowing others to study further aphasia treatment response in relation to cognitive/linguistic and lesion factors.              ",Center for the Study of Aphasia Recovery (C-STAR),9455467,P50DC014664,"['Acute', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'American', 'Anatomy', 'Aphasia', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Biography', 'Brain', 'Brain Injuries', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Cerebrum', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Communication', 'Consult', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Dorsal', 'Education', 'Elderly', 'Electric Stimulation', 'Electrical Stimulation of the Brain', 'Employment', 'Employment Opportunities', 'Family', 'Friends', 'Goals', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Language', 'Language Disorders', 'Lead', 'Left', 'Lesion', 'Life', 'Life Expectancy', 'Linguistics', 'Literature', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Modeling', 'Neuroanatomy', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Perfusion', 'Phase', 'Prevalence', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Residual state', 'Resources', 'Savings', 'Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor', 'Semantics', 'Severities', 'Social isolation', 'South Carolina', 'Speech', 'Stream', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translations', 'Treatment Effectiveness', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States', 'Work', 'acute stroke', 'aphasia recovery', 'aphasic', 'behavior test', 'chronic stroke', 'clinical practice', 'cost', 'disability', 'experience', 'fitness', 'hemisphere damage', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'individual patient', 'language impairment', 'language processing', 'mortality', 'neuroimaging', 'neurophysiology', 'outcome forecast', 'patient response', 'phonology', 'predicting response', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'speech processing', 'stroke patient', 'stroke survivor', 'success', 'theories', 'treatment response']",NIDCD,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA AT COLUMBIA,P50,2018,2212889,0.10730859519924366
"Shaping Neural Population Dynamics to Facilitate Learning Project Summary Behavior and cognition emerge from the coordinated activity of populations of interacting neurons. To change behavior we must change the architecture of the network that drives behavior. What are the rules whereby the activity of populations of neurons can change during learning? If we could observe the neural population dynamics that underlie skill learning, we might be able to facilitate learning. This ability may eventually lead to improvements to neurally- based rehabilitation strategies that can facilitate the recovery from stroke.  We will use a neurofeedback paradigm to shape the neural population dynamics that underlie skill learning. To do this, we will record the activity of dozens of neurons in the motor cortex of Rhesus monkey subjects. Animals will control a cursor on a computer screen by generating neural command signals. This is neurofeedback because the animal directly observes a projection of his neural activity, in the form of the movement of the onscreen cursor. This paradigm allows us to study learning simply by perturbing the mapping from neural activity to cursor movement on the screen. Following such a perturbation the animal must discover how to generate new patterns of neural activity that are now appropriate to restore good control of the onscreen cursor.  We will ask two linked questions. First, how does the animal learn to generate new patterns of neural activity? And second, can we facilitate that process? Neurofeedback-based learning offers complementary advantages to arm movements for studying the neural population dynamics that accompany learning. Chieﬂy, only in a neurofeedback paradigm can we be certain that the learning-induced changes in neural activity we observe matter directly for behavior, because only the neurons we record directly impact behavior in this paradigm.  We will test classic theories of skill learning, converted into speciﬁc hypotheses about how neural activity patterns will change throughout the multi-day course of skill learning.  If our neurofeedback-based incremental training schemes do facilitate learning, then this research will inform the work of rehabilitation specialists who work with stroke patients. We (and others) believe that if neurofeedback-based therapies are coupled with standard behavioral therapies for stroke, rehabilitation outcomes will improve. Project Narrative Stroke can be a debilitating condition. Only ﬁfty percent of stroke survivors make a full recovery, and that is usually only after extensive rehabilitation. The recovery from stroke and skill learning are probably closely related. We propose to develop brain-computer interface neurofeedback paradigms to facilitate the learning of new skills. If this is effective in our animal subjects it will provide new avenues to explore for stroke rehabilitation.",Shaping Neural Population Dynamics to Facilitate Learning,9475247,R01HD071686,"['Animals', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Computers', 'Control Animal', 'Couples Therapy', 'Data', 'Electrodes', 'Exhibits', 'Goals', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Learning Skill', 'Lesion', 'Link', 'Macaca mulatta', 'Machine Learning', 'Monkeys', 'Motor Cortex', 'Movement', 'Nervous System Trauma', 'Neurons', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Population Dynamics', 'Process', 'Recovery', 'Rehabilitation Outcome', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Scheme', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specialist', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Stroke', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Work', 'arm movement', 'base', 'behavior change', 'brain computer interface', 'design', 'forging', 'functional restoration', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'motor learning', 'multi-electrode arrays', 'network architecture', 'neural circuit', 'neural patterning', 'neurofeedback', 'neuromechanism', 'rehabilitation strategy', 'relating to nervous system', 'restoration', 'skills', 'stroke model', 'stroke patient', 'stroke recovery', 'stroke rehabilitation', 'stroke survivor', 'theories', 'tool']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2018,441867,0.11444658491439044
"Contributions of spared brain structures and connections to aphasia recovery Language impairment, or aphasia, is a common problem after left hemisphere stroke, and causes significant long-term disability. After the initial period of healing, recovery from stroke relies on plasticity in brain networks spared from direct stroke damage. Thus, to improve behavioral and biological treatments for aphasia, we must understand how spared brain structures and connections contribute to recovery. Over a century of research has demonstrated that left hemisphere areas surrounding the stroke and right hemisphere areas symmetric to the normal left hemisphere language network participate in aphasia recovery. However, the mechanisms by which these areas are recruited and their roles in language recovery remain unclear, particularly for the “right hemisphere language network.” We propose to examine the role of spared brain structures and connections in recovery of core language functions in a large group of left hemisphere stroke survivors and matched controls. The innovative methods address major limitations of prior studies by accounting for individual differences in stroke severity, using task-independent brain structure and connectivity measures, and examining several core language functions as defined by statistical analysis of an extensive behavioral assessment battery. Preliminary studies using this new approach suggest that parts of the right hemisphere language network grow after stroke, and that these changes improve language outcomes. Based on these findings, we hypothesize that recruitment of the right hemisphere language network after left hemisphere stroke compensates for language deficits. We will test this hypothesis against multiple alternative hypotheses, using advanced brain imaging methods to test for effects throughout spared parts of the brain. Analyses will examine how spared brain structures and connections contribute to language recovery, accounting for individual differences in stroke severity. We will additionally test for signs of brain plasticity after stroke and test relationships between stroke location and patterns of brain plasticity to better understand the mechanisms of recovery. New multi- modal analysis methods will integrate the brain structure and connectivity data, providing a more complete picture of recovery of language functions than has been possible before. This research will significantly advance our understanding of the biological basis of aphasia recovery, which will be vital in order to design maximally effective treatments. Language impairment, or aphasia, is a common problem after left hemisphere stroke, and causes significant long-term disability. Understanding the brain basis of recovery is critical to developing new treatments that can meaningfully improve the lives of people with aphasia. This study uses advanced brain imaging techniques to examine how brain networks spared by the stroke contribute to recovery of language abilities in left hemisphere stroke survivors.",Contributions of spared brain structures and connections to aphasia recovery,9567461,R01DC014960,"['Accounting', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Aphasia', 'Area', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavior assessment', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Response Modifier Therapy', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain region', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Diffusion', 'Factor Analysis', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Hypertrophy', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Individual Differences', 'Language', 'Language Disorders', 'Left', 'Lesion', 'Linear Regressions', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pilot Projects', 'Production', 'Publishing', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Rest', 'Role', 'Severities', 'Site', 'Speech', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technical Expertise', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Time Study', 'Work', 'aphasia recovery', 'base', 'behavioral study', 'density', 'design', 'disability', 'effective therapy', 'gray matter', 'healing', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'language impairment', 'morphometry', 'multimodality', 'neuroregulation', 'novel strategies', 'patient subsets', 'post stroke', 'programs', 'recruit', 'stroke recovery', 'stroke survivor', 'study population', 'support network']",NIDCD,GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,762544,0.1795258931873054
"Neural correlates of recovery from aphasia after acute stroke DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of this project is to identify the neural correlates of recovery from aphasia during the first three months after acute stroke. Aphasia is one of the most common and debilitating consequences of strokes affecting the dominant hemisphere. In the acute and subacute stages, most patients experience some degree of recovery of language function. These first few months after brain damage occurs are critically important because the greatest behavioral gains take place during this time, even when patients do not receive treatment. However the extent of recovery is highly variable: some patients recover most or nearly all language function, while others make few gains and remain chronically aphasic. It is not well understood what neural mechanisms underlie recovery during this period, nor why some patients recover so much better than others. To address these questions, we propose to study individuals with aphasia due to acute left hemisphere stroke. Patients will be examined at four time points after stroke: 24-48 hours, 2 weeks, 1 month, and 3 months. At each time point, a comprehensive yet time-efficient language evaluation will be administered to quantify expressive and receptive language function, and a multimodal brain imaging protocol will be implemented that includes structural imaging (MRI), functional imaging (fMRI), perfusion imaging (arterial spin labeling, ASL) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). The proposed research has two specific aims. The first is to identify the neural changes that are associated with successful recovery from aphasia in the acute and subacute periods after a stroke. The second aim is to determine the initial imaging and behavioral variables that are most predictive of the extent of eventual recovery of language function. We hypothesize that the inclusion of fMRI, ASL and DTI in combination with comprehensive language assessments will provide a more complete characterization of the brain's changing state than standard clinical imaging and language measures, and will explain a greater proportion of the variance in recovery patterns. A better understanding of the neural correlates of successful recovery will improve the accuracy of prognoses so as to better plan medical treatments and behavioral interventions. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Approximately one million Americans are living with aphasia, an acquired communication disorder that is one of the most common and debilitating consequences of stroke. The proposed research will use multimodal neuroimaging and comprehensive language evaluations to better understand the process of recovery from aphasia in the crucial first few months after acute stroke. The knowledge gained will help to improve accuracy of prognoses, which will support better planning of treatment and rehabilitation.",Neural correlates of recovery from aphasia after acute stroke,9483275,R01DC013270,"['Acquired Communication Disorders', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Affect', 'American', 'Aphasia', 'Area', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain Injuries', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain region', 'Cell Death', 'Chronic', 'Communities', 'Consent', 'Contralateral', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Evaluation', 'Functional Imaging', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Hour', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Infarction', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Left', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Modality', 'Pathologist', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perfusion', 'Physicians', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Recovery', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Reperfusion Therapy', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Secure', 'Speech', 'Spin Labels', 'Stroke', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'acute stroke', 'aphasia recovery', 'aphasic', 'behavioral study', 'clinical imaging', 'experience', 'hemodynamics', 'hypoperfusion', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'language impairment', 'language onset', 'language processing', 'multimodality', 'neural correlate', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'perfusion imaging', 'post stroke', 'prognostic', 'public health relevance', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'relational database', 'response', 'stroke patient', 'treatment planning', 'web based interface', 'white matter', 'white matter damage']",NIDCD,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2018,417437,0.16110488227500547
"Sleep apnea after stroke: Implications for screening and treatment ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Abstract Stroke is the leading cause of adult disability and a leading cause of death in the US, and results in $21 billion in direct medical costs each year. Stroke disproportionately impacts minorities including Hispanics who have higher stroke risk, poorer outcomes after stroke, and a higher prevalence of post-stroke sleep-disordered breathing (SDB). Declining stroke mortality in combination with the aging US population will result in dramatic increases in the number of disabled stroke survivors, with the largest increases projected among Hispanics. New approaches to improve stroke outcomes are therefore urgently needed, and may be particularly important among Hispanics, the largest US minority population. One critical yet scarcely explored opportunity may exist through identification and treatment of SDB in individuals with stroke. SDB is highly prevalent after stroke, and its presence predicts poor functional outcome and higher mortality. Nonetheless, very few stroke patients are screened or treated for SDB. Little information is available about which patients are likely to have high risk SDB after stroke; the trajectory of SDB in this setting and how to predict it; and almost no data are available for Hispanics. This information may offer opportunities to improve critical post-stroke outcomes and lessen ethnic stroke disparities. Thus, the main goals of the research proposed are 1) develop risk stratification models for post-stroke patients with SDB, 2) provide novel insight into the trajectory that SDB takes after stroke to inform management decisions, 3) inform the design of a subsequent clinical trial that will assess the impact of treatment of high risk SDB on key post-stroke outcomes, and 4) explore a possible treatable cause for worse stroke outcomes in Hispanics. We plan to take advantage of an exceptional opportunity provided by the ongoing Brain Attack Surveillance in Corpus Christi (BASIC) project (R01 NS38916). In this population-based stroke surveillance study in a bi-ethnic community, all acute ischemic stroke patients are interviewed at baseline and followed prospectively for 3, 6 and 12 month outcomes. The current application will add longitudinal SDB assessments to BASIC using a validated portable SDB screening device. SDB severity will be assessed with the apnea/hypopnea index, as well as innovative measures derived from signal analysis. Use of BASIC provides a cost-effective opportunity to expand our knowledge about SDB after stroke in ways that can directly impact clinical care, future clinical trial design, and health disparities. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Sleep-disordered breathing (SDB), which affects over half of stroke patients, predicts poor outcomes after stroke. Leveraging the infrastructure of the BASIC project, we propose a longitudinal, population-based study of SDB and stroke outcomes to improve the identification and management of important SDB after stroke, provide critical data to plan future clinical trials, and explore a potential target to reduce an important ethnic health disparity.",Sleep apnea after stroke: Implications for screening and treatment,9389004,R01HL126700,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Aging', 'Apnea', 'Autonomic Dysfunction', 'Caring', 'Cause of Death', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'County', 'Data', 'Devices', 'Disabled Persons', 'Elements', 'Epidemiology', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'High Prevalence', 'Hispanics', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Investigation', 'Ischemic Stroke', 'Knowledge', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Neurological outcome', 'Not Hispanic or Latino', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Population', 'Population Study', 'Pulse Rates', 'Quality of life', 'Recurrence', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Resource Allocation', 'Risk', 'Risk stratification', 'Sampling', 'Selection Criteria', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sleep Apnea Syndromes', 'Stroke', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'acute stroke', 'base', 'clinical care', 'cost effective', 'design', 'disability', 'ethnic health disparity', 'experience', 'functional outcomes', 'health disparity', 'high risk', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'insight', 'mortality', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'patient screening', 'personalized medicine', 'population based', 'portability', 'post stroke', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'research clinical testing', 'screening', 'stroke outcome', 'stroke patient', 'stroke risk', 'stroke survivor', 'stroke trials', 'surveillance study']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2018,734204,0.29957750752869267
"Toward a Mechanistic Understanding of Optimization Principles Underlying Hemiparetic Gait This project seeks to identify how motor impairments in stroke survivors contribute to mobility deficits through the use of behavioral observations and computational models. Ultimately, this knowledge could be used to design more effective interventions to improve walking ability, increase functional independence, and reduce fall risk in individuals post-stroke. After a stroke, walking ability is affected by motor control deficits which are often characterized by hemiparesis, or weakness on one side of the body. During walking, hemiparesis is often associated with a visible limp that is due to differences in step lengths and stance times between the right and left sides of the body. Reducing these right-left asymmetries are a common objective of rehabilitation, and recently researchers have developed a number of approaches designed to reduce asymmetries such as acoustic pacing, unilateral step training, and split-belt treadmill training. Despite the recent clinical focus on reducing asymmetry, the potential functional benefits of improving symmetry have yet to be established. This research will address this gap by answering two fundamental questions: 1) Do improvements in symmetry lead to functional benefits such as a more efficient walking pattern or improvements in balance? 2) If stroke survivors retain the capacity to walk more symmetrically why do they choose to do otherwise? Although improvements in symmetry can no doubt reduce the potential stigma of walking with a limp, it is possible that a symmetric walking pattern could be less efficient or put patients at a higher risk of falls if it requires that they push the limits of their capacity. Alternatively, it is possible that, through repeated stepping practice, post- stroke individuals have reinforced a suboptimal pattern due to insufficient experience with a more optimal, symmetric pattern. Addressing these issues requires a thorough understanding of the processes by which stroke survivors optimize their walking pattern. Here, these issues are addressed using behavioral approaches to quantify tradeoffs between asymmetry and measures of walking ability such as stability and economy, and computational methods to identify the causal relationships linking these variables. Ultimately, the knowledge derived from this work will provide a mechanistic understanding of how the damaged brain optimizes movement, and may also inform the way in which clinicians develop personalized rehabilitation objectives for stroke survivors. Our findings may also inform cost/benefit analyses of walking in other patient populations known to have asymmetric walking patterns such as amputees or individuals with Parkinson's disease. Furthermore, providing a more mechanistic rationale for gait rehabilitation interventions could improve the efficiency of physical therapy, reduce health care costs, and ultimately help to better reintegrate individuals with neuromotor impairments into society by maximizing their mobility. Public Health Relevance Statement This project seeks to identify the how walking impairments in stroke survivors contribute to mobility deficits through the use of behavioral observations and computational models. The chosen approach integrates biomechanical analyses, physiological assessments and machine learning algorithms to explain how asymmetries during walking influence balance and the effort required to walk. Ultimately, the results of this work may lead to more personalized rehabilitation strategies to improve walking capacity and efficiency, and ultimately reduce fall risk in stroke survivors.",Toward a Mechanistic Understanding of Optimization Principles Underlying Hemiparetic Gait,9524485,R01HD091184,"['Acceleration', 'Acoustics', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Amputees', 'Automobile Driving', 'Behavioral', 'Biomechanics', 'Brain', 'Brain Injuries', 'Clinical', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Cost-Benefit Analysis', 'Development', 'Environment', 'Equilibrium', 'Exercise Physiology', 'Functional disorder', 'Gait', 'Gases', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Left', 'Length', 'Link', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Metabolic', 'Movement', 'Nervous system structure', 'Paresis', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physical therapy', 'Physiological', 'Process', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Reaction', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Side', 'Societies', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Speed', 'Step training', 'Stroke', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Uncertainty', 'Walking', 'Work', 'behavior observation', 'clinical practice', 'computer science', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'design', 'effective intervention', 'experience', 'fall risk', 'foot', 'gait rehabilitation', 'hemiparesis', 'high risk', 'improved', 'injured', 'locomotor control', 'motor control', 'motor impairment', 'novel strategies', 'patient population', 'post stroke', 'public health relevance', 'rehabilitation strategy', 'relating to nervous system', 'social stigma', 'spatiotemporal', 'stroke rehabilitation', 'stroke survivor', 'success', 'treadmill', 'treadmill training', 'visual feedback', 'walking speed']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,R01,2018,381478,0.17493708916388526
"Smartwatch Monitoring for Atrial Fibrillation After Stroke Project Summary / Abstract Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the world’s most common serious heart rhythm problem and causes 15% of all strokes, a major cause of disability and death among Americans.1 Long-term monitoring for early AF detection and treatment is recommended for many stroke patients, but although existing cardiac monitors are accurate, they suffer from methodologic and cost limitations that preclude their long-term use. In the proposed, “Smartwatch Monitoring for Atrial Fibrillation Real-Time in Stroke,” Study, our overall objective is to enhance paroxysmal AF (pAF) detection by enhancing and testing Pulsewatch, an innovative, smartwatch-based technology for long-term rhythm monitoring of stroke patients. For Aim 1, we embed our state-of-the art AF detection algorithms, interactive messaging to promote adherence, and novel contact and motion noise correction capabilities into a smartwatch to enable near-continuous pulse waveform analysis. We will further refine Pulsewatch through focus groups and a Hack-a-thon with stroke patients and their medical providers. For Aim 2, we will enroll 90 stroke survivors and provide them with a smartphone and smartwatch, both encoded with Pulsewatch. We will compare the performance of Pulsewatch when worn daily for 7 days to conventional 7-day cardiac monitoring for pAF detection. For Aim 3, we will determine the acceptability and usability of Pulsewatch through follow-up interviews and focus groups in 30 randomly selected participants from Aim 2 asked to continue wearing smartwatch daily for an additional 30 days. We will identify patient factors associated with adherence and evaluate the impact of Pulsewatch use on disease-specific quality of life, anxiety, and self- activation among the 30 users compared to 30 stroke patients treated with usual care through baseline and 1- month assessments. Our research will lead to the development of a highly acceptable, enabling cardiovascular monitoring technology designed by, and for, stroke patients that facilitates long-term non-invasive screening for pAF, as well as communication between stroke patients and their medical providers.

Accordingly, we propose a series of prospective investigations involving stroke patients and their medical providers focused on developing, validating, and field-testing a new smartwatch-based AF detection platform, Pulsewatch, to create a mobile technology that can detect paroxysms of AF, accelerate their treatment, is user-centric, and is of great intrinsic acceptability.",Smartwatch Monitoring for Atrial Fibrillation After Stroke,9523887,R01HL137734,"['Adherence', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Anxiety', 'Atrial Fibrillation', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cellular Phone', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Elderly', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Electronic Mail', 'Engineering', 'Enhancement Technology', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Fingers', 'Focus Groups', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Geriatrics', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Heart Rate', 'Immigrant', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Interview', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Letters', 'Machine Learning', 'Market Research', 'Measurement', 'Medical', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Noise', 'Participant', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Representative', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Population', 'Provider', 'Publishing', 'Quality of life', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Self Efficacy', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Spottings', 'Stroke', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technology', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Transient Ischemic Attack', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Work', 'base', 'comparative efficacy', 'cost', 'cryptogenic stroke', 'design', 'disability', 'experience', 'field study', 'follow-up', 'heart rhythm', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'iterative design', 'lens', 'mHealth', 'mobile computing', 'non-invasive monitor', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'preference', 'prospective', 'screening', 'sensor', 'signal processing', 'smartphone Application', 'stroke patient', 'stroke survivor', 'tool', 'treatment as usual', 'usability']",NHLBI,UNIV OF MASSACHUSETTS MED SCH WORCESTER,R01,2018,853336,0.20965458323337008
"Prediction Model for Incident Stroke for Early Screening of an Individual at Risk of Stroke ABSTRACT Stroke is one of the leading causes of death and disability in the United States and other developed countries. About 800,000 people in the United States have a stroke each year. The incidence of stroke is expected to increase (due to diabetes, an aging population and a rise in obesity), which is a major public health concern and great economic burden to society. Early identification of people at risk of stroke is important as it allows for better planning and implementation of preventative strategies. A number of risk prediction models have been proposed for stroke using common biomarkers such as lipids, and conventional risk factors including age, gender, history of hypertension and smoking. However, these models do not adequately capture a substantial proportion of persons at high risk of stroke they lack precision (best accuracy is up to 50% by Framingham risk score) in risk estimation and have other limitations.

"Enhancing Stroke Prehospital and Emergency Evaluation and Delivery (E-SPEED) Nearly 800,000 people in the United States (US) each year are affected by stroke, which remains the leading cause of adult disability and 5th leading cause of death. Despite the proliferation of stroke centers nationwide, access to timely stroke care and evidence-based therapies is still poor with multiple inefficiencies, redundancies, errors, and system-based barriers that lead to care fragmentation. A stroke system of care that integrates and coordinates care between non-stroke center hospitals, primary stroke centers, and comprehensive stroke centers has been recommended since it would reduce stroke-related deaths by 20,000 annually in the US and nearly 400,000 worldwide. This proposal is significant because it addresses two important gaps in knowledge about the acute evaluation and treatment of stroke patients: prehospital screening errors and delays in inter-hospital transfer. The Enhancing Stroke Prehospital and Emergency Evaluation and Delivery (E-SPEED) study will (1) enhance existing LVO screening tools, assess whether machine learning approaches improve LVO prediction, and evaluate the impact of an Enhanced LVO Screening Tool in the prehospital setting; and (2) use learning collaboratives and simulations to design, implement, and pilot test a new inter-hospital stroke transfer protocol. We bring together systems engineers and stroke health service researchers in a novel collaboration that will produce generalizable knowledge that can be widely applied to other urban regions of the country and provide preliminary data and demonstration of novel approaches that could be evaluated in large-scale comparative effectiveness studies across multiple regions. NARRATIVE Timely acute stroke treatments can be life-saving and reduce disability from stroke; however, a minority of patients receive these treatments in a timely manner or at all. This proposal addresses two important gaps in knowledge about the acute evaluation and treatment of stroke patients: prehospital screening errors and delays in inter-hospital transfer. In doing so, we will produce generalizable knowledge that can be widely applied to other urban regions of the country and provide preliminary data and demonstration of novel approaches that could be evaluated in large-scale comparative effectiveness studies across multiple regions.",Enhancing Stroke Prehospital and Emergency Evaluation and Delivery (E-SPEED),9572076,R18HS025359,[' '],AHRQ,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R18,2018,399396,0.2521351671837383
"Automated Assessment of Leptomeningeal Collaterals on CT Angiograms Abstract  The primary goal of this study is to develop an automated scoring system of leptomeningeal collaterals based on CT angiography (CTA) as a quantitative assessment of acute ischemic stroke. Leptomeningeal collaterals provide an alternate path of blood flow in the setting of a proximal vessel occlusion. The presence and effectiveness of leptomeningeal collaterals (i.e., “collateral status”) varies significantly from patient to patient. Collateral status has been shown to be correlated with both patient outcome and risk of hemorrhagic transformation, suggesting that rapid and accurate assessment of the collaterals would provide a powerful tool for treatment evaluation. The current gold standard for collateral scoring is performed by subjective analysis of retrograde filling in invasive digital subtraction angiograms (DSA). Though CTA is more limited than DSA in the direct evaluation of collaterals, the presence of collaterals may also be evaluated in CTA by the tree-pattern of vessel filling around the site of occlusion. Several manual assessment techniques based on CTA have been proposed in the literature, but all are subjective and require significant human intervention.  During Phase I, we deployed a web-based system for automated assessment of stroke collaterals based on CTA, and we used it in a preliminary study of collateral status for stroke assessment.  In this Phase II STTR proposal, the specific aims are (1) to improve the integration of our system with clinical workflows; (2) expand the system to also compute CT perfusion stroke measures, so as to provide a unified platform for comparing and combining CTA collateral and CT perfusion assessment metrics; and (3) test the hypotheses that the combined use of CTA collateral and CT perfusion measures outperforms either method independently for treatment efficacy prediction in stroke patients. Narrative  Leptomeningeal collateral vessels provide connections between vascular territories in the brain when occlusions occur, e.g., when a person suffers a stroke. The number and connectivity of collateral vessels varies significantly from patient to patient, and they have been shown to play an important role in stroke outcomes, providing blood flow to tissue at risk. Rapid and effective patient-specific determination of the presence and connectivity of collaterals is needed in acute stroke situations to determine which treatments will be effective. We propose to develop an automated system to evaluate collateral vessel trees from computed tomography angiography (CTA) images and to offer that system as an algorithms-as-a-service (AaaS) product.",Automated Assessment of Leptomeningeal Collaterals on CT Angiograms,9622038,R42NS086295,"['Academia', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Angiography', 'Blood Pressure', 'Blood Vessels', 'Blood flow', 'Brain', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffusion', 'Distal', 'Doctor of Medicine', 'Effectiveness', 'Evaluation', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Hemorrhage', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Hypertension', 'Image', 'Industry', 'Infarction', 'Intervention', 'Intraobserver Variability', 'Intravenous', 'Ischemic Stroke', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Odds Ratio', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Patient risk', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perfusion', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Privatization', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Recurrence', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Running', 'Security', 'Services', 'Site', 'Small Business Technology Transfer Research', 'Standardization', 'Stroke', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thrombolytic Therapy', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Trees', 'Triage', 'Visualization software', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'acute stroke', 'base', 'computer science', 'cost effective', 'deep learning', 'design', 'digital', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'innovation', 'open source', 'outcome prediction', 'post stroke', 'product development', 'prospective', 'prototype', 'research clinical testing', 'research study', 'statistics', 'stroke outcome', 'stroke patient', 'thrombolysis', 'tool', 'treatment arm', 'web services']",NINDS,"KITWARE, INC.",R42,2018,489999,0.17814192567430184
"Quantitative Rehabilitation after Stroke PROJECT SUMMARY Stroke causes significant disability, and recovery is often incomplete. In animal models of stroke, robust upper extremity (UE) motor recovery can be elicited if high doses of functional training are given early. In humans, however, the optimal training dose is unknown, because no quantitative dose-response trials have been undertaken in the first months after stroke. This deficiency stems from a lack of measurement instruments that can accurately and easily quantify UE functional training dose and recovery. To address this gap, this proposal will generate two new measurement tools to enable quantitative stroke recovery research. The first tool (Aim 1) will quantify the number of functional movements made during stroke rehabilitation, measuring UE training dose. The second tool (Aim 2) will quantify the abnormality of movements, measuring UE recovery and response to interventions. We will combine wireless motion capture and computational methodologies to create objective, precise, and user-friendly tools. Inertial measurement units, worn by individuals with stroke and healthy controls performing various activities, will capture upper body motion. In Aim 1, machine learning algorithms will be trained to identify and count functional movements in activities normally practiced during rehabilitation. In Aim 2, functional principal components analysis will quantify movement impairment and compensation in standardized motions. Validity will be determined by correlating tool outcomes with current gold standards. The proposed study will be conducted at New York University, in collaboration with investigators from the NYU Center for Data Science, Columbia University, and Washington University-St. Louis. Each have complementary expertise in machine learning, functional data analysis, and functional movement identification. This K02 Independent Scientist Award will provide the candidate with skill in advanced motion capture and analytical methodologies needed to study stroke rehabilitation and recovery. The career development plan includes personalized tutorials and coursework combined with longitudinal oversight of data analysis, providing an excellent foundation for launching an independent research career. Ultimately, the developed tools have the potential to immediately impact neurorehabilitation research, facilitating the rigorous dose-response trials so critically needed to change clinical practice and improve stroke outcomes. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research is relevant to public health, because it will enable the precise and feasible measurement of rehabilitation and recovery after stroke. The generated measurement tools will facilitate important stroke recovery research, which is expected to inform stroke rehabilitation practices and reduce the burden of stroke disability.",Quantitative Rehabilitation after Stroke,9430869,K02NS104207,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Collaborations', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Science', 'Development Plans', 'Dose', 'Dyskinetic syndrome', 'Ensure', 'Felis catus', 'Financial compensation', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Independent Scientist Award', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Motion', 'Movement', 'Neurorehabilitation', 'New York', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Public Health', 'Radial', 'Recovery', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Speed', 'Standardization', 'Stroke', 'Survivors', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Upper Extremity', 'Washington', 'Wireless Technology', 'Work', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical practice', 'clinically relevant', 'disability', 'experience', 'improved', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'kinematics', 'motor impairment', 'motor recovery', 'novel', 'response', 'sensor', 'skills', 'stem', 'stroke recovery', 'stroke rehabilitation', 'tool', 'user-friendly']",NINDS,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,K02,2017,208791,0.24810703481983223
"Enabling Comparative Effectiveness Research in Silent Brain Infarction Through Natural Language Processing and Big Data It is a common clinical occurrence that neuroimaging scans obtained in the course of routine clinical care discover a prior brain infarction in patients with no history of stroke or transient ischemic attack. Indeed, epidemiologic studies indicate that silent brain infarctions (SBI) are far more common than strokes; MRI- defined SBI can be detected in ~20% of the healthy elderly. In these studies based on screened patients, the findings have been shown to be associated with subtle, typically unrecognized, deficits in physical and cognitive function. These imaging findings are also strong, independent risk factors for future stroke and dementia. Despite the very high prevalence of SBI in screened populations, and their serious consequences, little is known about the significance or the appropriate management of SBI when discovered incidentally in routine care. While there is strong evidence that antiplatelet therapy and statin therapy are effective in preventing recurrent stroke in patients with prior stroke, the degree to which these results apply to patients with SBI is unclear. Because patients with SBI define a population that falls in between primary and secondary stroke prevention, the approach to these patients is marked by uncertainty and practice variation, making it an ideal condition for observational comparative effectiveness research. Nonetheless, there are serious challenges for the study of SBI. As patients have no overt symptoms, recruitment into a trial can be problematic. Comparative effectiveness research on SBI, using routinely collected data and leveraging the variation in care of these patients, is impeded by the fact that there are no ICD codes for SBI, and it is generally not included in structured fields of electronic health records (EHR) as it is typically considered an incidental finding. In order to establish the comparative effectiveness of treatment strategies for SBI in a large, heterogeneous population, we propose to develop Natural Language Processing (NLP) algorithms to identify individuals with SBI through the automated review of neuroradiology reports. We have performed preliminary work to demonstrate that such an approach is feasible. We will then apply state-of-the-science observational comparative effectiveness methods in a massive database with linked EHR and claims data to examine the effectiveness of statins and antiplatelet agents in preventing future stroke and dementia. Thus, our aims are: Aim 1: We will develop NLP algorithms that can accurately identify cases of SBI and white matter disease (WMD) in two different health systems. Aim 2: We will port, refine, and validate the NLP algorithm in a large heterogeneous database including more than 600 hospitals and 6500 clinics and identify a large cohort of patients with routinely-discovered SBI and WMD. Aim 3: We will characterize the cohort with respect to age- specific prevalence of SBI, management patterns, and the risk of future stroke and dementia associated with SBI and WMD. Aim 4: We will estimate the comparative effectiveness of preventive therapies (statins and antiplatelet agents) on the risk of future stroke and dementia in patients with incidentally-discovered SBI. The goal of this project is to improve the evidence base for the prevention of stroke in patients with “silent brain infarct”—i.e., a stroke on neuroimaging (head CT or MRI) but no clinical evidence of a stroke. We will develop a computer-based algorithm using a technology known as natural language processing that can accurately identify cases of silent brain infarction among a large population of adults on whom neuroimages have been obtained, but who are without a history of clinically-evident cerebrovascular disease. We will estimate the comparative effectiveness of medications (statins and antiplatelet agents) on the risk of future stroke and dementia in patients with incidentally discovered and reported SBI.",Enabling Comparative Effectiveness Research in Silent Brain Infarction Through Natural Language Processing and Big Data,9365110,R01NS102233,"['Adult', 'Age', 'Age-Years', 'Algorithms', 'American Heart Association', 'Antiplatelet Drugs', 'Big Data', 'Blood Vessels', 'Brain', 'Brain Infarction', 'Caring', 'Cerebrovascular Disorders', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Effectiveness', 'Elderly', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Health Personnel', 'Health system', 'Healthcare Systems', 'High Prevalence', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Incidental Findings', 'Individual', 'Infarction', 'Informatics', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'International Classification of Disease Codes', 'Knowledge', 'Lesion', 'Link', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Medical center', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physical Function', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention approach', 'Prevention trial', 'Preventive therapy', 'Process', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Recurrence', 'Reporting', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Scanning', 'Science', 'Stroke', 'Stroke prevention', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Technology', 'Transient Ischemic Attack', 'Translating', 'Uncertainty', 'Variant', 'White Matter Disease', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'case finding', 'clinical care', 'clinical practice', 'cognitive function', 'cohort', 'comparative effectiveness', 'effectiveness research', 'epidemiology study', 'evidence base', 'falls', 'improved', 'learning progression', 'member', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'patient population', 'prevent', 'repository', 'routine care', 'screening', 'treatment strategy']",NINDS,TUFTS MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2017,711929,0.18765106373277018
"A Functional Upper Limb Training and Assessment Tool to Enhance Efficacy and Scalability of Rehabilitation in Ecological Environments ABSTRACT Impairments following stroke make it one of the leading causes of disability. Many individuals with stroke do not recover complete function of the upper limb at time of discharge from clinical services . Moreover, early stage improvements may wane following the cessation of formal therapies. Regaining as much upper limb function as possible is important, as even mild impairments are associated with limitations in daily function and lower health- related quality of life. Thus, finding ways to augment functional mobility is important. The overarching purpose of this project is to use portable technology, affordable for home use, to provide objective feedback on performance of upper limb motor tasks to individuals with residual deficits following chronic conditions such as stroke. Objective feedback serves to better inform the participant of their progress and actively engage them in their rehabilitation, thus encouraging self-management of rehabilitation. Results from a recent survey shows therapists predominantly provide patients with stroke written home exercise programs at time of discharge from therapies. With this static approach, patients have a limited capacity to evaluate their motor performance and no encouragement to refine their movement. Creating automated systems that measure and provide feedback will promote a more proactive approach to maximizing function across the lifespan of individuals with chronic conditions. We propose that coupling smart technology found in readily available smartphones with three-dimensional (3D) printing provides a scalable option to provide feedback in long-term rehabilitation and advances the current standard of care, i.e. written home exercise programs. We will build upon our current research, further developing and validating a novel in-home rehabilitation system using 3D printing technologies, smart devices and machine learning algorithms. Specifically, we will use emerging low- cost 3D printing techniques to augment off-the-shelf smart devices (e.g., smartphones) into functional rehabilitation tools. The built-in sensors and our machine learning apps in smartphones can quantify characteristics of movement and provide actionable feedbacks to users during in-home rehabilitation. We hypothesize that feedback will result in improved functional mobility. We will examine performance changes in common activities of daily living (ADLs) trained with our system. With the portable devices, we are able to go further than reporting the typical time metric and also provide feedback on smoothness of movement represented as a normalized cumulative jerk (rate of change of acceleration) score. This assessment provides information on control of movement, an indication of impairment. Recording normalized jerk over time and across activities is a promising way to assess change in impairment. Overall, this scalable design offers an innovative approach to long-term rehabilitation needs of individuals with stroke. PROJECT NARRATIVE Interventions promoting optimum motor performance across the lifespan are a priority after a neurological insult such as stroke. The proposed research incorporates smart devices and 3D printing to create patient-centered rehabilitation devices that are scalable.

"Big Data Neuroimaging to Predict Motor Behavior After Stroke PROJECT SUMMARY  Stroke is a leading cause of serious long-term adult disability around the world. Despite intensive therapy, an estimated 2/3 of stroke survivors do not fully recover and are left unable to care for themselves independently. Growing research suggests that rehabilitation is not “one-size-fits-all”; variability among stroke survivors in terms of lesion location, age, gender, time since stroke and more may all affect a person's likelihood of recovery and response to different types of treatments. Personalized rehabilitation medicine to maximize each individual's recovery potential is thus desperately needed. However, in order to develop accurate, robust, and specific predictive models that can determine an individual's recovery potential and response to different treatments, large, heterogeneous datasets are needed. The current best predictors of stroke outcomes are neuroimaging (MRI) and behavioral biomarkers that look at brain structure/function and motor performance at baseline. Generating a large enough dataset of MRI and behavioral data is extremely difficult and expensive for any one site to do on its own. This proposal addresses this problem by generating a large, diverse dataset using a novel meta-analytic approach that harmonizes post-stroke data collected worldwide. In partnership with an international consortium comprised of over 500 researchers who produce the largest-known neuroimaging and genetic studies of over 18 different diseases (ENIGMA Center for Worldwide Medicine, Imaging, and Genomics), I propose to apply ENIGMA's powerful approach to answer critical questions in stroke recovery. Under this K01 career development award, I will develop skills in big data neuroimaging analytics, clinical research, and consortium building through my ENIGMA Stroke Recovery working group in order to ask questions about stroke recovery using a large dataset approach (goal n>3,000). This project has four specific aims: Aim 1 will leverage ENIGMA's existing methodology to develop the infrastructure, optimal methods, and analysis techniques for harmonizing a large dataset of post-stroke MRI and behavioral data. Aim 2 will use this large dataset to identify neural and behavioral biomarkers predicting recovery of motor impairment (e.g., actual arm movement ability) and recovery of function (e.g., ability to perform tasks, such as picking up objects with the affected arm). Aim 3 will use supervised machine learning to generate and fine-tune highly accurate predictive models of the relationship between these biomarkers and recovery of impairment versus function. Lastly, Aim 4 will use unsupervised machine learning techniques to examine shared properties of outliers from the predictive model and determine additional neurobiological mechanisms that may prevent individuals from recovering. This approach has the potential to revolutionize the way that rehabilitation research is validated, to ensure robust, reliable, and reproducible results. The methods developed here could be extended to other domains of recovery (language, gait), to study other predictors of recovery (functional brain activity, genomics), and to other clinical populations to improve rehabilitation overall. PROJECT NARRATIVE The overall goal of this project is to provide personalized, precise rehabilitation medicine to individuals after stroke by developing accurate predictive models that help us detect who will recover and best respond to different types of post-stroke treatments. Using a novel meta-analytic approach, this project will harmonize datasets of brain imaging and behavioral information across sites worldwide in order to develop a large dataset with thousands of participants. Advanced statistical and machine learning techniques will then be applied to this dataset in order to detect robust neural and behavioral biomarkers that can be used to predict stroke recovery and to personalize treatments across diverse populations.",Big Data Neuroimaging to Predict Motor Behavior After Stroke,9292814,K01HD091283,"['Activities of Daily Living', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Corticospinal Tracts', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Set', 'Diffuse', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness of Interventions', 'Ensure', 'Future', 'Gait', 'Gender', 'Genetic study', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'International', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Lead', 'Left', 'Lesion', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Motor Cortex', 'Nature', 'Neurorehabilitation', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Physical Medicine', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Property', 'Recovery', 'Recovery of Function', 'Rehabilitation Research', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Reproducibility', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Sensory', 'Site', 'Statistical Models', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'Task Performances', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Wolves', 'arm', 'arm movement', 'computerized tools', 'disability', 'functional disability', 'functional improvement', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'motor impairment', 'motor recovery', 'muscle strength', 'neurobiological mechanism', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'personalized medicine', 'post stroke', 'precision medicine', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'relating to nervous system', 'research and development', 'response', 'skills', 'stroke recovery', 'stroke rehabilitation', 'stroke survivor', 'stroke treatment', 'tool', 'treatment response', 'working group']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,K01,2017,133191,0.2154463737510364
"Whole Transcriptome Studies of Patients with Transient Ischemic Attacks (TIAs) ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Transient ischemic attacks (TIA) are critical to identify because prevention therapy can reduce the risk of future vascular events by > 50%. Diagnostic testing and therapeutic intervention must start as soon as possible because 10-25% of TIAs have a stroke within 90 days. Because so many patients present emergently with transient neurological events the large majority of whom do not go on to have a stroke, methods for identifying TIAs at high risk for stroke have been sought so that work up and treatment can be targeted to those who need it most to save time, money and limited resources. Though the ABCD2 score and brain Diffusion Weighted Imaging-MRI (DWI-MRI) have improved prediction of which TIAs have a stroke, their sensitivity and specificity for prediction of individual cases i poor. In this proposal we propose that peripheral blood leukocytes and platelets play pivotal roles in which TIAs go on to have a stroke and by assessing RNA in whole blood we can evaluate leukocyte and platelet function in TIA patients who go on to have stroke versus those that do not have a stroke. We hypothesize that specific coagulation and immune genes are activated in TIA patients that predispose them to have a stroke by 90 days compared to those TIA patients who do NOT have a stroke by 90 days. A subset of these leukocyte and platelet mRNA genes will predict TIAs who have a stroke by 90 days. This hypothesis is addressed by the following specific aims. Aim #1 (Derivation Cohort): Demonstrate that mRNA expression measured using RNAseq from whole blood differs in a derivation cohort of TIAs that go on to have a stroke by 90 days compared to those TIAs who do not have a stroke by 90 days. Demonstrate that most mRNA found to be regulated using RNAseq are also significantly regulated when measured using qRT-PCR. Aim #2 (Derivation Cohort): Apply machine learning algorithms to the mRNA from Aim #1 to derive an optimal subset of mRNA regulated by both RNAseq and qRT-PCR that predict which TIAs have strokes by 90 days compared to those who do not with >95% sensitivity on cross-validation. Aim #3 (Validation Cohort): Use machine/prediction learning algorithms to demonstrate that the genes from Aim #2 when measured using qRT-PCR on an independent validation cohort predict which TIAs have a stroke by 90 days with >85% sensitivity. The goal of these studies is to discover mRNA profiles in blood that predict which TIA patients go on to have strokes by 90 days. When confirmed in future studies, this will direct in depth testing to those high risk TIAs most in need in order to prevent strokes, and decrease unnecessary testing in those with low risk of stroke. Equally as important, the genes discovered to be associated with high risk of stroke in TIA patients will represent potential novel stroke prevention targets. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will examine RNA in blood using RNAseq and qRT-PCR of human subjects with Transient Ischemic Attacks (TIAs) who have a stroke by 90 days compared to TIAs who do not have a stroke. The regulated mRNA, exons and alternatively spliced transcripts in a Derivation Cohort of TIA patients will be used to predict which TIAs have a stroke by 90 days in a Validation Cohort of TIA patients.",Whole Transcriptome Studies of Patients with Transient Ischemic Attacks (TIAs),9243329,R01NS097000,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Alternative Splicing', 'Area', 'Arterial Fatty Streak', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood Platelets', 'Blood Vessels', 'Brain', 'Cerebrum', 'Clinical', 'Coagulation Process', 'Data', 'Derivation procedure', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Emergency Situation', 'Epilepsy', 'Event', 'Exons', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Hour', 'Immune', 'Individual', 'Ischemic Stroke', 'Labyrinthine disorder', 'Learning', 'Leukocytes', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Messenger RNA', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Migraine', 'Neurologic', 'Patients', 'Play', 'Prevention therapy', 'Publishing', 'Quantitative Reverse Transcriptase PCR', 'RNA', 'ROC Curve', 'Recurrence', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Estimate', 'Role', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Site', 'Stroke', 'Stroke prevention', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Transcript', 'Transient Ischemic Attack', 'Validation', 'Whole Blood', 'base', 'cohort', 'gene discovery', 'high risk', 'human subject', 'improved', 'mRNA Expression', 'monocyte', 'neutrophil', 'novel', 'peripheral blood', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'release factor', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,R01,2017,569977,0.2826061521768155
"Whole Genome RNA Sequencing (RNAseq) of Blood from Patients with Lacunar Stroke Abstract  Lacunar strokes are small infarctions of deep penetrator end arteries that supply deep areas of brain including the basal ganglia, internal capsule, thalamus and pons. The “cause” of lacunar strokes has been controversial. C Miller Fisher was the first to suggest that hypertension was one cause, noting lipohyalinosis (inflammation, fibrinoid necrosis of vessel wall) in smaller penetrating arteries (<200um) occurred only in hypertensives. He also showed, however, that larger lacunar strokes were often associated with microatheroma associated narrowing of larger penetrating arteries. This pathology is now thought to be the most common and associated with lipid abnormalities and diabetes. Moreover, some lacunar strokes are now thought to be associated with intracranial atherosclerosis of the parent artery at the origin of the penetrators. Though lacunar strokes were not traditionally associated with large vessel extracranial atherosclerosis or cardioembolism, there are now a number of cases where lacunar strokes have been associated with large vessel atherosclerosis or cardiac causes. Indeed, in our own recent study we showed that as many as ~50% of small deep infarcts (>15mm in size) were predicted to be due to large vessel atherosclerosis or to cardioembolic disease. It is crucial to identify the correct causes of lacunar strokes because treatments differ: drugs for hypertension vs drugs for lipid abnormalities, surgery for large vessel carotid disease, anticoagulants for cardioembolic disease, and anti-platelet agents for lacunar strokes associated with hypertension or abnormal lipids or diabetes. The biology of lacunar strokes has been studied very little, and there are no accepted biomarkers for lacunar stroke or its causes. Our group, however, has begun to provide novel insights into how the immune and clotting profiles in peripheral blood differ in lacunar strokes compared to large vessel and cardioembolic strokes. We have shown that the immune response in large vessel and cardioembolic cortical strokes is mainly associated with neutrophil genes, whereas the immune response in lacunar stroke associated with hypertension /lipids/ diabetes is associated with inflammatory monocyte-related genes. However, since the preliminary studies were performed on whole blood, there is a great need to study individual immune cell types in these different causes of ischemic stroke. Therefore, in this study we will isolate neutrophils and monocytes in patients with lacunar stroke compared to large vessel and cardioembolic stroke. We will perform RNA sequencing on those cells in the following aims which allows us to measure expression levels of >250,000 alternatively spliced transcripts which are derived from the ~20,000 coding genes.  Specific Aim #1. Use RNAseq to demonstrate that alternatively spliced transcript level expression profiles in monocytes, neutrophils and whole blood differ for subcortical lacunar strokes associated with hypertension, abnormal lipids, diabetes, large vessel atherosclerosis, or cardioembolism compared to each other and compared to matched controls.  Specific Aim #2. Use RNAseq to demonstrate that alternatively spliced transcript level expression profiles for subcortical lacunar strokes with hypertension, lipids or diabetes are associated with monocytes, and differ from cortical large vessel and cardioembolic strokes which are associated mainly with neutrophils.  Specific Aim #3a. Use Support Vector Machine (SVM) to derive the minimum number of transcripts from Aim #1 that differentiate the different causes of lacunar strokes including hypertension, abnormal lipids, diabetes, large vessel atherosclerosis, or cardiac disease. Specific Aim #3b. Use the profiles derived in Aim #3a to predict the cause of lacunar stroke in a second cohort using qRT-PCR to measure expression and SVM to perform predictions with >85% sensitivity and specificity.  Significance: Identifying the causes of lacunar strokes based upon splice variant expression in individual blood cell types is important since it would affect therapy used for secondary stroke prevention. Narrative  This study will perform whole genome RNAsequencing of whole blood, neutrophils and monocytes from patients with lacunar strokes and correlate gene profiles with each cause of lacunar stroke. It will then show the lacunar stroke profiles differ from cortical strokes due to cardioembolism and large vessel atherosclerosis, and the profiles can be used to predict the cause of lacunar stroke in an independent validation cohort of patients which is important because different causes of lacunar strokes require different treatments.",Whole Genome RNA Sequencing (RNAseq) of Blood from Patients with Lacunar Stroke,9395742,R01NS101718,"['Affect', 'Alternative Splicing', 'Anticoagulants', 'Antiplatelet Drugs', 'Area', 'Arterial Fatty Streak', 'Arteries', 'Atherosclerosis', 'BCL6 gene', 'Basal Ganglia', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Blood', 'Blood Cells', 'Blood Platelets', 'Blood Vessels', 'Brain', 'CADASIL', 'CCL2 gene', 'CCL3 gene', 'CCL4 gene', 'Caliber', 'Cardiac', 'Carotid Atherosclerotic Disease', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Coagulation Process', 'Code', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Endothelial Cells', 'FPR1 gene', 'Fibrinoid necrosis', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Heart Diseases', 'Hereditary Disease', 'Hyperlipidemia', 'Hypertension', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Individual', 'Infarction', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Internal Capsule', 'Intracranial Atheroscleroses', 'Ischemic Stroke', 'Lacunar Infarctions', 'Lipids', 'MMP9 gene', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Messenger RNA', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Parents', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pontine structure', 'Quantitative Reverse Transcriptase PCR', 'RNA Splicing', 'Recurrence', 'Risk Factors', 'S100P gene', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Stroke', 'Stroke prevention', 'Thalamic structure', 'Thrombosis', 'Transcript', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Whole Blood', 'base', 'cell type', 'cohort', 'insight', 'middle cerebral artery', 'monocyte', 'neutrophil', 'notch protein', 'novel', 'peripheral blood', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'white matter', 'whole genome']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,R01,2017,130225,0.2918362372916003
"Center for the Study of Aphasia Recovery (C-STAR) ﻿    DESCRIPTION (Description as provided by applicant): Stroke is the leading cause of adult disability in the United States, making it a major public health concern (1). The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) estimates the annual cost of stroke in the United States to be $36.5 billion (1). Accordingly, it is clear that the negative personal and societal impact of stroke is vry high. Stroke is typically thought to affect older persons; however, many younger individuals also suffer strokes. For example, at least half of all stroke patients in the state of South Carolina ar under the age of 60 (2). Approximately a quarter of all chronic stroke survivors present with aphasia, a language disorder caused by damage to the speech and language areas of the brain (3, 4). The prevalence of chronic aphasia in the United States is estimated to be one million. Aphasia can vary in severity from very profound impairment that renders patients mute and without the ability to understand others' speech, to milder forms where patients have great difficulty retrieving specific words. In the chronic stage of stroke, aphasia has been identified a the strongest predictor of poor quality of life. Aphasia not only influences the ability to communicate with family and friends, but also drastically decreases education and employment opportunities. Although some degree of spontaneous recovery from aphasia is typical in the first weeks and months following stroke, many patients are left with devastating communication problems. Once aphasia has become a chronic condition, the only road to recovery is through aphasia therapy. Several meta-analysis studies suggest that aphasia therapy is effective. In spite of decades of research, very little is known about which patients benefit the most from treatment and what kind of treatment should be administered to patients with different impairment profiles. The overarching goal of the research proposed here is to improve aphasia treatment effectiveness as well as identify patient factors that can be used to improve diagnosis of language impairment, guide aphasia treatment, and predict prognosis. Specifically, the focus of our center (Center for the Study of Aphasia Recovery; C-STAR) is to examine the extent to which factors such as behavioral aphasia treatment, electrical brain stimulation, and residual brain function influence aphasia recovery. To accomplish our research goals, this project will rely on collaboration among four main investigators: Drs. Julius Fridriksson, Argye Hillis, Chris Rorden, and Greg Hickok. Projects led by Fridriksson (chronic patients) and Hillis (acute patients) will focus on factors that may promote improved outcome of aphasia therapy. Both projects will yield a vast, unique dataset including measures of brain status and response to aphasia treatment. Relying on this dataset, Rorden's project will predict recovery from aphasia using machine learning approaches whereas Hickok will utilize the same data to better understand aphasic impairment in relation to contemporary models of speech and language processing.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Stroke is the leading cause of adult disability in the United States; aphasia, an impairment of the ability to process language, is one of the most devastating results of left hemisphere stroke. The purpose of the work proposed here is to improve recovery from aphasia by better understanding how neurophysiology and anatomy as well as theory driven aphasia treatment relate to long-term outcome.            Subproject-1    Modeling treated recovery from aphasia    Lead Investigator: Julius Fridriksson, Ph.D.            DESCRIPTION (Description as provided by applicant): Stroke is the leading cause of serious adult disability in the United States. One of the most devastating impairments resulting from stroke is aphasia, a language impairment caused by left hemisphere damage involving cortical language areas. It is generally accepted that behavioral aphasia treatment is effective. Nevertheless, different patients experience very different degrees of benefit from aphasia treatment. Despite considerable differences in the response to aphasia treatment, the relationship between patient factors and treatment response is poorly understood and very few reliable prognostic indicators have been identified. This is a major problem, as both time and resources are wasted when clinicians do not know what patients are likely to respond to treatment, or which treatment best fits individual patients. The purpose of the current project is to develop a model that includes biographical and cognitive/linguistic factors to predict patients' response to aphasia treatment. Aphasia severity is one of the few factors that have been identified as a reliable predictor of performance in treatment; it is generally accepted that more severe aphasia is associated with poorer treatment outcomes. However, aphasia severity is a multidimensional construct and patients with similar overall severity scores might demonstrate very different language impairment profiles. To better understand how language impairment relates to treatment outcomes, the dual stream model (DS model;1) will be consulted. Specifically, we will test whether measures of proportional damage to the cortical areas that comprise the DS model improve prediction of aphasia treatment response, beyond biographical and cognitive/linguistic factors. Although the DS model is a functional model grounded in neuroanatomy, we expect measures of speech and language that assesses processes supported by the two major components of the DS model - the dorsal and ventral streams - might be redundant with measures of cortical damage. To understand whether our predictive model can be generalized across different kinds of treatment foci, each patient will undergo treatment devoted to phonological stimulation and a separate treatment phase focusing on semantic stimulation. Ultimately, the goal here is to construct a predictive model that will be made available on- line so that clinicians can enter test scores from individual patients to predic how likely a given patient is to respond to treatment, as well as the focus of that treatment.         There is a great need for prognostic indicators of aphasia treatment response. At the completion of our research, we will understand why some patients respond better to aphasia treatment than others. We have selected treatment approaches that are routinely used in clinical practice, allowing for immediate translation of the findings directly into patient management. The current project will yield a vast dataset that will be made publicly available allowing others to study further aphasia treatment response in relation to cognitive/linguistic and lesion factors.              ",Center for the Study of Aphasia Recovery (C-STAR),9244766,P50DC014664,"['Acute', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'American', 'Anatomy', 'Aphasia', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Biography', 'Brain', 'Brain Injuries', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Cerebrum', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Communication', 'Consult', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Dorsal', 'Education', 'Elderly', 'Electric Stimulation', 'Electrical Stimulation of the Brain', 'Employment', 'Employment Opportunities', 'Family', 'Friends', 'Goals', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Language', 'Language Disorders', 'Lead', 'Left', 'Lesion', 'Life', 'Life Expectancy', 'Linguistics', 'Literature', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Modeling', 'Neuroanatomy', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Perfusion', 'Phase', 'Prevalence', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Residual state', 'Resources', 'Savings', 'Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor', 'Semantics', 'Severities', 'Social isolation', 'South Carolina', 'Speech', 'Stream', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translations', 'Treatment Effectiveness', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States', 'Work', 'acute stroke', 'aphasia recovery', 'aphasic', 'behavior test', 'chronic stroke', 'clinical practice', 'cost', 'disability', 'experience', 'fitness', 'hemisphere damage', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'individual patient', 'language impairment', 'language processing', 'mortality', 'neuroimaging', 'neurophysiology', 'outcome forecast', 'phonology', 'predicting response', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'speech processing', 'stroke survivor', 'success', 'theories', 'treatment response']",NIDCD,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA AT COLUMBIA,P50,2017,2210408,0.10730859519924366
"Shaping Neural Population Dynamics to Facilitate Learning Project Summary Behavior and cognition emerge from the coordinated activity of populations of interacting neurons. To change behavior we must change the architecture of the network that drives behavior. What are the rules whereby the activity of populations of neurons can change during learning? If we could observe the neural population dynamics that underlie skill learning, we might be able to facilitate learning. This ability may eventually lead to improvements to neurally- based rehabilitation strategies that can facilitate the recovery from stroke.  We will use a neurofeedback paradigm to shape the neural population dynamics that underlie skill learning. To do this, we will record the activity of dozens of neurons in the motor cortex of Rhesus monkey subjects. Animals will control a cursor on a computer screen by generating neural command signals. This is neurofeedback because the animal directly observes a projection of his neural activity, in the form of the movement of the onscreen cursor. This paradigm allows us to study learning simply by perturbing the mapping from neural activity to cursor movement on the screen. Following such a perturbation the animal must discover how to generate new patterns of neural activity that are now appropriate to restore good control of the onscreen cursor.  We will ask two linked questions. First, how does the animal learn to generate new patterns of neural activity? And second, can we facilitate that process? Neurofeedback-based learning offers complementary advantages to arm movements for studying the neural population dynamics that accompany learning. Chieﬂy, only in a neurofeedback paradigm can we be certain that the learning-induced changes in neural activity we observe matter directly for behavior, because only the neurons we record directly impact behavior in this paradigm.  We will test classic theories of skill learning, converted into speciﬁc hypotheses about how neural activity patterns will change throughout the multi-day course of skill learning.  If our neurofeedback-based incremental training schemes do facilitate learning, then this research will inform the work of rehabilitation specialists who work with stroke patients. We (and others) believe that if neurofeedback-based therapies are coupled with standard behavioral therapies for stroke, rehabilitation outcomes will improve. Project Narrative Stroke can be a debilitating condition. Only ﬁfty percent of stroke survivors make a full recovery, and that is usually only after extensive rehabilitation. The recovery from stroke and skill learning are probably closely related. We propose to develop brain-computer interface neurofeedback paradigms to facilitate the learning of new skills. If this is effective in our animal subjects it will provide new avenues to explore for stroke rehabilitation.",Shaping Neural Population Dynamics to Facilitate Learning,9309921,R01HD071686,"['Animals', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Computers', 'Control Animal', 'Couples Therapy', 'Data', 'Electrodes', 'Exhibits', 'Goals', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Learning Skill', 'Lesion', 'Link', 'Macaca mulatta', 'Machine Learning', 'Modeling', 'Monkeys', 'Motor Cortex', 'Movement', 'Nervous System Trauma', 'Neurons', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Population Dynamics', 'Process', 'Recovery', 'Rehabilitation Outcome', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Scheme', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specialist', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Stroke', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Work', 'arm movement', 'base', 'behavior change', 'brain computer interface', 'design', 'forging', 'functional restoration', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'motor learning', 'multi-electrode arrays', 'network architecture', 'neural circuit', 'neural patterning', 'neurofeedback', 'neuromechanism', 'rehabilitation strategy', 'relating to nervous system', 'restoration', 'skills', 'stroke recovery', 'stroke rehabilitation', 'stroke survivor', 'theories', 'tool']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2017,453274,0.11444658491439044
"Contributions of spared brain structures and connections to aphasia recovery Language impairment, or aphasia, is a common problem after left hemisphere stroke, and causes significant long-term disability. After the initial period of healing, recovery from stroke relies on plasticity in brain networks spared from direct stroke damage. Thus, to improve behavioral and biological treatments for aphasia, we must understand how spared brain structures and connections contribute to recovery. Over a century of research has demonstrated that left hemisphere areas surrounding the stroke and right hemisphere areas symmetric to the normal left hemisphere language network participate in aphasia recovery. However, the mechanisms by which these areas are recruited and their roles in language recovery remain unclear, particularly for the “right hemisphere language network.” We propose to examine the role of spared brain structures and connections in recovery of core language functions in a large group of left hemisphere stroke survivors and matched controls. The innovative methods address major limitations of prior studies by accounting for individual differences in stroke severity, using task-independent brain structure and connectivity measures, and examining several core language functions as defined by statistical analysis of an extensive behavioral assessment battery. Preliminary studies using this new approach suggest that parts of the right hemisphere language network grow after stroke, and that these changes improve language outcomes. Based on these findings, we hypothesize that recruitment of the right hemisphere language network after left hemisphere stroke compensates for language deficits. We will test this hypothesis against multiple alternative hypotheses, using advanced brain imaging methods to test for effects throughout spared parts of the brain. Analyses will examine how spared brain structures and connections contribute to language recovery, accounting for individual differences in stroke severity. We will additionally test for signs of brain plasticity after stroke and test relationships between stroke location and patterns of brain plasticity to better understand the mechanisms of recovery. New multi- modal analysis methods will integrate the brain structure and connectivity data, providing a more complete picture of recovery of language functions than has been possible before. This research will significantly advance our understanding of the biological basis of aphasia recovery, which will be vital in order to design maximally effective treatments. Language impairment, or aphasia, is a common problem after left hemisphere stroke, and causes significant long-term disability. Understanding the brain basis of recovery is critical to developing new treatments that can meaningfully improve the lives of people with aphasia.

"Sleep apnea after stroke: Implications for screening and treatment ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Abstract Stroke is the leading cause of adult disability and a leading cause of death in the US, and results in $21 billion in direct medical costs each year. Stroke disproportionately impacts minorities including Hispanics who have higher stroke risk, poorer outcomes after stroke, and a higher prevalence of post-stroke sleep-disordered breathing (SDB). Declining stroke mortality in combination with the aging US population will result in dramatic increases in the number of disabled stroke survivors, with the largest increases projected among Hispanics. New approaches to improve stroke outcomes are therefore urgently needed, and may be particularly important among Hispanics, the largest US minority population. One critical yet scarcely explored opportunity may exist through identification and treatment of SDB in individuals with stroke. SDB is highly prevalent after stroke, and its presence predicts poor functional outcome and higher mortality. Nonetheless, very few stroke patients are screened or treated for SDB. Little information is available about which patients are likely to have high risk SDB after stroke; the trajectory of SDB in this setting and how to predict it; and almost no data are available for Hispanics. This information may offer opportunities to improve critical post-stroke outcomes and lessen ethnic stroke disparities. Thus, the main goals of the research proposed are 1) develop risk stratification models for post-stroke patients with SDB, 2) provide novel insight into the trajectory that SDB takes after stroke to inform management decisions, 3) inform the design of a subsequent clinical trial that will assess the impact of treatment of high risk SDB on key post-stroke outcomes, and 4) explore a possible treatable cause for worse stroke outcomes in Hispanics. We plan to take advantage of an exceptional opportunity provided by the ongoing Brain Attack Surveillance in Corpus Christi (BASIC) project (R01 NS38916). In this population-based stroke surveillance study in a bi-ethnic community, all acute ischemic stroke patients are interviewed at baseline and followed prospectively for 3, 6 and 12 month outcomes. The current application will add longitudinal SDB assessments to BASIC using a validated portable SDB screening device. SDB severity will be assessed with the apnea/hypopnea index, as well as innovative measures derived from signal analysis. Use of BASIC provides a cost-effective opportunity to expand our knowledge about SDB after stroke in ways that can directly impact clinical care, future clinical trial design, and health disparities. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Sleep-disordered breathing (SDB), which affects over half of stroke patients, predicts poor outcomes after stroke. Leveraging the infrastructure of the BASIC project, we propose a longitudinal, population-based study of SDB and stroke outcomes to improve the identification and management of important SDB after stroke, provide critical data to plan future clinical trials, and explore a potential target to reduce an important ethnic health disparity.",Sleep apnea after stroke: Implications for screening and treatment,9195060,R01HL126700,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Aging', 'Apnea', 'Autonomic Dysfunction', 'Caring', 'Cause of Death', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'County', 'Data', 'Devices', 'Disabled Persons', 'Elements', 'Epidemiology', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'High Prevalence', 'Hispanics', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Investigation', 'Ischemic Stroke', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Neurological outcome', 'Not Hispanic or Latino', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Population', 'Population Study', 'Pulse Rates', 'Quality of life', 'Recurrence', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Resource Allocation', 'Risk', 'Risk stratification', 'Sampling', 'Selection Criteria', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sleep Apnea Syndromes', 'Stroke', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'acute stroke', 'base', 'clinical care', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'design', 'disability', 'ethnic health disparity', 'experience', 'functional outcomes', 'health disparity', 'high risk', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'insight', 'mortality', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'personalized medicine', 'population based', 'portability', 'post stroke', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'research clinical testing', 'screening', 'stroke survivor', 'surveillance study']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2017,722492,0.29957750752869267
"Neural correlates of recovery from aphasia after acute stroke DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of this project is to identify the neural correlates of recovery from aphasia during the first three months after acute stroke. Aphasia is one of the most common and debilitating consequences of strokes affecting the dominant hemisphere. In the acute and subacute stages, most patients experience some degree of recovery of language function. These first few months after brain damage occurs are critically important because the greatest behavioral gains take place during this time, even when patients do not receive treatment. However the extent of recovery is highly variable: some patients recover most or nearly all language function, while others make few gains and remain chronically aphasic. It is not well understood what neural mechanisms underlie recovery during this period, nor why some patients recover so much better than others. To address these questions, we propose to study individuals with aphasia due to acute left hemisphere stroke. Patients will be examined at four time points after stroke: 24-48 hours, 2 weeks, 1 month, and 3 months. At each time point, a comprehensive yet time-efficient language evaluation will be administered to quantify expressive and receptive language function, and a multimodal brain imaging protocol will be implemented that includes structural imaging (MRI), functional imaging (fMRI), perfusion imaging (arterial spin labeling, ASL) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). The proposed research has two specific aims. The first is to identify the neural changes that are associated with successful recovery from aphasia in the acute and subacute periods after a stroke. The second aim is to determine the initial imaging and behavioral variables that are most predictive of the extent of eventual recovery of language function. We hypothesize that the inclusion of fMRI, ASL and DTI in combination with comprehensive language assessments will provide a more complete characterization of the brain's changing state than standard clinical imaging and language measures, and will explain a greater proportion of the variance in recovery patterns. A better understanding of the neural correlates of successful recovery will improve the accuracy of prognoses so as to better plan medical treatments and behavioral interventions. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Approximately one million Americans are living with aphasia, an acquired communication disorder that is one of the most common and debilitating consequences of stroke. The proposed research will use multimodal neuroimaging and comprehensive language evaluations to better understand the process of recovery from aphasia in the crucial first few months after acute stroke. The knowledge gained will help to improve accuracy of prognoses, which will support better planning of treatment and rehabilitation.",Neural correlates of recovery from aphasia after acute stroke,9326960,R01DC013270,"['Acquired Communication Disorders', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Affect', 'American', 'Aphasia', 'Area', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain Injuries', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain region', 'Cell Death', 'Chronic', 'Communities', 'Consent', 'Contralateral', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Evaluation', 'Functional Imaging', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Hour', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Infarction', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Left', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Modality', 'Pathologist', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perfusion', 'Physicians', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Recovery', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Reperfusion Therapy', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Secure', 'Speech', 'Spin Labels', 'Stroke', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'acute stroke', 'aphasia recovery', 'aphasic', 'behavioral study', 'clinical imaging', 'experience', 'hemodynamics', 'hypoperfusion', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'language impairment', 'language onset', 'language processing', 'multimodality', 'neural correlate', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'perfusion imaging', 'post stroke', 'prognostic', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'relational database', 'response', 'treatment planning', 'web based interface', 'white matter', 'white matter damage']",NIDCD,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2017,419061,0.16110488227500547
"Stroke Plasticity DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Stroke occurs when blood supply to some part of the brain is compromised and can lead to focal motor, language, and general functional deficits important for activities of daily life. Recovery after deficits in stroke patients is linked to bran plasticity changes occurring over time. There is evidence that these plasticity changes can be adaptive as well as maladaptive towards functional recovery and rehabilitation aimed at facilitating adaptive networks and suppressing maladaptive networks may hasten stroke recovery.   One way to characterize plasticity changes over time is by utilizing fMRI methods in adults who have suffered an insult (e.g., stroke) resulting in damage to an area typically associated with a specific language or motor function. Studies have shown that these patients show recovery through brain reorganization changes over time where a network of areas are recruited while performing the language or motor function. There are a number of novel stroke rehabilitation treatments aimed at improving recovery. Yet no set guidelines exist on how to utilize these treatments. There is an important need to develop a set of prognostic predictors to make decisions about which patients are appropriate for which treatment, identify a time window that best predicts stroke recovery and therefore ideal for intervention, as well as characterize adaptive and maladaptive brain plasticity changes in order to facilitate faster and more effective rehabilitation.   This proposal has three aims: 1) Identify prognostic predictors of stroke recovery, 2) Identify a time window which best predicts stroke recovery, and 3) Identify adaptive and maladaptive brain plasticity changes involved in stroke recovery. Stroke patients will undergo through neuroimaging and behavioral testing at the acute, subacute and chronic stages. Neuroimaging measures (e.g., fMRI activation) along with clinical measures will be utilized to predict behavior. It is hypothesized that neuroimaging along with clinical measures will predict motor, language, and general functional stroke recovery more accurately than either measure. It is also hypothesized a subacute time window would best predict stroke recovery, given that the most robust plasticity changes occur at this time window. It is hypothesized that that brain plasticity changes assessed by brain measures over time will predict behavioral performance changes over time, characterizing adaptive and maladaptive plasticity networks essential for motor, language, and general functional stroke recovery.   Overall this would lead to better prognostic prediction of recovery in stroke patients, identify a critical time window for intervention, identify adaptive and maladaptive networks involved in reorganization. Subsequently this would allow us to provide individualized treatments based on the prognostics, allow us to intervene at a particular time window for optimal effect, and expand the potential for a range of rehabilitation strategies aimed at facilitating adaptive and suppressing maladaptive networks hastening and maximizing functional recovery. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Stroke is the fourth leading cause of death in the United States as well as the leading cause of long-term disability. Each year about 800,000 people suffer a new or recurrent stroke in the United States. 85% of these patients survive and require rehabilitation, making it the leading cause of long-term disability in the U.S. The majority of the stroke costs(e.g. $57 billion in 2003 to $73.7 billion in 2010 and from 2005-2050 is projected to be $2.2 trillion) are needed for long-term care and rehabilitation (>2/3). Although there are already several rehabilitation techniques aimed at stroke recovery including traditional physical-occupational-speech therapy, novel therapies such as constraint-induced therapy, robot-aided therapy, Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS), real-time biofeedback, and brain-computer interface treatments, few guidelines exist for these interventions. The recommendations from the 2009 workshop sponsored by the NIH blueprint for neuroscience research heralded the translation of neuroplasticity as key to developing guidelines for effective clinical therapies in rehabilitation. Furthermore, the high prevalence of stroke and the high economic costs associated with it make rehabilitation or reduction of stroke-related disability a national healthcare priority. This research proposal is designed to characterize brain plasticity changes using neuroimaging measures and: 1) identify prognostic predictors in terms of neuroimaging and clinical measures so specific rehabilitation treatment plans can be tailored for a particular patient based on these predictors 2) identify a time window using neuroimaging measures which best predicts stroke recovery where stroke interventions may be maximally effective and 3) characterize the brain networks involved in stroke recovery so interventions can facilitate adaptive networks and suppress maladaptive networks which may lead to faster and more optimal rehabilitation. The results of this study could potentially help in the designing of effectve patient specific rehabilitation plans. The ability to plan patient-specific rehabilitation techniqus for optimal recovery will result in longer productive life-spans for the patients and less burden o the care- givers.

"Optimizing sensori-motor training post-stroke Project Summary The large variability in lesions, impairment, and responsiveness to training following stroke has hindered the development of principled and cost-effective approaches to neuro-rehabilitation of the upper extremity. Our long-term goal is to develop predictive personalized neurorehabilitation therapy based on large data sets. This proposal is based on a unique opportunity to design and execute a large neuro-rehabilitation cohort study at a relatively low cost. Building on our established US-French collaborations, with interdisciplinary expertise in neurorehabilitation, brain imaging, dynamical systems, and statistical learning, we will predict recovery and individualize therapy with the following novel three-pronged approach. In Aim 1, we will develop a database of clinical and neural patient characteristics, treatments, and outcomes from 500 patients post-stroke receiving upper extremity rehabilitation therapy with the ARMEO Spring device (a gravity compensating exoskeleton) in routine clinical care. Inclusion criteria will be as broad as possible to include patients with a large variety of brain lesions, as assessed by state- of-the-art magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and functional MRI scans. In aim 2, using the database, we will predict long-term changes in upper extremity outcomes as a function of patient's characteristics and treatment using dynamical models that link motor learning to recovery. The final models will expand and combine previous computational models of motor learning at small time scales with models of recovery at long time scales, and will include mixed effects to accurately predict long-term recovery for individual patients. In aim 3, based on these predictions, we will perform a feasibility study aimed at individualizing upper extremity rehabilitation to maximize recovery. Given a new patient, characterized by a number of baseline characteristics that predict recovery, we will select the schedule of treatment that was the most effective for similar patients in the database. The recovery models and scheduling methods developed in this proposal will provide the basis for future clinical software that suggests timing, dosage, and content of therapy from early clinical data, kinematic performance, and routine scans. Such an approach will transform neurorehabilitation programs because the clinician, patient, and insurance company will be able to determine effective treatments while reducing costs. Inclusion of Children Children and adolescents under the age of 21 will be excluded on scientific grounds. The incidence, etiology and pathophysiology of stroke are quite different in this age range, and inclusion would introduce substantial heterogeneity to the subject pool without providing a large enough sample to inform pediatric stroke care. More importantly, patterns of recovery differ with age, and adding small numbers of subjects with very different recovery from the target population would similarly impede hypothesis testing.",Optimizing sensori-motor training post-stroke,9512137,R56NS100528,"['21 year old', 'Accounting', 'Action Research', 'Acute', 'Adolescent', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood stroke', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cohort Studies', 'Collaborations', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Corticospinal Tracts', 'Data', 'Data Quality', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Disease', 'Early treatment', 'Enrollment', 'Etiology', 'Evidence based practice', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Force of Gravity', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human Resources', 'Impairment', 'Incidence', 'Insurance', 'International', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Light', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Multi-Institutional Clinical Trial', 'National Health Insurance', 'Neurorehabilitation', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Recovery', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Rest', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Schedule', 'Space Models', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'Target Populations', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Treatment outcome', 'Upper Extremity', 'acute stroke', 'arm', 'base', 'clinical care', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'design', 'disability', 'dosage', 'dynamic system', 'effective therapy', 'exoskeleton', 'inclusion criteria', 'individual patient', 'individualized medicine', 'kinematics', 'motor learning', 'novel', 'patient population', 'post stroke', 'programs', 'prospective', 'relating to nervous system', 'treatment group']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,R56,2017,483108,0.10011288159407046
"Prediction Model for Incident Stroke for Early Screening of an Individual at Risk of Stroke ABSTRACT Stroke is one of the leading causes of death and disability in the United States and other developed countries. About 800,000 people in the United States have a stroke each year. The incidence of stroke is expected to increase (due to diabetes, an aging population and a rise in obesity), which is a major public health concern and great economic burden to society. Early identification of people at risk of stroke is important as it allows for better planning and implementation of preventative strategies. A number of risk prediction models have been proposed for stroke using common biomarkers such as lipids, and conventional risk factors including age, gender, history of hypertension and smoking. However, these models do not adequately capture a substantial proportion of persons at high risk of stroke they lack precision (best accuracy is up to 50% by Framingham risk score) in risk estimation and have other limitations. Therefore, it is a necessity to improve the accuracy of a stroke risk prediction model. Therefore, we aim to develop a novel model using retinal vessel features and conventional risk factors which will provide higher accuracy on stroke prediction than the existing models and provide better preventative strategies for the people at risk of stroke. PROJECT NARRATIVE Stroke is one of the leading causes of death and disability in developed countries. Early intervention and therapy can significantly reduce the risk of stroke. Hence, identification of patients at risk of incident stroke is critically needed to help prevent this life-threatening disease. To achieve this goal, we propose to develop an automated screening system that can be widely deployed to identify these individuals at risk of stroke.",Prediction Model for Incident Stroke for Early Screening of an Individual at Risk of Stroke,9465584,R43NS102100,"['Age', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'American', 'Area', 'Arteries', 'Asians', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Pressure', 'Blood Vessels', 'Body mass index', 'Brain imaging', 'Car Phone', 'Cause of Death', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Developed Countries', 'Developing Countries', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Early treatment', 'Economic Burden', 'Educational Background', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Ethnic group', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Habits', 'Hispanics', 'Hypertension', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Legal patent', 'Lesion', 'Licensing', 'Life', 'Light', 'Lipids', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Neurologist', 'Obesity', 'Ophthalmology', 'Optometry', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Prevention strategy', 'Primary Health Care', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Reading', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reflex action', 'Reporting', 'Retinal', 'Retinal Diseases', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Smoking', 'Societies', 'Stroke', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technology', 'Telemedicine', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Veins', 'Waist-Hip Ratio', 'Width', 'aging population', 'base', 'checkup examination', 'commercial application', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'design', 'disability', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'platform-independent', 'portability', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'prototype', 'racial and ethnic', 'retina blood vessel structure', 'screening', 'white matter']",NINDS,"IHEALTHSCREEN, INC.",R43,2017,303622,0.2388618577801843
"Whole Transcriptome Studies of Patients with Transient Ischemic Attacks (TIAs) ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Transient ischemic attacks (TIA) are critical to identify because prevention therapy can reduce the risk of future vascular events by > 50%. Diagnostic testing and therapeutic intervention must start as soon as possible because 10-25% of TIAs have a stroke within 90 days. Because so many patients present emergently with transient neurological events the large majority of whom do not go on to have a stroke, methods for identifying TIAs at high risk for stroke have been sought so that work up and treatment can be targeted to those who need it most to save time, money and limited resources. Though the ABCD2 score and brain Diffusion Weighted Imaging-MRI (DWI-MRI) have improved prediction of which TIAs have a stroke, their sensitivity and specificity for prediction of individual cases i poor. In this proposal we propose that peripheral blood leukocytes and platelets play pivotal roles in which TIAs go on to have a stroke and by assessing RNA in whole blood we can evaluate leukocyte and platelet function in TIA patients who go on to have stroke versus those that do not have a stroke. We hypothesize that specific coagulation and immune genes are activated in TIA patients that predispose them to have a stroke by 90 days compared to those TIA patients who do NOT have a stroke by 90 days. A subset of these leukocyte and platelet mRNA genes will predict TIAs who have a stroke by 90 days. This hypothesis is addressed by the following specific aims. Aim #1 (Derivation Cohort): Demonstrate that mRNA expression measured using RNAseq from whole blood differs in a derivation cohort of TIAs that go on to have a stroke by 90 days compared to those TIAs who do not have a stroke by 90 days. Demonstrate that most mRNA found to be regulated using RNAseq are also significantly regulated when measured using qRT-PCR. Aim #2 (Derivation Cohort): Apply machine learning algorithms to the mRNA from Aim #1 to derive an optimal subset of mRNA regulated by both RNAseq and qRT-PCR that predict which TIAs have strokes by 90 days compared to those who do not with >95% sensitivity on cross-validation. Aim #3 (Validation Cohort): Use machine/prediction learning algorithms to demonstrate that the genes from Aim #2 when measured using qRT-PCR on an independent validation cohort predict which TIAs have a stroke by 90 days with >85% sensitivity. The goal of these studies is to discover mRNA profiles in blood that predict which TIA patients go on to have strokes by 90 days. When confirmed in future studies, this will direct in depth testing to those high risk TIAs most in need in order to prevent strokes, and decrease unnecessary testing in those with low risk of stroke. Equally as important, the genes discovered to be associated with high risk of stroke in TIA patients will represent potential novel stroke prevention targets. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will examine RNA in blood using RNAseq and qRT-PCR of human subjects with Transient Ischemic Attacks (TIAs) who have a stroke by 90 days compared to TIAs who do not have a stroke. The regulated mRNA, exons and alternatively spliced transcripts in a Derivation Cohort of TIA patients will be used to predict which TIAs have a stroke by 90 days in a Validation Cohort of TIA patients.",Whole Transcriptome Studies of Patients with Transient Ischemic Attacks (TIAs),9127532,R01NS097000,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Arterial Fatty Streak', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood Platelets', 'Blood Vessels', 'Brain', 'Cerebrum', 'Clinical', 'Coagulation Process', 'Data', 'Derivation procedure', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Emergency Situation', 'Epilepsy', 'Event', 'Exons', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hour', 'Immune', 'Individual', 'Ischemic Stroke', 'Labyrinthine disorder', 'Learning', 'Leukocytes', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Messenger RNA', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Migraine', 'Neurologic', 'Patients', 'Play', 'Prevention therapy', 'Publishing', 'RNA', 'RNA Splicing', 'ROC Curve', 'Recurrence', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Estimate', 'Role', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Site', 'Stroke', 'Stroke prevention', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Transcript', 'Transient Ischemic Attack', 'Validation', 'Whole Blood', 'Work', 'base', 'cohort', 'gene discovery', 'high risk', 'human subject', 'improved', 'mRNA Expression', 'monocyte', 'neutrophil', 'novel', 'peripheral blood', 'prospective', 'release factor', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,R01,2016,620686,0.2826061521768155
"Center for the Study of Aphasia Recovery (C-STAR) ﻿    DESCRIPTION (Description as provided by applicant): Stroke is the leading cause of adult disability in the United States, making it a major public health concern (1). The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) estimates the annual cost of stroke in the United States to be $36.5 billion (1). Accordingly, it is clear that the negative personal and societal impact of stroke is vry high. Stroke is typically thought to affect older persons; however, many younger individuals also suffer strokes. For example, at least half of all stroke patients in the state of South Carolina ar under the age of 60 (2). Approximately a quarter of all chronic stroke survivors present with aphasia, a language disorder caused by damage to the speech and language areas of the brain (3, 4). The prevalence of chronic aphasia in the United States is estimated to be one million. Aphasia can vary in severity from very profound impairment that renders patients mute and without the ability to understand others' speech, to milder forms where patients have great difficulty retrieving specific words. In the chronic stage of stroke, aphasia has been identified a the strongest predictor of poor quality of life. Aphasia not only influences the ability to communicate with family and friends, but also drastically decreases education and employment opportunities. Although some degree of spontaneous recovery from aphasia is typical in the first weeks and months following stroke, many patients are left with devastating communication problems. Once aphasia has become a chronic condition, the only road to recovery is through aphasia therapy. Several meta-analysis studies suggest that aphasia therapy is effective. In spite of decades of research, very little is known about which patients benefit the most from treatment and what kind of treatment should be administered to patients with different impairment profiles. The overarching goal of the research proposed here is to improve aphasia treatment effectiveness as well as identify patient factors that can be used to improve diagnosis of language impairment, guide aphasia treatment, and predict prognosis. Specifically, the focus of our center (Center for the Study of Aphasia Recovery; C-STAR) is to examine the extent to which factors such as behavioral aphasia treatment, electrical brain stimulation, and residual brain function influence aphasia recovery. To accomplish our research goals, this project will rely on collaboration among four main investigators: Drs. Julius Fridriksson, Argye Hillis, Chris Rorden, and Greg Hickok. Projects led by Fridriksson (chronic patients) and Hillis (acute patients) will focus on factors that may promote improved outcome of aphasia therapy. Both projects will yield a vast, unique dataset including measures of brain status and response to aphasia treatment. Relying on this dataset, Rorden's project will predict recovery from aphasia using machine learning approaches whereas Hickok will utilize the same data to better understand aphasic impairment in relation to contemporary models of speech and language processing.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Stroke is the leading cause of adult disability in the United States; aphasia, an impairment of the ability to process language, is one of the most devastating results of left hemisphere stroke. The purpose of the work proposed here is to improve recovery from aphasia by better understanding how neurophysiology and anatomy as well as theory driven aphasia treatment relate to long-term outcome.            Subproject-1    Modeling treated recovery from aphasia    Lead Investigator: Julius Fridriksson, Ph.D.            DESCRIPTION (Description as provided by applicant): Stroke is the leading cause of serious adult disability in the United States. One of the most devastating impairments resulting from stroke is aphasia, a language impairment caused by left hemisphere damage involving cortical language areas. It is generally accepted that behavioral aphasia treatment is effective. Nevertheless, different patients experience very different degrees of benefit from aphasia treatment. Despite considerable differences in the response to aphasia treatment, the relationship between patient factors and treatment response is poorly understood and very few reliable prognostic indicators have been identified. This is a major problem, as both time and resources are wasted when clinicians do not know what patients are likely to respond to treatment, or which treatment best fits individual patients. The purpose of the current project is to develop a model that includes biographical and cognitive/linguistic factors to predict patients' response to aphasia treatment. Aphasia severity is one of the few factors that have been identified as a reliable predictor of performance in treatment; it is generally accepted that more severe aphasia is associated with poorer treatment outcomes. However, aphasia severity is a multidimensional construct and patients with similar overall severity scores might demonstrate very different language impairment profiles. To better understand how language impairment relates to treatment outcomes, the dual stream model (DS model;1) will be consulted. Specifically, we will test whether measures of proportional damage to the cortical areas that comprise the DS model improve prediction of aphasia treatment response, beyond biographical and cognitive/linguistic factors. Although the DS model is a functional model grounded in neuroanatomy, we expect measures of speech and language that assesses processes supported by the two major components of the DS model - the dorsal and ventral streams - might be redundant with measures of cortical damage. To understand whether our predictive model can be generalized across different kinds of treatment foci, each patient will undergo treatment devoted to phonological stimulation and a separate treatment phase focusing on semantic stimulation. Ultimately, the goal here is to construct a predictive model that will be made available on- line so that clinicians can enter test scores from individual patients to predic how likely a given patient is to respond to treatment, as well as the focus of that treatment.         There is a great need for prognostic indicators of aphasia treatment response. At the completion of our research, we will understand why some patients respond better to aphasia treatment than others. We have selected treatment approaches that are routinely used in clinical practice, allowing for immediate translation of the findings directly into patient management. The current project will yield a vast dataset that will be made publicly available allowing others to study further aphasia treatment response in relation to cognitive/linguistic and lesion factors.              ",Center for the Study of Aphasia Recovery (C-STAR),9083041,P50DC014664,"['Acute', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'American', 'Anatomy', 'Aphasia', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain Injuries', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Cerebrum', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Communication', 'Consult', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Dorsal', 'Education', 'Elderly', 'Electric Stimulation', 'Electrical Stimulation of the Brain', 'Employment', 'Employment Opportunities', 'Family', 'Friends', 'Goals', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Language', 'Language Disorders', 'Lead', 'Left', 'Lesion', 'Life', 'Life Expectancy', 'Linguistics', 'Literature', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Modeling', 'Neuroanatomy', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Perfusion', 'Phase', 'Prevalence', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Public Health', 'Qualifying', 'Quality of life', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Residual state', 'Resources', 'Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor', 'Semantics', 'Severities', 'Social isolation', 'South Carolina', 'Speech', 'Staging', 'Stream', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translations', 'Treatment Effectiveness', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States', 'Work', 'acute stroke', 'aphasia recovery', 'aphasic', 'behavior test', 'chronic stroke', 'clinical practice', 'cost', 'disability', 'experience', 'fitness', 'hemisphere damage', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'individual patient', 'language impairment', 'language processing', 'mortality', 'neuroimaging', 'neurophysiology', 'outcome forecast', 'phonology', 'predicting response', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'speech processing', 'stroke survivor', 'success', 'theories', 'treatment response', 'wasting']",NIDCD,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA AT COLUMBIA,P50,2016,2291632,0.10730859519924366
"Sleep apnea after stroke: Implications for screening and treatment ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Abstract Stroke is the leading cause of adult disability and a leading cause of death in the US, and results in $21 billion in direct medical costs each year. Stroke disproportionately impacts minorities including Hispanics who have higher stroke risk, poorer outcomes after stroke, and a higher prevalence of post-stroke sleep-disordered breathing (SDB). Declining stroke mortality in combination with the aging US population will result in dramatic increases in the number of disabled stroke survivors, with the largest increases projected among Hispanics. New approaches to improve stroke outcomes are therefore urgently needed, and may be particularly important among Hispanics, the largest US minority population. One critical yet scarcely explored opportunity may exist through identification and treatment of SDB in individuals with stroke. SDB is highly prevalent after stroke, and its presence predicts poor functional outcome and higher mortality. Nonetheless, very few stroke patients are screened or treated for SDB. Little information is available about which patients are likely to have high risk SDB after stroke; the trajectory of SDB in this setting and how to predict it; and almost no data are available for Hispanics. This information may offer opportunities to improve critical post-stroke outcomes and lessen ethnic stroke disparities. Thus, the main goals of the research proposed are 1) develop risk stratification models for post-stroke patients with SDB, 2) provide novel insight into the trajectory that SDB takes after stroke to inform management decisions, 3) inform the design of a subsequent clinical trial that will assess the impact of treatment of high risk SDB on key post-stroke outcomes, and 4) explore a possible treatable cause for worse stroke outcomes in Hispanics. We plan to take advantage of an exceptional opportunity provided by the ongoing Brain Attack Surveillance in Corpus Christi (BASIC) project (R01 NS38916). In this population-based stroke surveillance study in a bi-ethnic community, all acute ischemic stroke patients are interviewed at baseline and followed prospectively for 3, 6 and 12 month outcomes. The current application will add longitudinal SDB assessments to BASIC using a validated portable SDB screening device. SDB severity will be assessed with the apnea/hypopnea index, as well as innovative measures derived from signal analysis. Use of BASIC provides a cost-effective opportunity to expand our knowledge about SDB after stroke in ways that can directly impact clinical care, future clinical trial design, and health disparities.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Sleep-disordered breathing (SDB), which affects over half of stroke patients, predicts poor outcomes after stroke. Leveraging the infrastructure of the BASIC project, we propose a longitudinal, population-based study of SDB and stroke outcomes to improve the identification and management of important SDB after stroke, provide critical data to plan future clinical trials, and explore a potential target to reduce an important ethnic health disparity.                ",Sleep apnea after stroke: Implications for screening and treatment,9028400,R01HL126700,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Aging', 'Apnea', 'Autonomic Dysfunction', 'Caring', 'Cause of Death', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'County', 'Data', 'Devices', 'Disabled Persons', 'Elements', 'Epidemiology', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'High Prevalence', 'Hispanics', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Investigation', 'Ischemic Stroke', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Neurological outcome', 'Not Hispanic or Latino', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Population', 'Pulse Rates', 'Quality of life', 'Recurrence', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Resource Allocation', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Selection Criteria', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sleep Apnea Syndromes', 'Stratification', 'Stroke', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'abstracting', 'acute stroke', 'base', 'clinical care', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'design', 'disability', 'ethnic health disparity', 'experience', 'functional outcomes', 'health disparity', 'high risk', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'insight', 'mortality', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'personalized medicine', 'population based', 'post stroke', 'public health relevance', 'research clinical testing', 'screening', 'stroke survivor', 'surveillance study']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2016,767518,0.29957750752869267
"Neural correlates of recovery from aphasia after acute stroke DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of this project is to identify the neural correlates of recovery from aphasia during the first three months after acute stroke. Aphasia is one of the most common and debilitating consequences of strokes affecting the dominant hemisphere. In the acute and subacute stages, most patients experience some degree of recovery of language function. These first few months after brain damage occurs are critically important because the greatest behavioral gains take place during this time, even when patients do not receive treatment. However the extent of recovery is highly variable: some patients recover most or nearly all language function, while others make few gains and remain chronically aphasic. It is not well understood what neural mechanisms underlie recovery during this period, nor why some patients recover so much better than others. To address these questions, we propose to study individuals with aphasia due to acute left hemisphere stroke. Patients will be examined at four time points after stroke: 24-48 hours, 2 weeks, 1 month, and 3 months. At each time point, a comprehensive yet time-efficient language evaluation will be administered to quantify expressive and receptive language function, and a multimodal brain imaging protocol will be implemented that includes structural imaging (MRI), functional imaging (fMRI), perfusion imaging (arterial spin labeling, ASL) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). The proposed research has two specific aims. The first is to identify the neural changes that are associated with successful recovery from aphasia in the acute and subacute periods after a stroke. The second aim is to determine the initial imaging and behavioral variables that are most predictive of the extent of eventual recovery of language function. We hypothesize that the inclusion of fMRI, ASL and DTI in combination with comprehensive language assessments will provide a more complete characterization of the brain's changing state than standard clinical imaging and language measures, and will explain a greater proportion of the variance in recovery patterns. A better understanding of the neural correlates of successful recovery will improve the accuracy of prognoses so as to better plan medical treatments and behavioral interventions. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Approximately one million Americans are living with aphasia, an acquired communication disorder that is one of the most common and debilitating consequences of stroke. The proposed research will use multimodal neuroimaging and comprehensive language evaluations to better understand the process of recovery from aphasia in the crucial first few months after acute stroke. The knowledge gained will help to improve accuracy of prognoses, which will support better planning of treatment and rehabilitation.",Neural correlates of recovery from aphasia after acute stroke,9059058,R01DC013270,"['Acquired Communication Disorders', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Affect', 'American', 'Aphasia', 'Area', 'Arteriogram', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain Injuries', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain region', 'Cell Death', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Consent', 'Contralateral', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Evaluation', 'Functional Imaging', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hour', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Infarction', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Left', 'Life', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Modality', 'Pathologist', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perfusion', 'Physicians', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Recovery', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Reperfusion Therapy', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Secure', 'Speech', 'Spin Labels', 'Staging', 'Stroke', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'acute stroke', 'aphasia recovery', 'aphasic', 'behavioral study', 'experience', 'hemodynamics', 'hypoperfusion', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'language impairment', 'language processing', 'neural correlate', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'outcome forecast', 'post stroke', 'prognostic', 'relating to nervous system', 'relational database', 'response', 'treatment planning', 'web based interface', 'white matter', 'white matter damage']",NIDCD,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2016,419061,0.16110488227500547
"Stroke Plasticity DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Stroke occurs when blood supply to some part of the brain is compromised and can lead to focal motor, language, and general functional deficits important for activities of daily life. Recovery after deficits in stroke patients is linked to bran plasticity changes occurring over time. There is evidence that these plasticity changes can be adaptive as well as maladaptive towards functional recovery and rehabilitation aimed at facilitating adaptive networks and suppressing maladaptive networks may hasten stroke recovery.   One way to characterize plasticity changes over time is by utilizing fMRI methods in adults who have suffered an insult (e.g., stroke) resulting in damage to an area typically associated with a specific language or motor function. Studies have shown that these patients show recovery through brain reorganization changes over time where a network of areas are recruited while performing the language or motor function. There are a number of novel stroke rehabilitation treatments aimed at improving recovery. Yet no set guidelines exist on how to utilize these treatments. There is an important need to develop a set of prognostic predictors to make decisions about which patients are appropriate for which treatment, identify a time window that best predicts stroke recovery and therefore ideal for intervention, as well as characterize adaptive and maladaptive brain plasticity changes in order to facilitate faster and more effective rehabilitation.   This proposal has three aims: 1) Identify prognostic predictors of stroke recovery, 2) Identify a time window which best predicts stroke recovery, and 3) Identify adaptive and maladaptive brain plasticity changes involved in stroke recovery. Stroke patients will undergo through neuroimaging and behavioral testing at the acute, subacute and chronic stages. Neuroimaging measures (e.g., fMRI activation) along with clinical measures will be utilized to predict behavior. It is hypothesized that neuroimaging along with clinical measures will predict motor, language, and general functional stroke recovery more accurately than either measure. It is also hypothesized a subacute time window would best predict stroke recovery, given that the most robust plasticity changes occur at this time window. It is hypothesized that that brain plasticity changes assessed by brain measures over time will predict behavioral performance changes over time, characterizing adaptive and maladaptive plasticity networks essential for motor, language, and general functional stroke recovery.   Overall this would lead to better prognostic prediction of recovery in stroke patients, identify a critical time window for intervention, identify adaptive and maladaptive networks involved in reorganization. Subsequently this would allow us to provide individualized treatments based on the prognostics, allow us to intervene at a particular time window for optimal effect, and expand the potential for a range of rehabilitation strategies aimed at facilitating adaptive and suppressing maladaptive networks hastening and maximizing functional recovery. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Stroke is the fourth leading cause of death in the United States as well as the leading cause of long-term disability. Each year about 800,000 people suffer a new or recurrent stroke in the United States. 85% of these patients survive and require rehabilitation, making it the leading cause of long-term disability in the U.S. The majority of the stroke costs(e.g. $57 billion in 2003 to $73.7 billion in 2010 and from 2005-2050 is projected to be $2.2 trillion) are needed for long-term care and rehabilitation (>2/3). Although there are already several rehabilitation techniques aimed at stroke recovery including traditional physical-occupational-speech therapy, novel therapies such as constraint-induced therapy, robot-aided therapy, Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS), real-time biofeedback, and brain-computer interface treatments, few guidelines exist for these interventions. The recommendations from the 2009 workshop sponsored by the NIH blueprint for neuroscience research heralded the translation of neuroplasticity as key to developing guidelines for effective clinical therapies in rehabilitation. Furthermore, the high prevalence of stroke and the high economic costs associated with it make rehabilitation or reduction of stroke-related disability a national healthcare priority. This research proposal is designed to characterize brain plasticity changes using neuroimaging measures and: 1) identify prognostic predictors in terms of neuroimaging and clinical measures so specific rehabilitation treatment plans can be tailored for a particular patient based on these predictors 2) identify a time window using neuroimaging measures which best predicts stroke recovery where stroke interventions may be maximally effective and 3) characterize the brain networks involved in stroke recovery so interventions can facilitate adaptive networks and suppress maladaptive networks which may lead to faster and more optimal rehabilitation. The results of this study could potentially help in the designing of effectve patient specific rehabilitation plans. The ability to plan patient-specific rehabilitation techniqus for optimal recovery will result in longer productive life-spans for the patients and less burden o the care- givers.

These first few months after brain damage occurs are critically important because the greatest behavioral gains take place during this time, even when patients do not receive treatment. However the extent of recovery is highly variable: some patients recover most or nearly all language function, while others make few gains and remain chronically aphasic. It is not well understood what neural mechanisms underlie recovery during this period, nor why some patients recover so much better than others. To address these questions, we propose to study individuals with aphasia due to acute left hemisphere stroke. Patients will be examined at four time points after stroke: 24-48 hours, 2 weeks, 1 month, and 3 months. At each time point, a comprehensive yet time-efficient language evaluation will be administered to quantify expressive and receptive language function, and a multimodal brain imaging protocol will be implemented that includes structural imaging (MRI), functional imaging (fMRI), perfusion imaging (arterial spin labeling, ASL) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). The proposed research has two specific aims. The first is to identify the neural changes that are associated with successful recovery from aphasia in the acute and subacute periods after a stroke. The second aim is to determine the initial imaging and behavioral variables that are most predictive of the extent of eventual recovery of language function. We hypothesize that the inclusion of fMRI, ASL and DTI in combination with comprehensive language assessments will provide a more complete characterization of the brain's changing state than standard clinical imaging and language measures, and will explain a greater proportion of the variance in recovery patterns. A better understanding of the neural correlates of successful recovery will improve the accuracy of prognoses so as to better plan medical treatments and behavioral interventions. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Approximately one million Americans are living with aphasia, an acquired communication disorder that is one of the most common and debilitating consequences of stroke. The proposed research will use multimodal neuroimaging and comprehensive language evaluations to better understand the process of recovery from aphasia in the crucial first few months after acute stroke.

"Stroke Plasticity DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Stroke occurs when blood supply to some part of the brain is compromised and can lead to focal motor, language, and general functional deficits important for activities of daily life. Recovery after deficits in stroke patients is linked to bran plasticity changes occurring over time. There is evidence that these plasticity changes can be adaptive as well as maladaptive towards functional recovery and rehabilitation aimed at facilitating adaptive networks and suppressing maladaptive networks may hasten stroke recovery.   One way to characterize plasticity changes over time is by utilizing fMRI methods in adults who have suffered an insult (e.g., stroke) resulting in damage to an area typically associated with a specific language or motor function. Studies have shown that these patients show recovery through brain reorganization changes over time where a network of areas are recruited while performing the language or motor function. There are a number of novel stroke rehabilitation treatments aimed at improving recovery. Yet no set guidelines exist on how to utilize these treatments. There is an important need to develop a set of prognostic predictors to make decisions about which patients are appropriate for which treatment, identify a time window that best predicts stroke recovery and therefore ideal for intervention, as well as characterize adaptive and maladaptive brain plasticity changes in order to facilitate faster and more effective rehabilitation.   This proposal has three aims: 1) Identify prognostic predictors of stroke recovery, 2) Identify a time window which best predicts stroke recovery, and 3) Identify adaptive and maladaptive brain plasticity changes involved in stroke recovery. Stroke patients will undergo through neuroimaging and behavioral testing at the acute, subacute and chronic stages. Neuroimaging measures (e.g., fMRI activation) along with clinical measures will be utilized to predict behavior. It is hypothesized that neuroimaging along with clinical measures will predict motor, language, and general functional stroke recovery more accurately than either measure. It is also hypothesized a subacute time window would best predict stroke recovery, given that the most robust plasticity changes occur at this time window. It is hypothesized that that brain plasticity changes assessed by brain measures over time will predict behavioral performance changes over time, characterizing adaptive and maladaptive plasticity networks essential for motor, language, and general functional stroke recovery.   Overall this would lead to better prognostic prediction of recovery in stroke patients, identify a critical time window for intervention, identify adaptive and maladaptive networks involved in reorganization. Subsequently this would allow us to provide individualized treatments based on the prognostics, allow us to intervene at a particular time window for optimal effect, and expand the potential for a range of rehabilitation strategies aimed at facilitating adaptive and suppressing maladaptive networks hastening and maximizing functional recovery. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Stroke is the fourth leading cause of death in the United States as well as the leading cause of long-term disability. Each year about 800,000 people suffer a new or recurrent stroke in the United States. 85% of these patients survive and require rehabilitation, making it the leading cause of long-term disability in the U.S. The majority of the stroke costs(e.g. $57 billion in 2003 to $73.7 billion in 2010 and from 2005-2050 is projected to be $2.2 trillion) are needed for long-term care and rehabilitation (>2/3). Although there are already several rehabilitation techniques aimed at stroke recovery including traditional physical-occupational-speech therapy, novel therapies such as constraint-induced therapy, robot-aided therapy, Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS), real-time biofeedback, and brain-computer interface treatments, few guidelines exist for these interventions. The recommendations from the 2009 workshop sponsored by the NIH blueprint for neuroscience research heralded the translation of neuroplasticity as key to developing guidelines for effective clinical therapies in rehabilitation. Furthermore, the high prevalence of stroke and the high economic costs associated with it make rehabilitation or reduction of stroke-related disability a national healthcare priority. This research proposal is designed to characterize brain plasticity changes using neuroimaging measures and: 1) identify prognostic predictors in terms of neuroimaging and clinical measures so specific rehabilitation treatment plans can be tailored for a particular patient based on these predictors 2) identify a time window using neuroimaging measures which best predicts stroke recovery where stroke interventions may be maximally effective and 3) characterize the brain networks involved in stroke recovery so interventions can facilitate adaptive networks and suppress maladaptive networks which may lead to faster and more optimal rehabilitation. The results of this study could potentially help in the designing of effectve patient specific rehabilitation plans.

"Biomarker panel to differentiate stroke from stroke mimic    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In the United States (US), stroke affects more than 700,000 people annually in the U.S. and is the third leading cause of death. Stroke patients may present to the emergency room with a wide variety of symptoms that can be caused by other conditions not related to stroke, collectively called stroke mimic. Even at the most advanced stroke centers, the diagnosis of ischemic stroke is made by clinical examination after ruling out hemorrhagic lesions by imaging. These imaging tests can be used to diagnose hemorrhagic stroke but is relatively ineffective in detecting most ischemic stroke. A reliable and rapid method to distinguish stroke and stroke mimic is a necessary aid to current examination and imaging-based stroke diagnosis and will become more crucial with the implementation of new therapies for the time-critical treatment of ischemic stroke. In contrast to cardiovascular disease and oncology, no approved immunoassay or molecular test is available to aid diagnosis. Analysis of a previous dataset demonstrated that our advanced GeneRx algorithm technologies were able to develop an accurate diagnostic model where other multi-marker panels failed. In this phase I proposal we will perform a validation study, collecting blood samples from 200 admitted with stroke-like symptoms and diagnosed as stroke or stroke mimic. We will measure stroke biomarker protein levels markers present in the top combinations and algorithms from our previous study, and utilize our proprietary GeneRx technology to develop a multiple marker predictive model for accurate differentiation of stroke from stroke mimic. Project Narrative: Currently no blood test is available to help accurately diagnose stroke patients. This study develops a diagnostic to help differentiate stroke patients from the many non-stroke patients that arrive at the ER with stroke-like symptoms.

"c-FN as a predictor of hemorrhagic transformation in t-PA treated stroke patients    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Currently there is only one approved drug treatment for acute ischemic stroke, t-PA. t-PA is a highly beneficial treatment but is severely underutilized due largely to fear of an often fatal side effect called hemorrhagic transformation. There is a critical clinical need for a diagnostic to identify patients that are at high and low risk of hemorrhagic transformation (HT). A preliminary study showed that plasma level of cellular fibronectin (c-Fn) was predictive of t-PA induced HT. We will collect patient samples and perform a validation study to confirm the utility of c-Fn as a molecular diagnostic for the prediction of more severe forms of HT. In this study we will determine the threshold levels of c-Fn that are most predictive of outcome, determine if the elevation of c-Fn is time dependant, and follow c-Fn levels through treatment. In addition we will analyze additional plasma biomarkers, matrix metalloprotease 9 (MMP9), apolipoprotein C-III (Apo-C), and serum amyloid A (SAA) as potential contributors to c-Fn to more accurately predict HT. A successful diagnostic would greatly improve safety and increase use of t-PA/thrombolytics in the treatment of stroke. This validation study develops the first biomarker-based diagnostic to aid physicians in the identification of patients with high and low risk of bleeding as a result of clot busting treatment of acute ischemic stroke. Successful development will increase safety and usage of this highly beneficial treatment as well as lower overall healthcare cost as a result of stroke.          n/a",c-FN as a predictor of hemorrhagic transformation in t-PA treated stroke patients,7220477,R43NS057921,"['Accounting', 'Acute', 'Admission activity', 'Adult', 'Adverse effects', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alteplase', 'American', 'Americas', 'Apolipoproteins C', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Blood Clot', 'Blood coagulation', 'Brain', 'Cause of Death', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Coagulation Process', 'Contracts', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Discriminant Analysis', 'Discrimination', 'Disease regression', 'Economic Burden', 'Elevation', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Evolution', 'Facilities and Administrative Costs', 'Fibronectins', 'Fright', 'Future', 'Guidelines', 'Health Care Costs', 'Hemorrhage', 'Hour', 'Image Analysis', 'Incidence', 'Institutes', 'Institution', 'Ischemic Stroke', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Manufacturer Name', 'Measures', 'Metalloproteases', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Non-linear Models', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Physiological reperfusion', 'Plasma', 'Predictive Factor', 'Publications', 'Purpose', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recovery', 'Reperfusion Therapy', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Serum amyloid A protein', 'Severities', 'Societies', 'Statistically Significant', 'Stroke', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thrombolytic Therapy', 'Time', 'Treatment outcome', 'Trees', 'United States Food and Drug Administration', 'Validation', 'Vascular blood supply', 'apolipoprotein C-III', 'base', 'brain tissue', 'desire', 'disability', 'falls', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'nervous system disorder', 'point of care', 'prognostic', 'social', 'statistics', 'tool', 'validation studies']",NINDS,"PREDICTION SCIENCES, LLC",R43,2007,206191,0.14430227795357567
"Robotic Stroke Rehabilitation Using Perceptual Feedback    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Due to advances in modern medicine, the elderly population is growing worldwide, and, along with this growth, there is a growing need for physical rehabilitation after strokes, which have an average onset of over 65 years of age. Given the magnitude of this problem and its societal ramifications, the time is ripe to explore the extent to which robotic devices and virtual environments can be used as a means of rehabilitation to improve the quality of life for both the elderly and the physically disabled. According to recent studies in robotics, robot-assisted stroke rehabilitation enhances arm movement recovery. Moreover, robot-assisted rehabilitation improves patients' mobility and strength to the point where it is equal to, or greater than, that which is achieved by human-assisted therapy. However, none of the currently available systems addresses patients' perceptual or cognitive deficits. Furthermore, these systems neglect to address the fact that many patients do not reach their full mobility potential using these systems. To remedy these problems, a virtual robotic environment that explores the full potential needs and abilities of patients must be developed. We will coin this strategy, ""rehabilitation by distortion."" To develop an environment to rehabilitate by distortion, however, there are two fundamental issues to address. First, it is necessary to quantify the perceptual gap that can be created between virtual and actual movements that is not perceptible to patients. To do so, we will first quantify the lowest sensory resolution, also known as just noticeable difference (JND), of force and position. As we explain below, the JND will act as the lowest bound of the perceptual gap. In addition, we will quantify the size of the perceptual gap with the existence of visual feedback distortion. Second, having identified a perceptual gap that is not noticeable, we must prove that mobility and strength of stroke patients can be extended by undetected distortion. For this proposed work, we will isolate working with one finger. Fingers are one of the parts of the body that are most commonly affected by strokes; thus testing the basic concepts about the perceptual gap between virtual and actual movements using fingers is appropriate. After we prove that rehabilitation by distortion is therapeutic for a finger, we can expand our work to other limbs. In addition, to show that this strategy is effective for patients who already received traditional therapy, we will work with patients who have already completed their traditional therapy and are at least one year after the onset of strokes. If we prove that we can allow patients to move beyond what they thought was possible after traditional therapeutic techniques, the results will be groundbreaking and will lead to an R01 grant to develop a new robotic virtual therapeutic strategy, ""rehabilitation by distortion,"" that extends the force production and range of motion for motor impaired patients recovering from stroke.         n/a",Robotic Stroke Rehabilitation Using Perceptual Feedback,7031314,R21HD047405,"['artificial intelligence', 'biomechanics', 'biomedical equipment development', 'clinical research', 'computer human interaction', 'computer simulation', 'fingers', 'functional ability', 'human subject', 'human therapy evaluation', 'longitudinal human study', 'medical rehabilitation related tag', 'motion perception', 'patient oriented research', 'perceptual distortions', 'quality of life', 'rehabilitation', 'robotics', 'sensory feedback', 'sensory thresholds', 'stroke therapy']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R21,2006,157321,0.1503234180132208
"MEDIC ONE STROKE SCALE As stroke therapies emerge, they will likely work better if given earlier after stroke onset.

"Data-driven subtyping to find patients with drug interactions leading to stroke Project Summary Stroke is a highly heterogeneous and complex disease and is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Identification of the cause of disease is essential for risk stratification and optimal treatment, but can be difficult, as up to 35% of causes are undetermined by traditional subtyping criteria and very few causative genetic variants have been found. In addition, certain causes may be hidden within the clinical picture of a patient, such as an adverse drug reaction. Using data-driven approaches to analyze the medical records of patients may uncover novel patterns of risk factors and clinical features leading to stroke. The long-term goal of this research is to identify novel subtypes of highly heterogeneous diseases such as stroke and to reduce the genetic heterogeneity of a disease cohort by identifying patients with the same subtype. The objective of this application is to propose a pipeline that applies a data-driven analysis of medical notes to identify novel subtypes of stroke, focus on a subtype caused by an adverse drug reaction or drug pair interaction, validate the subtype in a genotyped study cohort, and look for gene variant enrichment in this cohort. This application’s central hypothesis is that applying deep learning to the electronic health record (EHR) of acute ischemic stroke patients will form subtypes based on more granular information than currently implemented and with reduced genetic heterogeneity by identifying novel patterns of risk factors and clinical picture leading to the stroke. In addition, we hypothesize that at least one subtype will identify patients whose stroke is an adverse drug reaction or drug-drug interaction. To do this, Aim 1 will first identify all acute ischemic stroke patients in the EHR by developing a machine learning classifier trained on structured data in the EHR. Aim 2 will then build and train an unsupervised deep learning algorithm on text from medical notes to identify clusters, or subtypes, of patients with similar clinical pictures. Aim 3 will finally validate reduction in genetic heterogeneity of these cohorts by estimating observational heritability of all subtypes using a tool created in our lab and comparing this with the heritability estimates of subtypes derived from physician-based criteria. It will also focus on a not well-studied subtype, stroke due to an adverse drug reaction or drug-drug interaction, by identifying its enrichment in the novel subtypes, validating this subtype in a study cohort with genotyped data, and finally looking for enrichment of pharmacogenetic variants in this subtype. These aims will generate a computational pipeline that identifies novel subtypes of acute ischemic stroke, enabling improved future genetic studies by reducing genetic heterogeneity of cohorts and improved understanding of the underlying causes of the disease. Project Narrative Stroke is a highly complex disease that is a leading cause of death and severe disability. Identifying the cause of stroke is essential for risk stratification and optimal treatment, but up to a third of cases are of undetermined cause, and very few genetic variants have been identified due to the heterogeneity of the disease. To address this, this research proposal develops a computational pipeline that applies data-driven deep learning to medical notes to identify novel combinations of environmental, genetic, and medical risk factors causing the disease; this tool may clarify the etiology of unknown stroke cases, provide cohorts of patients enriched with similar genetic variants, and be expanded to subtype any disease.",Data-driven subtyping to find patients with drug interactions leading to stroke,9999028,F30HL140946,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Blood flow', 'Brain', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Categories', 'Cause of Death', 'Cerebrovascular Disorders', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Cohort Studies', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Disease', 'Drug Interactions', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Etiology', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Heterogeneity', 'Genetic study', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Hemorrhage', 'Heritability', 'Internet', 'Ischemic Stroke', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Medical', 'Medical Records', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Nervous System Physiology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacogenetics', 'Physicians', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Proposals', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk stratification', 'Semantics', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Training', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'acute stroke', 'adverse drug reaction', 'automated analysis', 'base', 'case control', 'cohort', 'computational pipelines', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'disability', 'disease diagnosis', 'disease heterogeneity', 'experience', 'falls', 'genetic risk factor', 'genetic variant', 'improved', 'learning algorithm', 'learning classifier', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning method', 'mortality', 'novel', 'optimal treatments', 'patient health information', 'patient population', 'patient subsets', 'population based', 'random forest', 'stroke patient', 'stroke recovery', 'structured data', 'supervised learning', 'tool', 'unsupervised learning']",NHLBI,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,F30,2020,50016,0.14963983100186376
"A Machine Learning Approach to Classifying Time Since Stroke using Medical Imaging PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Stroke is a leading cause of mortality and morbidity in the United States, with approximately 795,000 Americans experiencing a new or recurrent stroke each year. Intravenous tissue plasminogen activator (IV tPA) is the dominant and most proven treatment option, but its use is only indicated within 4.5 hours following a stroke. Unfortunately, up to 30% of stroke patients present with an unknown time since stroke (TSS) symptom onset, which makes them ineligible to receive IV tPA. Many of these individuals could be spared severe morbidity or mortality if there existed an alternative method for establishing TSS, allowing them to be identified and treated. This proposal will develop machine learning methods to create a physiologically grounded method for predicting TSS based on multiparametric magnetic resonance (MR) and computed tomography (CT) imaging data. We believe our proposed techniques will outperform state-of-the-art methods that are based on subjective image interpretation, and have the potential to provide an objective data point that may be used in conjunction with the subjective assessments of experts, or in clinical environments that lack expertise in stroke imaging Research has established that MR and CT imaging captures information that correlates with TSS. However, existing methods for extracting this information are based on a physician subjectively interpreting the images and delineating regions of interest, processes that have been documented to have only weak to moderate agreement across trained expert reviewers. An automated approach that comprehensively analyzes the spectrum of imaging data could identify complex relationships across channels that more accurately classify TSS. For example, in MR, diffusion-weighted, perfusion-weighted, and fluid attenuated inversion recovery imaging all play important roles in characterizing a stroke, but a deep understanding of how each channel may be combined to describe TSS is unknown. We propose to establish new deep learning methods for fusing this information. Specifically, we will: 1) develop a machine learning framework for classifying TSS; 2) develop a deep convolutional autoencoder to generate novel multimodal image representations from MR and CT to improve classification; and 3) implement visualization techniques that elucidate the relationship between deep features and pathophysiological stroke processes. Under this project, we will use data from the UCLA and UCI Stroke Centers, allowing us to study different patient populations and imaging techniques. The successful completion of this research will provide a new method for estimating TSS from imaging, leading to new prospective trials for providing therapy to patients with unknown TSS. PROJECT NARRATIVE Stroke is a leading cause of death in the United States, with approximately 795,000 Americans experiencing a new or recurrent stroke each year; however patients who present with an unknown stroke onset time are ineli- gible for receiving the leading therapy.

"A Machine Learning Approach For CTA-based Plaque Characterization and Stroke Risk Prediction in Carotid Artery Atherosclerosis PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Carotid artery atherosclerosis is a major vascular risk factor and accounts for approximately 15% of all strokes. A major risk marker in patients with carotid atherosclerosis has been the degree of narrowing, or stenosis, of the carotid artery lumen. While stenosis is often quantified via angiography, imaging can also provide detailed assessments of plaque. Our project is motivated by converging data that correlate vulnerable plaque elements, which can be captured with imaging, with increased stroke risk. Identifying high-risk or vulnerable carotid plaques before a stroke occurs is important because stroke prevention treatments, like carotid endarterectomy or stenting, carry risks and ideally should only be performed only those patients at highest risk of stroke. CTA (computed tomographic angiography) is an attractive tool for plaque imaging since it is not operator dependent, can be quickly performed, and is more widely available than MRI. Although CTA offers significant potential to evaluate these plaque features, small studies have not reached a consensus regarding their reliability and clinical relevance. In this project, we plan to explore the utility of CTA for the detailed carotid vessel wall imaging by employing a unique, large-scale clinical dataset and advanced algorithms. Our overarching objective in this R21 project is to conduct developmental and interdisciplinary research that will lay the foundation for the implementation and validation of novel CTA-based technologies that can be adopted in the risk stratification of patients with carotid atherosclerosis. Our central hypothesis is that there are CTA-based carotid plaque features that can be reliably extracted and used for stroke risk stratification, which will be more sensitive and specific than standard stenosis grading. To pursue our objective, we will pursue two specific aims: In Specific Aim 1 we plan to optimize the use of human reader defined plaque features in predicting culprit carotid plaques. We will perform a blinded, multi-reader study of CTA-derived carotid plaque features in a large scale clinical dataset to test the association between CTA-derived human-defined features and stroke, and compute accuracy metrics. In Specific Aim 2, we plan to develop algorithms to automatically characterize and discriminate culprit carotid plaque in CTA. We will implement and test image processing algorithms that automatically compute from a CTA scan stroke-associated carotid artery plaque features (from Aim 1), and then train a machine learning algorithm to distinguish culprit from asymptomatic carotid artery plaques. We believe that this R21 study is significant because it will establish a novel, machine learning-aided imaging strategy which can aid in identifying high-risk carotid artery plaques before they cause stroke and when they can be properly treated to prevent stroke from occurring in the future. PROJECT NARRATIVE  The proposed research is relevant to public health because the discovery of novel and treatable vascular risk factors will ultimately improve risk factor screening and stroke prevention efforts, thereby reducing the incidence of a disabling and lethal disease. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to the part of the NHLBI's mission that involves reducing the burden of vascular disease by fostering research on prevention.",A Machine Learning Approach For CTA-based Plaque Characterization and Stroke Risk Prediction in Carotid Artery Atherosclerosis,9904175,R21HL145427,"['Adopted', 'Algorithms', 'Angiography', 'Arterial Fatty Streak', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Biological Markers', 'Blinded', 'Carotid Arteries', 'Carotid Artery Plaques', 'Carotid Atherosclerotic Disease', 'Carotid Endarterectomy', 'Carotid Stenosis', 'Carotid stent', 'Clinical', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Hand', 'Hemorrhage', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging Device', 'Incidence', 'Institution', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Ischemia', 'Ischemic Stroke', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Medicine', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Prevention', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Reader', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Registries', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk Marker', 'Risk stratification', 'Scanning', 'Statistical Models', 'Stenosis', 'Stroke', 'Stroke prevention', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Ulcer', 'Ultrasonography', 'Validation', 'Vascular Diseases', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'attenuation', 'automated algorithm', 'base', 'calcification', 'cerebrovascular', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'convolutional neural network', 'feature extraction', 'high risk', 'image processing', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning algorithm', 'novel', 'patient stratification', 'predictive modeling', 'radiologist', 'screening', 'stroke patient', 'stroke risk', 'systematic review', 'tool', 'vascular risk factor']",NHLBI,WEILL MEDICAL COLL OF CORNELL UNIV,R21,2020,121967,0.19986107061218716
"Non-invasive Evaluation of Intracranial Atherosclerotic Disease Using Hemodynamic Biomarkers The proposed study will be based on a multimodal approach using 4D flow MRI, perfusion-weighted MRI (PWI), diffusion-weighted MRI (DWI) and high-resolution vessel wall imaging (VWI) together with patient information (demographics and clinical factors) to predict the risk of recurrent stroke of patients with intracranial atherosclerotic disease (ICAD) stenosis. This will allow integrating the vulnerability of the stenosis as well as the patient by assessing the hemodynamic impact, plaque stability, and stroke lesion pattern together with patient information into a prediction model. PWI will provide tissue perfusion, VWI will provide plaque stability, DWI will provide stroke lesion pattern and 4D flow MRI will provide macroscopic hemodynamics of the circle of Willis (CoW). We will concentrate on the following innovative developments: 4D flow MRI: In order to allow 4D flow MRI scanning with a high dynamic velocity range (necessary to measure slow and fast velocities simultaneously), we recently developed dual-venc 4D flow MRI. However, this method suffers from extended scan tome of an already long acquisition. We, therefore, aim to minimize scan time for dual-venc 4D flow MRI scan while using the required spatial resolution and volume coverage, targeting 5-10 minutes so that this sequence can be added to clinical protocols. We aim to achieve this by integrating compressed sensing acceleration. Rigorous testing of the sequence will be done in phantom experiments as well as in a healthy test-retest control study. Data Analysis and Outcome Prediction: Currently, the multi-modal information that can be acquired with MRI has not been combined and used for comprehensive prediction of recurrent stroke risk in ICAD. Information that can be acquired from different MRI modalities may be critical in characterizing ICAD patient status. We will develop a new analysis tool that combines all data into a single network graph. All imaging data will be reported relative to supplying the intracranial artery of the CoW by using the vascular territory region of interest analysis. This will allow gathering all imaging parameters in a network graph. In a cross-sectional patient study, we will use combined data to see if it enables differentiation between healthy subjects, ICAD subgroups. Patient Study: In Aim 3, we will develop a machine-learning algorithm to predict which of the patients are at risk of experiencing a recurrent stroke. In order to achieve this, we will enroll a total of 150 ICAD patients from two institutions (Northwestern Memorial Hospital and San Francisco General Hospital). The combined data from the four different MR modalities and all other patient information will be used to identify only the discriminative features. This will be realized by using support vector machine recursive feature elimination to rank features associated with the risk of an ischemic event. The SVM will be trained and tested using information from the patient's clinical follow-up as outcome measure. The outcome (ischemic event or death yes/no)) will enable the development of the SVM classifier to predict outcome. Project Narrative (2 – 3 sentences) In the proposed study, we will develop an advanced intracranial MRI protocol together with a comprehensive image processing pipeline allowing full characterization of intracranial atherosclerotic disease (ICAD). Imaging biomarkers together with clinical and demographic factors will enable the identification of patients at risk to suffer recurring stroke. Machine learning methods will be used to predict risk. Successful completion will allow for better identification of patients who could benefit from endovascular stenting to reduce stroke recurrence.",Non-invasive Evaluation of Intracranial Atherosclerotic Disease Using Hemodynamic Biomarkers,10052508,R01HL149787,"['3-Dimensional', '4D MRI', 'Acceleration', 'Acute', 'Age', 'Angioplasty', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Vessels', 'Blood flow', 'Brain Infarction', 'Cerebrovascular Circulation', 'Cerebrovascular system', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Circle of Willis', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Protocols', 'Control Groups', 'Core-Binding Factor', 'Coupled', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Death Rate', 'Demographic Factors', 'Development', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Distal', 'Drops', 'Enrollment', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Failure', 'Flowmeters', 'Gender', 'General Hospitals', 'Graph', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'In Vitro', 'Institution', 'Intervention', 'Intracranial Arterial Stenosis', 'Investigation', 'Ischemic Stroke', 'Lesion', 'Location', 'MRI Scans', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perfusion', 'Perfusion Weighted MRI', 'Pilot Projects', 'Protocols documentation', 'Recurrence', 'Refractory', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk stratification', 'San Francisco', 'Scanning', 'Scheme', 'Severities', 'Staging', 'Stenosis', 'Stents', 'Stroke', 'Subgroup', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Work', 'base', 'cerebrovascular', 'comorbidity', 'demographics', 'disorder subtype', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'follow-up', 'hemodynamics', 'hypoperfusion', 'image processing', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'intracranial artery', 'learning classifier', 'machine learning algorithm', 'machine learning method', 'magnetic resonance imaging biomarker', 'multimodality', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'outcome prediction', 'predictive modeling', 'pressure', 'pressure sensor', 'prognostic significance', 'stroke patient', 'stroke risk', 'supervised learning', 'support vector machine', 'tool']",NHLBI,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R01,2020,486172,0.09061505192284977
"Motor cortex network dynamics driving stroke recovery PROJECT SUMMARY Ischemic stroke is the most common cause of disability in US, with motor impairment being the most common form of disability. Rehabilitation therapies remain a mainstay treatment during recovery, but are not very effective for those with moderate to severe upper extremity weakness. Physical and pharmacologic interventions could become more effective if recovery mechanisms were better understood. The studies proposed here will use cutting-edge techniques to dissect the mechanisms of post-stroke recovery at the level of cortical neuronal networks. The principal investigator (PI) is a board-certified neurologist, and has extensive training in neuroscience, stroke neurobiology, and clinical management of patients with neurological diseases. The long- term goal is to understand relationships between the cortical neural network and the motor behaviors with a focus on motor recovery. The proposed research and career development plans will provide the necessary training, mentorship and experience to launch the PI’s career as a successful, R01-funded clinician-scientist. The PI has recently developed deep learning (a branch of machine learning) tools for automated and unbiased analysis of animal behavioral imaging data. Preliminary data demonstrate that, by using these automated tools, 3D kinematics of paw movements can be obtained during a food pellet reaching task in a head-fixed mouse, distinct neural activity patterns emerge in the primary motor cortex (M1) during motor learning of the skilled reaching, and stroke induces changes in the kinematics of the reaching behavior. In the proposed studies, the following specific hypotheses will be tested: stable neuronal network activity patterns emerge in M1 during motor learning (Aim-1); these M1 activity patterns destabilize after a stroke and sensorimotor disconnection (Aim-2); and new M1 activity patterns emerge after post-stroke task-specific rehabilitation (Aim-3). The PI will use, and be further trained on state-of-the-art techniques to record neural population activity (two-photon calcium imaging), to label and silence projection neurons (retro-AAVs and designer-receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs), and to analyze the kinematics of the behavior (deep learning tools). For this purpose, he has assembled a strong mentorship team with experts in their respective fields: Primary mentor Dr. Peyman Golshani (two-photon calcium imaging and analysis in behaving animals), as well as co-mentors, Dr. S. Thomas Carmichael (stroke recovery research), Dr. Jonathan Kao (neural dynamics analysis in motor cortex), and clinically, Dr. Bruce Dobkin (translational neurorehabilitation). The mentored research will be complemented with course work on state-space methods, biostatistics, bioethics, deep learning, responsible conduct of research, and grant writing; as well as improvement of professional skills by publishing manuscripts, presenting at meetings, and participating in workshops on leadership and management. By the end of K08 award, it is expected that the PI will obtain R01 funding as a clinician-scientist and independent investigator, focused on understanding mechanisms of the neural networks that can be modulated to improve motor behavior after stroke. PROJECT NARRATIVE Understanding the mechanisms of motor recovery will ultimately lead to better therapies for stroke recovery. In the proposed research, we aim to elucidate the motor recovery process by investigating the precise activity patterns of brain cells during skilled reaching movements that will be kinematically analyzed by novel automated tools.

"Enabling Comparative Effectiveness Research in Silent Brain Infarction Through Natural Language Processing and Big Data It is a common clinical occurrence that neuroimaging scans obtained in the course of routine clinical care discover a prior brain infarction in patients with no history of stroke or transient ischemic attack. Indeed, epidemiologic studies indicate that silent brain infarctions (SBI) are far more common than strokes; MRI- defined SBI can be detected in ~20% of the healthy elderly. In these studies based on screened patients, the findings have been shown to be associated with subtle, typically unrecognized, deficits in physical and cognitive function. These imaging findings are also strong, independent risk factors for future stroke and dementia. Despite the very high prevalence of SBI in screened populations, and their serious consequences, little is known about the significance or the appropriate management of SBI when discovered incidentally in routine care. While there is strong evidence that antiplatelet therapy and statin therapy are effective in preventing recurrent stroke in patients with prior stroke, the degree to which these results apply to patients with SBI is unclear. Because patients with SBI define a population that falls in between primary and secondary stroke prevention, the approach to these patients is marked by uncertainty and practice variation, making it an ideal condition for observational comparative effectiveness research. Nonetheless, there are serious challenges for the study of SBI. As patients have no overt symptoms, recruitment into a trial can be problematic. Comparative effectiveness research on SBI, using routinely collected data and leveraging the variation in care of these patients, is impeded by the fact that there are no ICD codes for SBI, and it is generally not included in structured fields of electronic health records (EHR) as it is typically considered an incidental finding. In order to establish the comparative effectiveness of treatment strategies for SBI in a large, heterogeneous population, we propose to develop Natural Language Processing (NLP) algorithms to identify individuals with SBI through the automated review of neuroradiology reports. We have performed preliminary work to demonstrate that such an approach is feasible. We will then apply state-of-the-science observational comparative effectiveness methods in a massive database with linked EHR and claims data to examine the effectiveness of statins and antiplatelet agents in preventing future stroke and dementia. Thus, our aims are: Aim 1: We will develop NLP algorithms that can accurately identify cases of SBI and white matter disease (WMD) in two different health systems. Aim 2: We will port, refine, and validate the NLP algorithm in a large heterogeneous database including more than 600 hospitals and 6500 clinics and identify a large cohort of patients with routinely-discovered SBI and WMD. Aim 3: We will characterize the cohort with respect to age- specific prevalence of SBI, management patterns, and the risk of future stroke and dementia associated with SBI and WMD. Aim 4: We will estimate the comparative effectiveness of preventive therapies (statins and antiplatelet agents) on the risk of future stroke and dementia in patients with incidentally-discovered SBI. The goal of this project is to improve the evidence base for the prevention of stroke in patients with “silent brain infarct”—i.e., a stroke on neuroimaging (head CT or MRI) but no clinical evidence of a stroke. We will develop a computer-based algorithm using a technology known as natural language processing that can accurately identify cases of silent brain infarction among a large population of adults on whom neuroimages have been obtained, but who are without a history of clinically-evident cerebrovascular disease. We will estimate the comparative effectiveness of medications (statins and antiplatelet agents) on the risk of future stroke and dementia in patients with incidentally discovered and reported SBI.",Enabling Comparative Effectiveness Research in Silent Brain Infarction Through Natural Language Processing and Big Data,9931326,R01NS102233,"['Adult', 'Age', 'Age-Years', 'Algorithms', 'American Heart Association', 'American Stroke Association', 'Antiplatelet Drugs', 'Big Data', 'Blood Vessels', 'Brain', 'Brain Infarction', 'Caring', 'Cerebrovascular Disorders', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Comparative Effectiveness Research', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Effectiveness', 'Elderly', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Health Personnel', 'Health system', 'Healthcare Systems', 'High Prevalence', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Incidental Findings', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'International Classification of Disease Codes', 'Knowledge', 'Lesion', 'Link', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Medical center', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physical Function', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention approach', 'Prevention trial', 'Preventive therapy', 'Process', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recurrence', 'Reporting', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Scanning', 'Science', 'Stroke', 'Stroke prevention', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Technology', 'Transient Ischemic Attack', 'Translating', 'Uncertainty', 'Variant', 'White Matter Disease', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'case finding', 'clinical care', 'clinical practice', 'cognitive function', 'cohort', 'comparative effectiveness', 'comparative effectiveness study', 'epidemiology study', 'evidence base', 'falls', 'improved', 'learning progression', 'member', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'patient population', 'patient screening', 'prevent', 'recruit', 'repository', 'routine care', 'screening', 'treatment strategy']",NINDS,TUFTS MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2020,520509,0.18765106373277018
"Patient-centered rehabilitation and dexterous assistive devices for stroke patients using bionic exoskeletons controlled by non-invasive electromyography PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Stroke is one of the leading causes of disability worldwide and the most common stroke-related impairment is upper-limb hemiparesis, affecting 80% of stroke patients acutely and 40% chronically. Full recovery is unlikely with current rehabilitation approaches, and as a result, stroke reduces quality of life, increases healthcare costs, and burdens caregivers. The long-term goal of this project is to leverage assistive bionic devices to restore motor function and promote long-term neuro-regeneration, ultimately replacing more expensive and less effective rehabilitation approaches with a patient-centered rehabilitation strategy. The objective of this proposal is to control assistive bionic exoskeletons and quantify stroke recovery with electromyographic (EMG) recordings of residual muscle activity from the paretic arm. Our central hypothesis is that an EMG-controlled powered orthosis – that assists individuals in activities of daily living – can be used as a patient-specific rehabilitative tool that improves stroke recovery. Aim 1 will adapt dexterous EMG-control algorithms for upper-limb orthoses, and then demonstrate improved hand dexterity and functional mobility for stroke patients. Aim 2 will utilize large EMG datasets over time to precisely quantify changes in muscle strength and spasticity throughout recovery and to provide robust long-term control of assistive devices via deep learning. Aim 3 consists of a pilot study to determine the feasibility of patient-specific assistive-device-driven rehabilitation. The proposed research is innovative because it will address gaps in knowledge critical to merging assistive and rehabilitative devices. These findings are significant because they will enable devices that can immediately and simultaneously promote usage, strengthen muscles, and provide closed-loop visual feedback – thereby merging multiple effective rehabilitation strategies into a single holistic approach. This proposal will have a positive impact on society by increasing rehabilitation compliance, promoting independence and improving recovery outcomes for stroke patients, ultimately reducing healthcare costs and improving patients’ quality of life. PROJECT NARRATIVE / PUBLIC HEALTH STATEMENT This project aims to bridge the gap between assistive devices and rehabilitative tools so that stroke patients with a paretic arm can immediately return to their daily routine and use their activities of daily living as a patient-specific rehabilitation strategy. Assistive bionic exoskeletons will be intuitively controlled with residual muscle activity from the paretic arm, and artificial intelligence will elucidate underlying muscle impairment, improve the dexterity of bionic devices, and temporarily assist and rehabilitate stroke patients. This proposal is relevant to NIH’s mission because it has strong potential to improve quality of life for stroke patients and their caregivers, as well as reduce overall healthcare costs.",Patient-centered rehabilitation and dexterous assistive devices for stroke patients using bionic exoskeletons controlled by non-invasive electromyography,10017601,DP5OD029571,"['Activities of Daily Living', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Award', 'Bionics', 'Caregiver Burden', 'Caregivers', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Devices', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Educational workshop', 'Electromyography', 'Event', 'Faculty', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Growth', 'HRK gene', 'Hand', 'Health Care Costs', 'High Performance Computing', 'Hospitals', 'Human Subject Research', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intuition', 'Knowledge', 'Leadership', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuscripts', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Mission', 'Motor', 'Muscle', 'Muscle Spasticity', 'Nerve Regeneration', 'Neuromuscular Diseases', 'Orthotic Devices', 'Paresis', 'Patients', 'Physical Medicine', 'Pilot Projects', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Quality of life', 'Recovery', 'Rehabilitation Centers', 'Rehabilitation device', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Technics', 'Residual state', 'Running', 'Secure', 'Self-Help Devices', 'Services', 'Societies', 'Spinal cord injury', 'Stroke', 'Students', 'System', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Upper Extremity', 'Utah', 'Vision', 'arm paresis', 'career', 'career development', 'data visualization', 'deep learning', 'dexterity', 'disability', 'exoskeleton', 'faculty mentor', 'functional restoration', 'graduate student', 'handbook', 'hemiparetic stroke', 'holistic approach', 'improved', 'innovation', 'lecturer', 'muscle strength', 'neurological rehabilitation', 'patient oriented', 'post stroke', 'professor', 'rehabilitation strategy', 'social', 'strength training', 'stroke outcome', 'stroke patient', 'stroke recovery', 'symposium', 'tenure track', 'tool', 'undergraduate student', 'upper limb hemiparesis', 'visual feedback']",OD,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,DP5,2020,327384,0.2033880633025729
"Neural Correlates of Recovery from Aphasia After Stroke Project Summary/Abstract Aphasia is one of the most common and debilitating consequences of stroke. Aphasia is caused by damage to language regions of the brain, which are usually localized to the left hemisphere. Fortunately, most individuals with aphasia after a stroke experience some degree of recovery of language function over time. The pace of recovery is greatest in the first weeks and months, but clinically meaningful gains in language function are possible even years after stroke. Recovery from aphasia is thought to depend on neural plasticity, that is, functional reorganization of surviving brain regions such that they take on new or expanded roles in language processing. However, despite much research, the mechanisms that underlie this process of functional reorganization remain poorly understood. The overall goals of this project are to better characterize the neural correlates of recovery from aphasia after stroke, and to determine which patterns of functional reorganization are associated with more or less favorable language outcomes. To address major limitations of prior studies, we will use a range of innovative approaches. Adaptive language mapping paradigms will be used to identify language regions in a reliable and valid manner, while minimizing performance confounds. We will recruit large numbers of patients at two established sites, enabling rigorous statistical approaches such as linear mixed models and permutation testing. Advanced machine learning algorithms will allow us to disentangle complex relationships between structural damage, neurofunctional changes, and language outcomes. We will study two complementary cohorts of patients—acute and chronic—longitudinally using the same multimodal functional and structural MRI protocol, and the same language evaluations. In the acute cohort, we will investigate the dynamics of early recovery and functional reorganization, while in the chronic cohort, we will identify relationships between patterns of reorganization and language outcomes in a larger sample, and track the neural correlates of recovery in the chronic phase. Our first specific aim is to build predictive models of the trajectory of evolving aphasia profiles based on structural neuroimaging, including lesion location and extent, as well as multiple measures of the integrity of surviving tissue, and other clinical variables. Our second specific aim is to characterize the brain regions recruited for language processing in people with aphasia, and to identify patterns that are associated with more or less favorable outcomes. Critically, the key analyses will use the predictive models from Aim 1 to determine which patterns of functional reorganization result in better or worse outcomes relative to what would be expected on the basis of structural and clinical factors alone. Our third aim is to identify changes in functional activity associated with gains in language function over time, again in the context of the predictive models developed in Aim 1. A better understanding of the biological mechanisms that underlie recovery from aphasia will contribute to the development of neuromodulatory and therapeutic interventions, and will improve the clinical management of individuals with aphasia. Project Narrative Aphasia (acquired language impairment) is one of the most common consequences of stroke and often leads to significant long-term disability. This project seeks to better characterize the neural correlates of recovery from aphasia after stroke, and to determine which patterns of functional reorganization are associated with more or less favorable language outcomes.

"Data Harmonization PROJECT SUMMARY Stroke is the fifth most prevalent cause of death in the U.S. afflicting nearly 800,000 per year. About three quarters of strokes are first events, underscoring the importance of primary prevention. Designing optimal preventive strategies requires identification of risk factors and estimation of the risk of stroke. The most recent American Heart Association (AHA)/American Stroke Association Guidelines for the Primary Prevention of Stroke conclude that “an ideal stroke risk assessment tool that is simple, is widely applicable and accepted, and takes into account the effects of multiple risk factors does not exist.” One of the most commonly recommended predictive models is the Framingham Stroke Profile, developed and updated more than 25 years ago. Newer models have been proposed (including the Self-Reported Stroke Risk Stratification tool from the REGARDS study) but have not been thoroughly validated. Consequently, the Primary Prevention of Stroke guidelines call for more research “to validate risk assessment tools across age, sex, and race/ethnic groups” and “to evaluate whether any of the more recently identified risk factors add to the predictive accuracy of existing scales”. We propose to address these gaps by aggregating and harmonizing existing patient-level data collected as part of longitudinal cohort studies supported by the NINDS and NHLBI. The data will be obtained through a partnership with the coordinating center for the REGARDS Study at the University of Alabama at Birmingham and by a request submitted to the NIH dbGap repository to obtain data from the Framingham Offspring, ARIC and MESA cohorts. At the same time, we will expand the advanced machine learning techniques developed as part of our currently funded NIH BD2K award to Duke. We will apply these models to the harmonized data to facilitate development and validation of prediction tool for primary strokes. These complex analyses will require advanced computational resources that will utilize the AHA's Precision Medicine Platform (PMP), built based on Amazon Web Services.

"Noninvasive Real-time Estimation of Cerebral Blood Flow for Personalized Stroke Assessment PROJECT SUMMARY Stroke is the second leading cause of death and the third leading cause of disability worldwide. Similar trends exist in the U.S., where it is estimated that every 40 seconds a stroke occurs, leading to a stroke-related death every 4 minutes. Afflicting approximately 800,000 Americans each year, time sensitive and widely practicable diagnostic algorithms are paramount. Despite increasing emphasis on the significance of blood flow characteristics in pursuing strokes, estimating regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) inside the skull is no trivial task. Imaging techniques that provide rCBF distribution may be unavailable due to time constraint or access to facilities, or simply the expenses attached to it. In our preliminary studies, we have developed a model that can give blood flow estimates in real-time for the entire brain vasculature. Here, we propose a novel hybrid computational model that utilizes high-performance computing and machine learning to simulate the entire brain vasculature, as well as provide real time measures of regional CBF. We will use novel mathematical methods to determine the vascular geometry of each subject using our existing imaging database that includes CTA and CBF images from stroke patients, and will subsequently validate our simulations against the same dataset. Finally, we will use machine learning algorithms to extract patterns in stroke patients' blood flow and give estimates for stroke severity predictors on patient- specific measurements. PROJECT NARRATIVE The objective of this project is to estimate blood flow properties in the brain and its correlation with stroke. We will simulate and validate a model to give similar information as the expensive perfusion scanning measurements.

"Quantitative Rehabilitation after Stroke PROJECT SUMMARY Stroke causes significant disability, and recovery is often incomplete. In animal models of stroke, robust upper extremity (UE) motor recovery can be elicited if high doses of functional training are given early. In humans, however, the optimal training dose is unknown, because no quantitative dose-response trials have been undertaken in the first months after stroke. This deficiency stems from a lack of measurement instruments that can accurately and easily quantify UE functional training dose and recovery. To address this gap, this proposal will generate two new measurement tools to enable quantitative stroke recovery research. The first tool (Aim 1) will quantify the number of functional movements made during stroke rehabilitation, measuring UE training dose. The second tool (Aim 2) will quantify the abnormality of movements, measuring UE recovery and response to interventions. We will combine wireless motion capture and computational methodologies to create objective, precise, and user-friendly tools. Inertial measurement units, worn by individuals with stroke and healthy controls performing various activities, will capture upper body motion. In Aim 1, machine learning algorithms will be trained to identify and count functional movements in activities normally practiced during rehabilitation. In Aim 2, functional principal components analysis will quantify movement impairment and compensation in standardized motions. Validity will be determined by correlating tool outcomes with current gold standards. The proposed study will be conducted at New York University, in collaboration with investigators from the NYU Center for Data Science, Columbia University, and Washington University-St. Louis. Each have complementary expertise in machine learning, functional data analysis, and functional movement identification. This K02 Independent Scientist Award will provide the candidate with skill in advanced motion capture and analytical methodologies needed to study stroke rehabilitation and recovery. The career development plan includes personalized tutorials and coursework combined with longitudinal oversight of data analysis, providing an excellent foundation for launching an independent research career. Ultimately, the developed tools have the potential to immediately impact neurorehabilitation research, facilitating the rigorous dose-response trials so critically needed to change clinical practice and improve stroke outcomes.

"Big Data Neuroimaging to Predict Motor Behavior After Stroke PROJECT SUMMARY  Stroke is a leading cause of serious long-term adult disability around the world. Despite intensive therapy, an estimated 2/3 of stroke survivors do not fully recover and are left unable to care for themselves independently. Growing research suggests that rehabilitation is not “one-size-fits-all”; variability among stroke survivors in terms of lesion location, age, gender, time since stroke and more may all affect a person's likelihood of recovery and response to different types of treatments. Personalized rehabilitation medicine to maximize each individual's recovery potential is thus desperately needed. However, in order to develop accurate, robust, and specific predictive models that can determine an individual's recovery potential and response to different treatments, large, heterogeneous datasets are needed. The current best predictors of stroke outcomes are neuroimaging (MRI) and behavioral biomarkers that look at brain structure/function and motor performance at baseline. Generating a large enough dataset of MRI and behavioral data is extremely difficult and expensive for any one site to do on its own. This proposal addresses this problem by generating a large, diverse dataset using a novel meta-analytic approach that harmonizes post-stroke data collected worldwide. In partnership with an international consortium comprised of over 500 researchers who produce the largest-known neuroimaging and genetic studies of over 18 different diseases (ENIGMA Center for Worldwide Medicine, Imaging, and Genomics), I propose to apply ENIGMA's powerful approach to answer critical questions in stroke recovery. Under this K01 career development award, I will develop skills in big data neuroimaging analytics, clinical research, and consortium building through my ENIGMA Stroke Recovery working group in order to ask questions about stroke recovery using a large dataset approach (goal n>3,000). This project has four specific aims: Aim 1 will leverage ENIGMA's existing methodology to develop the infrastructure, optimal methods, and analysis techniques for harmonizing a large dataset of post-stroke MRI and behavioral data. Aim 2 will use this large dataset to identify neural and behavioral biomarkers predicting recovery of motor impairment (e.g., actual arm movement ability) and recovery of function (e.g., ability to perform tasks, such as picking up objects with the affected arm). Aim 3 will use supervised machine learning to generate and fine-tune highly accurate predictive models of the relationship between these biomarkers and recovery of impairment versus function. Lastly, Aim 4 will use unsupervised machine learning techniques to examine shared properties of outliers from the predictive model and determine additional neurobiological mechanisms that may prevent individuals from recovering. This approach has the potential to revolutionize the way that rehabilitation research is validated, to ensure robust, reliable, and reproducible results. The methods developed here could be extended to other domains of recovery (language, gait), to study other predictors of recovery (functional brain activity, genomics), and to other clinical populations to improve rehabilitation overall. PROJECT NARRATIVE The overall goal of this project is to provide personalized, precise rehabilitation medicine to individuals after stroke by developing accurate predictive models that help us detect who will recover and best respond to different types of post-stroke treatments. Using a novel meta-analytic approach, this project will harmonize datasets of brain imaging and behavioral information across sites worldwide in order to develop a large dataset with thousands of participants.

"Learning invariant representation from high- dimensional data for quantitative stroke reha    Advances in wearable electronics, personal mobile devices, and sensor technology are opening the door to many promising applications in medical care and biomedical research. However, the resulting datasets are often challenging to process due to variability caused by extraneous effects unrelated to the tasks of interest, such as changes in environmental conditions, heteroscedasticity in measurement noise, or patient idiosyncrasies. These effects produce systematic differences between the data used to train machine- learning algorithms and the data on which they are applied in practice, impairing real-world performance. The proposed research will address the fundamental problem of factoring out extraneous effects associated with known nuisance variables. We will develop a novel methodology for extracting features that ar.e invariant to nuisance variables-and hence also to the associated extraneous effects-but that are still useful for classification or regression. The methodology is based on nonparametric deep-network models that perform automatic normalization of the data, and further enforce invariance via adversarial learning. We will apply the approach to an important problem in stroke rehabilitation, the quantitated dosing of motor training. Using a dataset of sensor-based motion data, we will train the model to identify and count functional movements in stroke patients performing rehabilitation activities. We expect to show that our approach can surmount patient variability to enable rigorous movement classification and quantitation. The proposed work is significant, because it will empower investigators to undertake the dosing trials critically needed in stroke rehabilitation. The proposed work is innovative, because it departs from traditional data preprocessing techniques by combining advanced data normalization and model calibration procedures. Our work is likely to have a positive impact on stroke rehabilitation by facilitating the research required to change clinical practice and improve stroke outcomes. Our quantitative approach is broadly generalizable to applications hindered by nuisance variables, such as medical diagnostics and genomics. The proposed research is relevant to public health, because it will enable the precise measurement of rehabilitation after stroke. This will facilitate important recovery research that is expected to inform stroke rehabilitation practices and reduce the burden of stroke disability. The quantitative methodology will advance data-driven discovery in the presence of nuisance variables, which is relevant to biomedical research applications such as diagnostics, genetics, and imaging.",Learning invariant representation from high- dimensional data for quantitative stroke reha   ,9978948,R01LM013316,"['Address', 'Biomedical Research', 'Calibration', 'Caring', 'Classification', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diagnostic', 'Dose', 'Due Process', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Learning', 'Measurement', 'Medical', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Noise', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Procedures', 'Public Health', 'Recovery', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Stroke', 'Techniques', 'Training', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'disability', 'handheld mobile device', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'machine learning algorithm', 'multidimensional data', 'network models', 'novel', 'patient variability', 'sensor', 'sensor technology', 'stroke outcome', 'stroke patient', 'stroke rehabilitation', 'wearable device']",NLM,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,300000,0.21714276576583877
"Whole Genome RNA Sequencing (RNAseq) of Blood from Patients with Lacunar Stroke Abstract  Lacunar strokes are small infarctions of deep penetrator end arteries that supply deep areas of brain including the basal ganglia, internal capsule, thalamus and pons. The “cause” of lacunar strokes has been controversial. C Miller Fisher was the first to suggest that hypertension was one cause, noting lipohyalinosis (inflammation, fibrinoid necrosis of vessel wall) in smaller penetrating arteries (<200um) occurred only in hypertensives. He also showed, however, that larger lacunar strokes were often associated with microatheroma associated narrowing of larger penetrating arteries. This pathology is now thought to be the most common and associated with lipid abnormalities and diabetes. Moreover, some lacunar strokes are now thought to be associated with intracranial atherosclerosis of the parent artery at the origin of the penetrators. Though lacunar strokes were not traditionally associated with large vessel extracranial atherosclerosis or cardioembolism, there are now a number of cases where lacunar strokes have been associated with large vessel atherosclerosis or cardiac causes. Indeed, in our own recent study we showed that as many as ~50% of small deep infarcts (>15mm in size) were predicted to be due to large vessel atherosclerosis or to cardioembolic disease. It is crucial to identify the correct causes of lacunar strokes because treatments differ: drugs for hypertension vs drugs for lipid abnormalities, surgery for large vessel carotid disease, anticoagulants for cardioembolic disease, and anti-platelet agents for lacunar strokes associated with hypertension or abnormal lipids or diabetes. The biology of lacunar strokes has been studied very little, and there are no accepted biomarkers for lacunar stroke or its causes. Our group, however, has begun to provide novel insights into how the immune and clotting profiles in peripheral blood differ in lacunar strokes compared to large vessel and cardioembolic strokes. We have shown that the immune response in large vessel and cardioembolic cortical strokes is mainly associated with neutrophil genes, whereas the immune response in lacunar stroke associated with hypertension /lipids/ diabetes is associated with inflammatory monocyte-related genes. However, since the preliminary studies were performed on whole blood, there is a great need to study individual immune cell types in these different causes of ischemic stroke. Therefore, in this study we will isolate neutrophils and monocytes in patients with lacunar stroke compared to large vessel and cardioembolic stroke. We will perform RNA sequencing on those cells in the following aims which allows us to measure expression levels of >250,000 alternatively spliced transcripts which are derived from the ~20,000 coding genes.  Specific Aim #1. Use RNAseq to demonstrate that alternatively spliced transcript level expression profiles in monocytes, neutrophils and whole blood differ for subcortical lacunar strokes associated with hypertension, abnormal lipids, diabetes, large vessel atherosclerosis, or cardioembolism compared to each other and compared to matched controls.  Specific Aim #2. Use RNAseq to demonstrate that alternatively spliced transcript level expression profiles for subcortical lacunar strokes with hypertension, lipids or diabetes are associated with monocytes, and differ from cortical large vessel and cardioembolic strokes which are associated mainly with neutrophils.  Specific Aim #3a. Use Support Vector Machine (SVM) to derive the minimum number of transcripts from Aim #1 that differentiate the different causes of lacunar strokes including hypertension, abnormal lipids, diabetes, large vessel atherosclerosis, or cardiac disease. Specific Aim #3b. Use the profiles derived in Aim #3a to predict the cause of lacunar stroke in a second cohort using qRT-PCR to measure expression and SVM to perform predictions with >85% sensitivity and specificity.  Significance: Identifying the causes of lacunar strokes based upon splice variant expression in individual blood cell types is important since it would affect therapy used for secondary stroke prevention. Narrative  This study will perform whole genome RNAsequencing of whole blood, neutrophils and monocytes from patients with lacunar strokes and correlate gene profiles with each cause of lacunar stroke. It will then show the lacunar stroke profiles differ from cortical strokes due to cardioembolism and large vessel atherosclerosis, and the profiles can be used to predict the cause of lacunar stroke in an independent validation cohort of patients which is important because different causes of lacunar strokes require different treatments.",Whole Genome RNA Sequencing (RNAseq) of Blood from Patients with Lacunar Stroke,9932520,R01NS101718,"['Affect', 'Alternative Splicing', 'Anticoagulants', 'Antiplatelet Drugs', 'Area', 'Arterial Fatty Streak', 'Arteries', 'Atherosclerosis', 'BCL6 gene', 'Basal Ganglia', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Blood', 'Blood Cells', 'Blood Platelets', 'Brain', 'CADASIL', 'CCL2 gene', 'CCL3 gene', 'CCL4 gene', 'Caliber', 'Cardiac', 'Carotid Atherosclerotic Disease', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Coagulation Process', 'Code', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Endothelial Cells', 'Expression Profiling', 'FPR1 gene', 'Fibrinoid necrosis', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Heart Diseases', 'Hyperlipidemia', 'Hypertension', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Individual', 'Infarction', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Internal Capsule', 'Intracranial Atheroscleroses', 'Ischemic Stroke', 'Lacunar Infarctions', 'Lipids', 'MMP9 gene', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Messenger RNA', 'Molecular', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Parents', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pontine structure', 'Quantitative Reverse Transcriptase PCR', 'RNA Splicing', 'Recurrence', 'S100P gene', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Stroke', 'Stroke prevention', 'Thalamic structure', 'Thrombosis', 'Transcript', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Whole Blood', 'base', 'cell type', 'cohort', 'insight', 'middle cerebral artery', 'monocyte', 'neutrophil', 'notch protein', 'novel', 'peripheral blood', 'rare genetic disorder', 'support vector machine', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'vascular risk factor', 'white matter', 'whole genome']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,R01,2020,122618,0.2918362372916003
"Ultrafast Quantitative pH MRI for Acute Ischemic Stroke Patients ABSTRACT Ischemic stroke is one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in the U.S. The goal of acute ischemic stroke therapy is to salvage tissue that is at risk of infarction, but still viable, through the use of reperfusion strategies. Current reperfusion therapies are limited by a tight time window for treatment and by the potential risk of brain hemorrhage. Using this time-based approach, only a limited number of stroke patients are eligible for treatment. Patients who present beyond the standard treatment time windows can benefit from therapy when identified based on multimodal MRI; however, precise and accurate identification of the salvageable tissue is essential, as the potential beneficial effect of treatment must be weighed against the risk of hemorrhage. Although a diffusion/perfusion MRI mismatch has been suggested as a guide with which to identify the presence of salvageable tissues and to serve as a selection marker for thrombolysis, the results of clinical trials using this criterion have been inconclusive, in part because of the inclusion of regions of oligemia in the penumbra, which overestimates the size of the tissue at risk. Amide proton transfer (APT) MRI has shown promise in detecting such an acidosis-based ischemic penumbra in animal models and in human stroke patients. However, most currently used APT imaging protocols are not very practical and not optimized with respect to the magnitude of signal changes caused by the pH effect. More quantitative APT-MRI typically would require an even longer scan time due to the use of multiple RF saturation frequencies, multiple acquisitions, and a long RF saturation pulse (or pulse train), all of which hamper clinical translation due to the very small time-window between stroke onset and possible thrombolysis treatment. Our long-term goal is to develop an ultrafast pH imaging technique for routine clinical use to guide reperfusion therapies for hyperacute stroke patients at various therapeutic time windows, as well as predict the risk of hemorrhagic transformation (HT) following acute ischemic stroke. The first clinical hypothesis is that, similar to animal studies, the pH imaging penumbra due to ischemic tissue acidosis predicts the maximum final infarction size if no reperfusion is initiated. Our second clinical hypothesis is that the presence of severe tissue acidosis in the ischemic core is associated with an increased probability of secondary HT. Our hypotheses will be tested through three specific aims: 1) to develop and optimize an ultrafast quantitative pH imaging method; 2) to validate this technique and assess the diagnostic accuracy of the acidosis-based ischemic penumbra in a clinical setting; and 3) to develop a novel deep-learning model with which to predict HT following acute ischemic stroke, and quantify the sensitivity and specificity of pH imaging. This work is expected to accelerate the translation of APT-MRI into a clinically viable and robust method. The addition of pH imaging to the standard MRI protocol is expected to enable better visualization of the true ischemic penumbra, thus improving predictions of clinical outcome and reducing the incidence of HT. NARRATIVE This research proposal is designed to optimize the speed and evaluate the accuracy of a novel pH MRI technique for identifying stroke patients with salvageable brain regions, as well as patients at increased risk for developing hemorrhage after an acute ischemic stroke. The results would enhance patient selection for treatment, extend the therapeutic time window, and improve the risk-benefit ratio of recanalization therapies.",Ultrafast Quantitative pH MRI for Acute Ischemic Stroke Patients,9968624,R01NS112242,"['3-Dimensional', 'Acidosis', 'Acute', 'Alteplase', 'Amides', 'Anaerobic Bacteria', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Benign', 'Brain', 'Brain hemorrhage', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain region', 'Cause of Death', 'Chemicals', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Excision', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Hemorrhage', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Incidence', 'Infarction', 'Intervention', 'Intravenous', 'Ischemic Penumbra', 'Ischemic Stroke', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Outcome', 'Patient Selection', 'Patients', 'Perfusion', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Probability', 'Protocols documentation', 'Protons', 'Reperfusion Therapy', 'Research Proposals', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk', 'Scanning', 'Selection for Treatments', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Signal Transduction', 'Speed', 'Stroke', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Thrombectomy', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Variant', 'Visualization', 'Work', 'acute stroke', 'base', 'blood-brain barrier permeabilization', 'clinical translation', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'design', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'disability', 'human imaging', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'mortality', 'multimodality', 'novel', 'perfusion imaging', 'predict clinical outcome', 'radio frequency', 'risk benefit ratio', 'standard care', 'stroke patient', 'stroke therapy', 'targeted treatment', 'thrombolysis', 'time use', 'treatment effect']",NINDS,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,384813,0.18792549523874869
"Closed loop synchrony stimulation for motor recovery after chronic stroke PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Stroke is a common cause of disability, with the majority of stroke patients exhibiting chronic motor impairments. A commonly observed pattern of impairment is fragmented movement control (i.e. loss of smooth transitions during movements) and difficulty with sequences, even with physical rehabilitation therapy. We have poor understanding as to the neural circuit basis of these impairments. Current efforts in neuromodulation for motor recovery have resulted in variable effects, potentially due to nonspecific targeting of modulation. Work by Dr. Karunesh Ganguly's group, conducted in rats, has demonstrated that there is a characteristic low frequency [1.5-5Hz] quasi-oscillatory activity in low frequency local field potential (LFP) that occurs during a skilled reaching task in both the primary motor cortex (M1) and dorsolateral striatum (DLS). This phenomenon occurs when a group of neurons (ensemble) in each region fires in a synchronous manner, time-locked to the reach-to-grasp motion. In animals that have motor deficits due to stroke in M1, premotor cortex (M2) rearranges to recapitulate forelimb behavior representations that were lost; M2 is also connected to DLS. Additionally, electrical stimulation delivered therapeutically to M2 at the expected time onset of low frequency LFP power quasi-oscillations can improve accuracy in a skilled reaching task, but animals still display fragmented movement control – characterized by a loss of smoothness that is present in both human stroke subjects and animal models. The central hypothesis is that similar to how coordinated LFP and ensemble spiking activity is a marker of M1-DLS coordination, increasing neural synchrony between M2 and DLS will result in increased recovery of skilled motor function after M1 stroke. In both aims, motor function will be assessed in rats with a reaching task to retrieve pellets. Behavioral outcomes such as reach time, kinematic trajectory, amplitude (distance paw traveled in a single reach), and successful retrieval will be assessed. In this proposal, my first aim is to characterize how coordinated neural activity in M2 and DLS evolves with recovery. In the second aim, I will assess how M2 ensemble spiking-dependent stimulation of DLS affects performance of the reach to grasp task in stroke animals with chronic motor deficits. In addition to my mentor's expertise on stroke rehabilitation, treatments, and neural interfaces, guidance from my thesis committee members Dr. Philip Starr (neurosurgery, deep brain stimulation, closed-loop stimulation) and Professor Michel Maharbiz (recording and stimulation electrode paradigms) support the feasibility of this study. We predict that increasing synchronizing M2-DLS activity post-stroke using population spike timing-dependent plasticity principles will improve behavioral outcomes after a chronic stroke plateau: reach time will decreased to baseline; reach trajectory will be smoother and more stereotyped, as assessed by a deep learning method that automatically captures movement parameters; and accuracy of obtaining pellets will increase. By accomplishing these aims, I will contribute to knowledge of how cortico-striatal connections play a role in motor recovery after stroke. PROJECT NARRATIVE Stroke is a common cause of disability, resulting in many motor deficits such as poor coordination and smooth velocity regulation despite extensive physical rehabilitation, with little understanding of the neural circuit basis for these impairments. After primary motor cortex (M1) stroke, the perilesional premotor cortex (M2) rearranges to recapture movement representations that were lost, and both regions have monosynaptic projections to a deep brain structure in the striatum, the dorsolateral striatum (DLS) in rodents. This work will characterize the how M2 and DLS neural activity simultaneously evolve with stroke recovery, as well as assess whether closed- loop M2 ensemble spiking-dependent electrical stimulation of DLS will improve motor function after chronic stroke.",Closed loop synchrony stimulation for motor recovery after chronic stroke,10140813,F31NS117010,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Clinical Research', 'Committee Members', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Data', 'Deep Brain Stimulation', 'Dependence', 'Electric Stimulation', 'Electrodes', 'Evoked Potentials', 'Exhibits', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Fire - disasters', 'Forelimb', 'Frequencies', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Link', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Motion', 'Motor', 'Motor Cortex', 'Movement', 'Neurons', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Physical Rehabilitation', 'Play', 'Population', 'Process', 'Publications', 'Rattus', 'Recovery', 'Regulation', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Retrieval', 'Rodent', 'Role', 'Stereotyping', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Travel', 'Virus', 'Work', 'activity marker', 'base', 'behavioral outcome', 'chronic stroke', 'deep learning', 'design', 'disability', 'experience', 'grasp', 'improved', 'kinematics', 'learning strategy', 'motor deficit', 'motor function improvement', 'motor impairment', 'motor learning', 'motor recovery', 'neural circuit', 'neuroregulation', 'neurosurgery', 'post intervention', 'post stroke', 'professor', 'relating to nervous system', 'stereotypy', 'stroke patient', 'stroke recovery', 'stroke rehabilitation']",NINDS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",F31,2020,37672,0.15706109304947954
"Plasma MicroRNA Biomarkers to Guide Rehabilitation Therapy After Stroke Abstract Following a stroke, each patient has a specific capacity to recover function that likely hinges on their ability to mount a neural repair response. Knowing this capacity early on would provide opportunities for personalized medicine in stroke rehabilitation. Physicians and therapists currently have few methods to predict recovery, and therefore have little data to guide decisions on treatment approach and length of stay. This has led to suboptimal therapy delivery. There is, however, emerging evidence to suggest that biomarkers can accurately predict recovery potential in order to guide therapy. Early attempts to improve motor recovery prediction used clinical, neurophysiologic (TMS), and MRI biomarkers to develop algorithms with up to 80% accuracy. While these are helpful, they tell us little about the biology of stroke recovery and are difficult to implement in most rehabilitation facilities. We recently identified a panel of 5 microRNAs (miRNAs) collected from plasma on rehab admission that can predict motor recovery with 95% accuracy. These 5 miRNAs converge on axonal guidance and developmental biology pathways. We therefore suspect that they capture the potential to mount a neural repair response after stroke. The overall goal of the proposal is to refine this miRNA predictive panel using a larger number of samples from 3 studies, test it’s predictive / analytic qualities, and validate the predictive panel in a large prospective study. R61 Phase Specific Aims: Aim #1a. Analyze stroke samples from 3 independent studies and matched controls using discovery-based qRT-PCR. Aim #1b. Use machine learning to develop a miRNA panel with ≥ 80% predictive ability across the 3 studies to identify patients who achieve excellent, moderate, and poor motor recovery by 3-12 months, controlling for covariates. Aim #1c. Develop custom qRT-PCR cards that include ~10 miRNAs in the refined panel in triplicate along with endogenous controls. Perform analytic validation to gauge precision, accuracy, and ideal handling / storage. R33 Phase Specific Aims: Aim #2a. Prospectively validate the miRNA panel by collecting samples from patients with upper limb impairment admitted to 2 inpatient rehab facilities, testing sensitivity, specificity, and positive/negative predictive value for classifying excellent, moderate, and poor motor recovery at 6 months. Aim #2b Give the predicted recovery potential score to the treatment team upon patient discharge from the inpatient rehabilitation facility. Use regression and chi-squared tests to assess how having this information on the day of admission would have changed percent of time delivering specific therapies and recommended length of stay. Tailoring rehabilitation treatment to the individual’s biological capacity to recover may lead to greater independence and lower costs. Specifically, evidence suggests that delivering more restorative-type therapy to the subset of patients most likely to respond improves motor outcomes. Just as important, the miRNAs identified in the panel will become treatment targets for recovery-based therapeutics. Project Narrative This project will use qRT-PCR to analyze plasma samples collected from stroke patients to develop a microRNA-based motor recovery potential score. This score will undergo clinical validation as a tool to tailor rehabilitation therapy delivery for individual stroke patients at inpatient rehabilitation facilities based on their predicted level of motor recovery. Once validated, the score will be used in future studies to streamline therapy delivery and improve outcomes.",Plasma MicroRNA Biomarkers to Guide Rehabilitation Therapy After Stroke,10008023,R61NS117196,"['Admission activity', 'African American', 'Algorithms', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Blood Circulation', 'Chi-Square Tests', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Developmental Biology', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hospitals', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Inpatients', 'Lead', 'Length of Stay', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'MicroRNAs', 'Molecular Biology', 'Motor', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Discharge', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Plasma', 'Predictive Analytics', 'Predictive Value', 'Preparation', 'Process', 'Prospective Studies', 'Quantitative Reverse Transcriptase PCR', 'Recovery', 'Regimen', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Stroke', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Training', 'Upper Extremity', 'Validation', 'arm', 'axon guidance', 'base', 'cohort', 'cost', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'magnetic resonance imaging biomarker', 'microRNA biomarkers', 'molecular marker', 'motor impairment', 'motor recovery', 'neurophysiology', 'outcome prediction', 'patient subsets', 'personalized medicine', 'post stroke', 'precision medicine', 'predictive panel', 'programs', 'prospective', 'relating to nervous system', 'repaired', 'response', 'restoration', 'stroke patient', 'stroke recovery', 'stroke rehabilitation', 'tool']",NINDS,GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY,R61,2020,969858,0.15718831119347265
"Achieving Optimal Motor Function in Stroke Survivors via a Human-Centered Approach to Design an mHealth Platform Project Summary / Abstract  Upper-limb paresis is the most common impairment following a stroke affecting 75% of stroke survivors, which can be more prominent in one of the two limbs. Most recovery of functional impairments occurs within the first few weeks after stroke and plateaus thereafter. Unfortunately, even after patients reach a stable phase of recovery, their functional level of the stroke-affected limb may decline. Therefore, it is clinically important to maintain the regained functional level beyond the first couple weeks of spontaneous recovery by continuing to practice the use of the affected limb during daily living.  Wearable technologies have emerged as a low-cost, objective tool to monitor the performance of the upper limbs during activities of daily living (ADLs). However, to date, there exists no study that has investigated the effectiveness of a mobile-health (mHealth) system aiming to enable high-dosage motor performance in chronic stroke survivors in the real-world setting. Specifically, the optimal configuration of the goal setting, feedback mechanism and ways to share data among the stakeholders (patients and clinicians) remains unknown.  This proposal aims to develop and validate an mHealth technology that aims to encourage affected limb use during the performance of ADLs in chronic stroke survivors. To accomplish this goal, we will employ the unique finger-worn ring sensor (accelerometer), developed by our academic-industry partnership, that can capture both gross-arm and fine-hand use of the limbs that are essential in the performance of ADLs. We will study important aspects of making positive behavior changes to encourage the affected limb use by fully leveraging the computational insights drawn from sensor data combined with clinical insights from providers.  To accomplish this research goal, Aim 1 will focus on the development of an mHealth platform, composed of body-networked sensors and cloud-based systems, to monitor the real-world use of the limbs in chronic stroke survivors. In Aim 2, we will develop machine-learning based algorithms to extract clinically meaningful information regarding real-world upper limb use from sensor data. Aim 3 will investigate the optimal design of our mHealth system – such as individual tailoring of the goal, design of the feedback, medium and timing to deliver feedback, and ways to share data among the stakeholders (patients and clinicians) – via human-centered design approaches. Finally, in Aim 4, we will validate the short-term (8 weeks) effectiveness of the mHealth system in improving the use of the affected limb through a field deployment study.  We believe that outcomes of this project will open a new door leading to previously unexplored datasets and understanding of patient-technology interactions to promote positive behavior changes to enable a high dosage of physical and occupational therapy, which can form the basis of a wide range of future investigations of hemiparesis rehabilitation and personalized disease management. Project Narrative  Upper-limb paresis is the most common impairment following a stroke affecting 75% of stroke survivors, which can be more prominent in one of the two limbs. It is clinically important that stroke survivors continue to practice the use of the stroke-affected limb in their home and community settings to maintain the functional level learned in the clinic, but currently, there exists no effective, practical clinical tool. In this project, we propose to develop and validate an mHealth technology that will monitor real-world upper limb activity by leveraging our novel finger-worn accelerometer sensors and provide individually-tailored feedback to encourage affected limb use.",Achieving Optimal Motor Function in Stroke Survivors via a Human-Centered Approach to Design an mHealth Platform,9887267,R01EB027777,"['Accelerometer', 'Activities of Daily Living', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Behavior', 'Brachial Paresis', 'Cause of Death', 'Cellular Phone', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Effectiveness', 'Environment', 'Evaluation Studies', 'Feedback', 'Fingers', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Hand functions', 'Health Technology', 'Health system', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Limb structure', 'Machine Learning', 'Monitor', 'Motor', 'Motor Skills', 'Movement', 'Network-based', 'Occupational Therapy', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physical therapy', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Recovery', 'Recovery of Function', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Secure', 'Stroke', 'System', 'Technology', 'Upper Extremity', 'Upper limb movement', 'Withdrawal', 'arm', 'arm movement', 'base', 'behavior change', 'care providers', 'chronic stroke', 'cloud based', 'cloud platform', 'community setting', 'cost', 'data sharing', 'data visualization', 'design', 'disability', 'dosage', 'functional disability', 'hemiparesis', 'improved', 'industry partner', 'insight', 'mHealth', 'motor recovery', 'novel', 'personalized management', 'post stroke', 'recruit', 'sensor', 'stroke survivor', 'tool', 'upper limb hemiparesis', 'usability', 'wearable device', 'wearable sensor technology', 'web platform']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF MASSACHUSETTS AMHERST,R01,2020,537650,0.18003393795298117
"Whole Transcriptome Studies of Patients with Transient Ischemic Attacks (TIAs) ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Transient ischemic attacks (TIA) are critical to identify because prevention therapy can reduce the risk of future vascular events by > 50%. Diagnostic testing and therapeutic intervention must start as soon as possible because 10-25% of TIAs have a stroke within 90 days. Because so many patients present emergently with transient neurological events the large majority of whom do not go on to have a stroke, methods for identifying TIAs at high risk for stroke have been sought so that work up and treatment can be targeted to those who need it most to save time, money and limited resources. Though the ABCD2 score and brain Diffusion Weighted Imaging-MRI (DWI-MRI) have improved prediction of which TIAs have a stroke, their sensitivity and specificity for prediction of individual cases i poor. In this proposal we propose that peripheral blood leukocytes and platelets play pivotal roles in which TIAs go on to have a stroke and by assessing RNA in whole blood we can evaluate leukocyte and platelet function in TIA patients who go on to have stroke versus those that do not have a stroke. We hypothesize that specific coagulation and immune genes are activated in TIA patients that predispose them to have a stroke by 90 days compared to those TIA patients who do NOT have a stroke by 90 days. A subset of these leukocyte and platelet mRNA genes will predict TIAs who have a stroke by 90 days. This hypothesis is addressed by the following specific aims. Aim #1 (Derivation Cohort): Demonstrate that mRNA expression measured using RNAseq from whole blood differs in a derivation cohort of TIAs that go on to have a stroke by 90 days compared to those TIAs who do not have a stroke by 90 days. Demonstrate that most mRNA found to be regulated using RNAseq are also significantly regulated when measured using qRT-PCR. Aim #2 (Derivation Cohort): Apply machine learning algorithms to the mRNA from Aim #1 to derive an optimal subset of mRNA regulated by both RNAseq and qRT-PCR that predict which TIAs have strokes by 90 days compared to those who do not with >95% sensitivity on cross-validation. Aim #3 (Validation Cohort): Use machine/prediction learning algorithms to demonstrate that the genes from Aim #2 when measured using qRT-PCR on an independent validation cohort predict which TIAs have a stroke by 90 days with >85% sensitivity. The goal of these studies is to discover mRNA profiles in blood that predict which TIA patients go on to have strokes by 90 days. When confirmed in future studies, this will direct in depth testing to those high risk TIAs most in need in order to prevent strokes, and decrease unnecessary testing in those with low risk of stroke. Equally as important, the genes discovered to be associated with high risk of stroke in TIA patients will represent potential novel stroke prevention targets. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will examine RNA in blood using RNAseq and qRT-PCR of human subjects with Transient Ischemic Attacks (TIAs) who have a stroke by 90 days compared to TIAs who do not have a stroke. The regulated mRNA, exons and alternatively spliced transcripts in a Derivation Cohort of TIA patients will be used to predict which TIAs have a stroke by 90 days in a Validation Cohort of TIA patients.",Whole Transcriptome Studies of Patients with Transient Ischemic Attacks (TIAs),9896876,R01NS097000,"['Address', 'Alternative Splicing', 'Area', 'Arterial Fatty Streak', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood Platelets', 'Blood Vessels', 'Brain', 'Cerebrum', 'Clinical', 'Coagulation Process', 'Data', 'Derivation procedure', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Epilepsy', 'Event', 'Exons', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Hour', 'Immune', 'Individual', 'Ischemic Stroke', 'Labyrinthine disorder', 'Leukocytes', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Messenger RNA', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Migraine', 'Neurologic', 'Patients', 'Play', 'Prevention therapy', 'Publishing', 'Quantitative Reverse Transcriptase PCR', 'RNA', 'ROC Curve', 'Recurrence', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Estimate', 'Role', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Site', 'Stroke', 'Stroke prevention', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Transcript', 'Transient Ischemic Attack', 'Validation', 'Whole Blood', 'base', 'cohort', 'emergency settings', 'gene discovery', 'high risk', 'human subject', 'improved', 'learning algorithm', 'mRNA Expression', 'machine learning algorithm', 'monocyte', 'neutrophil', 'novel', 'peripheral blood', 'platelet function', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'release factor', 'stroke risk', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,R01,2020,544777,0.2826061521768155
"Center for the Study of Aphasia Recovery (C-STAR) DESCRIPTION (Description as provided by applicant): Stroke is the leading cause of adult disability in the United States, making it a major public health concern (1). The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) estimates the annual cost of stroke in the United States to be $36.5 billion (1). Accordingly, it is clear that the negative personal and societal impact of stroke is vry high. Stroke is typically thought to affect older persons; however, many younger individuals also suffer strokes. For example, at least half of all stroke patients in the state of South Carolina ar under the age of 60 (2). Approximately a quarter of all chronic stroke survivors present with aphasia, a language disorder caused by damage to the speech and language areas of the brain (3, 4). The prevalence of chronic aphasia in the United States is estimated to be one million. Aphasia can vary in severity from very profound impairment that renders patients mute and without the ability to understand others' speech, to milder forms where patients have great difficulty retrieving specific words. In the chronic stage of stroke, aphasia has been identified a the strongest predictor of poor quality of life. Aphasia not only influences the ability to communicate with family and friends, but also drastically decreases education and employment opportunities. Although some degree of spontaneous recovery from aphasia is typical in the first weeks and months following stroke, many patients are left with devastating communication problems. Once aphasia has become a chronic condition, the only road to recovery is through aphasia therapy. Several meta-analysis studies suggest that aphasia therapy is effective. In spite of decades of research, very little is known about which patients benefit the most from treatment and what kind of treatment should be administered to patients with different impairment profiles. The overarching goal of the research proposed here is to improve aphasia treatment effectiveness as well as identify patient factors that can be used to improve diagnosis of language impairment, guide aphasia treatment, and predict prognosis. Specifically, the focus of our center (Center for the Study of Aphasia Recovery; C-STAR) is to examine the extent to which factors such as behavioral aphasia treatment, electrical brain stimulation, and residual brain function influence aphasia recovery. To accomplish our research goals, this project will rely on collaboration among four main investigators: Drs. Julius Fridriksson, Argye Hillis, Chris Rorden, and Greg Hickok. Projects led by Fridriksson (chronic patients) and Hillis (acute patients) will focus on factors that may promote improved outcome of aphasia therapy. Both projects will yield a vast, unique dataset including measures of brain status and response to aphasia treatment. Relying on this dataset, Rorden's project will predict recovery from aphasia using machine learning approaches whereas Hickok will utilize the same data to better understand aphasic impairment in relation to contemporary models of speech and language processing. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Stroke is the leading cause of adult disability in the United States; aphasia, an impairment of the ability to process language, is one of the most devastating results of left hemisphere stroke. The purpose of the work proposed here is to improve recovery from aphasia by better understanding how neurophysiology and anatomy as well as theory driven aphasia treatment relate to long-term outcome.",Center for the Study of Aphasia Recovery (C-STAR),9889924,P50DC014664,"['Acute', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'American', 'Anatomy', 'Aphasia', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain Injuries', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Cerebrum', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Communication', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Education', 'Elderly', 'Electric Stimulation', 'Electrical Stimulation of the Brain', 'Employment', 'Employment Opportunities', 'Family', 'Friends', 'Goals', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Language', 'Language Disorders', 'Left', 'Lesion', 'Life', 'Life Expectancy', 'Literature', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Perfusion', 'Prevalence', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Residual state', 'Savings', 'Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor', 'Severities', 'Social isolation', 'South Carolina', 'Speech', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Treatment Effectiveness', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States', 'Work', 'acute stroke', 'aphasia recovery', 'behavior test', 'chronic stroke', 'cost', 'disability', 'experience', 'fitness', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'language impairment', 'language processing', 'mortality', 'neuroimaging', 'neurophysiology', 'outcome forecast', 'predicting response', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'speech processing', 'stroke patient', 'stroke survivor', 'success', 'theories', 'treatment response']",NIDCD,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA AT COLUMBIA,P50,2020,2187036,0.13563416582850982
"Antiplatelet in Stroke:  Safety and Effectiveness in Seniors (ASSESS) The current U.S. and European guidelines recommend antiplatelet therapy such as aspirin, clopidogrel, or dual antiplatelet therapy to reduce the risk of recurrent ischemic events in patients with noncardioembolic ischemic stroke. However, selection of antiplatelet agents can be a difficult decision to make for older patients. Not only older individuals are at increased risk for recurrent strokes, they also face risk for bleeding complications. While it is known that drug selection should be individualized, it remains unknown how to tailor antiplatelet therapy according to patient unique characteristics, preferences, needs, and values. The long-term goal is to use com- parative effectiveness research to improve primary and secondary prevention in cardiovascular disease and stroke. Leveraging the American Heart Association (AHA) Get With The Guidelines Stroke (GWTG) registry and Medicare claims, the overall objective in this application is to develop patient-centered evidence-based strategies to improve antiplatelet treatment selection for older individuals presenting with noncardioembolic ischemic stroke. The central hypothesis is that individuals differ in many characteristics, such as age, sex, presence of comorbid- ities, or concurrent medications, which can influence the potential benefits and harms associated with the treat- ment. Once the variability in response to treatment is known, selection of an antiplatelet agent can be made based on patient risk profiles, preferences, and known efficacy/safety of the agents, making treatment both safer and more effective. Guided by strong preliminary data, this hypothesis will be tested by pursuing three specific aims: 1) determine the long-term clinical effectiveness of different antiplatelet regimens in patients with noncar- dioembolic ischemic stroke; 2) determine the long-term safety of different antiplatelet regimens; and 3) balance benefits and harms of each antiplatelet regimen while incorporating patient preferences into decision-making. The proposed research is innovative in four key ways: 1) a patient-centered approach is used to address a real- life decisional dilemma facing stroke survivors and clinicians; 2) it shifts focus from selected samples in clinical trials to nationwide representative stroke population, including traditionally underrepresented subgroups in com- munity practice; 3) novel propensity score inverse probability weighting method using generalized boosted mod- els (a machine learning technique) will be employed to mimic a trial-type multi-treatment design, uncover treat- ment heterogeneity, and minimize selection bias in observational data; 4) beyond traditional mechanisms of scientific publications, the evidence generated from this study will be disseminated to stroke survivors, clinicians, and relevant stakeholders through the AHA GWTG-led national quality initiatives and patient-led efforts to insure a rapid translation of seminal findings into clinical practice. The proposed research is significant, because it is expected to help guide personalized antiplatelet therapy in older ischemic stroke survivors that could best meet their needs and lead to better outcomes most meaningful to patients. Ultimately, such knowledge has the poten- tial to inform evidence-based treatment decisions in stroke that now afflicts more than 7.2 million Americans. The proposed research will develop patient-centered evidence-based strategies to improve antiplatelet treatment selection for older individuals presenting with noncardioembolic ischemic stroke. It is relevant to public health because the development and adoption of personalized evidence-based antiplatelet therapy is expected to re- duce recurrent ischemic events, minimize treatment complications, and improve outcomes most meaningful to patients. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to the part of NIH’s mission that pertains to developing funda- mental knowledge that will help to enhance health and reduce the burdens of illness and disability.",Antiplatelet in Stroke:  Safety and Effectiveness in Seniors (ASSESS),9897457,R01AG062770,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Age', 'Aging', 'American', 'American Heart Association', 'Antiplatelet Drugs', 'Aspirin', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cause of Death', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical effectiveness', 'Coagulation Process', 'Community Practice', 'Comparative Effectiveness Research', 'Complication', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Dose', 'Effectiveness', 'Equilibrium', 'European', 'Event', 'Evidence based treatment', 'Face', 'Failure', 'Fright', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Heart', 'Hemorrhage', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Ischemia', 'Ischemic Stroke', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Level of Evidence', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Medicare claim', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Patient Preferences', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Primary Prevention', 'Probability', 'Public Health', 'Publications', 'Recurrence', 'Regimen', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'Sampling', 'Secondary Prevention', 'Selection Bias', 'Selection for Treatments', 'Seminal', 'Societies', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Stroke', 'Stroke prevention', 'Subgroup', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Translations', 'Treatment Failure', 'United States', 'United States Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Weight', 'Woman', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'cardiovascular disorder prevention', 'clinical practice', 'clopidogrel', 'comorbidity', 'comparative effectiveness', 'disability', 'evidence base', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'individual patient', 'individualized medicine', 'innovation', 'novel', 'older patient', 'patient oriented', 'personalized medicine', 'preference', 'prevent', 'safety outcomes', 'sex', 'stroke patient', 'stroke survivor', 'therapy design', 'treatment effect', 'treatment response']",NIA,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,515169,0.2010254855958326
"Precision blood pressure management after endovascular stroke therapy based on real-time autoregulation measurements Abstract The following K23 proposal is for Dr. Nils Petersen, a Neurocritical Care and Stroke Neurologist at Yale-New Haven Hospital, and Assistant Professor at Yale University School of Medicine. Dr. Petersen is a physician- scientist with specialized knowledge of human cerebral hemodynamics who is investigating personalized, autoregulation-guided blood pressure management after ischemic stroke. About 40% of patients with ischemic stroke due to intracranial large-vessel occlusion (LVO) are rendered non-ambulatory, bedridden or deceased despite treatment with endovascular thrombectomy. Abnormalities in cerebrovascular autoregulation in the acute phase of LVO stroke increase the risk of secondary brain injury from relative cerebral hypo- or hyperperfusion. Thus, autoregulation-guided, personalized blood pressure management presents a promising alternative to the current practice of targeting fixed thresholds. By providing a more favorable physiologic environment for the injured brain, the autoregulation-guided approach may reduce secondary brain injury and improve outcomes. Preliminary data obtained by Dr. Petersen have demonstrated the feasibility of a research plan that uses near- infrared spectroscopy and real-time data processing to identify a patient-specific blood pressure range that yields optimal brain blood flow. This research proposal will evaluate if blood pressure management outside personalized limits of autoregulation increases the risk for neurologic worsening from infarct progression or hemorrhagic transformation, leading to increased rates of unfavorable outcome (Aim 1). Next, Dr. Petersen will evaluate the effectiveness of therapeutic blood pressure interventions and explore the feasibility of an intervention protocol targeting a personalized blood pressure range (Aim 2). Under the expert mentorship of Dr. Kevin Sheth, Chief of Neurocritical Care, Dr. Randolph Marshall, Director of Stroke Division at Columbia University, and Dr. Cynthia Brandt, Director of Medical Informatics, this K23 award will allow Dr. Petersen 1) to acquire skills in informatics, advanced signal processing and machine learning in order to enhance current methods of quantifying cerebral autoregulation, 2) to develop expertise in clinical trial design, 3) to build a research group dedicated to discovery and clinical evaluation of physiology-based individualized treatment strategies after stroke, and 4) to foster inter-institutional collaboration and data-sharing. This proposal will leverage Yale’s cutting-edge neuro-monitoring technologies along with extensive informatics and research resources from the Yale Center for Clinical Investigation to generate new insights into cerebral hemodynamics and identify treatment opportunities. At the conclusion of this award period, Dr. Petersen will be well-positioned to become an independently-funded investigator conducting high-quality research in the area of cerebral hemodynamics. His long-term goal is to use neuro-monitoring to develop physiology-based, personalized, early interventions to reduce the disability and morbidity associated with stroke. Narrative Project Narrative/Public Health Relevance: Stroke is the leading cause of disability in the United States, and this research proposal addresses the NIH mission to reduce the burden of neurological disorders and enhance the quality of life of people with disability. Current stroke treatments are primarily aimed at treating blockage of blood vessels but are only partially effective, leaving a great need for additional adjunctive therapies. Effective blood pressure management tailored to individual patients, with the aim of maintaining optimal brain blood flow, may prevent additional brain injury, and is an important first-step towards personalized medicine in stroke.",Precision blood pressure management after endovascular stroke therapy based on real-time autoregulation measurements,9977426,K23NS110980,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Award', 'Blood Pressure', 'Blood Vessels', 'Brain Injuries', 'Caring', 'Cerebral Edema', 'Cerebrovascular Circulation', 'Cerebrum', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Science', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Disabled Persons', 'Early Intervention', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Fostering', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Hemorrhage', 'Homeostasis', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Infarction', 'Informatics', 'Intervention', 'Ischemic Stroke', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Medical Informatics', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Near-Infrared Spectroscopy', 'Neurologic', 'Neurologist', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pharmacology', 'Phase', 'Physician Executives', 'Physicians', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quality of life', 'Recovery', 'Reperfusion Injury', 'Reperfusion Therapy', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Proposals', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Scientist', 'Secondary to', 'Step Tests', 'Stroke', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thrombectomy', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'acute stroke', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'blood pressure intervention', 'blood pressure reduction', 'blood pressure regulation', 'career', 'cerebral hemodynamics', 'cerebrovascular', 'clinical center', 'clinical investigation', 'computerized data processing', 'disability', 'effectiveness evaluation', 'functional outcomes', 'hemodynamics', 'hypoperfusion', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'individual patient', 'individualized medicine', 'insight', 'inter-institutional', 'medical schools', 'modifiable risk', 'nervous system disorder', 'personalized medicine', 'post stroke', 'preservation', 'pressure', 'prevent', 'professor', 'public health relevance', 'randomized trial', 'research clinical testing', 'signal processing', 'skills', 'standard of care', 'stroke therapy', 'therapeutic effectiveness', 'treatment strategy']",NINDS,YALE UNIVERSITY,K23,2020,191533,0.15967906945874408
"Balancing Risks and Benefits of Direct Oral Anticoagulants in Older Ischemic Stroke Patients with Atrial Fibrillation The 2019 U.S. practice guidelines recommend direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) such as dabigatran, rivarox- aban, and apixaban over warfarin for stroke prevention in high-risk patients with atrial fibrillation (AF). However, the selection of a DOAC can be challenging for older ischemic stroke patients. The risk-benefit ratios in second- ary stroke prevention differ substantially from those in primary prevention. Not only are older stroke survivors at increased risk for recurrent ischemic events, older age and history of ischemic stroke are also major risk factors for bleeding complications. While it is known that drug selection should be individualized, it remains unknown how to tailor anticoagulant therapy according to the effectiveness/safety of the agents and patient unique char- acteristics. The long-term goal is to use comparative effectiveness research to improve quality of care and out- comes in patients with cardiovascular disease and stroke. Leveraging the American Heart Association (AHA) Get With The Guidelines-Stroke Registry (GWTG-Stroke) and Medicare inpatient and Part D database, the over- all objective of this application is to develop evidence-based strategies to improve appropriate anticoagulant therapy for secondary prevention in older ischemic stroke patients with AF. The central hypothesis is that differ- ences exist between DOACs in terms of effectiveness and safety, which have direct implications for therapeutic selection. Once the relative effectiveness/safety is known, the selection of an anticoagulant can be made based on patient risk profiles, making treatment safer and more effective. Guided by strong preliminary data, this hy- pothesis will be tested by pursuing two specific aims: 1) Determine the long-term clinical effectiveness and safety of different DOACs for secondary prevention in older ischemic stroke patients with AF; 2) Investigate DOACs dosing patterns and evaluate the potential impact of underdosing or overdosing on long-term outcomes. The proposed research is innovative in four key ways: 1) A patient-centered approach is used to address a real-life decisional dilemma facing stroke survivors and clinicians; 2) It shifts focus from selected samples in clinical trials to a nationwide representative stroke population, including traditionally underrepresented subgroups in commu- nity practice; 3) A novel propensity score inverse probability weighting method using generalized boosted models (a machine learning technique) will be employed to mimic a trial-type multi-treatment design, uncover treatment heterogeneity, and minimize selection bias in observational data; 4) Beyond traditional mechanisms of scientific publications, the evidence generated from this study will be disseminated to stroke survivors, clinicians, and relevant stakeholders through the AHA GWTG-led national quality initiatives and patient-led efforts to ensure a rapid translation of seminal findings into clinical practice.

"Development and Acceptability of an Ambient In-Home Activity Assessment Tool for Stroke 1. Project Summary/Abstract  Stroke is the leading cause of serious, long-term disability in the United States and those that do not exercise or engage in regular activity are at a 30% increased risk of experiencing a recurrent stroke. One-on- one rehabilitation sessions are frequently limited in number due to insurance regulations and therapists (physical and occupational) frequently prescribe home-based exercise programs. These programs historically have low adherence rates and patient report can often be biased, incomplete, or inaccurate. Wearable sensors can track amount of activity but these sensors are limited in scope and cannot discern between various activities. Depth sensors can be used in the home to detect falls and monitor in-home gait patterns of well older adults. Other researchers have used depth sensors to detect and discern activities in laboratories or mock home environments with a population without any disabilities. In this proposal, the Daily Activity Recognition and Assessment System (DARAS) will merge prior ambient depth sensor work with newly developed algorithms to objectively and accurately measure the amount and type of activity of people with stroke living at home. This will be completed in three specific aims. The DARAS algorithms will be developed and refined for recognizing activities of people with stroke in the kitchen environment using the Foresite depth sensor. These algorithms will be trained using real-world data from lab-based testing with individuals with stroke (n =10). We will refine the Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) based algorithm for accurately segmenting and recognizing activities from untrimmed processing of depth videos. The developed activity recognition system will be deployed in the homes of 10 individuals with stroke over the course of 1 year. To determine the impact on daily life and acceptability of the system and generated data, focus groups will be held with 10 individuals with stroke. The DARAS developed in this proposal will provide a novel outcome assessment for a variety of post-stroke interventions and provide occupational therapists the ability to detect declines in performance early on and intervene. 8. Project Narrative Stroke is the leading cause of serious, long-term disability in the United States and those that do not engage in regular activity are at a 30% increased risk of experiencing a second stroke. Self-monitoring and self-report of home-based activity and exercise is highly subjective and provides little value to rehabilitation clinicians and their clients with stroke.

"Enhancing Stroke Prehospital and Emergency Evaluation and Delivery (E-SPEED) Nearly 800,000 people in the United States (US) each year are affected by stroke, which remains the leading cause of adult disability and 5th leading cause of death. Despite the proliferation of stroke centers nationwide, access to timely stroke care and evidence-based therapies is still poor with multiple inefficiencies, redundancies, errors, and system-based barriers that lead to care fragmentation. A stroke system of care that integrates and coordinates care between non-stroke center hospitals, primary stroke centers, and comprehensive stroke centers has been recommended since it would reduce stroke-related deaths by 20,000 annually in the US and nearly 400,000 worldwide. This proposal is significant because it addresses two important gaps in knowledge about the acute evaluation and treatment of stroke patients: prehospital screening errors and delays in inter-hospital transfer. The Enhancing Stroke Prehospital and Emergency Evaluation and Delivery (E-SPEED) study will (1) enhance existing LVO screening tools, assess whether machine learning approaches improve LVO prediction, and evaluate the impact of an Enhanced LVO Screening Tool in the prehospital setting; and (2) use learning collaboratives and simulations to design, implement, and pilot test a new inter-hospital stroke transfer protocol. We bring together systems engineers and stroke health service researchers in a novel collaboration that will produce generalizable knowledge that can be widely applied to other urban regions of the country and provide preliminary data and demonstration of novel approaches that could be evaluated in large-scale comparative effectiveness studies across multiple regions. NARRATIVE Timely acute stroke treatments can be life-saving and reduce disability from stroke; however, a minority of patients receive these treatments in a timely manner or at all.

"Toward a Mechanistic Understanding of Optimization Principles Underlying Hemiparetic Gait This project seeks to identify how motor impairments in stroke survivors contribute to mobility deficits through the use of behavioral observations and computational models. Ultimately, this knowledge could be used to design more effective interventions to improve walking ability, increase functional independence, and reduce fall risk in individuals post-stroke. After a stroke, walking ability is affected by motor control deficits which are often characterized by hemiparesis, or weakness on one side of the body. During walking, hemiparesis is often associated with a visible limp that is due to differences in step lengths and stance times between the right and left sides of the body. Reducing these right-left asymmetries are a common objective of rehabilitation, and recently researchers have developed a number of approaches designed to reduce asymmetries such as acoustic pacing, unilateral step training, and split-belt treadmill training. Despite the recent clinical focus on reducing asymmetry, the potential functional benefits of improving symmetry have yet to be established. This research will address this gap by answering two fundamental questions: 1) Do improvements in symmetry lead to functional benefits such as a more efficient walking pattern or improvements in balance? 2) If stroke survivors retain the capacity to walk more symmetrically why do they choose to do otherwise? Although improvements in symmetry can no doubt reduce the potential stigma of walking with a limp, it is possible that a symmetric walking pattern could be less efficient or put patients at a higher risk of falls if it requires that they push the limits of their capacity. Alternatively, it is possible that, through repeated stepping practice, post- stroke individuals have reinforced a suboptimal pattern due to insufficient experience with a more optimal, symmetric pattern. Addressing these issues requires a thorough understanding of the processes by which stroke survivors optimize their walking pattern. Here, these issues are addressed using behavioral approaches to quantify tradeoffs between asymmetry and measures of walking ability such as stability and economy, and computational methods to identify the causal relationships linking these variables. Ultimately, the knowledge derived from this work will provide a mechanistic understanding of how the damaged brain optimizes movement, and may also inform the way in which clinicians develop personalized rehabilitation objectives for stroke survivors. Our findings may also inform cost/benefit analyses of walking in other patient populations known to have asymmetric walking patterns such as amputees or individuals with Parkinson's disease. Furthermore, providing a more mechanistic rationale for gait rehabilitation interventions could improve the efficiency of physical therapy, reduce health care costs, and ultimately help to better reintegrate individuals with neuromotor impairments into society by maximizing their mobility. Public Health Relevance Statement This project seeks to identify the how walking impairments in stroke survivors contribute to mobility deficits through the use of behavioral observations and computational models. The chosen approach integrates biomechanical analyses, physiological assessments and machine learning algorithms to explain how asymmetries during walking influence balance and the effort required to walk. Ultimately, the results of this work may lead to more personalized rehabilitation strategies to improve walking capacity and efficiency, and ultimately reduce fall risk in stroke survivors.",Toward a Mechanistic Understanding of Optimization Principles Underlying Hemiparetic Gait,9939297,R01HD091184,"['Acceleration', 'Acoustics', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Amputees', 'Automobile Driving', 'Behavioral', 'Biomechanics', 'Brain', 'Brain Injuries', 'Clinical', 'Computer Models', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Cost-Benefit Analysis', 'Development', 'Environment', 'Equilibrium', 'Exercise Physiology', 'Functional disorder', 'Gait', 'Gases', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Left', 'Length', 'Limb structure', 'Link', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Metabolic', 'Movement', 'Nervous system structure', 'Paresis', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physical therapy', 'Physiological', 'Process', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Reaction', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Side', 'Societies', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Speed', 'Step training', 'Stroke', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Uncertainty', 'Walking', 'Work', 'behavior observation', 'clinical practice', 'computer science', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'design', 'effective intervention', 'experience', 'fall risk', 'foot', 'functional independence', 'gait rehabilitation', 'hemiparesis', 'high risk', 'improved', 'injured', 'locomotor control', 'machine learning algorithm', 'motor control', 'motor impairment', 'novel strategies', 'patient population', 'post stroke', 'public health relevance', 'rehabilitation strategy', 'relating to nervous system', 'social stigma', 'spatiotemporal', 'stroke rehabilitation', 'stroke survivor', 'success', 'treadmill', 'treadmill training', 'visual feedback', 'walking speed']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,R01,2020,380769,0.17493708916388526
"Shaping Neural Population Dynamics to Facilitate Learning Project Summary Behavior and cognition emerge from the coordinated activity of populations of interacting neurons. To change behavior we must change the architecture of the network that drives behavior. What are the rules whereby the activity of populations of neurons can change during learning? If we could observe the neural population dynamics that underlie skill learning, we might be able to facilitate learning. This ability may eventually lead to improvements to neurally- based rehabilitation strategies that can facilitate the recovery from stroke.  We will use a neurofeedback paradigm to shape the neural population dynamics that underlie skill learning. To do this, we will record the activity of dozens of neurons in the motor cortex of Rhesus monkey subjects. Animals will control a cursor on a computer screen by generating neural command signals. This is neurofeedback because the animal directly observes a projection of his neural activity, in the form of the movement of the onscreen cursor. This paradigm allows us to study learning simply by perturbing the mapping from neural activity to cursor movement on the screen. Following such a perturbation the animal must discover how to generate new patterns of neural activity that are now appropriate to restore good control of the onscreen cursor.  We will ask two linked questions. First, how does the animal learn to generate new patterns of neural activity? And second, can we facilitate that process? Neurofeedback-based learning offers complementary advantages to arm movements for studying the neural population dynamics that accompany learning. Chieﬂy, only in a neurofeedback paradigm can we be certain that the learning-induced changes in neural activity we observe matter directly for behavior, because only the neurons we record directly impact behavior in this paradigm.  We will test classic theories of skill learning, converted into speciﬁc hypotheses about how neural activity patterns will change throughout the multi-day course of skill learning.  If our neurofeedback-based incremental training schemes do facilitate learning, then this research will inform the work of rehabilitation specialists who work with stroke patients. We (and others) believe that if neurofeedback-based therapies are coupled with standard behavioral therapies for stroke, rehabilitation outcomes will improve. Project Narrative Stroke can be a debilitating condition. Only ﬁfty percent of stroke survivors make a full recovery, and that is usually only after extensive rehabilitation. The recovery from stroke and skill learning are probably closely related. We propose to develop brain-computer interface neurofeedback paradigms to facilitate the learning of new skills. If this is effective in our animal subjects it will provide new avenues to explore for stroke rehabilitation.",Shaping Neural Population Dynamics to Facilitate Learning,9900034,R01HD071686,"['Animals', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Computers', 'Control Animal', 'Couples Therapy', 'Data', 'Electrodes', 'Exhibits', 'Goals', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Learning Skill', 'Lesion', 'Link', 'Macaca mulatta', 'Machine Learning', 'Monkeys', 'Motor Cortex', 'Movement', 'Nervous System Trauma', 'Neurons', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Population Dynamics', 'Process', 'Recovery', 'Rehabilitation Outcome', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Scheme', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specialist', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Stroke', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Work', 'arm movement', 'base', 'behavior change', 'brain computer interface', 'design', 'forging', 'functional restoration', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'motor learning', 'multi-electrode arrays', 'network architecture', 'neural circuit', 'neural patterning', 'neurofeedback', 'neuromechanism', 'post stroke', 'rehabilitation strategy', 'relating to nervous system', 'restoration', 'skills', 'stroke model', 'stroke patient', 'stroke recovery', 'stroke rehabilitation', 'stroke survivor', 'theories', 'tool']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2020,423660,0.11444658491439044
"Prehospital Diagnostic Biomarker for Large Vessel Occlusion Background: The incidence of Large Vessel Acute Ischemic Stroke (AIS) has been estimated to be approximately 250,000 patients per year in the United States and is the leading cause of disability and fifth leading cause of death. Although interventional (stentriever) and pharmaceutical (tPA) treatments exist for large vessel occlusion (LVO), their use is limited due to the short time window from symptom onset that these treatments are indicated to be administered in. Moreover, recent estimates suggest only approximately 10% of eligible patients receive interventional treatment which has shown to lead to better outcomes in several worldwide RCTs. In order for intervention to be successful, a standardized, quantitative, field based (pre- hospital) diagnostic tool is needed to improve LVO identification and ensure rapid transfer to a capable medical facility. Currently, the gold standard for stroke diagnosis is CT angiogram (CTA) which is limited to in-hospital use or a low number of mobile stroke ambulances, all costing multi-millions of dollars, requiring expert operators and IV injection of iodine-rich contrast material. Additionally, the clinical stroke assessment scales (RACE, LAMS, CPSS) used in the field although low cost and non-invasive have proven unreliable due to training requirements and low inherent accuracies, with SEN and SPE ranging in a recent study from 0.50-0.64 and 0.83-0.92, respectively. Project Goals and Broad Specific Aims: Validate a biomarker for LVO assessment which can be measured and displayed with a fully automated, non-invasive, transcranial Doppler (TCD) robotic system with performance at or exceeding 90% ROC–AUC (targeting SEN & SPE greater than 90%) to standard of care imaging. Complete a clinical study where Arm 1 demonstrates technical feasibility of the system in acute stroke settings and Arm 2 demonstrates safety, no detrimental change to standard of care, and collect robust data to submit to the FDA an IFU expansion to drive clinical care using our robotic system and the biomarker. The ultimate and future goal of this work is to use the automated device and validated VCI biomarker in a prehospital setting to show improved clinical outcomes after stroke onset due to improved prehospital triage. This work is critical to first validate the biomarker against gold standard CTA, which must be completed in a hospital, to ultimately be used in the pre-hospital setting. Longterm Objective: CTA will not be replaced in comprehensive stroke centers and we do not aim to use our technology to do this in comprehensive centers with CTA. Instead, our technology will be available in centers without CTA or MRA and ultimately in the prehospital environment. The goal of our company is to show that our lower cost, portable, non invasive technology can be used to measure a valid biomarker of large vessel occlusion that can be performed outside of a comprehensive stroke center. The first step is to validate the biomarker, in a center with CTA as a gold standard, which is the ultimate goal of this work. The incidence of Large Vessel Acute Ischemic Stroke (AIS) has been estimated to be approximately 250,000 patients per year in the United States and is the leading cause of disability and fifth leading cause of death.

"Contributions of spared brain structures and connections to aphasia recovery Language impairment, or aphasia, is a common problem after left hemisphere stroke, and causes significant long-term disability. After the initial period of healing, recovery from stroke relies on plasticity in brain networks spared from direct stroke damage. Thus, to improve behavioral and biological treatments for aphasia, we must understand how spared brain structures and connections contribute to recovery. Over a century of research has demonstrated that left hemisphere areas surrounding the stroke and right hemisphere areas symmetric to the normal left hemisphere language network participate in aphasia recovery. However, the mechanisms by which these areas are recruited and their roles in language recovery remain unclear, particularly for the “right hemisphere language network.” We propose to examine the role of spared brain structures and connections in recovery of core language functions in a large group of left hemisphere stroke survivors and matched controls. The innovative methods address major limitations of prior studies by accounting for individual differences in stroke severity, using task-independent brain structure and connectivity measures, and examining several core language functions as defined by statistical analysis of an extensive behavioral assessment battery. Preliminary studies using this new approach suggest that parts of the right hemisphere language network grow after stroke, and that these changes improve language outcomes. Based on these findings, we hypothesize that recruitment of the right hemisphere language network after left hemisphere stroke compensates for language deficits. We will test this hypothesis against multiple alternative hypotheses, using advanced brain imaging methods to test for effects throughout spared parts of the brain. Analyses will examine how spared brain structures and connections contribute to language recovery, accounting for individual differences in stroke severity. We will additionally test for signs of brain plasticity after stroke and test relationships between stroke location and patterns of brain plasticity to better understand the mechanisms of recovery. New multi- modal analysis methods will integrate the brain structure and connectivity data, providing a more complete picture of recovery of language functions than has been possible before. This research will significantly advance our understanding of the biological basis of aphasia recovery, which will be vital in order to design maximally effective treatments. Language impairment, or aphasia, is a common problem after left hemisphere stroke, and causes significant long-term disability. Understanding the brain basis of recovery is critical to developing new treatments that can meaningfully improve the lives of people with aphasia. This study uses advanced brain imaging techniques to examine how brain networks spared by the stroke contribute to recovery of language abilities in left hemisphere stroke survivors.",Contributions of spared brain structures and connections to aphasia recovery,9988227,R01DC014960,"['Accounting', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Aphasia', 'Area', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavior assessment', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Response Modifier Therapy', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain region', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Diffusion', 'Factor Analysis', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Hypertrophy', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Individual Differences', 'Language', 'Language Disorders', 'Left', 'Lesion', 'Linear Regressions', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pilot Projects', 'Production', 'Publishing', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Rest', 'Role', 'Severities', 'Site', 'Speech', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technical Expertise', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Time Study', 'Work', 'aphasia recovery', 'base', 'behavioral study', 'density', 'design', 'disability', 'effective therapy', 'gray matter', 'healing', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'language impairment', 'language outcome', 'morphometry', 'multimodality', 'neuroregulation', 'novel strategies', 'patient subsets', 'post stroke', 'programs', 'recruit', 'stroke recovery', 'stroke survivor', 'study population', 'support network']",NIDCD,GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,837117,0.1795258931873054
"Longitudinal and quantitative MR plaque imaging for prediction of response to medical management in symptomatic intracranial atherosclerosis ABSTRACT Intracranial atherosclerotic disease (ICAD) is one of the most common causes of ischemic stroke worldwide. Despite intensive medical management, the current standard of care for secondary stroke prevention, the rate of recurrent stroke is 13% in the first year and as high as 35% in certain populations by 2 years. Currently, the initial and follow-up evaluations of these patients rely exclusively on assessments of clinical risk factors and, in some circumstances, the degree of luminal stenosis on imaging. However, this strategy may overlook subtle non-luminal changes within ICAD lesions. A tool that can directly probe atherosclerotic plaques and accurately quantify longitudinal changes of plaque features may help early identify non-responsive patients in whom an alternative therapy can be initiated. Magnetic resonance (MR) vessel wall imaging (VWI) has the potential to fulfill this role because of its compacity to directly visualize the vessel wall and characterize plaque features. However, there are several technical challenges associated with intracranial VWI: small size, tortuous course, and deep sitting warrant a high-resolution and 3D imaging approach; multiple lesion sites require a large imaging view; signals arising from neighboring blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) need to be adequately suppressed; relatively long imaging time and potential image corruption by patient motion; and lack of dedicated plaque analysis tools particularly for 3D dataset. In this proposal, we will develop a reliable 3D VWI- based MR plaque imaging (MRPI) strategy for prediction of response to medical management in symptomatic ICAD. Specifically, we will first develop a whole-brain 3D VWI sequence with intracranial vessel-dedicated motion compensation and motion-adaptive imaging acceleration (Aim1-Task1) and develop an automated intracranial vessel wall (IVA) tool integrating 3D vessel wall segmentation and computational algorithms for deriving quantitative plaque features (Aim1-Task2) followed by a validation study (Aim1-Task3). The validated techniques will then be used in a cross-sectional study to determine the MRPI-derived quantitative plaque features that are associated with ICAD lesions within the infarcted territory in patients with acute symptomatic ICAD (Aim 2). We will finally conduct a longitudinal study to determine the capacity of longitudinal and quantitative MRPI to predict response to medical management in symptomatic ICAD patients (Aim 3). Successful completion of the project will validate the compacity of VWI-based MRPI to quantitatively characterize ICAD and predict response to medical management in symptomatic ICAD patients. This will open the door to future clinical trials investigating the role of MRPI in developing personalized management paradigms and assessing new therapies. PROJECT NARRATIVE Atherosclerosis in the brain is an important cause of ischemic stroke worldwide and carries a high risk of recurrent stroke despite treatment. The objective of this project is to develop a magnetic resonance technique for prediction of treatment response, which may potentially help prevent recurrent stroke by early identifying non-responsive patients and initiating an alternative therapy.",Longitudinal and quantitative MR plaque imaging for prediction of response to medical management in symptomatic intracranial atherosclerosis,9898455,R01HL147355,"['3-Dimensional', 'Acceleration', 'Activities of Daily Living', 'Acute', 'Alternative Therapies', 'Arterial Fatty Streak', 'Arteries', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Blood', 'Brain', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical assessments', 'Computational algorithm', 'Consumption', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Failure', 'Financial compensation', 'Fostering', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging Device', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Individual', 'Intracranial Atheroscleroses', 'Ischemic Stroke', 'Lesion', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Morphology', 'Motion', 'Movement', 'Patients', 'Pharmacodynamics', 'Population', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Recurrence', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Rupture', 'Scanning', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Stenosis', 'Stroke', 'Stroke prevention', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Time', 'Treatment outcome', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'clinical practice', 'clinical risk', 'deep learning', 'follow-up', 'high resolution imaging', 'high risk', 'imaging approach', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'non-invasive imaging', 'novel therapeutics', 'personalized management', 'predicting response', 'preservation', 'prevent', 'segmentation algorithm', 'standard of care', 'tool', 'validation studies']",NHLBI,CEDARS-SINAI MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2020,470303,0.10013856441124502
"Direct 3D Reconstruction Methods for Electrical Impedance Tomography for Stroke Imaging Project Summary Every four minutes an American dies from stroke, equating to approximately 1 in every 19 US deaths annually. Strokes are classiﬁed as ischemic and hemorrhagic. Ischemic strokes make up 87% of all strokes and are caused by a blockage in a blood vessel (or artery) resulting in a lack of blood to the brain. A hemorrhagic stroke occurs when an artery in the brain leaks or ruptures releasing excess blood in or around the brain. Incorrect classiﬁcation can have dire consequences as treating a patient suffering from a hemorrhagic stroke (bleed) with anticoagulant drugs (used to dissolve blood clots for ischemic strokes) can prove fatal. Early action is of the utmost importance as each passing minute that brain cells lack the proper blood ﬂow additional cells die. Current classiﬁcation methods require tests performed at the hospital, e.g., CT or MRI scans of the patient's brain, leading to treatment delays. These delays are particularly lengthy for patients living in rural communities.  Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT) is an emerging medical imaging modality that is inexpensive, has no ionizing radiation, and provides portable high-contrast images using harmless surface current and voltage measurements (e.g., on the head using a ﬂexible hat) to recover the internal point-wise electrical properties (e.g., inside the brain). EIT can recover conductivity, a measure of how easily current ﬂows through a material, as well as permittivity, a measure of the ability of a material to store a charge. A hemorrhagic stroke corresponds to an area of abnormally high conductivity due to the bleed, whereas an ischemic stroke presents as an area of lower conductivity than expected due cellular swelling from energy failure.  The proposed project addresses the important problem of early, fast, portable stroke classiﬁcation with EIT. A critical barrier for the use of EIT for stroke imaging has been the sensitivity of the image reconstruction algorithms to incorrect domain modeling and noise in the data. Due to these challenges, most research has focused on monitoring applications, not helpful for the classiﬁcation task. By contrast, the D-bar reconstruction method proposed here is the only proven noise and modeling error robust reconstruction method capable of recovering the true conductivity/permittivity using a low-pass ﬁltering in a nonlinear Fourier domain. D-bar methods have been successful in 2D but their development in 3D is stunted. This proposal focuses on the development of fast, robust D-bar based reconstruction methods for the 3D partial boundary problem, critical to working with stroke EIT data. Numerical algorithms will be developed for the full and partial boundary problems in 3D and validated on simulated and experimental data. A priori information, from anatomical atlases, will be embedded into the methods for increased resolution and stability. As the low-pass ﬁltering in D-bar methods leads to blurred reconstructions, post-processing through Convolutional Neural Networks will provide improved image quality. This work will be the ﬁrst to develop robust computational algorithms for 3D EIT data, opening the door for stroke imaging. Project Narrative Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT), a portable imaging modality may provide early classiﬁcation of stroke type reducing treatment delays thus leading to improved patient outcomes. Existing image reconstruction algorithms for EIT are not robust to practical partial boundary data inherent to stroke imaging. Robust D-bar methods, aided with a priori information from anatomical atlases, will be developed in 3D to address the stroke classiﬁcation and monitoring tasks from practical EIT data.",Direct 3D Reconstruction Methods for Electrical Impedance Tomography for Stroke Imaging,9872170,R21EB028064,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Alteplase', 'Ambulances', 'American', 'Anatomy', 'Anticoagulants', 'Area', 'Arteries', 'Atlases', 'Benign', 'Blood', 'Blood Vessels', 'Blood flow', 'Brain', 'Brain hemorrhage', 'Brain imaging', 'Bypass', 'Cancerous', 'Cells', 'Cerebral hemisphere hemorrhage', 'Cessation of life', 'Charge', 'Chemicals', 'Classification', 'Computational algorithm', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Drug usage', 'Electric Conductivity', 'Electrodes', 'Failure', 'Fourier Transform', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Head', 'Health', 'Hemorrhage', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Image', 'Ionizing radiation', 'Ischemic Stroke', 'Lead', 'Location', 'MRI Scans', 'Mathematics', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Rupture', 'Rural Community', 'Scanning', 'Stroke', 'Surface', 'Swelling', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Validation', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'brain cell', 'cancer classification', 'contrast imaging', 'convolutional neural network', 'cranium', 'deep learning', 'electrical impedance tomography', 'electrical property', 'flexibility', 'follow-up', 'human subject', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'mathematical methods', 'portability', 'reconstruction', 'stroke patient', 'theories', 'tumor', 'voltage']",NIBIB,MARQUETTE UNIVERSITY,R21,2020,225182,0.22671018510738927
"Smartwatch Monitoring for Atrial Fibrillation After Stroke Project Summary / Abstract Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the world’s most common serious heart rhythm problem and causes 15% of all strokes, a major cause of disability and death among Americans. Long-term monitoring for early AF detection and treatment is recommended for many stroke patients, but although existing cardiac monitors are accurate, they suffer from methodologic and cost limitations that preclude their long-term use. In the proposed, “Smartwatch Monitoring for Atrial Fibrillation Real-Time in Stroke,” Study, our overall objective is to enhance paroxysmal AF (pAF) detection by enhancing and testing Pulsewatch, an innovative, smartwatch-based technology for long-term rhythm monitoring of stroke patients. For Aim 1, we embed our state-of-the art AF detection algorithms, interactive messaging to promote adherence, and novel contact and motion noise correction capabilities into a smartwatch to enable near-continuous pulse waveform analysis. We will further refine Pulsewatch through focus groups and a Hack-a-thon with stroke patients and their medical providers. For Aim 2, we will enroll 90 stroke survivors and provide them with a smartphone and smartwatch, both encoded with Pulsewatch. We will compare the performance of Pulsewatch when worn daily for 7 days to conventional 7-day cardiac monitoring for pAF detection. For Aim 3, we will determine the acceptability and usability of Pulsewatch through follow-up interviews and focus groups in 30 randomly selected participants from Aim 2 asked to continue wearing smartwatch daily for an additional 30 days. We will identify patient factors associated with adherence and evaluate the impact of Pulsewatch use on disease-specific quality of life, anxiety, and self- activation among the 30 users compared to 30 stroke patients treated with usual care through baseline and 1- month assessments. Our research will lead to the development of a highly acceptable, enabling cardiovascular monitoring technology designed by, and for, stroke patients that facilitates long-term non-invasive screening for pAF, as well as communication between stroke patients and their medical providers.

Accordingly, we propose a series of prospective investigations involving stroke patients and their medical providers focused on developing, validating, and field-testing a new smartwatch-based AF detection platform, Pulsewatch, to create a mobile technology that can detect paroxysms of AF, accelerate their treatment, is user-centric, and is of great intrinsic acceptability.",Smartwatch Monitoring for Atrial Fibrillation After Stroke,9882313,R01HL137734,"['Adherence', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Anxiety', 'Atrial Fibrillation', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cellular Phone', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Elderly', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Electronic Mail', 'Engineering', 'Enhancement Technology', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Fingers', 'Focus Groups', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Geriatrics', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Heart Rate', 'Immigrant', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Interview', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Letters', 'Machine Learning', 'Market Research', 'Measurement', 'Medical', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Noise', 'Participant', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Representative', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Population', 'Provider', 'Publishing', 'Quality of life', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Self Efficacy', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Spottings', 'Stroke', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technology', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Transient Ischemic Attack', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Work', 'base', 'comparative efficacy', 'cost', 'cryptogenic stroke', 'design', 'disability', 'experience', 'field study', 'follow-up', 'heart rhythm', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'iterative design', 'lens', 'mHealth', 'mobile computing', 'non-invasive monitor', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'post stroke', 'preference', 'prospective', 'screening', 'sensor', 'signal processing', 'smart watch', 'smartphone Application', 'stroke patient', 'stroke survivor', 'tool', 'treatment as usual', 'usability']",NHLBI,UNIV OF MASSACHUSETTS MED SCH WORCESTER,R01,2020,744627,0.2096605911022095
"Point-of-Care CT Perfusion (PoC CT-P) for Early Stroke Assessment Abstract The goal of this SBIR Phase I project is to develop a portable and affordable cranial x-ray-based Computed Tomography Perfusion (CT-P) device for expedited front-line evaluation and triage of ischemic cerebral stroke victims. CT-P is the gold standard modality for assessment and classifying stroke patients to determine the best candidates for revascularizing procedures; however, CT-P is generally unavailable early in the current acute care treatment model. Unlike existing conventional CT-P equipment which is generally large, expensive, and stationary, the proposed device would be compact, portable, and affordable to be deployed in nursing homes, urgent care centers, hospital ER triage areas, ICUs, and EMS response vehicles, yet also provide sufficient time and contrast resolution for reliable perfusion metrics. Rapidly acquired point-of-care CT and CT-P images showing blood flow, volume, and transit times will enable (1) early classification of hemorrhage or ischemic, and (2) assessment of the recoverable brain tissue volume. This will enable early screening evaluation for appropriate acute stroke patient prioritization and routing. In addition, it may also provide an economical and safe bedside means of assessing cranial perfusion for follow up care in the ICU, recovery room, or even eventually in a residential care setting. Xoran Technologies LLC specializes in point-of-care (POC) medical imaging and has successfully marketed over 750 POC imaging devices in the US. Project Narrative When an individual is suffering from acute stroke, time is of the essence; however, it is critically important to assess the type of stroke as well as the amount and location of potentially recoverable brain tissue to determine the appropriate routing and priority to achieve the best outcome for that individual. In this project a new compact and portable device is proposed that allows cranial perfusion studies to be performed earlier in the process than the current standard of care, potentially in a nursing home, urgent care center, or in an emergency vehicle such as an ambulance.

"DISCOVERY: Determinants of Incident Stroke Cognitive Outcomes and Vascular Effects on RecoverY Stroke is the major cause of an adult disability epidemic in the US, with a major contribution from post-stroke cognitive impairment and dementia (PSCID), the rates of which are disproportionally high among the health disparity populations. Despite the PSCID’s overwhelming impact on public health, a knowledge gap exists with regard to the complex interaction between the acute stroke event and highly prevalent pre-existing brain pathology related to cerebrovascular (VCID) and Alzheimer’s disease, or related dementia (AD/ADRD). Understanding the factors that modulate PSCID risk in relation to index stroke event is critically important for developing personalized prognostication of PSCID, targeted interventions to prevent PSCID, and informing future clinical trial design. In response to this critical challenge, we propose Determinants of Incident Stroke Cognitive Outcomes and Vascular Effects on RecoverY (DISCOVERY), a collaborative network of clinical sites with access to acute stroke populations and the expertise and capacity for systematic assessment of PSCID led by a team of recognized experts in VCID, AD, acute stroke, health disparities, and multi-center research. The overarching goal of this proposal is to determine which specific subsets of stroke events cause (or do not cause) PSCID and which additional demographic (sex, race, ethnicity), clinical factors and comorbidities that synergize with acute stroke to result in or prevent PSCID. The overall scientific objective of this study is to elucidate mechanisms of brain resilience/susceptibility to PSCID in diverse US populations based on complex interplay between life-course exposure to multiple vascular risk factors, pre-existing burden of microvascular and neurodegenerative pathology, the effect of strategic acute stroke lesions, and the mediating effect of genomic/epigenomic variation. We will achieve this goal by implementing the DISCOVERY Network of 30 clinical sites, which under the leadership of the Administrative Core and guided by the research strategy delineated by the Recruitment and Retention, Statistics, and Repository Cores, will conduct a prospective, multi- center, observational, nested-cohort study of 8,000 nondemented ischemic and hemorrhagic incident stroke patients within 72 hours of symptom onset, who will be followed for a minimum of 2 years, with serial cognitive evaluations and assessments of functional outcome, with subsets undergoing research MRI and PET and comprehensive genetic/genomic and fluid biomarker testing. In a series of systematic, hypothesis driven experiments we will: 1) identify the independent and combined effect of the acute stroke lesion, pre-existing burden of disease, and baseline markers of brain resilience on PSCID; 2) examine the role of acute stroke as a critical factor in accelerating AD/ADRD and VCID pathology leading to PSCID; and 3) develop two distinct generalizable personalized-medicine models for individual patient outcome prediction and patient selection for clinical trials. DISCOVERY will become a landmark study to unravel the mechanisms of post-stroke cognitive disability, early stroke recovery, and potential targets for personalized prevention, intervention, and rehabilitation. Stroke-related disability - including cognitive impairment and dementia - is a public health epidemic and a key national research priority in the United States. Because of its disproportionately high impact on health disparity populations, understanding the mechanisms of post-stroke cognitive decline is a matter of equitable health care delivery. DISCOVERY, the proposed collaborative nationwide network of clinical sites with access to diverse acute stroke US populations has the expertise, experience and capacity to execute a large prospective study that will unravel the mechanisms of post-stroke cognitive disability, early recovery after stroke, and potential targets for personalized prevention, intervention, and rehabilitation.",DISCOVERY: Determinants of Incident Stroke Cognitive Outcomes and Vascular Effects on RecoverY,10021035,U19NS115388,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Amyloid beta-Protein', 'Aneurysmal Subarachnoid Hemorrhages', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood Vessels', 'Brain', 'Brain Injuries', 'Brain Pathology', 'Caring', 'Cerebral hemisphere hemorrhage', 'Characteristics', 'Classification Scheme', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Cognitive', 'Cohort Studies', 'Complex', 'Dementia', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemic', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Exposure to', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Hemorrhage', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Impaired cognition', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Trial', 'Ischemic Stroke', 'Knowledge', 'Leadership', 'Lesion', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Liquid substance', 'Location', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurable', 'Mediating', 'Methylation', 'Microvascular Dysfunction', 'Modeling', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Patient Selection', 'Patients', 'Perfusion', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Predisposition', 'Prevention trial', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Process', 'Prospective Studies', 'Public Health', 'Race', 'Recovery', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Research Priority', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Series', 'Serum', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translations', 'United States', 'Variant', 'acute stroke', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'cerebrovascular', 'clinical application', 'clinical research site', 'cognitive disability', 'cognitive load', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'deep learning', 'dementia risk', 'disability', 'epigenomics', 'exome sequencing', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'functional outcomes', 'genome wide association study', 'health care delivery', 'health disparity', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'indexing', 'individual patient', 'individualized prevention', 'morphometry', 'multiple omics', 'neuroimaging', 'non-demented', 'outcome prediction', 'patient stratification', 'personalized medicine', 'population based', 'post stroke', 'post stroke cognitive impairment', 'prevent', 'prognostic', 'prospective', 'recruit', 'repository', 'resilience', 'response', 'sex', 'statistics', 'stroke event', 'stroke patient', 'stroke recovery', 'tau Proteins', 'vascular injury', 'vascular risk factor']",NINDS,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,U19,2020,11092441,0.22095008443770606
