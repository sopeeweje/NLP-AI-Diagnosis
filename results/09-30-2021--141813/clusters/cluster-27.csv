"Adaptive Reproducible High-Dimensional Nonlinear Inference for Big Biological Data Big data is now ubiquitous in every field of modern scientific research. Many contemporary applications, such as the recent national microbiome initiative (NMI), greatly demand highly flexible statistical machine learning methods that can produce both interpretable and reproducible results. Thus, it is of paramount importance to identify crucial causal factors that are responsible for the response from a large number of available covariates, which can be statistically formulated as the false discovery rate (FDR) control in general high-dimensional nonlinear models. Despite the enormous applications of shotgun metagenomic studies, most existing investigations concentrate on the study of bacterial organisms. However, viruses and virus-host interactions play important roles in controlling the functions of the microbial communities. In addition, viruses have been shown to be associated with complex diseases. Yet, investigations into the roles of viruses in human diseases are significantly underdeveloped. The objective of this proposal is to develop mathematically rigorous and computationally efficient approaches to deal with highly complex big data and the applications of these approaches to solve fundamental and important biological and biomedical problems. There are four interrelated aims. In Aim 1, we will theoretically investigate the power of the recently proposed model-free knockoffs (MFK) procedure, which has been theoretically justified to control FDR in arbitrary models and arbitrary dimensions. We will also theoretically justify the robustness of MFK with respect to the misspecification of covariate distribution. These studies will lay the foundations for our developments in other aims. In Aim 2, we will develop deep learning approaches to predict viral contigs with higher accuracy, integrate our new algorithm with MFK to achieve FDR control for virus motif discovery, and investigate the power and robustness of our new procedure. In Aim 3, we will take into account the virus-host motif interactions and adapt our algorithms and theories in Aim 2 for predicting virus-host infectious interaction status. In Aim 4, we will apply the developed methods from the first three aims to analyze the shotgun metagenomics data sets in ExperimentHub to identify viruses and virus-host interactions associated with several diseases at some target FDR level. Both the algorithms and results will be disseminated through the web. The results from this study will be important for metagenomics studies under a variety of environments. Big data is ubiquitous in biological research. Identifying causal factors associated with complex diseases or traits from big data is highly important and challenging. New statistical and computational tools will be developed to control False Discovery Rate (FDR) for molecular sequence data based on the novel model-free knockoffs framework. They will be used to detect sequence motifs for viruses and motif-pairs for virus-host interactions, and to analyze multiple metagenomics data sets related to complex diseases.",Adaptive Reproducible High-Dimensional Nonlinear Inference for Big Biological Data,9753295,R01GM131407,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Archaea', 'Attention', 'Bacteria', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Bypass', 'Cells', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Consult', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Ecosystem', 'Effectiveness', 'Environment', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Gaussian model', 'Genes', 'Genetic Materials', 'Genomics', 'Healthcare', 'Human', 'Internet', 'Investigation', 'Joints', 'Length', 'Linear Regressions', 'Literature', 'Liver Cirrhosis', 'Machine Learning', 'Marines', 'Mathematics', 'Metagenomics', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutation', 'Neurosciences', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Non-linear Models', 'Obesity', 'Organism', 'Performance', 'Planet Earth', 'Play', 'Procedures', 'Reproducibility', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Studies', 'Shotguns', 'Social Sciences', 'Testing', 'Theoretical Studies', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Viral', 'Virus', 'Visualization software', 'Work', 'base', 'biological research', 'computerized tools', 'contig', 'dark matter', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'design', 'flexibility', 'high dimensionality', 'human disease', 'human tissue', 'improved', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'metagenomic sequencing', 'microbial community', 'microbiome', 'microbiome research', 'model design', 'model development', 'new technology', 'novel', 'power analysis', 'response', 'simulation', 'theories', 'trait', 'user-friendly', 'virus host interaction', 'virus identification']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,R01,2019,279949,0.042180320064067016
"Evidence Extraction Systems for the Molecular Interaction Literature Burns, Gully A. Abstract  In primary research articles, scientists make claims based on evidence from experiments, and report both the claims and the supporting evidence in the results section of papers. However, biomedical databases de- scribe the claims made by scientists in detail, but rarely provide descriptions of any supporting evidence that a consulting scientist could use to understand why the claims are being made. Currently, the process of curating evidence into databases is manual, time-consuming and expensive; thus, evidence is recorded in papers but not generally captured in database systems. For example, the European Bioinformatics Institute's INTACT database describes how different molecules biochemically interact with each other in detail. They characterize the under- lying experiment providing the evidence of that interaction with only two hierarchical variables: a code denoting the method used to detect the molecular interaction and another code denoting the method used to detect each molecule. In fact, INTACT describes 94 different types of interaction detection method that could be used in conjunction with other experimental methodological processes that can be used in a variety of different ways to reveal different details about the interaction. This crucial information is not being captured in databases. Although experimental evidence is complex, it conforms to certain principles of experimental design: experimentally study- ing a phenomenon typically involves measuring well-chosen dependent variables whilst altering the values of equally well-chosen independent variables. Exploiting these principles has permitted us to devise a preliminary, robust, general-purpose representation for experimental evidence. In this project, We will use this representation to describe the methods and data pertaining to evidence underpinning the interpretive assertions about molecular interactions described by INTACT. A key contribution of our project is that we will develop methods to extract this evidence from scientiﬁc papers automatically (A) by using image processing on a speciﬁc subtype of ﬁgure that is common in molecular biology papers and (B) by using natural language processing to read information from the text used by scientists to describe their results. We will develop these tools for the INTACT repository but package them so that they may then also be used for evidence pertaining to other areas of research in biomedicine. Burns, Gully A. Narrative  Molecular biology databases contain crucial information for the study of human disease (especially cancer), but they omit details of scientiﬁc evidence. Our work will provide detailed accounts of experimental evidence supporting claims pertaining to the study of these diseases. This additional detail may provide scientists with more powerful ways of detecting anomalies and resolving contradictory ﬁndings.",Evidence Extraction Systems for the Molecular Interaction Literature,9772541,R01LM012592,"['Area', 'Binding', 'Biochemical', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Burn injury', 'Classification', 'Co-Immunoprecipitations', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Consult', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Data Reporting', 'Data Set', 'Database Management Systems', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Disease', 'Engineering', 'European', 'Event', 'Experimental Designs', 'Experimental Models', 'Gel', 'Goals', 'Grain', 'Graph', 'Image', 'Informatics', 'Institutes', 'Intelligence', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Biology', 'Molecular Weight', 'Names', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Paper', 'Pattern', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Privatization', 'Process', 'Protein Structure Initiative', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publications', 'Reading', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Scientist', 'Source Code', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Structural Models', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Taxonomy', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'Typology', 'Western Blotting', 'Work', 'base', 'data modeling', 'experimental study', 'human disease', 'image processing', 'learning strategy', 'open source', 'optical character recognition', 'protein protein interaction', 'repository', 'software systems', 'text searching', 'tool']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,R01,2019,264255,0.02348547132391309
"Bayesian Machine Learning Tools for Analyzing Microbiome Dynamics The human microbiota plays an important role in health and disease, and its therapeutic manipulation is being actively investigated for a wide range of diseases that span every NIH institute. Our microbiota are inherently dynamic, and analyzing these time-dependent properties is key to robustly linking the microbiota to disease, and predicting the effects of therapies targeting the microbiota; indeed, longitudinal microbiome data is being acquired with increasing frequency, and is a major component of many NIH-funded projects. However, there is currently a dearth of computational tools for analyzing microbiome time-series data, which presents several special challenges including high measurement noise, irregular and sparse temporal sampling, and complex dependencies between variables. The objective of this proposal is to introduce new capabilities, improve on, and provide state-of-the-art implementations of tools for analyzing dynamics, or patterns of change in microbiome time-series data. The tools we develop will use Bayesian machine learning methods, which are well-recognized for their strong conceptual and practical advantages, particularly in biomedical domains. Tools will be rigorously tested and validated on synthetic and real human microbiome data, including publicly available datasets and those from collaborators providing 16S rRNA sequencing, metagenomic, and metabolomics data. We propose three specific aims. For Aim 1, we will develop integrated Bayesian machine learning tools for predicting population dynamics of the microbiome and its responses to perturbations. These tools will include a new model that simultaneously learns groups of microbes with similar interaction structure and predicts their behavior over time, and that incorporates prior phylogenetic information. The model will be further improved by incorporating stochastic microbial dynamics and errors in measurements throughout the model. For Aim 2, we will develop Bayesian machine learning tools to predict host status from microbiome dynamics. The tools will learn easily interpretable, human-readable rules that predict host status from microbiome time-series data, and will be further extended to handle a variety of longitudinal study designs. For Aim 3, we will engineer our microbiome dynamics analysis software tools for optimal performance, ease-of- use, maintainability, extensibility, and dissemination to the community. In total, the proposed work will yield a suite of contemporary software tools for analyzing microbiome dynamics, with expected broad use and major impact. The software will allow investigators to answer important scientific and translational questions about the microbiome, including discovering which microbial taxa or their metagenomes are affected over time by perturbations such as changes in diet or invasion by pathogens; predicting the effects of these perturbations over time, including changes in composition or stability of the gut microbiota; and finding temporal signatures in multi-‘omic microbiome data that predict disease risk in the human host. The human microbiota, or collection of micro-organisms living on and within us, plays an important role in health, and when disrupted or abnormal, may contribute to many types of diseases including infections, kidney diseases, bowel diseases, diabetes, heart diseases, arthritis, allergies, brain diseases, and cancer. Sophisticated computer-based tools are needed to make sense of human microbiota data, particularly time- series data, which can yield important insights into how our microbiomes change over time. This work will develop new and improved computer-based tools for analyzing microbiota time-series data, which will be made freely available and will enable scientists to increase our fundamental knowledge about how our microbiota affect us and ultimately to apply this knowledge to prevent and treat human illnesses.",Bayesian Machine Learning Tools for Analyzing Microbiome Dynamics,9787546,R01GM130777,"['16S ribosomal RNA sequencing', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Antibiotics', 'Arthritis', 'Autoimmunity', 'Bayesian learning', 'Behavior', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Models', 'Brain Diseases', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Childhood', 'Clostridium difficile', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dependence', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diet', 'Disease', 'Engineering', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Health', 'Heart Diseases', 'Human', 'Human Microbiome', 'Hypersensitivity', 'Infection', 'Institutes', 'Intervention', 'Intestines', 'Investigation', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Medical', 'Metagenomics', 'Microbe', 'Modeling', 'Names', 'Noise', 'Oligosaccharides', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phylogenetic Analysis', 'Play', 'Population Dynamics', 'Property', 'Pythons', 'Readability', 'Recurrence', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Shotguns', 'Software Engineering', 'Software Tools', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Time Series Analysis', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'base', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'disorder risk', 'dynamic system', 'gut microbiota', 'human data', 'human microbiota', 'human subject', 'improved', 'insight', 'learning algorithm', 'learning strategy', 'man', 'metabolomics', 'metagenome', 'microbial', 'microbiome', 'microbiome analysis', 'microbiome sequencing', 'microbiota', 'microorganism', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'open source', 'pathogen', 'predictive tools', 'prevent', 'response', 'software development', 'targeted treatment', 'tool']",NIGMS,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2019,312939,0.06718728968016723
"Structure based Prediction of the interactome The interactions of small molecules with proteins is not only omnipresent throughout cellular processes, but also of fundamental importance to drug design and disease treatment. Much like with protein-protein and protein-RNA interactions, high-throughput (HTP) experimental methods have led to the generation of enormous volumes of protein-small molecule and related data. However, in addition to sheer scale, high degrees of heterogeneity in these data, combined with proprietary ownership concerns when originating from within industry, present significant challenges to the sharing and full use of this data in basic research and therapeutic development. This proposal aims to develop new mathematical methods that can address not only interpreting the data itself, but also the collaborative and generative process through which researchers work: new cryptographic tools can enable unprecedented forms of secure sharing and collaboration between industry and the public, and deep learning of structural features can reduce the dependence of researchers on prior assumptions as to important predictors of drug-target interactions (DTI).  In our previous granting period, we successfully developed methods for structure-based prediction and HTP data analysis of protein-protein and protein-RNA interactions, uncovering novel biology (e.g., for neurodegenerative diseases). In this renewal, we aim to: 1) develop scalable methods for multi-party computation and differential privacy to enable the secure sharing of large proprietary drug-target interaction databases among industry and public researchers; 2) develop novel integrative machine learning approaches for identifying drug-target interactions based on interactome, molecular structure and chemogenomic data (in collaboration with co-I Jian Peng); and 3) establish innovative collaborations with industry, academia and the scientific community to drive use and adoption of these computational tools and technologies among practicing biomedical researchers.  Successful completion of these aims will provide both public and private research communities with scalable access to technologies for secure sharing of proprietary drug screening data as well as flexible, accurate tools for predicting drug-target interactions. All developed software will be made available via publicly accessible web-based portals under open source software licenses. Collaborations with research partners will validate the relevance of these tools to human health and disease, while the dissemination aim will ensure research communities convenient and ongoing access to these innovations. Narrative The interactions of small molecules with proteins are omnipresent throughout cellular processes and of fundamental importance to drug design and disease treatment, yet the task of predicting these interactions brings major challenges because of the heterogeneity and proprietary nature of the data.

"Modeling Emergent Behaviors in Systems Biology: A Biological Physics Approach Project Summary Biology is full of stunning examples of emergent behaviors – behaviors that arise from, but cannot be reduced to, the interactions of the constituent parts that make up the system under consideration. These behaviors span the full spectrum of length scales, from the emergence of distinct cell fates (e.g. neurons, muscle, etc.) due to the interactions of genes within cells, to the formation of complex ecological communities arising from the interactions of thousands of species. The overarching goal of my research is to develop new conceptual, theoretical, and computational tools to model such emergent, system-level behaviors in biology. To do so, we utilize an interdisciplinary approach that is grounded in Biological Physics, but draws heavily from Machine Learning, Information Theory, and Theoretical Ecology. Our work is unified and distinguished by our deep commitment to integrating theory with the vast amount of biological data now being generated by modern DNA sequencing-based techniques and quantitative microscopy. An important goal of the proposed research is to find common concepts and tools that transcend traditional biological sub-disciplines and models systems. The proposed research pursues four distinct but conceptually interrelated research directions: (1) understanding how distinct cell fates emerge from bimolecular interactions within mammalian cells (2) investigating how bimolecular networks within cells exploit energy consumption to improve computations, with applications to Synthetic Biology; (3) identifying the ecological principles governing community assembly in microbial communities and developing techniques for synthetically engineering ecological communities; and (4) developing new machine learning algorithms and techniques for biological data analysis. In addition to developing physics-based models for diverse biological phenomena, the proposed research will yield a series of practical important tools and algorithms which we will make publically available including: (1) a new linear-algebra based algorithm for assessing the fidelity of directed differentiation and cellular reprogramming protocols and visualizing reprogramming/differentiation dynamics and (2) improved algorithms for inferring microbial interactions in the human microbiome from high-throughput sequence data. These computational tools will allow scientists to realize the immense therapeutic potential of cellular reprogramming and microbial ecology-based techniques for studying and treating human disease.

"Computational Explorations of Unconventional Approaches to Control Noncovalent Interactions PROJECT SUMMARY The research interests of my group are rooted in explorations of new and useful conceptual models to improve the control and prediction of noncovalent interactions. Our research involves the use of a variety of computational quantum chemical tools, applications of density functional theory (DFT), cheminformatics, and machine-learning methods. A premise of our research is that aromaticity may be used to modulate many types of noncovalent interactions (such as hydrogen bonding, π-stacking, anion-π interactions). The reciprocal relationship we find, between “aromaticity” in molecules and the strengths of “noncovalent interactions,” is surprising especially since they are typically considered as largely separate ideas in chemistry. The innovation of this research is that it will enable use of intuitive “back-of-the-envelope” electron-counting rules (such as the 4n+2πe Hückel rule for aromaticity) to make predictions of experimental outcomes regarding the impact of noncovalent interactions. A five-year goal is to realize the use of our conceptual models in real synthetic examples prepared by our experimental collaborators. My research vision is to bridge discoveries of innovative concepts to their practical impacts for biomedical and biomolecular research. PROJECT NARRATIVE This research proposal includes four projects that are jointly motivated by the challenge to control and predict noncovalent interactions in organic and biomolecular systems. The proposed work involves applications of a variety of computational quantum chemical tools and synergistic investigations with experimental collaborators. We seek to identify new and useful concepts to guide experimental designs of novel “non-natural” molecular systems (e.g., receptors, biosensors, and hydrogels) that have potential biomedical applications.",Computational Explorations of Unconventional Approaches to Control Noncovalent Interactions,9798401,R35GM133548,"['Anions', 'Back', 'Biosensor', 'Chemicals', 'Chemistry', 'Electrons', 'Experimental Designs', 'Goals', 'Hydrogels', 'Hydrogen Bonding', 'Intuition', 'Investigation', 'Machine Learning', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Outcome', 'Plant Roots', 'Research', 'Research Project Summaries', 'Research Proposals', 'System', 'Vision', 'Work', 'cheminformatics', 'density', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'novel', 'quantum computing', 'receptor', 'theories', 'tool']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF HOUSTON,R35,2019,377200,0.06857005388060812
"Bioinformatics and Chemical Biology Approaches for Identifying Bioactive Natural Products of Symbiotic Actinobacteria Project Summary/Abstract Fungal and bacterial pathogens are a major threat to human health. Few therapeutics exist to treat fungal infections while bacteria are becoming increasingly resistant to existing therapeutics. Humans have been using natural products to treat infections for thousands of years, long before the causal agents of infection were understood. Natural products have continued to be used as therapeutics in the modern age of medicine. Rates of rediscovery of known natural products have increased in traditional sources of natural products, such as soil bacteria. Recently, symbiotic Actinobacteria from insect agricultural systems have been recognized as a promising source of bioactive compounds, especially antifungal agents. These bacteria often produce natural products that defend an insect’s fungal crop from pathogenic fungus. The work proposed here will use chemical biology approaches such as phenotypic interaction screens, genomics, and a new bioinformatics approach to systematically search for bioactive natural products produced by Actinobacteria symbionts and other organisms in insect agricultural systems. The first part of this proposal focuses on using existing techniques to identify new bioactive natural products. Phenotypic interaction screens can identify bioactive natural products by determining if a symbiotic bacteria produces a natural product that inhibits the growth of a fungal pathogen and vice-versa. We will then use genomic sequencing, bioinformatics, and heterologous expression to identify and characterize biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) that are not expressed in the phenotypic interaction screens. The second part of the proposed work involves the use of a new bioinformatics technique to identify interesting bioactive natural products. Existing bioinformatics techniques identify BGCs and predict the most likely chemical structure of the corresponding natural product. However, they do not conclude anything concerning the functional role that the natural product plays. The technique developed here will use machine learning to predict the function that the natural product fulfills in the ecological context of the organism. This algorithm will facilitate the identification of bioactive natural products with therapeutically relevant functions. Project Narrative Fungal infections are an underappreciated threat to human health with high mortality rates and few effective therapeutic agents for treatment. Symbiotic Actinobacteria from insect agricultural systems are a promising source of antifungal agents since they often produce natural products with antifungal activity protecting an insect’s fungal crop from pathogenic fungus. The work proposed here will use phenotypic interaction screens, genome sequencing, and the development of a novel bioinformatics method to systematically mine Actinobacteria for antifungal and antibacterial products – leading to the discovery of new bioactive small molecules along with a deeper understanding of how natural products mediate the interaction between species in insect agricultural systems.",Bioinformatics and Chemical Biology Approaches for Identifying Bioactive Natural Products of Symbiotic Actinobacteria,9716392,F32GM128267,"['Actinobacteria class', 'Age', 'Agriculture', 'Algorithms', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents', 'Antibiotics', 'Antifungal Agents', 'Ants', 'Bacteria', 'Bacterial Antibiotic Resistance', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Breathing', 'Chemical Structure', 'Chemicals', 'Collaborations', 'Computational Biology', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Ecosystem', 'Gene Cluster', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Human', 'Infection', 'Insecta', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modernization', 'Molecular Structure', 'Mycoses', 'Natural Products', 'Organism', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Public Health', 'Resistance', 'Role', 'Soil', 'Source', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'bioactive natural products', 'drug discovery', 'fungus', 'genetic information', 'genome sequencing', 'human disease', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mortality', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'pathogenic bacteria', 'pathogenic fungus', 'post-doctoral training', 'prediction algorithm', 'small molecule', 'symbiont']",NIGMS,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,F32,2019,61226,0.0326821741365368
"Selective Whole Genome Amplification - Enabling Microbial Population Genomics Microbial population genetic research has been crucial for understanding pathogen dynamics, virulence, host specificity, and many other topics; in many cases uncovering unexpected and transformative biological processes. However, conventional population genetic analyses are limited by the quantity of sequence data from each sample. The temporal, spatial, and evolutionary resolution of techniques that rely on single gene sequences or multi-locus sequence typing are often insufficient to study biological processes on fine scales, precisely the scales at which many evolutionary and mechanistic process occur. Population genomics offers a vast quantity of sequence information for inferring evolutionary and ecological processes on very fine spatial and temporal scales, inferences that are critical to understanding and eventually controlling many infectious diseases. The promise of population genomics is tempered, however, by difficulties in isolating and preparing microbes for next-generation sequencing. We have developed the selective whole genome amplification (SWGA) technology to sequence microbial genomes from complex biological specimens without relying on labor-intensive laboratory culture, even if the focal microbial genome constitutes only a miniscule fraction of the natural sample. The primary hindrance to popular adoption of SWGA for microbial genomic studies is not its effectiveness in producing samples suitable for next-generation sequencing but in the upfront investment needed to develop an effective protocol to amplify the genome of a specific microbial species. Identifying an SWGA protocol that consistently results in selective and even amplification across the target genome is currently hindered by computationally-inefficient software that can evaluate a very limited set of the potentially effective solutions. Further, this software uses marginally-effective optimality criteria as there is currently only a limited understanding of the true criteria that result in highly-selective and even amplification of a target genome. As a result, SWGA protocol development is currently costly in both time and resources. A primary goal of the proposed research is to identify the criteria that result in optimal SWGA by analyzing next- generation sequencing data with advanced machine learning techniques. These optimality criteria will be integrated into a freely-available, computationally-efficient swga development program that will reduce the upfront investment in SWGA protocol development, thus allowing researchers to address medically- and biologically-important questions in any microbial species. In the near term, this project will also generate effective SWGA protocols for four microbial species which can be used immediately to address fundamental questions in evolutionary biology, disease progression, and emerging infectious disease dynamics. From a global disease perspective, this work is imperative as the majority of microbial species cannot easily be cultured and are in danger of becoming bystanders in the genomics revolution that is currently elucidating evolutionary processes and molecular mechanisms in cultivable microbial species. Addressing many of the major outstanding questions about pathogen evolution will require analyses of populations of microbial genomes. Although population genomic studies would provide the analytical resolution to investigate evolutionary and mechanistic processes on fine spatial and temporal scales – precisely the scales at which these processes occur – microbial population genomic research is currently hindered by the practicalities of obtaining sufficient quantities of genomes to analyze. We propose to develop an innovative, cost-effective, practical, and publically-available technology to collect sufficient quantities of microbial genomic DNA necessary for next-generation microbial genome sequencing.",Selective Whole Genome Amplification - Enabling Microbial Population Genomics,9699440,R21AI137433,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Characteristics', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Coupling', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Effectiveness', 'Emerging Communicable Diseases', 'Evolution', 'Foundations', 'Genes', 'Genetic Research', 'Genome', 'Genomic DNA', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Investigation', 'Investments', 'Laboratory culture', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Metaphor', 'Methods', 'Microbe', 'Microbial Genome Sequencing', 'Microsatellite Repeats', 'Molecular', 'Organism', 'Population', 'Population Analysis', 'Population Genetics', 'Process', 'Program Development', 'Protocols documentation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Shapes', 'Specificity', 'Specimen', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Virulence', 'Work', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'design', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic approach', 'host-microbe interactions', 'improved', 'innovation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'microbial', 'microbial genome', 'next generation', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'prevent', 'protocol development', 'vector', 'whole genome']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R21,2019,186101,0.012702013898622693
"Computational Studies of Virus-host Interactions Using Metagenomics Data and Applications Computational Studies of Virus-host Interactions Using Metagenomics Data and Applications Summary: Viruses are ubiquitous in almost every ecological environment including the human body, water, soil, etc. They play important roles in the normal function of human microbiome. Many viruses have been shown to be associated with human diseases. However, our understanding of the roles of viruses in ecological communities is very limited. Recent technological and computational advances make it possible to have a deep understanding of the roles of viruses in public health and the environment. Metagenomics studies from various environments including the human microbiome projects (HMP), global ocean, and the earth microbiome projects have generated large amounts of short read data. Viruses are present in most of these metagenomic data sets and their hosts are unknown. In this proposal, the investigators will develop computational approaches for the identification of viral sequences from metagenomic data sets and for the study of virus-host interactions. For the identification of viral sequences from metagenomics samples, novel statistical measures using word patterns will first be developed. Second, a unified naïve Bayesian integrative approach by combining information from word patterns, gene directionality, and gene annotation will be studied. Third, the identified viral sequences from metagenomes will be further assembled to construct complete viral genomes using a novel binning approach to be developed by the investigators. Finally, the remaining reads will be assigned to the corresponding bins. For the study of virus- host interactions, computational methods to estimate the reliability of virus-host interactions from high-throughput experiments will first be developed. Then machine learning approaches will be developed to predict viruses infecting certain hosts. Finally, a network logistic regression approach will be developed to predict virus-host interactions. These computational approaches for the identification of viral sequences and for predicting virus-host interactions will be applied to a public liver cirrhosis and a unique metagenomics data set to understand how metagenomes change with health status, identify viruses and virus-host interactions associated with disease status and accurately predict disease status using bacteria, viruses and virus-host interactions. The developed computational methods will also be used to analyze metageomic data from various locations based on the TARA ocean data and a unique time series data to understand how environmental factors affect virus abundance and virus-host interactions. Some of the predictions will be experimentally validated. Software derived from the proposal will be developed and freely distributed to the scientific community.

"Computational Studies of Virus-host Interactions Using Metagenomics Data and Applications Computational Studies of Virus-host Interactions Using Metagenomics Data and Applications Summary: Viruses are ubiquitous in almost every ecological environment including the human body, water, soil, etc. They play important roles in the normal function of human microbiome. Many viruses have been shown to be associated with human diseases. However, our understanding of the roles of viruses in ecological communities is very limited. Recent technological and computational advances make it possible to have a deep understanding of the roles of viruses in public health and the environment. Metagenomics studies from various environments including the human microbiome projects (HMP), global ocean, and the earth microbiome projects have generated large amounts of short read data. Viruses are present in most of these metagenomic data sets and their hosts are unknown. In this proposal, the investigators will develop computational approaches for the identification of viral sequences from metagenomic data sets and for the study of virus-host interactions. For the identification of viral sequences from metagenomics samples, novel statistical measures using word patterns will first be developed. Second, a unified naïve Bayesian integrative approach by combining information from word patterns, gene directionality, and gene annotation will be studied. Third, the identified viral sequences from metagenomes will be further assembled to construct complete viral genomes using a novel binning approach to be developed by the investigators. Finally, the remaining reads will be assigned to the corresponding bins. For the study of virus- host interactions, computational methods to estimate the reliability of virus-host interactions from high-throughput experiments will first be developed. Then machine learning approaches will be developed to predict viruses infecting certain hosts. Finally, a network logistic regression approach will be developed to predict virus-host interactions. These computational approaches for the identification of viral sequences and for predicting virus-host interactions will be applied to a public liver cirrhosis and a unique metagenomics data set to understand how metagenomes change with health status, identify viruses and virus-host interactions associated with disease status and accurately predict disease status using bacteria, viruses and virus-host interactions. The developed computational methods will also be used to analyze metageomic data from various locations based on the TARA ocean data and a unique time series data to understand how environmental factors affect virus abundance and virus-host interactions. Some of the predictions will be experimentally validated. Software derived from the proposal will be developed and freely distributed to the scientific community.

"A platform for mining, visualization and design of microbial interaction networks Project Summary One of the burning questions in the study of the human microbiome is whether and how it is possible to design specific strategies for rebalancing the taxonomic and functional properties of human-associated microbial communities, triggering the transition from “disease states” to “healthy states”. While empirical studies provide strong support for the idea that we may be able to cure, or at least  treat, a number of diseases by simply transplanting microbiomes, or inducing changes through taxonomic or environmental perturbations, to date little mechanistic understanding exists on how microbial communities work, and on how to extend microbiome research from an empirical science to a systematic, quantitative field of biomedicine. We propose here to establish a computational platform--   a database (Aim 1) with fully integrated analytical software (Aims 2 and 3) --- developed for and with the cooperation of the scientific community. The resource goes beyond cataloguing microbial abundances under different condition; its aim is to enable an understanding of networks of interacting species and their condition-dependence, with the goal of eventually facilitating disease diagnosis and prognosis, and designing therapeutic strategies for microbiome intervention. Our project is centered around three key aims: 1.	The creation of a Microbial Interaction Network Database (MIND), a public resource that will collect data on inter-species interactions from metagenomic sequencing projects, computer simulations and direct experiments. This database will be accessed through a web-based platform complemented with tools for microbial interaction network analysis and visualization, akin to highly fruitful tools previously developed for the study of genetic networks; the database will also serve as the public repository of microbial networks associated with human diseases; 2.	The implementation of an integrated tool for simulation of interspecies interactions under different environments, based on genomic data and whole-cell models of metabolism; 3.	The implementation of new algorithms for microbial community analysis and engineering. These algorithms, including stoichiometric, machine-learning and statistical approaches will facilitate a “synthetic ecology” approach to help design strategies (e.g. microbial transplants or probiotic mixtures) for preventing and targeting microbiome-associated diseases. Our work will fill a major gap in current microbiome research, creating the first platform for global microbial interaction data integration, mining and computation. Project Narrative Among the major developments of the genomic revolution has been the ability to identify thousands of microbial species and strains living in communities in 5 major habitats in the human body, and the recognition that the relative abundances of these populations is strongly correlated with environment: disease state, diet, treatment protocol and so on. A major challenge in utilizing the deluge of health relevant data is structuring it into a database that facilitates understanding inter-microbial interactions in these communities. The aim of this proposal is to create a database and integrated computational platform, open to and contributed to by the research community, which will greatly accelerate the conversion of data into health related actionable knowledge.","A platform for mining, visualization and design of microbial interaction networks",9638561,R01GM121950,"['Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Cataloging', 'Catalogs', 'Cell model', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Diet', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Ecology', 'Ecosystem', 'Empirical Research', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Evolution', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genetic study', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Habitats', 'Health', 'Human Biology', 'Human Microbiome', 'Human body', 'Imagery', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurable', 'Mediating', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Microbe', 'Mining', 'Nature', 'Online Systems', 'Organism', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pattern', 'Population', 'Preventive Medicine', 'Probiotics', 'Property', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Structure', 'Taxonomy', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Transplantation', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Work', 'base', 'computational platform', 'computer framework', 'data integration', 'data to knowledge', 'design', 'disease diagnosis', 'experimental study', 'feeding', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'human disease', 'human microbiota', 'metagenomic sequencing', 'microbial', 'microbial community', 'microbiome', 'microbiome research', 'microbiota transplantation', 'microorganism interaction', 'novel diagnostics', 'novel therapeutics', 'open source', 'outcome forecast', 'prevent', 'repository', 'simulation', 'tool', 'user-friendly']",NIGMS,BOSTON UNIVERSITY (CHARLES RIVER CAMPUS),R01,2019,364865,0.07629413771620257
"Automated, model-guided phenotyping to identify metabolite/gene/microbe interactions Project Summary/Abstract DNA sequencing has spawned the “microbiome revolution” -- thousands of microbes and a dizzying number of microbial interactions that are associated with human health and disease. Unfortunately, most species in the microbiome are known only by a (partial) genome. The limited phenotypic data on newly discovered bacteria reveal species that behave unlike any of our model organisms. While genome-scale modeling plays an important role in understanding the microbiome, the paucity of phenotypic data for most species prevents detailed simulation of the microbial communities that affect our health. This project will develop an automated system for profiling, synthesizing, and modeling microbial communities. The center of our approach is Deep Phenotyping, an automated robotic platform that performs complex growth experiments on demand. Data from Deep Phenotyping will be used to train metabolic and statistical models of the oral pathogens Streptococcus mutans and Candida albicans to predict conditions that keep both microbes in a nonpathogenic state. Project Narrative The microbiome revolution has uncovered thousands of species of bacteria with roles in health and disease. This project automates the identification of interactions between environments, genes, and the microbes that live in and around us. Understanding these interactions is a critical step in re-engineering the microbiome to improve human health.","Automated, model-guided phenotyping to identify metabolite/gene/microbe interactions",9651956,R21EB027396,"['Affect', 'Animal Model', 'Antibiotics', 'Area', 'Bacteria', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Candida albicans', 'Carbon', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Collaborations', 'Combinatorics', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'DNA sequencing', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Exposure to', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Human', 'Human Microbiome', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Knock-out', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Microbe', 'Microbiology', 'Modeling', 'Oral', 'Oral candidiasis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Regulator Genes', 'Research Personnel', 'Robotics', 'Role', 'Shapes', 'Source', 'Statistical Models', 'Streptococcus mutans', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Work', 'base', 'combinatorial', 'cost', 'design', 'dysbiosis', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'fitness', 'fungus', 'genome-wide', 'improved', 'instrumentation', 'metabolomics', 'microbial', 'microbial community', 'microbiome', 'microorganism interaction', 'network models', 'open source', 'oral pathogen', 'pathogenic fungus', 'phenotypic data', 'preference', 'prevent', 'screening', 'simulation', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transposon sequencing']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT URBANA-CHAMPAIGN,R21,2019,219161,0.07522692958137435
"Joint Analysis of Microbiome and Other Genomic Data Types PROJECT SUMMARY In the same way that the human genome project created invaluable genomic maps, the objective of this project is to develop methods for eventual construction of comprehensive genetic and metabolomic by microbome relationship maps. Such maps would be an invaluable resource for improving our understanding as to the underlying mechanisms by which microbes and –omics features influence human diseases and conditions, potentially leading to identification of novel therapeutic targets. To these ends, this proposal seeks to develop statistical and computational tools for mapping associations and interactions between microbes and other – omic features and for further utilizing other –omics to improve microbiome based prediction models. Specifically, motivated by studies examining the role of the vaginal microbiome and other –omics in birth outcomes and menopause, we aim to develop statistical methodology for (1) mapping genetic variants that influence microbiome composition so as to understand the innate component of the microbiome as well as learn mechanisms by which genetics influence outcomes; (2) creating global metabolic maps integrating both microbes and metabolites which will enable understanding of how perturbations might influence the system and identify key pathways for therapeutic target; (3) exploiting other –omics in constructing more accurate microbiome based prediction models for preterm birth; (4) developing, distributing and supporting software packages for the proposed methods. The methods are based on frameworks in which we have considerable experience, but novel technical contributions are made to accommodate features of the data such as population stratification and relatedness in genetics, phylogenetic structure, and compositionality, as well as practical considerations such as availability of samples and other –omics data. Consequently, these new methods have the potential for accelerating mechanistic and translational microbiome studies, developing vital resources for enabling systematic achievement of many biological, clinical, and public health problems that have eluded researchers for decades. PROJECT NARRATIVE The methods developed in this proposal will enable improved understanding of the interactions between microbes and other –omics, thus aiding in elucidation of the mechanisms by which microbes and –omic features influence health outcomes and aiding in identification of potential molecular targets.

"Predicting and analyzing variation in cellular interactomes Project Summary Over the last two decades, significant experimental efforts have determined large sets of “reference” interactions for humans and other model organisms, along with substantial knowledge about the binding specificities of proteins, including for a large fraction of human transcription factors (TFs). The resulting data have proven to be an incredibly useful resource for understanding how cells function; nevertheless, they do not capture how molecular interactions and networks are different from the reference across individuals. Indeed, while human genomes in both healthy and disease populations are rapidly being sequenced, the corresponding individual-specific interaction networks remain largely unexamined; this represents a major gap in our knowledge, as mutations that alter molecular interactions underlie a wide range of human diseases. Further, the substantial amount of genetic variation across populations makes it infeasible in the near term to experimentally determine per-individual interaction networks. Thus our long-term goal is to develop computational methods to uncover whether and how mutations within coding and non-coding portions of the genome perturb cellular interactions and networks. Our specific aims are: (1) We will develop computational structure-based approaches to identify and catalog, at proteome-scale, variations within proteins that are likely to impact their ability to bind with DNA, RNA, small molecules, peptides or ions, thereby providing a comprehensive resource for analyzing protein interaction variation. (2) We will develop novel structure-based and probabilistic methods to predict how DNA-binding specificities are altered when a TF is mutated; since mutated TFs have been linked to numerous diseases, this will be a great aid in understanding disease networks and pathology. (3) We will develop new methods to uncover non-coding somatic mutations that alter human regulatory networks in cancer; this is a critical step towards ultimately uncovering patient-specific cancer networks. Overall by pursuing these aims—which integrate mutational information with existing knowledge about reference interactions, interfaces and specificities—we will develop novel computational methods that will significantly advance our understanding of molecular interactions perturbed in disease and healthy contexts. Narrative The proposed research will yield new software tools that predict whether specific genetic mutations alter molecular interactions and networks. Since many human diseases are caused by mutations that affect molecular interactions, this research will expand our understanding of the underlying basis of disease and will provide new avenues for diagnosis and treatment.",Predicting and analyzing variation in cellular interactomes,9740714,R01GM076275,"['Affect', 'Alleles', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animal Model', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Binding Sites', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Catalogs', 'Cell physiology', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'DNA', 'DNA Binding', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'DNA-Protein Interaction', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Internet', 'Ions', 'Knowledge', 'Ligand Binding', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Mutagenesis', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'Organism', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Peptides', 'Play', 'Population', 'Property', 'Protein Analysis', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'RNA', 'Regulator Genes', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Site', 'Software Tools', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'Work', 'Zinc Fingers', 'base', 'cancer genome', 'disease-causing mutation', 'experimental study', 'human disease', 'improved', 'interest', 'knowledge base', 'learning strategy', 'novel', 'predictive tools', 'preference', 'small molecule', 'software development', 'transcription factor', 'tumor', 'virtual']",NIGMS,PRINCETON UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,312660,0.03834168408704729
"Natural Product-Drug Interaction Research: The Roadmap to Best Practices ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): As natural products (NP) sales increase, the risk of adverse NP-drug interactions (NPDIs) increases, yet the pharmacokinetic (PK) elucidation and clinical relevance of putative NPDIs remain elusive. Assessing the risk of NPDIs is more challenging than that of drug-drug interactions (DDIs), often due to relatively scant PK knowledge of individual NP constituents that perpetrate these interactions. The proposed U54 Center will develop a roadmap for NPDI research through a series of well-designed human in vitro and in vivo studies (termed Interaction Projects) on 4-6 priority NPs that pose a potential risk for clinically relevant NPDIs. A repository will be developed for the data generated from the Interaction Projects, and results will be communicated to various target audiences through a public portal. This U54 Center is composed of an accomplished team of investigators, including pharmacokineticists with expertise in NPDIs, complemented by expertise in NP chemistry, DDIs, and health information communication. In collaboration with the Steering Committee, an innovative strategy that combines a mechanistic approach with practical considerations (e.g., popularity of the NPs) will be used to select and prioritize 4-6 NPs for further investigation in te Interaction Projects. Mechanistic aspects include curated clinical NDPI data from the widely used Drug Interaction Database (DIDB) of the Informatics Core, structural alerts, and compelling preliminary clinical and in silico NPDI data. Once selected, the NPs will be entered into a Decision Tree for assessment of NPDI liability and probable significance of interactions with victim drugs. In parallel, the Pharmacology Core will develop detailed Statements of Work for the human in vitro and in vivo studies - while the Analytical Core will source, acquire, and characterize the selected NPs - for the Interaction Projects. Upon completion of each project, the Analytical Core will analyze the PK samples, and the Pharmacology Core will develop physiologically-based PK models for further assessment of the clinical relevance of the Interaction Project results. Throughout these projects, the Informatics Core will create a data repository embedded within a public portal web-based application named, NaPDI app, for Natural Product-Drug Interaction application. The repository, built using the DIDB framework, will allow researchers to access both raw data and summarized results. The U54 Center will also develop and share Best Practices recommended for the conduct of NPDI studies, based on the experience with and results from the Interaction Projects, with the research communities via the public portal. Effective dissemination of the Interaction Project results will be ensured through user experience and brand content studies with target audiences - researchers/practitioners and lay public - to refine the public portal content.

"Probing transcriptional activation at the molecular level Project abstract Much of the assembly process of the transcription machinery is governed by transient and dynamic protein‐ protein interactions (PPIs) that defy standard characterization strategies. Transcriptional coactivators are the hubs of this process, interacting with transcriptional activators, epigenetic modulators, the polymerase, and other coactivators to assemble the transcriptional machine. Coactivators also represent a central molecular recognition conundrum, as the mechanisms by which they interact with such a diverse array with binding partners and the influence of local binding interactions on longer‐range structural and functional trajectories. In the previous funding period, we developed a molecular recognition model that addresses the first part of the conundrum. Here will build on this model to discover allosteric modulators of coactivators previously labelled undruggable despite their central functional roles. Additionally, we will answer the latter half of the conundrum to develop a comprehensive model of molecular recognition in transcriptional coactivator function. Project narrative Transcription is dysregulated in every human disease as either a cause or an effect and as such represents a potentially powerful intervention point for therapeutics; a significant impediment to progress are the many questions regarding the complex network of protein‐protein interactions that regulates this process. In this research plan we implement a combination of chemical biology tools and approaches to define key binding interactions and conformational changes that produce function in vitro and in cells. In doing so, we will discover new opportunities for drug discovery, with a particular focus on transcriptional pathways integral to metabolic disease and cancer.",Probing transcriptional activation at the molecular level,9840248,R01GM065330,"['Acids', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Ataxia', 'Binding', 'Biology', 'Biophysics', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Complex', 'Cryoelectron Microscopy', 'Data', 'Deuterium', 'Disease', 'EP300 gene', 'Electron Microscopy', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Family', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Homeostasis', 'Hydrogen', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Label', 'Length', 'Ligands', 'Lipids', 'MED25 gene', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mediating', 'Metabolic Diseases', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Chaperones', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Negative Staining', 'Nuclear Receptors', 'Organism', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Peptides', 'Play', 'Polymerase', 'Process', 'Regulation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Structural Models', 'Structure', 'TP53 gene', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Transcription Coactivator', 'Transcription Process', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Transcriptional Activation Domain', 'Up-Regulation', 'biophysical techniques', 'drug discovery', 'flexibility', 'human disease', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'machine learning algorithm', 'molecular modeling', 'molecular recognition', 'peptidomimetics', 'prediction algorithm', 'protein protein interaction', 'screening', 'small molecule', 'tool']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2019,440078,0.0036575931877147194
"Precision Medicine in Sarcoidosis ABSTRACT Sarcoidosis is a systemic inflammatory disease of unknown etiology characterized by non-caseating granulomas in affected organs, primarily in the lungs. Approximately 30% of patients with sarcoidosis progress to debilitating disease; however, the drivers of susceptibility or resilience to disease remain poorly understood. An inflammatory response to an undefined antigen is postulated as the etiology of granuloma formation, and the pathogenesis has been suggested to involve gene-pathogen interaction, yet analysis of single genes or microbes has not proven applicable to diagnosis of all forms of sarcoidosis. Indeed, rather than a single organism, the disease may represent an interaction between the community of organisms that comprise the lung microbiome (community of organisms that live in and on us) and the host immune response. We propose that understanding the microbiome/host interaction will suggest strategies for precision medicine approaches to sarcoidosis. This proposal addresses this significant gap by investigating interactions between the lung microbiome, host immune and clinical responses in sarcoidosis using multiomics approaches – a critically innovative strategy. Our preliminary data support our novel hypotheses. First, we identified distinct lung microbiomes that differentiated patients with sarcoidosis versus controls. Second, our results identified biomarkers of disease severity that were associated with decreased lung function. Third, a recurrent analytic theme that emerged, regardless of the type of -omic analysis, was that sarcoidosis is characterized by pathways related to apoptosis and autophagy, which is consistent with our observation of decreased abundance of peripheral lymphocytes and functional immune anergy. These data led us to our Overall Hypothesis: Lung microbiome and host immune interactions characterized by apoptosis and autophagy pathways influence sarcoidosis clinical course. This hypothesis will be tested by an observational prospective and validation study of sarcoidosis patients at 5 time points to facilitate time series analyses. Aims 1 and 2 focus on lung microbiome or host immune responses, respectively, in relation to clinical course of sarcoidosis. Using these data in Aim 3, predictive models will be constructed based on integrated data of metagenomic and host-immune interactions. The novelty and significance of our multiomics strategy is to construct models for precision medicine therapies to harness bioinformatic strategies into focused, patient-specific approaches. The long-term significance of this study is to define pathways for sarcoidosis progression or resolution, and to develop database of these findings to further develop more precise, testable, models. PROJECT NARRATIVE Sarcoidosis is a disease of unknown etiology that predominately affects the lung and may affect other organs. We propose to construct a model to predict sarcoidosis progression or resolution by identifying microbial and immune interactions.

"Continuous Probing of Nanoconstruct-Cell Interactions at Biologically Relevant Time Scales PROJECT SUMMARY  This proposal aims to develop live-cell, multi-channel imaging tools that can visualize—continuously, and in real time—nanoparticle interactions with cellular components. We will focus on several different time windows, where early time periods will monitor nanoparticle-cell membrane binding and uptake and later times will track endosomal accumulation and escape. The ability to resolve temporally and spatially how particle size/shape and ligand density affects interactions in 3D is critical for determining structure-activity-relationships and mechanism of action in live cells. To characterize interactions of functional nanoparticles with different cellular structures at physiologically relevant times, we propose to design a multi-channel optical microscope integrated with an opto- splitter and custom live-cell imaging chamber. Simultaneous images can be acquired in different channels of the fluorescence of dye-labeled organelles and dye-labeled ligands on the particles as well as differential interference contrast (DIC) signals of whole cells, cellular components, and nanoparticle cores. Correlation of structural and functional images provides a powerful window into how local nanoconstruct interactions can mediate a biological response. For model systems, we will compare gold nanoconstructs with oligonucleotide ligand shells of both targeting (DNA aptamers) or non-targeting (siRNA) properties. Nanoparticle shape enables a unique handle to probe rotation and orientation of intracellular particle interactions. This work can bridge a gap in understanding the behavior of nanoconstructs intracellularly and how the integrity and presentation of oligonucleotides in ligand shells affects targeting and other processes such as endosomal escape, which is critical to assess therapeutic efficacy. RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH  This proposal aims to design tools that can visualize nanoparticle interactions with cells at distinct time points with biological relevance. Our ultimate goal is to evaluate how nanoconstructs interact with cellular membranes and sub-cellular components.

"Evidence Extraction Systems for the Molecular Interaction Literature Burns, Gully A. Abstract  In primary research articles, scientists make claims based on evidence from experiments, and report both the claims and the supporting evidence in the results section of papers. However, biomedical databases de- scribe the claims made by scientists in detail, but rarely provide descriptions of any supporting evidence that a consulting scientist could use to understand why the claims are being made. Currently, the process of curating evidence into databases is manual, time-consuming and expensive; thus, evidence is recorded in papers but not generally captured in database systems. For example, the European Bioinformatics Institute's INTACT database describes how different molecules biochemically interact with each other in detail. They characterize the under- lying experiment providing the evidence of that interaction with only two hierarchical variables: a code denoting the method used to detect the molecular interaction and another code denoting the method used to detect each molecule. In fact, INTACT describes 94 different types of interaction detection method that could be used in conjunction with other experimental methodological processes that can be used in a variety of different ways to reveal different details about the interaction. This crucial information is not being captured in databases. Although experimental evidence is complex, it conforms to certain principles of experimental design: experimentally study- ing a phenomenon typically involves measuring well-chosen dependent variables whilst altering the values of equally well-chosen independent variables. Exploiting these principles has permitted us to devise a preliminary, robust, general-purpose representation for experimental evidence. In this project, We will use this representation to describe the methods and data pertaining to evidence underpinning the interpretive assertions about molecular interactions described by INTACT. A key contribution of our project is that we will develop methods to extract this evidence from scientiﬁc papers automatically (A) by using image processing on a speciﬁc subtype of ﬁgure that is common in molecular biology papers and (B) by using natural language processing to read information from the text used by scientists to describe their results. We will develop these tools for the INTACT repository but package them so that they may then also be used for evidence pertaining to other areas of research in biomedicine. Burns, Gully A. Narrative  Molecular biology databases contain crucial information for the study of human disease (especially cancer), but they omit details of scientiﬁc evidence. Our work will provide detailed accounts of experimental evidence supporting claims pertaining to the study of these diseases. This additional detail may provide scientists with more powerful ways of detecting anomalies and resolving contradictory ﬁndings.",Evidence Extraction Systems for the Molecular Interaction Literature,9543557,R01LM012592,"['Area', 'Binding', 'Biochemical', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Burn injury', 'Classification', 'Co-Immunoprecipitations', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Consult', 'Data', 'Data Reporting', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Disease', 'Engineering', 'European', 'Event', 'Experimental Designs', 'Experimental Models', 'Gel', 'Goals', 'Grain', 'Graph', 'Image', 'Informatics', 'Institutes', 'Intelligence', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Biology', 'Molecular Weight', 'Names', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Paper', 'Pattern', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Privatization', 'Process', 'Protein Structure Initiative', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publications', 'Reading', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Scientist', 'Source Code', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Taxonomy', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'Typology', 'Western Blotting', 'Work', 'base', 'data modeling', 'experimental study', 'human disease', 'image processing', 'learning strategy', 'open source', 'optical character recognition', 'protein protein interaction', 'repository', 'software systems', 'text searching', 'tool']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,R01,2018,264277,0.02348547132391309
"Bayesian Machine Learning Tools for Analyzing Microbiome Dynamics The human microbiota plays an important role in health and disease, and its therapeutic manipulation is being actively investigated for a wide range of diseases that span every NIH institute. Our microbiota are inherently dynamic, and analyzing these time-dependent properties is key to robustly linking the microbiota to disease, and predicting the effects of therapies targeting the microbiota; indeed, longitudinal microbiome data is being acquired with increasing frequency, and is a major component of many NIH-funded projects. However, there is currently a dearth of computational tools for analyzing microbiome time-series data, which presents several special challenges including high measurement noise, irregular and sparse temporal sampling, and complex dependencies between variables. The objective of this proposal is to introduce new capabilities, improve on, and provide state-of-the-art implementations of tools for analyzing dynamics, or patterns of change in microbiome time-series data. The tools we develop will use Bayesian machine learning methods, which are well-recognized for their strong conceptual and practical advantages, particularly in biomedical domains. Tools will be rigorously tested and validated on synthetic and real human microbiome data, including publicly available datasets and those from collaborators providing 16S rRNA sequencing, metagenomic, and metabolomics data. We propose three specific aims. For Aim 1, we will develop integrated Bayesian machine learning tools for predicting population dynamics of the microbiome and its responses to perturbations. These tools will include a new model that simultaneously learns groups of microbes with similar interaction structure and predicts their behavior over time, and that incorporates prior phylogenetic information. The model will be further improved by incorporating stochastic microbial dynamics and errors in measurements throughout the model. For Aim 2, we will develop Bayesian machine learning tools to predict host status from microbiome dynamics. The tools will learn easily interpretable, human-readable rules that predict host status from microbiome time-series data, and will be further extended to handle a variety of longitudinal study designs. For Aim 3, we will engineer our microbiome dynamics analysis software tools for optimal performance, ease-of- use, maintainability, extensibility, and dissemination to the community. In total, the proposed work will yield a suite of contemporary software tools for analyzing microbiome dynamics, with expected broad use and major impact. The software will allow investigators to answer important scientific and translational questions about the microbiome, including discovering which microbial taxa or their metagenomes are affected over time by perturbations such as changes in diet or invasion by pathogens; predicting the effects of these perturbations over time, including changes in composition or stability of the gut microbiota; and finding temporal signatures in multi-‘omic microbiome data that predict disease risk in the human host. The human microbiota, or collection of micro-organisms living on and within us, plays an important role in health, and when disrupted or abnormal, may contribute to many types of diseases including infections, kidney diseases, bowel diseases, diabetes, heart diseases, arthritis, allergies, brain diseases, and cancer. Sophisticated computer-based tools are needed to make sense of human microbiota data, particularly time- series data, which can yield important insights into how our microbiomes change over time. This work will develop new and improved computer-based tools for analyzing microbiota time-series data, which will be made freely available and will enable scientists to increase our fundamental knowledge about how our microbiota affect us and ultimately to apply this knowledge to prevent and treat human illnesses.",Bayesian Machine Learning Tools for Analyzing Microbiome Dynamics,9640012,R01GM130777,"['16S ribosomal RNA sequencing', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Antibiotics', 'Arthritis', 'Autoimmunity', 'Behavior', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Models', 'Brain Diseases', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Childhood', 'Clostridium difficile', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dependence', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diet', 'Disease', 'Engineering', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Health', 'Heart Diseases', 'Human', 'Human Microbiome', 'Hypersensitivity', 'Infection', 'Institutes', 'Intervention', 'Intestines', 'Investigation', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Medical', 'Metagenomics', 'Microbe', 'Modeling', 'Names', 'Noise', 'Oligosaccharides', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phylogenetic Analysis', 'Play', 'Population Dynamics', 'Property', 'Pythons', 'Readability', 'Recurrence', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Shotguns', 'Software Engineering', 'Software Tools', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Time Series Analysis', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'base', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'disorder risk', 'dynamic system', 'gut microbiota', 'human data', 'human microbiota', 'human subject', 'improved', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'man', 'metabolomics', 'metagenome', 'microbial', 'microbiome', 'microbiome analysis', 'microbiome sequencing', 'microbiota', 'microorganism', 'multiple omics', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'open source', 'pathogen', 'predictive tools', 'prevent', 'response', 'software development', 'targeted treatment', 'tool']",NIGMS,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2018,327382,0.06718728968016723
"Structure based Prediction of the interactome The interactions of small molecules with proteins is not only omnipresent throughout cellular processes, but also of fundamental importance to drug design and disease treatment. Much like with protein-protein and protein-RNA interactions, high-throughput (HTP) experimental methods have led to the generation of enormous volumes of protein-small molecule and related data. However, in addition to sheer scale, high degrees of heterogeneity in these data, combined with proprietary ownership concerns when originating from within industry, present significant challenges to the sharing and full use of this data in basic research and therapeutic development. This proposal aims to develop new mathematical methods that can address not only interpreting the data itself, but also the collaborative and generative process through which researchers work: new cryptographic tools can enable unprecedented forms of secure sharing and collaboration between industry and the public, and deep learning of structural features can reduce the dependence of researchers on prior assumptions as to important predictors of drug-target interactions (DTI).  In our previous granting period, we successfully developed methods for structure-based prediction and HTP data analysis of protein-protein and protein-RNA interactions, uncovering novel biology (e.g., for neurodegenerative diseases). In this renewal, we aim to: 1) develop scalable methods for multi-party computation and differential privacy to enable the secure sharing of large proprietary drug-target interaction databases among industry and public researchers; 2) develop novel integrative machine learning approaches for identifying drug-target interactions based on interactome, molecular structure and chemogenomic data (in collaboration with co-I Jian Peng); and 3) establish innovative collaborations with industry, academia and the scientific community to drive use and adoption of these computational tools and technologies among practicing biomedical researchers.  Successful completion of these aims will provide both public and private research communities with scalable access to technologies for secure sharing of proprietary drug screening data as well as flexible, accurate tools for predicting drug-target interactions. All developed software will be made available via publicly accessible web-based portals under open source software licenses. Collaborations with research partners will validate the relevance of these tools to human health and disease, while the dissemination aim will ensure research communities convenient and ongoing access to these innovations. Narrative The interactions of small molecules with proteins are omnipresent throughout cellular processes and of fundamental importance to drug design and disease treatment, yet the task of predicting these interactions brings major challenges because of the heterogeneity and proprietary nature of the data.

"Adaptive Reproducible High-Dimensional Nonlinear Inference for Big Biological Data Big data is now ubiquitous in every field of modern scientific research. Many contemporary applications, such as the recent national microbiome initiative (NMI), greatly demand highly flexible statistical machine learning methods that can produce both interpretable and reproducible results. Thus, it is of paramount importance to identify crucial causal factors that are responsible for the response from a large number of available covariates, which can be statistically formulated as the false discovery rate (FDR) control in general high-dimensional nonlinear models. Despite the enormous applications of shotgun metagenomic studies, most existing investigations concentrate on the study of bacterial organisms. However, viruses and virus-host interactions play important roles in controlling the functions of the microbial communities. In addition, viruses have been shown to be associated with complex diseases. Yet, investigations into the roles of viruses in human diseases are significantly underdeveloped. The objective of this proposal is to develop mathematically rigorous and computationally efficient approaches to deal with highly complex big data and the applications of these approaches to solve fundamental and important biological and biomedical problems. There are four interrelated aims. In Aim 1, we will theoretically investigate the power of the recently proposed model-free knockoffs (MFK) procedure, which has been theoretically justified to control FDR in arbitrary models and arbitrary dimensions. We will also theoretically justify the robustness of MFK with respect to the misspecification of covariate distribution. These studies will lay the foundations for our developments in other aims. In Aim 2, we will develop deep learning approaches to predict viral contigs with higher accuracy, integrate our new algorithm with MFK to achieve FDR control for virus motif discovery, and investigate the power and robustness of our new procedure. In Aim 3, we will take into account the virus-host motif interactions and adapt our algorithms and theories in Aim 2 for predicting virus-host infectious interaction status. In Aim 4, we will apply the developed methods from the first three aims to analyze the shotgun metagenomics data sets in ExperimentHub to identify viruses and virus-host interactions associated with several diseases at some target FDR level. Both the algorithms and results will be disseminated through the web. The results from this study will be important for metagenomics studies under a variety of environments. Big data is ubiquitous in biological research. Identifying causal factors associated with complex diseases or traits from big data is highly important and challenging. New statistical and computational tools will be developed to control False Discovery Rate (FDR) for molecular sequence data based on the novel model-free knockoffs framework. They will be used to detect sequence motifs for viruses and motif-pairs for virus-host interactions, and to analyze multiple metagenomics data sets related to complex diseases.",Adaptive Reproducible High-Dimensional Nonlinear Inference for Big Biological Data,9674585,R01GM131407,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Archaea', 'Attention', 'Bacteria', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Bypass', 'Cells', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Consult', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Ecosystem', 'Effectiveness', 'Environment', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Gaussian model', 'Genes', 'Genetic Materials', 'Genomics', 'Healthcare', 'Human', 'Internet', 'Investigation', 'Joints', 'Length', 'Linear Regressions', 'Literature', 'Liver Cirrhosis', 'Machine Learning', 'Marines', 'Mathematics', 'Metagenomics', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutation', 'Neurosciences', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Non-linear Models', 'Obesity', 'Organism', 'Performance', 'Planet Earth', 'Play', 'Procedures', 'Reproducibility', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Studies', 'Shotguns', 'Social Sciences', 'Testing', 'Theoretical Studies', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Viral', 'Virus', 'Visualization software', 'Work', 'base', 'biological research', 'computerized tools', 'dark matter', 'deep learning', 'design', 'flexibility', 'high dimensionality', 'human disease', 'human tissue', 'improved', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'metagenomic sequencing', 'microbial community', 'microbiome', 'microbiome research', 'model design', 'model development', 'new technology', 'novel', 'power analysis', 'response', 'simulation', 'theories', 'trait', 'user-friendly', 'virus host interaction', 'virus identification']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,R01,2018,289700,0.042180320064067016
"Modeling Emergent Behaviors in Systems Biology: A Biological Physics Approach Project Summary Biology is full of stunning examples of emergent behaviors – behaviors that arise from, but cannot be reduced to, the interactions of the constituent parts that make up the system under consideration. These behaviors span the full spectrum of length scales, from the emergence of distinct cell fates (e.g. neurons, muscle, etc.) due to the interactions of genes within cells, to the formation of complex ecological communities arising from the interactions of thousands of species. The overarching goal of my research is to develop new conceptual, theoretical, and computational tools to model such emergent, system-level behaviors in biology. To do so, we utilize an interdisciplinary approach that is grounded in Biological Physics, but draws heavily from Machine Learning, Information Theory, and Theoretical Ecology. Our work is unified and distinguished by our deep commitment to integrating theory with the vast amount of biological data now being generated by modern DNA sequencing-based techniques and quantitative microscopy. An important goal of the proposed research is to find common concepts and tools that transcend traditional biological sub-disciplines and models systems. The proposed research pursues four distinct but conceptually interrelated research directions: (1) understanding how distinct cell fates emerge from bimolecular interactions within mammalian cells (2) investigating how bimolecular networks within cells exploit energy consumption to improve computations, with applications to Synthetic Biology; (3) identifying the ecological principles governing community assembly in microbial communities and developing techniques for synthetically engineering ecological communities; and (4) developing new machine learning algorithms and techniques for biological data analysis. In addition to developing physics-based models for diverse biological phenomena, the proposed research will yield a series of practical important tools and algorithms which we will make publically available including: (1) a new linear-algebra based algorithm for assessing the fidelity of directed differentiation and cellular reprogramming protocols and visualizing reprogramming/differentiation dynamics and (2) improved algorithms for inferring microbial interactions in the human microbiome from high-throughput sequence data. These computational tools will allow scientists to realize the immense therapeutic potential of cellular reprogramming and microbial ecology-based techniques for studying and treating human disease.

The developed computational methods will also be used to analyze metageomic data from various locations based on the TARA ocean data and a unique time series data to understand how environmental factors affect virus abundance and virus-host interactions. Some of the predictions will be experimentally validated. Software derived from the proposal will be developed and freely distributed to the scientific community. Project Narrative Viruses are abundant in many environments and are important to public health. New statistical and computational tools will be developed for the identification of viral sequences from metagenomics samples and for the prediction of virus-host interactions. These tools will be used to analyze microbial data sets related to liver cirrhosis and travelers’ diarrhea as well as marine metagenomics data sets from various geographic locations and time series.",Computational Studies of Virus-host Interactions Using Metagenomics Data and Applications,9704539,R01GM120624,"['Affect', 'Bacteria', 'Biological', 'Body Water', 'Cells', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Environment and Public Health', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Functional disorder', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Geographic Locations', 'Health', 'Health Status', 'Human', 'Human Microbiome', 'Human body', 'Liver Cirrhosis', 'Location', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Marines', 'Measures', 'Metagenomics', 'Methods', 'Microbe', 'Network-based', 'Oceans', 'Organism', 'Pattern', 'Planet Earth', 'Play', 'Policies', 'Public Health', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Series', 'Soil', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Traveler&apos', 's diarrhea', 'Viral', 'Viral Genome', 'Virus', 'Virus Diseases', 'Visualization software', 'base', 'computer studies', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'experimental study', 'gut metagenome', 'human disease', 'interest', 'metagenome', 'microbial', 'microbial community', 'microbiome', 'novel', 'particle', 'statistics', 'tool', 'user-friendly', 'virus host interaction']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,R01,2018,57657,0.10203139087067871
"Selective Whole Genome Amplification - Enabling Microbial Population Genomics Microbial population genetic research has been crucial for understanding pathogen dynamics, virulence, host specificity, and many other topics; in many cases uncovering unexpected and transformative biological processes. However, conventional population genetic analyses are limited by the quantity of sequence data from each sample. The temporal, spatial, and evolutionary resolution of techniques that rely on single gene sequences or multi-locus sequence typing are often insufficient to study biological processes on fine scales, precisely the scales at which many evolutionary and mechanistic process occur. Population genomics offers a vast quantity of sequence information for inferring evolutionary and ecological processes on very fine spatial and temporal scales, inferences that are critical to understanding and eventually controlling many infectious diseases. The promise of population genomics is tempered, however, by difficulties in isolating and preparing microbes for next-generation sequencing. We have developed the selective whole genome amplification (SWGA) technology to sequence microbial genomes from complex biological specimens without relying on labor-intensive laboratory culture, even if the focal microbial genome constitutes only a miniscule fraction of the natural sample. The primary hindrance to popular adoption of SWGA for microbial genomic studies is not its effectiveness in producing samples suitable for next-generation sequencing but in the upfront investment needed to develop an effective protocol to amplify the genome of a specific microbial species. Identifying an SWGA protocol that consistently results in selective and even amplification across the target genome is currently hindered by computationally-inefficient software that can evaluate a very limited set of the potentially effective solutions. Further, this software uses marginally-effective optimality criteria as there is currently only a limited understanding of the true criteria that result in highly-selective and even amplification of a target genome. As a result, SWGA protocol development is currently costly in both time and resources. A primary goal of the proposed research is to identify the criteria that result in optimal SWGA by analyzing next- generation sequencing data with advanced machine learning techniques. These optimality criteria will be integrated into a freely-available, computationally-efficient swga development program that will reduce the upfront investment in SWGA protocol development, thus allowing researchers to address medically- and biologically-important questions in any microbial species. In the near term, this project will also generate effective SWGA protocols for four microbial species which can be used immediately to address fundamental questions in evolutionary biology, disease progression, and emerging infectious disease dynamics. From a global disease perspective, this work is imperative as the majority of microbial species cannot easily be cultured and are in danger of becoming bystanders in the genomics revolution that is currently elucidating evolutionary processes and molecular mechanisms in cultivable microbial species. Addressing many of the major outstanding questions about pathogen evolution will require analyses of populations of microbial genomes. Although population genomic studies would provide the analytical resolution to investigate evolutionary and mechanistic processes on fine spatial and temporal scales – precisely the scales at which these processes occur – microbial population genomic research is currently hindered by the practicalities of obtaining sufficient quantities of genomes to analyze. We propose to develop an innovative, cost-effective, practical, and publically-available technology to collect sufficient quantities of microbial genomic DNA necessary for next-generation microbial genome sequencing.",Selective Whole Genome Amplification - Enabling Microbial Population Genomics,9507167,R21AI137433,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Characteristics', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Coupling', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Effectiveness', 'Emerging Communicable Diseases', 'Evolution', 'Foundations', 'Genes', 'Genetic Research', 'Genome', 'Genomic DNA', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Investigation', 'Investments', 'Laboratory culture', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Metaphor', 'Methods', 'Microbe', 'Microbial Genome Sequencing', 'Microsatellite Repeats', 'Molecular', 'Organism', 'Population', 'Population Analysis', 'Population Genetics', 'Process', 'Program Development', 'Protocols documentation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Shapes', 'Specificity', 'Specimen', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Virulence', 'Work', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'design', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic approach', 'host-microbe interactions', 'improved', 'innovation', 'microbial', 'microbial genome', 'next generation', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'prevent', 'protocol development', 'vector', 'whole genome']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R21,2018,242837,0.012702013898622693
"Bioinformatics and Chemical Biology Approaches for Identifying Bioactive Natural Products of Symbiotic Actinobacteria Project Summary/Abstract Fungal and bacterial pathogens are a major threat to human health. Few therapeutics exist to treat fungal infections while bacteria are becoming increasingly resistant to existing therapeutics. Humans have been using natural products to treat infections for thousands of years, long before the causal agents of infection were understood. Natural products have continued to be used as therapeutics in the modern age of medicine. Rates of rediscovery of known natural products have increased in traditional sources of natural products, such as soil bacteria. Recently, symbiotic Actinobacteria from insect agricultural systems have been recognized as a promising source of bioactive compounds, especially antifungal agents. These bacteria often produce natural products that defend an insect’s fungal crop from pathogenic fungus. The work proposed here will use chemical biology approaches such as phenotypic interaction screens, genomics, and a new bioinformatics approach to systematically search for bioactive natural products produced by Actinobacteria symbionts and other organisms in insect agricultural systems. The first part of this proposal focuses on using existing techniques to identify new bioactive natural products. Phenotypic interaction screens can identify bioactive natural products by determining if a symbiotic bacteria produces a natural product that inhibits the growth of a fungal pathogen and vice-versa. We will then use genomic sequencing, bioinformatics, and heterologous expression to identify and characterize biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) that are not expressed in the phenotypic interaction screens. The second part of the proposed work involves the use of a new bioinformatics technique to identify interesting bioactive natural products. Existing bioinformatics techniques identify BGCs and predict the most likely chemical structure of the corresponding natural product. However, they do not conclude anything concerning the functional role that the natural product plays. The technique developed here will use machine learning to predict the function that the natural product fulfills in the ecological context of the organism. This algorithm will facilitate the identification of bioactive natural products with therapeutically relevant functions. Project Narrative Fungal infections are an underappreciated threat to human health with high mortality rates and few effective therapeutic agents for treatment. Symbiotic Actinobacteria from insect agricultural systems are a promising source of antifungal agents since they often produce natural products with antifungal activity protecting an insect’s fungal crop from pathogenic fungus. The work proposed here will use phenotypic interaction screens, genome sequencing, and the development of a novel bioinformatics method to systematically mine Actinobacteria for antifungal and antibacterial products – leading to the discovery of new bioactive small molecules along with a deeper understanding of how natural products mediate the interaction between species in insect agricultural systems.",Bioinformatics and Chemical Biology Approaches for Identifying Bioactive Natural Products of Symbiotic Actinobacteria,9540546,F32GM128267,"['Actinobacteria class', 'Age', 'Agriculture', 'Algorithms', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents', 'Antibiotics', 'Antifungal Agents', 'Ants', 'Bacteria', 'Bacterial Antibiotic Resistance', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Breathing', 'Chemical Structure', 'Chemicals', 'Collaborations', 'Computational Biology', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Ecosystem', 'Gene Cluster', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Human', 'Infection', 'Insecta', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modernization', 'Molecular Structure', 'Mycoses', 'Natural Products', 'Organism', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Public Health', 'Resistance', 'Role', 'Soil', 'Source', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'bioactive natural products', 'drug discovery', 'fungus', 'genetic information', 'genome sequencing', 'human disease', 'mortality', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'post-doctoral training', 'prediction algorithm', 'small molecule', 'symbiont']",NIGMS,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,F32,2018,58282,0.0326821741365368

"Developing Advanced Algorithms to Address Major Computational Challenges in Current Microbiome Research Abstract We propose a three-year interdisciplinary research plan to address two key issues currently facing the metagenomics community. The first issue concerns accurate construction and annotation of OTU tables using  of millions of 16S rRNA sequences, which is one of the most important yet most difficult problems inmicrobiome data analysis. Currently, it lacks computational algorithms capable of handling extremely large sequence data and constructing biologically consistent OTU tables. We propose a novel method that performs OTU table construction and annotation simultaneously by utilizing input and reference sequences, reference annotations, and data clustering structure within one analytical framework. Dynamic data-driven cutoffs are derived to identify OTUs that are consistent not only with data clustering structure but also with reference annotations. When successfully implemented, our method will generally address the computational needs of processing hundreds of millions of 16S rRNA reads that are currently being generated by large-scale studies. The second issue concerns developing novel methods to extract pertinent information from massive sequence data, thereby facilitating the field shifting from descriptive research to mechanistic studies. We are particularly interested in microbial community dynamics analysis, which can provide a wealth of insight into disease development unattainable through a static experiment design, and lays a critical foundation for developing probiotic and antibiotic strategies to manipulate microbial communities. Traditionally, system dynamics is approached through time-course studies. However, due to economical and logistical constraints, time-course studies are generally limited by the number of samples examined and the time period followed. With the rapid development of sequencing technology, many thousands of samples are being collected in large-scale studies. This provides us with a unique opportunity to develop a novel analytical strategy to use static data, instead of time-course data, to study microbial community dynamics. To our knowledge, this is the first time that massive static data is used to study dynamic aspects of microbial communities. When successfully implemented, our approach can effectively overcome the sampling limitation of time-course studies, and opens a new avenue of research to study microbial dynamics underlying disease development without performing a resource-intensive time-course study. The proposed pipeline will be intensively tested on a large oral microbiome dataset consisting of ~2,600 subgingival samples (~330M reads). The analysis can significantly advance our understanding of dynamic behaviors of oral microbial communities possibly contributing to the development of periodontal disease. To our knowledge, no prior work has been performed on this scale to study oral microbial community dynamics. We have assembled a multidisciplinary team that covers expertise spanning the areas of machine learning, bioinformatics, and oral microbiology. The expected outcome of this work will be a set of computational tools of high utility for the microbiology community and beyond. The human microbiome plays essential roles in many important physiological processes. We propose an interdisciplinary research plan to address some major computational challenges in current microbiome research. If successfully implemented, this work could significantly expand the capacity of existing pipelines for large-scale data analysis and scientific discovery, resulting in a significant impact on the field.",Developing Advanced Algorithms to Address Major Computational Challenges in Current Microbiome Research,9474101,R01AI125982,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Antibiotics', 'Area', 'Big Data', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Communities', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Epidemiology', 'Floods', 'Foundations', 'Health', 'Human', 'Human Microbiome', 'Human body', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Knowledge', 'Logistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Metagenomics', 'Methods', 'Microbe', 'Microbiology', 'Modeling', 'Oral Microbiology', 'Outcome', 'Periodontal Diseases', 'Physiological Processes', 'Play', 'Probiotics', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Ribosomal RNA', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Work', 'base', 'cohort', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'dynamic system', 'epidemiology study', 'experimental study', 'human microbiota', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'microbial', 'microbial community', 'microbiome', 'microbiome research', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'open source', 'operational taxonomic units', 'oral behavior', 'oral microbial community', 'oral microbiome', 'response', 'tumor progression', 'web app']",NIAID,STATE UNIVERSITY OF NEW YORK AT BUFFALO,R01,2018,350321,0.05356538805872311
"A platform for mining, visualization and design of microbial interaction networks Project Summary One of the burning questions in the study of the human microbiome is whether and how it is possible to design specific strategies for rebalancing the taxonomic and functional properties of human-associated microbial communities, triggering the transition from “disease states” to “healthy states”. While empirical studies provide strong support for the idea that we may be able to cure, or at least  treat, a number of diseases by simply transplanting microbiomes, or inducing changes through taxonomic or environmental perturbations, to date little mechanistic understanding exists on how microbial communities work, and on how to extend microbiome research from an empirical science to a systematic, quantitative field of biomedicine. We propose here to establish a computational platform--   a database (Aim 1) with fully integrated analytical software (Aims 2 and 3) --- developed for and with the cooperation of the scientific community. The resource goes beyond cataloguing microbial abundances under different condition; its aim is to enable an understanding of networks of interacting species and their condition-dependence, with the goal of eventually facilitating disease diagnosis and prognosis, and designing therapeutic strategies for microbiome intervention. Our project is centered around three key aims: 1.	The creation of a Microbial Interaction Network Database (MIND), a public resource that will collect data on inter-species interactions from metagenomic sequencing projects, computer simulations and direct experiments. This database will be accessed through a web-based platform complemented with tools for microbial interaction network analysis and visualization, akin to highly fruitful tools previously developed for the study of genetic networks; the database will also serve as the public repository of microbial networks associated with human diseases; 2.	The implementation of an integrated tool for simulation of interspecies interactions under different environments, based on genomic data and whole-cell models of metabolism; 3.	The implementation of new algorithms for microbial community analysis and engineering. These algorithms, including stoichiometric, machine-learning and statistical approaches will facilitate a “synthetic ecology” approach to help design strategies (e.g. microbial transplants or probiotic mixtures) for preventing and targeting microbiome-associated diseases. Our work will fill a major gap in current microbiome research, creating the first platform for global microbial interaction data integration, mining and computation. Project Narrative Among the major developments of the genomic revolution has been the ability to identify thousands of microbial species and strains living in communities in 5 major habitats in the human body, and the recognition that the relative abundances of these populations is strongly correlated with environment: disease state, diet, treatment protocol and so on. A major challenge in utilizing the deluge of health relevant data is structuring it into a database that facilitates understanding inter-microbial interactions in these communities. The aim of this proposal is to create a database and integrated computational platform, open to and contributed to by the research community, which will greatly accelerate the conversion of data into health related actionable knowledge.","A platform for mining, visualization and design of microbial interaction networks",9420621,R01GM121950,"['Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Cataloging', 'Catalogs', 'Cell model', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Diet', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Ecology', 'Ecosystem', 'Empirical Research', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Evolution', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genetic study', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Habitats', 'Health', 'Human Biology', 'Human Microbiome', 'Human body', 'Imagery', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurable', 'Mediating', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Microbe', 'Mining', 'Nature', 'Online Systems', 'Organism', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pattern', 'Population', 'Preventive Medicine', 'Probiotics', 'Property', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Structure', 'Taxonomy', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Transplantation', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Work', 'base', 'computer framework', 'data integration', 'data to knowledge', 'design', 'disease diagnosis', 'experimental study', 'feeding', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'human disease', 'human microbiota', 'metagenomic sequencing', 'microbial', 'microbial community', 'microbiome', 'microbiome research', 'microbiota transplantation', 'microorganism interaction', 'novel diagnostics', 'novel therapeutics', 'open source', 'outcome forecast', 'prevent', 'repository', 'simulation', 'tool', 'user-friendly']",NIGMS,BOSTON UNIVERSITY (CHARLES RIVER CAMPUS),R01,2018,374683,0.07629413771620257
"Precision Medicine in Sarcoidosis ABSTRACT Sarcoidosis is a systemic inflammatory disease of unknown etiology characterized by non-caseating granulomas in affected organs, primarily in the lungs. Approximately 30% of patients with sarcoidosis progress to debilitating disease; however, the drivers of susceptibility or resilience to disease remain poorly understood. An inflammatory response to an undefined antigen is postulated as the etiology of granuloma formation, and the pathogenesis has been suggested to involve gene-pathogen interaction, yet analysis of single genes or microbes has not proven applicable to diagnosis of all forms of sarcoidosis. Indeed, rather than a single organism, the disease may represent an interaction between the community of organisms that comprise the lung microbiome (community of organisms that live in and on us) and the host immune response. We propose that understanding the microbiome/host interaction will suggest strategies for precision medicine approaches to sarcoidosis. This proposal addresses this significant gap by investigating interactions between the lung microbiome, host immune and clinical responses in sarcoidosis using multiomics approaches – a critically innovative strategy. Our preliminary data support our novel hypotheses. First, we identified distinct lung microbiomes that differentiated patients with sarcoidosis versus controls. Second, our results identified biomarkers of disease severity that were associated with decreased lung function. Third, a recurrent analytic theme that emerged, regardless of the type of -omic analysis, was that sarcoidosis is characterized by pathways related to apoptosis and autophagy, which is consistent with our observation of decreased abundance of peripheral lymphocytes and functional immune anergy. These data led us to our Overall Hypothesis: Lung microbiome and host immune interactions characterized by apoptosis and autophagy pathways influence sarcoidosis clinical course. This hypothesis will be tested by an observational prospective and validation study of sarcoidosis patients at 5 time points to facilitate time series analyses. Aims 1 and 2 focus on lung microbiome or host immune responses, respectively, in relation to clinical course of sarcoidosis. Using these data in Aim 3, predictive models will be constructed based on integrated data of metagenomic and host-immune interactions.

"Joint Analysis of Microbiome and Other Genomic Data Types PROJECT SUMMARY In the same way that the human genome project created invaluable genomic maps, the objective of this project is to develop methods for eventual construction of comprehensive genetic and metabolomic by microbome relationship maps. Such maps would be an invaluable resource for improving our understanding as to the underlying mechanisms by which microbes and –omics features influence human diseases and conditions, potentially leading to identification of novel therapeutic targets. To these ends, this proposal seeks to develop statistical and computational tools for mapping associations and interactions between microbes and other – omic features and for further utilizing other –omics to improve microbiome based prediction models. Specifically, motivated by studies examining the role of the vaginal microbiome and other –omics in birth outcomes and menopause, we aim to develop statistical methodology for (1) mapping genetic variants that influence microbiome composition so as to understand the innate component of the microbiome as well as learn mechanisms by which genetics influence outcomes; (2) creating global metabolic maps integrating both microbes and metabolites which will enable understanding of how perturbations might influence the system and identify key pathways for therapeutic target; (3) exploiting other –omics in constructing more accurate microbiome based prediction models for preterm birth; (4) developing, distributing and supporting software packages for the proposed methods. The methods are based on frameworks in which we have considerable experience, but novel technical contributions are made to accommodate features of the data such as population stratification and relatedness in genetics, phylogenetic structure, and compositionality, as well as practical considerations such as availability of samples and other –omics data. Consequently, these new methods have the potential for accelerating mechanistic and translational microbiome studies, developing vital resources for enabling systematic achievement of many biological, clinical, and public health problems that have eluded researchers for decades. PROJECT NARRATIVE The methods developed in this proposal will enable improved understanding of the interactions between microbes and other –omics, thus aiding in elucidation of the mechanisms by which microbes and –omic features influence health outcomes and aiding in identification of potential molecular targets.

"Natural Product-Drug Interaction Research: The Roadmap to Best Practices ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): As natural products (NP) sales increase, the risk of adverse NP-drug interactions (NPDIs) increases, yet the pharmacokinetic (PK) elucidation and clinical relevance of putative NPDIs remain elusive. Assessing the risk of NPDIs is more challenging than that of drug-drug interactions (DDIs), often due to relatively scant PK knowledge of individual NP constituents that perpetrate these interactions. The proposed U54 Center will develop a roadmap for NPDI research through a series of well-designed human in vitro and in vivo studies (termed Interaction Projects) on 4-6 priority NPs that pose a potential risk for clinically relevant NPDIs. A repository will be developed for the data generated from the Interaction Projects, and results will be communicated to various target audiences through a public portal. This U54 Center is composed of an accomplished team of investigators, including pharmacokineticists with expertise in NPDIs, complemented by expertise in NP chemistry, DDIs, and health information communication. In collaboration with the Steering Committee, an innovative strategy that combines a mechanistic approach with practical considerations (e.g., popularity of the NPs) will be used to select and prioritize 4-6 NPs for further investigation in te Interaction Projects. Mechanistic aspects include curated clinical NDPI data from the widely used Drug Interaction Database (DIDB) of the Informatics Core, structural alerts, and compelling preliminary clinical and in silico NPDI data. Once selected, the NPs will be entered into a Decision Tree for assessment of NPDI liability and probable significance of interactions with victim drugs. In parallel, the Pharmacology Core will develop detailed Statements of Work for the human in vitro and in vivo studies - while the Analytical Core will source, acquire, and characterize the selected NPs - for the Interaction Projects. Upon completion of each project, the Analytical Core will analyze the PK samples, and the Pharmacology Core will develop physiologically-based PK models for further assessment of the clinical relevance of the Interaction Project results. Throughout these projects, the Informatics Core will create a data repository embedded within a public portal web-based application named, NaPDI app, for Natural Product-Drug Interaction application. The repository, built using the DIDB framework, will allow researchers to access both raw data and summarized results. The U54 Center will also develop and share Best Practices recommended for the conduct of NPDI studies, based on the experience with and results from the Interaction Projects, with the research communities via the public portal. Effective dissemination of the Interaction Project results will be ensured through user experience and brand content studies with target audiences - researchers/practitioners and lay public - to refine the public portal content. The Informatics Core will ensure that the U54 Center's results are archived, organized, analyzed, and well-publicized, allowing for improved design of future NPDI research and ultimately, improved decisions on the optimal management of clinically relevant NPDIs.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of this proposed Center of Excellence is to provide leadership on how best to study potential adverse interactions between natural products and conventional medications.

"Evidence Extraction Systems for the Molecular Interaction Literature Burns, Gully A. Abstract  In primary research articles, scientists make claims based on evidence from experiments, and report both the claims and the supporting evidence in the results section of papers. However, biomedical databases de- scribe the claims made by scientists in detail, but rarely provide descriptions of any supporting evidence that a consulting scientist could use to understand why the claims are being made. Currently, the process of curating evidence into databases is manual, time-consuming and expensive; thus, evidence is recorded in papers but not generally captured in database systems. For example, the European Bioinformatics Institute's INTACT database describes how different molecules biochemically interact with each other in detail. They characterize the under- lying experiment providing the evidence of that interaction with only two hierarchical variables: a code denoting the method used to detect the molecular interaction and another code denoting the method used to detect each molecule. In fact, INTACT describes 94 different types of interaction detection method that could be used in conjunction with other experimental methodological processes that can be used in a variety of different ways to reveal different details about the interaction. This crucial information is not being captured in databases. Although experimental evidence is complex, it conforms to certain principles of experimental design: experimentally study- ing a phenomenon typically involves measuring well-chosen dependent variables whilst altering the values of equally well-chosen independent variables. Exploiting these principles has permitted us to devise a preliminary, robust, general-purpose representation for experimental evidence. In this project, We will use this representation to describe the methods and data pertaining to evidence underpinning the interpretive assertions about molecular interactions described by INTACT. A key contribution of our project is that we will develop methods to extract this evidence from scientiﬁc papers automatically (A) by using image processing on a speciﬁc subtype of ﬁgure that is common in molecular biology papers and (B) by using natural language processing to read information from the text used by scientists to describe their results. We will develop these tools for the INTACT repository but package them so that they may then also be used for evidence pertaining to other areas of research in biomedicine. Burns, Gully A. Narrative  Molecular biology databases contain crucial information for the study of human disease (especially cancer), but they omit details of scientiﬁc evidence. Our work will provide detailed accounts of experimental evidence supporting claims pertaining to the study of these diseases. This additional detail may provide scientists with more powerful ways of detecting anomalies and resolving contradictory ﬁndings.",Evidence Extraction Systems for the Molecular Interaction Literature,9365558,R01LM012592,"['Area', 'Binding', 'Biochemical', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Burn injury', 'Cereals', 'Classification', 'Co-Immunoprecipitations', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Consult', 'Data', 'Data Reporting', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Disease', 'Engineering', 'European', 'Event', 'Experimental Designs', 'Experimental Models', 'Gel', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Image', 'Informatics', 'Institutes', 'Intelligence', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Biology', 'Molecular Models', 'Molecular Weight', 'Names', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Paper', 'Pattern', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Privatization', 'Process', 'Protein Structure Initiative', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publications', 'Reading', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Scientist', 'Source Code', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Taxonomy', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'Typology', 'Western Blotting', 'Work', 'base', 'data modeling', 'experimental study', 'human disease', 'image processing', 'learning strategy', 'molecular modeling', 'open source', 'optical character recognition', 'protein protein interaction', 'repository', 'software systems', 'text searching', 'tool']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,R01,2017,264299,0.02348547132391309
"Modeling Emergent Behaviors in Systems Biology: A Biological Physics Approach Project Summary Biology is full of stunning examples of emergent behaviors – behaviors that arise from, but cannot be reduced to, the interactions of the constituent parts that make up the system under consideration. These behaviors span the full spectrum of length scales, from the emergence of distinct cell fates (e.g. neurons, muscle, etc.) due to the interactions of genes within cells, to the formation of complex ecological communities arising from the interactions of thousands of species. The overarching goal of my research is to develop new conceptual, theoretical, and computational tools to model such emergent, system-level behaviors in biology. To do so, we utilize an interdisciplinary approach that is grounded in Biological Physics, but draws heavily from Machine Learning, Information Theory, and Theoretical Ecology. Our work is unified and distinguished by our deep commitment to integrating theory with the vast amount of biological data now being generated by modern DNA sequencing-based techniques and quantitative microscopy. An important goal of the proposed research is to find common concepts and tools that transcend traditional biological sub-disciplines and models systems. The proposed research pursues four distinct but conceptually interrelated research directions: (1) understanding how distinct cell fates emerge from bimolecular interactions within mammalian cells (2) investigating how bimolecular networks within cells exploit energy consumption to improve computations, with applications to Synthetic Biology; (3) identifying the ecological principles governing community assembly in microbial communities and developing techniques for synthetically engineering ecological communities; and (4) developing new machine learning algorithms and techniques for biological data analysis. In addition to developing physics-based models for diverse biological phenomena, the proposed research will yield a series of practical important tools and algorithms which we will make publically available including: (1) a new linear-algebra based algorithm for assessing the fidelity of directed differentiation and cellular reprogramming protocols and visualizing reprogramming/differentiation dynamics and (2) improved algorithms for inferring microbial interactions in the human microbiome from high-throughput sequence data. These computational tools will allow scientists to realize the immense therapeutic potential of cellular reprogramming and microbial ecology-based techniques for studying and treating human disease.

"Structure based Prediction of the interactome The interactions of small molecules with proteins is not only omnipresent throughout cellular processes, but also of fundamental importance to drug design and disease treatment. Much like with protein-protein and protein-RNA interactions, high-throughput (HTP) experimental methods have led to the generation of enormous volumes of protein-small molecule and related data. However, in addition to sheer scale, high degrees of heterogeneity in these data, combined with proprietary ownership concerns when originating from within industry, present significant challenges to the sharing and full use of this data in basic research and therapeutic development. This proposal aims to develop new mathematical methods that can address not only interpreting the data itself, but also the collaborative and generative process through which researchers work: new cryptographic tools can enable unprecedented forms of secure sharing and collaboration between industry and the public, and deep learning of structural features can reduce the dependence of researchers on prior assumptions as to important predictors of drug-target interactions (DTI).  In our previous granting period, we successfully developed methods for structure-based prediction and HTP data analysis of protein-protein and protein-RNA interactions, uncovering novel biology (e.g., for neurodegenerative diseases). In this renewal, we aim to: 1) develop scalable methods for multi-party computation and differential privacy to enable the secure sharing of large proprietary drug-target interaction databases among industry and public researchers; 2) develop novel integrative machine learning approaches for identifying drug-target interactions based on interactome, molecular structure and chemogenomic data (in collaboration with co-I Jian Peng); and 3) establish innovative collaborations with industry, academia and the scientific community to drive use and adoption of these computational tools and technologies among practicing biomedical researchers.  Successful completion of these aims will provide both public and private research communities with scalable access to technologies for secure sharing of proprietary drug screening data as well as flexible, accurate tools for predicting drug-target interactions. All developed software will be made available via publicly accessible web-based portals under open source software licenses. Collaborations with research partners will validate the relevance of these tools to human health and disease, while the dissemination aim will ensure research communities convenient and ongoing access to these innovations. Narrative The interactions of small molecules with proteins are omnipresent throughout cellular processes and of fundamental importance to drug design and disease treatment, yet the task of predicting these interactions brings major challenges because of the heterogeneity and proprietary nature of the data.

"Computational Studies of Virus-host Interactions Using Metagenomics Data and Applications Computational Studies of Virus-host Interactions Using Metagenomics Data and Applications Summary: Viruses are ubiquitous in almost every ecological environment including the human body, water, soil, etc. They play important roles in the normal function of human microbiome. Many viruses have been shown to be associated with human diseases. However, our understanding of the roles of viruses in ecological communities is very limited. Recent technological and computational advances make it possible to have a deep understanding of the roles of viruses in public health and the environment. Metagenomics studies from various environments including the human microbiome projects (HMP), global ocean, and the earth microbiome projects have generated large amounts of short read data. Viruses are present in most of these metagenomic data sets and their hosts are unknown. In this proposal, the investigators will develop computational approaches for the identification of viral sequences from metagenomic data sets and for the study of virus-host interactions. For the identification of viral sequences from metagenomics samples, novel statistical measures using word patterns will first be developed. Second, a unified naïve Bayesian integrative approach by combining information from word patterns, gene directionality, and gene annotation will be studied. Third, the identified viral sequences from metagenomes will be further assembled to construct complete viral genomes using a novel binning approach to be developed by the investigators. Finally, the remaining reads will be assigned to the corresponding bins. For the study of virus- host interactions, computational methods to estimate the reliability of virus-host interactions from high-throughput experiments will first be developed. Then machine learning approaches will be developed to predict viruses infecting certain hosts. Finally, a network logistic regression approach will be developed to predict virus-host interactions. These computational approaches for the identification of viral sequences and for predicting virus-host interactions will be applied to a public liver cirrhosis and a unique metagenomics data set to understand how metagenomes change with health status, identify viruses and virus-host interactions associated with disease status and accurately predict disease status using bacteria, viruses and virus-host interactions. The developed computational methods will also be used to analyze metageomic data from various locations based on the TARA ocean data and a unique time series data to understand how environmental factors affect virus abundance and virus-host interactions. Some of the predictions will be experimentally validated. Software derived from the proposal will be developed and freely distributed to the scientific community. Project Narrative Viruses are abundant in many environments and are important to public health. New statistical and computational tools will be developed for the identification of viral sequences from metagenomics samples and for the prediction of virus-host interactions. These tools will be used to analyze microbial data sets related to liver cirrhosis and travelers’ diarrhea as well as marine metagenomics data sets from various geographic locations and time series.",Computational Studies of Virus-host Interactions Using Metagenomics Data and Applications,9312083,R01GM120624,"['Affect', 'Bacteria', 'Biological', 'Body Water', 'Cells', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Environment and Public Health', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Functional disorder', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Geographic Locations', 'Health', 'Health Status', 'Human', 'Human Microbiome', 'Human body', 'Liver Cirrhosis', 'Location', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Marines', 'Measures', 'Metagenomics', 'Methods', 'Microbe', 'Network-based', 'Oceans', 'Organism', 'Pattern', 'Planet Earth', 'Play', 'Policies', 'Public Health', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Series', 'Soil', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Traveler&apos', 's diarrhea', 'Viral', 'Viral Genome', 'Virus', 'Virus Diseases', 'Visualization software', 'base', 'computer studies', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'experimental study', 'human disease', 'interest', 'metagenome', 'microbial', 'microbial community', 'microbiome', 'novel', 'particle', 'statistics', 'tool', 'user-friendly', 'virus host interaction']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,R01,2017,395858,0.10203139087067871
"Bioinformatics strategies to relate age of onset with gene-gene interaction ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Time to onset of chronic diseases such as cancer, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes is expected to be influenced by multiple gene-gene interactions that add to the complexity of the genotype-phenotype mapping relationship. Unfortunately, parametric statistical methods such as Cox regression lack sufficient power to detect high-order gene-gene interactions due to the sparseness of the data. Machine learning methods offer a more powerful alternative but rely on computationally-intensive searching methods to identify the top models. We propose here to develop a powerful and computationally efficient bioinformatics strategy that combines machine learning algorithm and Cox regression for identifying gene-gene and gene-environment interaction models that are associated with time of onset of chronic disease. Specifically, we firs propose to develop a novel Robust Survival Multifactor Dimensionality Reduction method (RS-MDR) for the detection of gene-gene interactions in rare variants that influence time of onset of human disease (AIM 1). The power of RS-MDR method will be evaluated by comparing it to other existing methods in simulation studies. We then propose to change the representation space of the gene-gene interaction models using RS-MDR's construction induction method and apply L1 penalized Cox regression to identify a set of interaction models that can predict patients' survival probability (AIM 2). We hypothesize that RS-MDR can effectively identify high order interaction models and the combined approach provides a powerful and computational efficient way to select a set of interaction models. We will use extensive simulations that are derived from GWAS studies to thoroughly evaluate this hypothesis. Next, we will apply the new combined method for detecting and characterizing gene-gene and gene-environment interactions in genome-wide association study (GWAS) data from large population-based studies of lung cancer and rheumatoid arthritis (AIM 3). Results from the real data analysis will be used to refine the method. Finally, we will distribute the proposed method as part of an open- source R software package (AIM 4). We anticipate that the proposed method will combine the strength from both parametric and non-parametric methods and enable detection of interaction models that are jointly affecting time of onset of chronic diseases. This is important because time of onset has more variation than case-control status and it may be more clinically relevant. Furthermore, studies of genetic factors predicting time of onset have not been pursued aggressively using GWAS studies, despite the relevance of this information for the discovery of high risk variants like mutations in BRCA1. Narrative This project will provide a general method for genome data analysis that can be potentially apply to any specific disease. We focus the application of this method on an investigation into the role of genetic polymorphisms in lung cancer and rheumatoid arthritis. This will increase our knowledge of the basic biology and lead for screening and targeted therapy.",Bioinformatics strategies to relate age of onset with gene-gene interaction,9306198,R01LM012012,"['Affect', 'Age of Onset', 'Algorithms', 'BRCA1 gene', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biology', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Chronic Disease', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Europe', 'Gene Order', 'Genes', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic study', 'Genome', 'Genotype', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'North America', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Population Study', 'Predictive Factor', 'Probability', 'Research', 'Rheumatoid Arthritis', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Statistical Methods', 'Testing', 'Texas', 'Time', 'United Kingdom', 'Variant', 'base', 'case control', 'clinically relevant', 'gene environment interaction', 'gene interaction', 'genome wide association study', 'high risk', 'human disease', 'learning strategy', 'novel', 'open source', 'rare variant', 'risk variant', 'screening', 'simulation', 'survival outcome', 'targeted treatment']",NLM,DARTMOUTH COLLEGE,R01,2017,352350,0.017330456452189457
"Developing Advanced Algorithms to Address Major Computational Challenges in Current Microbiome Research Abstract We propose a three-year interdisciplinary research plan to address two key issues currently facing the metagenomics community. The first issue concerns accurate construction and annotation of OTU tables using  of millions of 16S rRNA sequences, which is one of the most important yet most difficult problems inmicrobiome data analysis. Currently, it lacks computational algorithms capable of handling extremely large sequence data and constructing biologically consistent OTU tables. We propose a novel method that performs OTU table construction and annotation simultaneously by utilizing input and reference sequences, reference annotations, and data clustering structure within one analytical framework. Dynamic data-driven cutoffs are derived to identify OTUs that are consistent not only with data clustering structure but also with reference annotations. When successfully implemented, our method will generally address the computational needs of processing hundreds of millions of 16S rRNA reads that are currently being generated by large-scale studies. The second issue concerns developing novel methods to extract pertinent information from massive sequence data, thereby facilitating the field shifting from descriptive research to mechanistic studies. We are particularly interested in microbial community dynamics analysis, which can provide a wealth of insight into disease development unattainable through a static experiment design, and lays a critical foundation for developing probiotic and antibiotic strategies to manipulate microbial communities. Traditionally, system dynamics is approached through time-course studies. However, due to economical and logistical constraints, time-course studies are generally limited by the number of samples examined and the time period followed. With the rapid development of sequencing technology, many thousands of samples are being collected in large-scale studies. This provides us with a unique opportunity to develop a novel analytical strategy to use static data, instead of time-course data, to study microbial community dynamics. To our knowledge, this is the first time that massive static data is used to study dynamic aspects of microbial communities. When successfully implemented, our approach can effectively overcome the sampling limitation of time-course studies, and opens a new avenue of research to study microbial dynamics underlying disease development without performing a resource-intensive time-course study. The proposed pipeline will be intensively tested on a large oral microbiome dataset consisting of ~2,600 subgingival samples (~330M reads). The analysis can significantly advance our understanding of dynamic behaviors of oral microbial communities possibly contributing to the development of periodontal disease. To our knowledge, no prior work has been performed on this scale to study oral microbial community dynamics. We have assembled a multidisciplinary team that covers expertise spanning the areas of machine learning, bioinformatics, and oral microbiology. The expected outcome of this work will be a set of computational tools of high utility for the microbiology community and beyond. The human microbiome plays essential roles in many important physiological processes. We propose an interdisciplinary research plan to address some major computational challenges in current microbiome research. If successfully implemented, this work could significantly expand the capacity of existing pipelines for large-scale data analysis and scientific discovery, resulting in a significant impact on the field.",Developing Advanced Algorithms to Address Major Computational Challenges in Current Microbiome Research,9270498,R01AI125982,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Antibiotics', 'Area', 'Big Data', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Communities', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Epidemiology', 'Floods', 'Foundations', 'Health', 'Human', 'Human Microbiome', 'Human body', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Knowledge', 'Logistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Metagenomics', 'Methods', 'Microbe', 'Microbiology', 'Modeling', 'Oral', 'Oral Microbiology', 'Outcome', 'Periodontal Diseases', 'Physiological Processes', 'Play', 'Probiotics', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Ribosomal RNA', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Structure', 'System', 'Taxonomy', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Work', 'base', 'cohort', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'dynamic system', 'epidemiology study', 'experimental study', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'microbial', 'microbial community', 'microbiome', 'microbiota', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'open source', 'oral behavior', 'oral microbiome', 'response', 'tumor progression', 'web app']",NIAID,STATE UNIVERSITY OF NEW YORK AT BUFFALO,R01,2017,311153,0.05356538805872311
"A platform for mining, visualization and design of microbial interaction networks Project Summary One of the burning questions in the study of the human microbiome is whether and how it is possible to design specific strategies for rebalancing the taxonomic and functional properties of human-associated microbial communities, triggering the transition from “disease states” to “healthy states”. While empirical studies provide strong support for the idea that we may be able to cure, or at least  treat, a number of diseases by simply transplanting microbiomes, or inducing changes through taxonomic or environmental perturbations, to date little mechanistic understanding exists on how microbial communities work, and on how to extend microbiome research from an empirical science to a systematic, quantitative field of biomedicine. We propose here to establish a computational platform--   a database (Aim 1) with fully integrated analytical software (Aims 2 and 3) --- developed for and with the cooperation of the scientific community. The resource goes beyond cataloguing microbial abundances under different condition; its aim is to enable an understanding of networks of interacting species and their condition-dependence, with the goal of eventually facilitating disease diagnosis and prognosis, and designing therapeutic strategies for microbiome intervention. Our project is centered around three key aims: 1.	The creation of a Microbial Interaction Network Database (MIND), a public resource that will collect data on inter-species interactions from metagenomic sequencing projects, computer simulations and direct experiments. This database will be accessed through a web-based platform complemented with tools for microbial interaction network analysis and visualization, akin to highly fruitful tools previously developed for the study of genetic networks; the database will also serve as the public repository of microbial networks associated with human diseases; 2.	The implementation of an integrated tool for simulation of interspecies interactions under different environments, based on genomic data and whole-cell models of metabolism; 3.	The implementation of new algorithms for microbial community analysis and engineering. These algorithms, including stoichiometric, machine-learning and statistical approaches will facilitate a “synthetic ecology” approach to help design strategies (e.g. microbial transplants or probiotic mixtures) for preventing and targeting microbiome-associated diseases. Our work will fill a major gap in current microbiome research, creating the first platform for global microbial interaction data integration, mining and computation. Project Narrative Among the major developments of the genomic revolution has been the ability to identify thousands of microbial species and strains living in communities in 5 major habitats in the human body, and the recognition that the relative abundances of these populations is strongly correlated with environment: disease state, diet, treatment protocol and so on. A major challenge in utilizing the deluge of health relevant data is structuring it into a database that facilitates understanding inter-microbial interactions in these communities. The aim of this proposal is to create a database and integrated computational platform, open to and contributed to by the research community, which will greatly accelerate the conversion of data into health related actionable knowledge.","A platform for mining, visualization and design of microbial interaction networks",9221662,R01GM121950,"['Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Cataloging', 'Catalogs', 'Cell model', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Diet', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Ecology', 'Ecosystem', 'Empirical Research', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Evolution', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genetic study', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Habitats', 'Health', 'Human', 'Human Biology', 'Human Microbiome', 'Human body', 'Imagery', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurable', 'Mediating', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Microbe', 'Mining', 'Nature', 'Online Systems', 'Organism', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pattern', 'Population', 'Preventive Medicine', 'Probiotics', 'Property', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Structure', 'Taxonomy', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Transplantation', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Work', 'base', 'computer framework', 'data integration', 'data to knowledge', 'design', 'disease diagnosis', 'experimental study', 'feeding', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'human disease', 'metagenomic sequencing', 'microbial', 'microbial community', 'microbiome', 'microbiota transplantation', 'microorganism interaction', 'novel diagnostics', 'novel therapeutics', 'open source', 'outcome forecast', 'prevent', 'repository', 'simulation', 'tool', 'user-friendly']",NIGMS,BOSTON UNIVERSITY (CHARLES RIVER CAMPUS),R01,2017,377226,0.07629413771620257
"Predicting Resilience in the Human Microbiome DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Humans have co-evolved with complex, dynamic microbial communities that play essential roles in nutrition, metabolism, immunity, and numerous other aspects of human physiology. Hence, maintenance and recovery of key beneficial services by the microbiota in the face of disturbance is fundamental to health. Yet, stability and resilience vary in, and between individuals, and are poorly understood. Our goal is to identify features of the human microbiome that predict microbial community stability and resilience following disturbance. We propose an innovative large-scale clinical study design that will generate the necessary compositional and functional data from the most relevant ecosystem, i.e., humans!  We will develop novel statistical and mathematical methods for data integration (sparse, non-linear multi-table methods), and test existing ecological theories and apply statistical learning strategies to allow data-driven investigation of ecological and clinical properties that determine and predict stability and/or resilience. The breadth and magnitude of this project's impact are significant: We envision tests to predict microbial community responses to disturbance, and procedures to stabilize or restore beneficial microbial interactions as needed. A predictive understanding of the stability and resilience of the gut microbiota will advance the rational practice of medicine. There are three key innovative aspects to our approach: 1) sequential perturbations of different types in a large number of human subjects sampled over time; 2) multiple compositional and functional measurements made on the same samples; and 3) novel data integration methods that incorporate all of the information. Aim 1. Profile the human microbiome before, during and after multiple forms of disturbance. One hundred subjects will each be sampled at 40 time points over a 34 week study period that encompasses two types of perturbation in each subject (dietary shift, and bowel cleansing or antibiotic). From each sample, we will determine taxonomic composition, genomic content, meta-transcriptome, and metabolomic profiles. Aim 2. Discover resilience: Develop non-linear approaches for complex data integration using sparse, multiple-table methods. We will develop a novel sparse, multiple-table approach for data integration and simultaneous analysis of diverse types of complex data over time. Aim 3. Explain resilience: Use statistical learning approaches to find the predictive features that characterize resilience. Using the multiple table approach, we will compare routine unperturbed dynamics within a community to the varied responses to a perturbation, define stable states, and identify common network features characteristic of resilient communities subjected to different forms of disturbance. Finally, we wil use validation techniques to confirm these candidate predictors of community resilience. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Humans rely on the microbial communities that colonize the gut for a wide variety of critical functions, including nutrition, immune system maturation, protection against infection by disease-causing microbes, and detoxification of environmental chemicals. Daily life is punctuated by events, such as exposure to antibiotics or other chemicals, or changes in diet, that sometimes disturb or destabilize our microbial communities with potentially severe and sustained negative impacts on health. We propose an ambitious study in which we will monitor the microbial communities of healthy humans before, during and after several types of planned disturbance, and discover community features that predict future stability or future recovery from disturbance, with the expectation that our findings will fundamentally change the practice of medicine.",Predicting Resilience in the Human Microbiome,9325416,R01AI112401,"['Allergic Disease', 'Antibiotics', 'Attention', 'Characteristics', 'Chemicals', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diet', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Drug Metabolic Detoxication', 'Ecology', 'Ecosystem', 'Event', 'Exposure to', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Human Microbiome', 'Immune system', 'Immunity', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Inflammatory', 'Intervention', 'Intestines', 'Investigation', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Measurement', 'Medicine', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Microbe', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Obesity', 'Output', 'Physiology', 'Play', 'Predisposition', 'Procedures', 'Property', 'Recovery', 'Research Design', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Services', 'Statistical Methods', 'Taxonomy', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Validation', 'analytical method', 'data integration', 'environmental chemical', 'expectation', 'gut microbiome', 'gut microbiota', 'human subject', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'mathematical methods', 'metabolomics', 'microbial', 'microbial community', 'microbiome', 'microbiota', 'microorganism interaction', 'novel', 'nutrition', 'pathogen', 'public health relevance', 'resilience', 'response', 'theories', 'tool', 'transcriptome', 'urinary']",NIAID,PALO ALTO VETERANS INSTIT FOR RESEARCH,R01,2017,413065,0.06975266023894175
"Natural Product-Drug Interaction Research: The Roadmap to Best Practices ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): As natural products (NP) sales increase, the risk of adverse NP-drug interactions (NPDIs) increases, yet the pharmacokinetic (PK) elucidation and clinical relevance of putative NPDIs remain elusive. Assessing the risk of NPDIs is more challenging than that of drug-drug interactions (DDIs), often due to relatively scant PK knowledge of individual NP constituents that perpetrate these interactions. The proposed U54 Center will develop a roadmap for NPDI research through a series of well-designed human in vitro and in vivo studies (termed Interaction Projects) on 4-6 priority NPs that pose a potential risk for clinically relevant NPDIs. A repository will be developed for the data generated from the Interaction Projects, and results will be communicated to various target audiences through a public portal. This U54 Center is composed of an accomplished team of investigators, including pharmacokineticists with expertise in NPDIs, complemented by expertise in NP chemistry, DDIs, and health information communication. In collaboration with the Steering Committee, an innovative strategy that combines a mechanistic approach with practical considerations (e.g., popularity of the NPs) will be used to select and prioritize 4-6 NPs for further investigation in te Interaction Projects. Mechanistic aspects include curated clinical NDPI data from the widely used Drug Interaction Database (DIDB) of the Informatics Core, structural alerts, and compelling preliminary clinical and in silico NPDI data. Once selected, the NPs will be entered into a Decision Tree for assessment of NPDI liability and probable significance of interactions with victim drugs. In parallel, the Pharmacology Core will develop detailed Statements of Work for the human in vitro and in vivo studies - while the Analytical Core will source, acquire, and characterize the selected NPs - for the Interaction Projects. Upon completion of each project, the Analytical Core will analyze the PK samples, and the Pharmacology Core will develop physiologically-based PK models for further assessment of the clinical relevance of the Interaction Project results. Throughout these projects, the Informatics Core will create a data repository embedded within a public portal web-based application named, NaPDI app, for Natural Product-Drug Interaction application.

"Modeling Emergent Behaviors in Systems Biology: A Biological Physics Approach Project Summary Biology is full of stunning examples of emergent behaviors – behaviors that arise from, but cannot be reduced to, the interactions of the constituent parts that make up the system under consideration. These behaviors span the full spectrum of length scales, from the emergence of distinct cell fates (e.g. neurons, muscle, etc.) due to the interactions of genes within cells, to the formation of complex ecological communities arising from the interactions of thousands of species. The overarching goal of my research is to develop new conceptual, theoretical, and computational tools to model such emergent, system-level behaviors in biology. To do so, we utilize an interdisciplinary approach that is grounded in Biological Physics, but draws heavily from Machine Learning, Information Theory, and Theoretical Ecology. Our work is unified and distinguished by our deep commitment to integrating theory with the vast amount of biological data now being generated by modern DNA sequencing-based techniques and quantitative microscopy. An important goal of the proposed research is to find common concepts and tools that transcend traditional biological sub-disciplines and models systems. The proposed research pursues four distinct but conceptually interrelated research directions: (1) understanding how distinct cell fates emerge from bimolecular interactions within mammalian cells (2) investigating how bimolecular networks within cells exploit energy consumption to improve computations, with applications to Synthetic Biology; (3) identifying the ecological principles governing community assembly in microbial communities and developing techniques for synthetically engineering ecological communities; and (4) developing new machine learning algorithms and techniques for biological data analysis. In addition to developing physics-based models for diverse biological phenomena, the proposed research will yield a series of practical important tools and algorithms which we will make publically available including: (1) a new linear-algebra based algorithm for assessing the fidelity of directed differentiation and cellular reprogramming protocols and visualizing reprogramming/differentiation dynamics and (2) improved algorithms for inferring microbial interactions in the human microbiome from high-throughput sequence data. These computational tools will allow scientists to realize the immense therapeutic potential of cellular reprogramming and microbial ecology-based techniques for studying and treating human disease.

"Bioinformatics strategies to relate age of onset with gene-gene interaction ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Time to onset of chronic diseases such as cancer, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes is expected to be influenced by multiple gene-gene interactions that add to the complexity of the genotype-phenotype mapping relationship. Unfortunately, parametric statistical methods such as Cox regression lack sufficient power to detect high-order gene-gene interactions due to the sparseness of the data. Machine learning methods offer a more powerful alternative but rely on computationally-intensive searching methods to identify the top models. We propose here to develop a powerful and computationally efficient bioinformatics strategy that combines machine learning algorithm and Cox regression for identifying gene-gene and gene-environment interaction models that are associated with time of onset of chronic disease. Specifically, we firs propose to develop a novel Robust Survival Multifactor Dimensionality Reduction method (RS-MDR) for the detection of gene-gene interactions in rare variants that influence time of onset of human disease (AIM 1). The power of RS-MDR method will be evaluated by comparing it to other existing methods in simulation studies. We then propose to change the representation space of the gene-gene interaction models using RS-MDR's construction induction method and apply L1 penalized Cox regression to identify a set of interaction models that can predict patients' survival probability (AIM 2). We hypothesize that RS-MDR can effectively identify high order interaction models and the combined approach provides a powerful and computational efficient way to select a set of interaction models. We will use extensive simulations that are derived from GWAS studies to thoroughly evaluate this hypothesis. Next, we will apply the new combined method for detecting and characterizing gene-gene and gene-environment interactions in genome-wide association study (GWAS) data from large population-based studies of lung cancer and rheumatoid arthritis (AIM 3). Results from the real data analysis will be used to refine the method. Finally, we will distribute the proposed method as part of an open- source R software package (AIM 4). We anticipate that the proposed method will combine the strength from both parametric and non-parametric methods and enable detection of interaction models that are jointly affecting time of onset of chronic diseases. This is important because time of onset has more variation than case-control status and it may be more clinically relevant. Furthermore, studies of genetic factors predicting time of onset have not been pursued aggressively using GWAS studies, despite the relevance of this information for the discovery of high risk variants like mutations in BRCA1. Narrative This project will provide a general method for genome data analysis that can be potentially apply to any specific disease. We focus the application of this method on an investigation into the role of genetic polymorphisms in lung cancer and rheumatoid arthritis. This will increase our knowledge of the basic biology and lead for screening and targeted therapy.",Bioinformatics strategies to relate age of onset with gene-gene interaction,9097781,R01LM012012,"['Affect', 'Age of Onset', 'Algorithms', 'BRCA1 gene', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biology', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Chronic Disease', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Europe', 'Gene Order', 'Genes', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic study', 'Genome', 'Genotype', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'North America', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Probability', 'Research', 'Rheumatoid Arthritis', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Staging', 'Statistical Methods', 'Testing', 'Texas', 'Time', 'United Kingdom', 'Variant', 'base', 'cancer genome', 'case control', 'clinically relevant', 'gene environment interaction', 'gene interaction', 'genome wide association study', 'high risk', 'human disease', 'learning strategy', 'novel', 'open source', 'population based', 'rare variant', 'risk variant', 'screening', 'simulation', 'survival outcome', 'targeted treatment']",NLM,DARTMOUTH COLLEGE,R01,2016,352350,0.017330456452189457
"Developing Advanced Algorithms to Address Major Computational Challenges in Current Microbiome Research Abstract We propose a three-year interdisciplinary research plan to address two key issues currently facing the metagenomics community. The first issue concerns accurate construction and annotation of OTU tables using  of millions of 16S rRNA sequences, which is one of the most important yet most difficult problems inmicrobiome data analysis. Currently, it lacks computational algorithms capable of handling extremely large sequence data and constructing biologically consistent OTU tables. We propose a novel method that performs OTU table construction and annotation simultaneously by utilizing input and reference sequences, reference annotations, and data clustering structure within one analytical framework. Dynamic data-driven cutoffs are derived to identify OTUs that are consistent not only with data clustering structure but also with reference annotations. When successfully implemented, our method will generally address the computational needs of processing hundreds of millions of 16S rRNA reads that are currently being generated by large-scale studies. The second issue concerns developing novel methods to extract pertinent information from massive sequence data, thereby facilitating the field shifting from descriptive research to mechanistic studies. We are particularly interested in microbial community dynamics analysis, which can provide a wealth of insight into disease development unattainable through a static experiment design, and lays a critical foundation for developing probiotic and antibiotic strategies to manipulate microbial communities. Traditionally, system dynamics is approached through time-course studies. However, due to economical and logistical constraints, time-course studies are generally limited by the number of samples examined and the time period followed. With the rapid development of sequencing technology, many thousands of samples are being collected in large-scale studies. This provides us with a unique opportunity to develop a novel analytical strategy to use static data, instead of time-course data, to study microbial community dynamics. To our knowledge, this is the first time that massive static data is used to study dynamic aspects of microbial communities. When successfully implemented, our approach can effectively overcome the sampling limitation of time-course studies, and opens a new avenue of research to study microbial dynamics underlying disease development without performing a resource-intensive time-course study. The proposed pipeline will be intensively tested on a large oral microbiome dataset consisting of ~2,600 subgingival samples (~330M reads). The analysis can significantly advance our understanding of dynamic behaviors of oral microbial communities possibly contributing to the development of periodontal disease. To our knowledge, no prior work has been performed on this scale to study oral microbial community dynamics. We have assembled a multidisciplinary team that covers expertise spanning the areas of machine learning, bioinformatics, and oral microbiology. The expected outcome of this work will be a set of computational tools of high utility for the microbiology community and beyond.

Hence, maintenance and recovery of key beneficial services by the microbiota in the face of disturbance is fundamental to health. Yet, stability and resilience vary in, and between individuals, and are poorly understood. Our goal is to identify features of the human microbiome that predict microbial community stability and resilience following disturbance. We propose an innovative large-scale clinical study design that will generate the necessary compositional and functional data from the most relevant ecosystem, i.e., humans!  We will develop novel statistical and mathematical methods for data integration (sparse, non-linear multi-table methods), and test existing ecological theories and apply statistical learning strategies to allow data-driven investigation of ecological and clinical properties that determine and predict stability and/or resilience. The breadth and magnitude of this project's impact are significant: We envision tests to predict microbial community responses to disturbance, and procedures to stabilize or restore beneficial microbial interactions as needed. A predictive understanding of the stability and resilience of the gut microbiota will advance the rational practice of medicine. There are three key innovative aspects to our approach: 1) sequential perturbations of different types in a large number of human subjects sampled over time; 2) multiple compositional and functional measurements made on the same samples; and 3) novel data integration methods that incorporate all of the information. Aim 1. Profile the human microbiome before, during and after multiple forms of disturbance. One hundred subjects will each be sampled at 40 time points over a 34 week study period that encompasses two types of perturbation in each subject (dietary shift, and bowel cleansing or antibiotic). From each sample, we will determine taxonomic composition, genomic content, meta-transcriptome, and metabolomic profiles. Aim 2. Discover resilience: Develop non-linear approaches for complex data integration using sparse, multiple-table methods. We will develop a novel sparse, multiple-table approach for data integration and simultaneous analysis of diverse types of complex data over time. Aim 3. Explain resilience: Use statistical learning approaches to find the predictive features that characterize resilience. Using the multiple table approach, we will compare routine unperturbed dynamics within a community to the varied responses to a perturbation, define stable states, and identify common network features characteristic of resilient communities subjected to different forms of disturbance. Finally, we wil use validation techniques to confirm these candidate predictors of community resilience. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Humans rely on the microbial communities that colonize the gut for a wide variety of critical functions, including nutrition, immune system maturation, protection against infection by disease-causing microbes, and detoxification of environmental chemicals. Daily life is punctuated by events, such as exposure to antibiotics or other chemicals, or changes in diet, that sometimes disturb or destabilize our microbial communities with potentially severe and sustained negative impacts on health. We propose an ambitious study in which we will monitor the microbial communities of healthy humans before, during and after several types of planned disturbance, and discover community features that predict future stability or future recovery from disturbance, with the expectation that our findings will fundamentally change the practice of medicine.",Predicting Resilience in the Human Microbiome,9125723,R01AI112401,"['Allergic Disease', 'Antibiotics', 'Attention', 'Characteristics', 'Chemicals', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diet', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Drug Metabolic Detoxication', 'Ecology', 'Ecosystem', 'Event', 'Exposure to', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Human Microbiome', 'Immune system', 'Immunity', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Inflammatory', 'Intervention', 'Intestines', 'Investigation', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Measurement', 'Medicine', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Microbe', 'Monitor', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Obesity', 'Output', 'Physiology', 'Play', 'Predisposition', 'Procedures', 'Property', 'Recovery', 'Research Design', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Services', 'Statistical Methods', 'Taxon', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Validation', 'abstracting', 'analytical method', 'data integration', 'environmental chemical', 'expectation', 'gut microbiome', 'gut microbiota', 'human subject', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'mathematical methods', 'metabolomics', 'microbial', 'microbial community', 'microbiome', 'microbiota', 'microorganism interaction', 'novel', 'nutrition', 'pathogen', 'resilience', 'response', 'theories', 'tool', 'transcriptome', 'urinary']",NIAID,PALO ALTO VETERANS INSTIT FOR RESEARCH,R01,2016,413065,0.06975266023894175
"Natural Product-Drug Interaction Research: The Roadmap to Best Practices ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): As natural products (NP) sales increase, the risk of adverse NP-drug interactions (NPDIs) increases, yet the pharmacokinetic (PK) elucidation and clinical relevance of putative NPDIs remain elusive. Assessing the risk of NPDIs is more challenging than that of drug-drug interactions (DDIs), often due to relatively scant PK knowledge of individual NP constituents that perpetrate these interactions. The proposed U54 Center will develop a roadmap for NPDI research through a series of well-designed human in vitro and in vivo studies (termed Interaction Projects) on 4-6 priority NPs that pose a potential risk for clinically relevant NPDIs. A repository will be developed for the data generated from the Interaction Projects, and results will be communicated to various target audiences through a public portal. This U54 Center is composed of an accomplished team of investigators, including pharmacokineticists with expertise in NPDIs, complemented by expertise in NP chemistry, DDIs, and health information communication. In collaboration with the Steering Committee, an innovative strategy that combines a mechanistic approach with practical considerations (e.g., popularity of the NPs) will be used to select and prioritize 4-6 NPs for further investigation in te Interaction Projects. Mechanistic aspects include curated clinical NDPI data from the widely used Drug Interaction Database (DIDB) of the Informatics Core, structural alerts, and compelling preliminary clinical and in silico NPDI data. Once selected, the NPs will be entered into a Decision Tree for assessment of NPDI liability and probable significance of interactions with victim drugs. In parallel, the Pharmacology Core will develop detailed Statements of Work for the human in vitro and in vivo studies - while the Analytical Core will source, acquire, and characterize the selected NPs - for the Interaction Projects. Upon completion of each project, the Analytical Core will analyze the PK samples, and the Pharmacology Core will develop physiologically-based PK models for further assessment of the clinical relevance of the Interaction Project results. Throughout these projects, the Informatics Core will create a data repository embedded within a public portal web-based application named, NaPDI app, for Natural Product-Drug Interaction application. The repository, built using the DIDB framework, will allow researchers to access both raw data and summarized results. The U54 Center will also develop and share Best Practices recommended for the conduct of NPDI studies, based on the experience with and results from the Interaction Projects, with the research communities via the public portal.

"Bioinformatics strategies to relate age of onset with gene-gene interaction ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Time to onset of chronic diseases such as cancer, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes is expected to be influenced by multiple gene-gene interactions that add to the complexity of the genotype-phenotype mapping relationship. Unfortunately, parametric statistical methods such as Cox regression lack sufficient power to detect high-order gene-gene interactions due to the sparseness of the data. Machine learning methods offer a more powerful alternative but rely on computationally-intensive searching methods to identify the top models. We propose here to develop a powerful and computationally efficient bioinformatics strategy that combines machine learning algorithm and Cox regression for identifying gene-gene and gene-environment interaction models that are associated with time of onset of chronic disease. Specifically, we firs propose to develop a novel Robust Survival Multifactor Dimensionality Reduction method (RS-MDR) for the detection of gene-gene interactions in rare variants that influence time of onset of human disease (AIM 1). The power of RS-MDR method will be evaluated by comparing it to other existing methods in simulation studies. We then propose to change the representation space of the gene-gene interaction models using RS-MDR's construction induction method and apply L1 penalized Cox regression to identify a set of interaction models that can predict patients' survival probability (AIM 2). We hypothesize that RS-MDR can effectively identify high order interaction models and the combined approach provides a powerful and computational efficient way to select a set of interaction models. We will use extensive simulations that are derived from GWAS studies to thoroughly evaluate this hypothesis. Next, we will apply the new combined method for detecting and characterizing gene-gene and gene-environment interactions in genome-wide association study (GWAS) data from large population-based studies of lung cancer and rheumatoid arthritis (AIM 3). Results from the real data analysis will be used to refine the method. Finally, we will distribute the proposed method as part of an open- source R software package (AIM 4). We anticipate that the proposed method will combine the strength from both parametric and non-parametric methods and enable detection of interaction models that are jointly affecting time of onset of chronic diseases. This is important because time of onset has more variation than case-control status and it may be more clinically relevant. Furthermore, studies of genetic factors predicting time of onset have not been pursued aggressively using GWAS studies, despite the relevance of this information for the discovery of high risk variants like mutations in BRCA1.             Narrative This project will provide a general method for genome data analysis that can be potentially apply to any specific disease. We focus the application of this method on an investigation into the role of genetic polymorphisms in lung cancer and rheumatoid arthritis. This will increase our knowledge of the basic biology and lead for screening and targeted therapy.",Bioinformatics strategies to relate age of onset with gene-gene interaction,8962812,R01LM012012,"['Affect', 'Age of Onset', 'Algorithms', 'BRCA1 gene', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biology', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Chronic Disease', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Europe', 'Gene Order', 'Genes', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic study', 'Genome', 'Genotype', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'North America', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Probability', 'Research', 'Rheumatoid Arthritis', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Staging', 'Statistical Methods', 'Testing', 'Texas', 'Time', 'United Kingdom', 'Variant', 'base', 'cancer genome', 'case control', 'clinically relevant', 'gene environment interaction', 'gene interaction', 'genome wide association study', 'high risk', 'human disease', 'novel', 'open source', 'population based', 'rare variant', 'risk variant', 'screening', 'simulation', 'targeted treatment']",NLM,DARTMOUTH COLLEGE,R01,2015,352350,0.017330456452189457

"Structure based prediction of the interactome DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Molecular interactions play a central role in all biological processes. Akin to the complete sequencing of genomes, complete descriptions of interactomes is a fundamental step towards a deeper understanding of biological processes, and has a vast potential to impact systems biology, genomics, molecular biology and therapeutics. Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) and protein-RNA interactions (PRIs) are of particular interest as they are critical in maintenance of cellular integrity, metabolism, transcription/translation, and cell-cell communication. Although high-throughput experimental PPI and PRI data is rapidly accumulating, building complete and confident datasets requires multiple replicates of expensive screens. This proposal aims to develop new methods that will significantly advance our efforts at structure-based approaches to better predict PPIs and RPIs and boost confidence in emerging high-throughput (HTP) data with the goal of comprehensive interactome mapping at lower cost. Taken together, these methods will vastly expand our understanding of macromolecular networks. We will continue to devise structure-based methods for protein-protein interaction prediction and branch out to methods for protein-RNA interaction prediction; this represents a major shift from the purely sequence-based approaches that most bioinformatics approaches utilize to predict  We will also build computational frameworks for boosting confidence in HTP protein-protein and protein-RNA interaction datasets using structure-based approaches; these frameworks will provide a comprehensive assessment of in-house and public HTP data, with potential biomedical applications such as heat shock protein-kinase interactions related to development for cancer therapeutics, MAPK6's role in a cancer-related signaling network, and (long non-coding) RNA-protein binding roles in neurodegenerative disease. Finally, we will computationally screen for PPIs and PRIs at the genome scale and expand our Struct2Net webserver to disseminate tools based on our methods and results to the community. An increasing number of HTP interaction datasets are being determined, thus presenting new opportunities to leverage this data in conjunction with structural insights to map binding sites and to uncover the underlying molecular mechanisms of cellular functions. molecular interactions and will enhance coverage and accuracy of the complete interactome. Successful completion of these aims will result in computational methods that will significantly increase our confidence in high-throughput data on protein-protein and protein-RNA interactions and will reveal fundamental aspects of their functioning, as well as testable hypotheses for experimental investigations. All developed software will be made publicly available. Biological processes are carried out through thousands of interactions between various types of molecules (the Interactome) that play fundamental roles in all biomedical processes including the maintenance of cellular integrity, metabolism, transcription/translation, and cell-cell communication. Understanding these interaction networks on a large scale will empower both rational, targeted drug design and more intelligent disease management.

"Center for Nanobiology and Predictive Toxicology    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The Center for Nanobiology and Predictive Toxicology has assembled a multidisciplinary team with expertise in nanomaterial science, toxicology, cell biology, high throughput screening, biostatistics, mathematics and computer science with the overall goal of gaining fundamental understanding of how the physical and Chemical properties of carefully selected ENM libraries relate to interactions with cells and cellular structures, including how these bio-physicochemical interactions at the nano-bio interface may lead to pulmonary toxicity. This goal will be executed through the acquisition, synthesis and characterization of compositional and combinatorial ENM libraries that focus on the major physicochemical properties of nominated metal, metal oxide and silica nanoparticles {Scientific Core), hypothesized to play a role in pulmonary toxicity through the generation of oxidative stress, inflammation, signal pathway activation and membrane lysis. These efforts will be assisted by in silico modeling that use heatmaps, mathematical models and machine learning to perform hazard ranking and risk prediction. The major objectives of the Center are: (i) To establish an overarching predictive toxicological paradigm, which is defined as the assessment of in vivo toxic potential of ENM based on in vitro and in silico methods (integrated center effort); (ii) To establish rapid throughput cellular screening and conduct imaging to identify compositional and combinatorial ENM properties that lead to bioavailability and engagement of the injury pathways discussed above (Project 1); (iii) To establish through the performance of instillation and inhalation exposures in the rodent lung how the structure-property relationships linking ENM to in vitro injury mechanisms may be predictive of pulmonary inflammation, fibrosis and cytotoxicity in a dose-dependent fashion (Project 2); (iv) To develop in silico toxicity models that utilize multivariate analysis of the rapid throughput screening and cellular imaging data to show the relationships that can be used to develop ""nano-QSARs"" for probabilistic risk ranking (Project 3).        We propose a center to study how properties of engineered nanomaterials may lead to lung health effects by creating harmful interactions in cells and tissues that will come into contact with these materials.

"Time/Space-Varying Networks of Molecular Interactions: A New Paradigm for Studyin DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A major challenge in systems biology is to quantitatively understand and model the dynamic topological and functional properties of cellular networks, such as the spatial-temporally specific and context-dependent rewiring of transcriptional regulatory circuitry and signal transduction pathways that control cell behavior. Current efforts to study biological networks have primarily focused on creating a descriptive analysis of macroscopic properties. Such simple analyses offer limited insights into the remarkably complex functional and structural organization of a biological system, especially in a dynamic context. Furthermore, most existing techniques for reconstructing molecular networks based on high-throughput data ignore the dynamic aspect of the network topology and represent it as an invariant graph. To our knowledge the network itself is rarely considered as an object that is changing and evolving. In this proposal, we aim to develop principled machine learning algorithms that reverse engineer the temporally and spatially varying interactions between biological molecules from longitudinal or spatial experimental data. Our approaches will take into account biological prior information such as transcriptional factor binding targets, gene knockout experiments, gene ontology, and PPI. Contrary to traditional co-expression studies, our methods unfold the rewiring networks underlying the entire span of the biological process. This will make it possible to discover and trace transient molecular interactions, modules, and pathways during the progression of the process. We will also develop a Bayesian formalism to model and infer the ""dynamic network tomography"" - the meta-states that determine each molecule's function and relationship to other molecules, thereby driving the evolution of the network topology, possibly in response to internal perturbations or environmental changes. Using these new tools, we will carry out a case study on time series gene expression data from organotypic models of breast cancer progression/reversal to gain insight into the mechanisms that drive the temporal rewiring of gene networks during this process. Finally we will also deliver a software platform offering the tools developed in this project to the public. So far, there has not been work done to consider temporally and spatially varying biological interactions under a unified framework. Our proposed work represents an initial foray into this important problem. Our proposed work represents a significant step forward over the current methodology. We envisage a new paradigm that facilitates: 1) Statistical inference and learning of gene networks that are evolving over space and time, possibly in response to various stimuli and possibly mediating genome-environmental interactions. 2) Thorough exploration of the underlying functional underpinnings that drive the network rewiring, dynamic trajectory, and trend of functional evolution. 3) Uncovering transient events taking place in the dynamic systems, building predictive understanding of the mechanisms of gene regulation, network formation, and evolution. 4) Fast and accurate computational algorithms, with stronger statistical guarantee and greater scalability and robustness in large-scale dynamic network analysis. 5) A full spectrum of convenient software packages and user interfaces for dynamic network analysis, available to the public. Project Narrative  We propose a systematic attempt on methodological development for the largely unexplored but practically  important problem of time- and space-varying (rather than static) gene network learning, and Bayesian  inference of the latent dynamic multi-functionality of genes/proteins in the context of such evolving networks.  We intend to apply our method to the study of the dynamic genome-microenvironmental interactions during  breast cancer progression and reversal. Since any complex biological processes such as development and  disease pathogenesis involve intricate and transient regulatory events and signal transduction, it is  unreasonable to assume that the underlying network of gene interaction is invariant throughout the process.  But modern experimental and computational methodology is not able to identify such time/space specific  network due to technical difficulty, therefore our proposed new methods for inferring evolving network, and the  functional underpinnings behind network rewiring are not only needed, but also necessary; but it is beyond the  grasp of convention methods and requires the methodological innovations we propose. Unraveling and  characterizing such dynamic activities and trajectories of biological networks can provide a more  comprehensive genetic and molecular view of complex biological processes and diseases, which may lead to  better understanding of the mechanisms driving genome-microenvironmental interactions, and identification of  key elements in the network responsible for the functional integrity of the network and the system; in addition,  such an approach will allow us to formulate hypotheses regarding the roles of these genes with respect to cell  differentiation and disease pathogenesis, and to develop improved diagnostic biomarkers and treatment  scheme.

"Predicting Resilience in the Human Microbiome     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Humans have co-evolved with complex, dynamic microbial communities that play essential roles in nutrition, metabolism, immunity, and numerous other aspects of human physiology. Hence, maintenance and recovery of key beneficial services by the microbiota in the face of disturbance is fundamental to health. Yet, stability and resilience vary in, and between individuals, and are poorly understood. Our goal is to identify features of the human microbiome that predict microbial community stability and resilience following disturbance. We propose an innovative large-scale clinical study design that will generate the necessary compositional and functional data from the most relevant ecosystem, i.e., humans!  We will develop novel statistical and mathematical methods for data integration (sparse, non-linear multi-table methods), and test existing ecological theories and apply statistical learning strategies to allow data-driven investigation of ecological and clinical properties that determine and predict stability and/or resilience. The breadth and magnitude of this project's impact are significant: We envision tests to predict microbial community responses to disturbance, and procedures to stabilize or restore beneficial microbial interactions as needed. A predictive understanding of the stability and resilience of the gut microbiota will advance the rational practice of medicine. There are three key innovative aspects to our approach: 1) sequential perturbations of different types in a large number of human subjects sampled over time; 2) multiple compositional and functional measurements made on the same samples; and 3) novel data integration methods that incorporate all of the information. Aim 1. Profile the human microbiome before, during and after multiple forms of disturbance. One hundred subjects will each be sampled at 40 time points over a 34 week study period that encompasses two types of perturbation in each subject (dietary shift, and bowel cleansing or antibiotic). From each sample, we will determine taxonomic composition, genomic content, meta-transcriptome, and metabolomic profiles. Aim 2. Discover resilience: Develop non-linear approaches for complex data integration using sparse, multiple-table methods. We will develop a novel sparse, multiple-table approach for data integration and simultaneous analysis of diverse types of complex data over time. Aim 3. Explain resilience: Use statistical learning approaches to find the predictive features that characterize resilience. Using the multiple table approach, we will compare routine unperturbed dynamics within a community to the varied responses to a perturbation, define stable states, and identify common network features characteristic of resilient communities subjected to different forms of disturbance. Finally, we wil use validation techniques to confirm these candidate predictors of community resilience.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Humans rely on the microbial communities that colonize the gut for a wide variety of critical functions, including nutrition, immune system maturation, protection against infection by disease-causing microbes, and detoxification of environmental chemicals. Daily life is punctuated by events, such as exposure to antibiotics or other chemicals, or changes in diet, that sometimes disturb or destabilize our microbial communities with potentially severe and sustained negative impacts on health. We propose an ambitious study in which we will monitor the microbial communities of healthy humans before, during and after several types of planned disturbance, and discover community features that predict future stability or future recovery from disturbance, with the expectation that our findings will fundamentally change the practice of medicine.

"Structure based prediction of the interactome     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Molecular interactions play a central role in all biological processes. Akin to the complete sequencing of genomes, complete descriptions of interactomes is a fundamental step towards a deeper understanding of biological processes, and has a vast potential to impact systems biology, genomics, molecular biology and therapeutics. Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) and protein-RNA interactions (PRIs) are of particular interest as they are critical in maintenance of cellular integrity, metabolism, transcription/translation, and cell-cell communication. Although high-throughput experimental PPI and PRI data is rapidly accumulating, building complete and confident datasets requires multiple replicates of expensive screens. This proposal aims to develop new methods that will significantly advance our efforts at structure-based approaches to better predict PPIs and RPIs and boost confidence in emerging high-throughput (HTP) data with the goal of comprehensive interactome mapping at lower cost. Taken together, these methods will vastly expand our understanding of macromolecular networks. We will continue to devise structure-based methods for protein-protein interaction prediction and branch out to methods for protein-RNA interaction prediction; this represents a major shift from the purely sequence-based approaches that most bioinformatics approaches utilize to predict  We will also build computational frameworks for boosting confidence in HTP protein-protein and protein-RNA interaction datasets using structure-based approaches; these frameworks will provide a comprehensive assessment of in-house and public HTP data, with potential biomedical applications such as heat shock protein-kinase interactions related to development for cancer therapeutics, MAPK6's role in a cancer-related signaling network, and (long non-coding) RNA-protein binding roles in neurodegenerative disease. Finally, we will computationally screen for PPIs and PRIs at the genome scale and expand our Struct2Net webserver to disseminate tools based on our methods and results to the community. An increasing number of HTP interaction datasets are being determined, thus presenting new opportunities to leverage this data in conjunction with structural insights to map binding sites and to uncover the underlying molecular mechanisms of cellular functions. molecular interactions and will enhance coverage and accuracy of the complete interactome. Successful completion of these aims will result in computational methods that will significantly increase our confidence in high-throughput data on protein-protein and protein-RNA interactions and will reveal fundamental aspects of their functioning, as well as testable hypotheses for experimental investigations. All developed software will be made publicly available.          Biological processes are carried out through thousands of interactions between various types of molecules (the Interactome) that play fundamental roles in all biomedical processes including the maintenance of cellular integrity, metabolism, transcription/translation, and cell-cell communication. Understanding these interaction networks on a large scale will empower both rational, targeted drug design and more intelligent disease management.

"Time/Space-Varying Networks of Molecular Interactions: A New Paradigm for Studyin DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A major challenge in systems biology is to quantitatively understand and model the dynamic topological and functional properties of cellular networks, such as the spatial-temporally specific and context-dependent rewiring of transcriptional regulatory circuitry and signal transduction pathways that control cell behavior. Current efforts to study biological networks have primarily focused on creating a descriptive analysis of macroscopic properties. Such simple analyses offer limited insights into the remarkably complex functional and structural organization of a biological system, especially in a dynamic context. Furthermore, most existing techniques for reconstructing molecular networks based on high-throughput data ignore the dynamic aspect of the network topology and represent it as an invariant graph. To our knowledge the network itself is rarely considered as an object that is changing and evolving. In this proposal, we aim to develop principled machine learning algorithms that reverse engineer the temporally and spatially varying interactions between biological molecules from longitudinal or spatial experimental data. Our approaches will take into account biological prior information such as transcriptional factor binding targets, gene knockout experiments, gene ontology, and PPI. Contrary to traditional co-expression studies, our methods unfold the rewiring networks underlying the entire span of the biological process. This will make it possible to discover and trace transient molecular interactions, modules, and pathways during the progression of the process. We will also develop a Bayesian formalism to model and infer the ""dynamic network tomography"" - the meta-states that determine each molecule's function and relationship to other molecules, thereby driving the evolution of the network topology, possibly in response to internal perturbations or environmental changes. Using these new tools, we will carry out a case study on time series gene expression data from organotypic models of breast cancer progression/reversal to gain insight into the mechanisms that drive the temporal rewiring of gene networks during this process. Finally we will also deliver a software platform offering the tools developed in this project to the public. So far, there has not been work done to consider temporally and spatially varying biological interactions under a unified framework. Our proposed work represents an initial foray into this important problem. Our proposed work represents a significant step forward over the current methodology.

"Center for Nanobiology and Predictive Toxicology    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The Center for Nanobiology and Predictive Toxicology has assembled a multidisciplinary team with expertise in nanomaterial science, toxicology, cell biology, high throughput screening, biostatistics, mathematics and computer science with the overall goal of gaining fundamental understanding of how the physical and Chemical properties of carefully selected ENM libraries relate to interactions with cells and cellular structures, including how these bio-physicochemical interactions at the nano-bio interface may lead to pulmonary toxicity.

"Computational Strategies for Quantitative Mapping of Genetic Interaction Networks    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recent studies suggest that many diseases, particularly those that commonly afflict our population, result from interactions among multiple alleles. In an attempt to understand these complex phenotypes, recent experimental efforts in model organisms have focused on measuring such interactions by engineering combinatorial genetic perturbations. Due to the enormous space of possible mutants, brute-force experimental investigation is simply not feasible, and thus, there is a critical need for computational strategies for intelligent exploration of genetic interaction networks. The specific objective of this application is to develop a computational framework for leveraging the existing genomic or proteomic data to enable intelligent direction of combinatorial perturbation studies. The rationale for the proposed research is that although current knowledge of genetic interactions is sparse, the integration of existing genomic and proteomic data can enable the inference of network models that suggest promising candidates for high-throughput interaction screens. Using such computational guidance should enable more efficient characterization of network structure, and ultimately, better understanding of how genes contribute to complex phenotypes.  Based on strong findings in preliminary studies, this objective will be accomplished through two specific aims: (1) development of critical normalization methods and quantitative models for colony array-based interaction assays, and (2) novel machine learning-based approaches for iterative model refinement and optimal interaction screen selection.  The proposed research is innovative because it would represent one of the first efforts to couple genomic data integration and network inference technology with a large-scale experimental effort, where several months of experimental investigation are based entirely on computational direction. Such an approach will yield insight into how combinatorial perturbations can be used to characterize global modularity and organization, and more generally, would serve as a prototype for hybrid computational-experimental strategies in other genomic contexts.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Many common diseases result from interactions among multiple genes. One approach to studying multigenic interactions is to introduce combinations of mutations in model organisms and observe how they affect the cell. This project proposes to develop computational strategies to guide and interpret these combinatorial perturbation studies, which will ultimately help us better understand and treat multigenic diseases.

"Time/Space-Varying Networks of Molecular Interactions: A New Paradigm for Studyin DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A major challenge in systems biology is to quantitatively understand and model the dynamic topological and functional properties of cellular networks, such as the spatial-temporally specific and context-dependent rewiring of transcriptional regulatory circuitry and signal transduction pathways that control cell behavior. Current efforts to study biological networks have primarily focused on creating a descriptive analysis of macroscopic properties. Such simple analyses offer limited insights into the remarkably complex functional and structural organization of a biological system, especially in a dynamic context. Furthermore, most existing techniques for reconstructing molecular networks based on high-throughput data ignore the dynamic aspect of the network topology and represent it as an invariant graph. To our knowledge the network itself is rarely considered as an object that is changing and evolving. In this proposal, we aim to develop principled machine learning algorithms that reverse engineer the temporally and spatially varying interactions between biological molecules from longitudinal or spatial experimental data. Our approaches will take into account biological prior information such as transcriptional factor binding targets, gene knockout experiments, gene ontology, and PPI. Contrary to traditional co-expression studies, our methods unfold the rewiring networks underlying the entire span of the biological process. This will make it possible to discover and trace transient molecular interactions, modules, and pathways during the progression of the process. We will also develop a Bayesian formalism to model and infer the ""dynamic network tomography"" - the meta-states that determine each molecule's function and relationship to other molecules, thereby driving the evolution of the network topology, possibly in response to internal perturbations or environmental changes. Using these new tools, we will carry out a case study on time series gene expression data from organotypic models of breast cancer progression/reversal to gain insight into the mechanisms that drive the temporal rewiring of gene networks during this process. Finally we will also deliver a software platform offering the tools developed in this project to the public. So far, there has not been work done to consider temporally and spatially varying biological interactions under a unified framework. Our proposed work represents an initial foray into this important problem. Our proposed work represents a significant step forward over the current methodology. We envisage a new paradigm that facilitates: 1) Statistical inference and learning of gene networks that are evolving over space and time, possibly in response to various stimuli and possibly mediating genome-environmental interactions. 2) Thorough exploration of the underlying functional underpinnings that drive the network rewiring, dynamic trajectory, and trend of functional evolution. 3) Uncovering transient events taking place in the dynamic systems, building predictive understanding of the mechanisms of gene regulation, network formation, and evolution. 4) Fast and accurate computational algorithms, with stronger statistical guarantee and greater scalability and robustness in large-scale dynamic network analysis. 5) A full spectrum of convenient software packages and user interfaces for dynamic network analysis, available to the public. Project Narrative  We propose a systematic attempt on methodological development for the largely unexplored but practically  important problem of time- and space-varying (rather than static) gene network learning, and Bayesian  inference of the latent dynamic multi-functionality of genes/proteins in the context of such evolving networks.  We intend to apply our method to the study of the dynamic genome-microenvironmental interactions during  breast cancer progression and reversal. Since any complex biological processes such as development and  disease pathogenesis involve intricate and transient regulatory events and signal transduction, it is  unreasonable to assume that the underlying network of gene interaction is invariant throughout the process.  But modern experimental and computational methodology is not able to identify such time/space specific  network due to technical difficulty, therefore our proposed new methods for inferring evolving network, and the  functional underpinnings behind network rewiring are not only needed, but also necessary; but it is beyond the  grasp of convention methods and requires the methodological innovations we propose. Unraveling and  characterizing such dynamic activities and trajectories of biological networks can provide a more  comprehensive genetic and molecular view of complex biological processes and diseases, which may lead to  better understanding of the mechanisms driving genome-microenvironmental interactions, and identification of  key elements in the network responsible for the functional integrity of the network and the system; in addition,  such an approach will allow us to formulate hypotheses regarding the roles of these genes with respect to cell  differentiation and disease pathogenesis, and to develop improved diagnostic biomarkers and treatment  scheme.

"Statistical Models and Inference in the Single-Molecule Approach to Biology DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The rapid advance of nanotechnology has generated much excitement in the scientific and engineering community. Its application to the biological front created the new area of single-molecule biology: Scientists were able to investigate biological processes on a molecule-by-molecule basis, opening the door to addressing many problems that were inaccessible just a few decades ago. The new frontier also raises many statistical challenges, calling upon an urgent need for new statistical inference tools and new stochastic models because of the stochastic nature of single-molecule experiments and because many classical models derived from oversimplified assumptions are no longer valid for single-molecule experiments. The current proposal focuses on the statistical challenges in the single-molecule approach to biology. The proposed research consists of three projects: (1) Using stochastic networks to model enzymatic reaction kinetics. The goal is to provide models not only biologically meaningful, but also capable of explaining the recent single-molecule experimental discoveries that contradict the classical Michaelis-Menten model. (2) Using the kernel method to infer biochemical properties from doubly stochastic Poisson process data, in particular, photon arrival data from single-molecule experiments. The goal is to develop nonparametric inference tools to recover the dependence structure, such as the autocorrelation function, from the doubly stochastic Poisson data. (3) Using bootstrap moment estimates to infer the helical diffusion of DNA-binding proteins. The goal is to elucidate how DNA-binding proteins interact with DNA, and estimate the associated energy landscape. The proposed research aims to provide essential statistical models and inference tools to study biological processes at the single-molecule level and to advance significantly our understanding of how important biological processes such as enzymatic reactions and protein-DNA interactions actually occur in our cells. The single-molecule approach to biology presents many opportunities for interdisciplinary research, calling upon collective efforts from mathematical, biological and physical scientists. The proposed research seeks to meet a high academic standard and aims to reach out to the general scientific community to collaborate and cross-fertilize the interdisciplinary field. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research is relevant to human health because both enzymatic reactions and protein-DNA interactions play fundamental roles in the healthy function of our cells. For example, deficiency of the beta- galactosidase, an enzyme studied in the proposal, can result in galactosialidosis or Morquio B syndrome; the misfunction of hOgg1, a DNA-repair protein studied in this proposal, can result in harmful genetic mutations.",Statistical Models and Inference in the Single-Molecule Approach to Biology,8280335,R01GM090202,"['Address', 'Area', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemical Reaction', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Cells', 'Communities', 'DNA', 'DNA repair protein', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'DNA-Protein Interaction', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Diffusion', 'Educational Activities', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Engineering', 'Enzymes', 'Gangliosidosis GM1', 'Gene Mutation', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Kinetics', 'Machine Learning', 'Modeling', 'Nanotechnology', 'Nature', 'Photons', 'Play', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Property', 'Research', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Students', 'Syndrome', 'Training', 'base', 'career', 'computerized data processing', 'frontier', 'graduate student', 'meetings', 'research study', 'single molecule', 'statistics', 'tool']",NIGMS,HARVARD UNIVERSITY,R01,2012,288150,0.015083584755552323
"Functional activity and inter-organismal interactions in the human microbiome    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): High-throughput sequencing has provided a tool capable of observing the human microbiome, but characterizing the biological roles and metabolic potential of these microbial communities remains a significant challenge. Increasing evidence points to the functional activity of gene products, rather than community taxonomic composition, as the most robust descriptor of the microflora's relationship with its host and as a potential point of intervention in modulating human health. Existing computational tools for exploring a newly sequenced metagenome rely heavily on sequence homology and do not yet leverage information from the thousands of publicly available functional experimental results. Likewise, no previous methods have provided genome-scale computational tools for biological hypothesis generation regarding specific molecular interactions among the microflora and with a human host. This proposal aims to develop computational methodology to interpret the functional activity of microfloral communities: 1. Integrate functional information from taxonomic, metagenomic, and metatranscriptomic datasets. We will develop methodology to unify these three representations of microbiome composition by incorporating  information from large scale functional genomic data collections. 2. Identify genomic predictors of inter-species functional activity, including host/microflora interactions and points of community-wide regulatory feedback. We will computationally screen microbiome assays for molecular interactions and regulatory motifs spanning multiple organisms in the community. 3. Implement these technologies as publicly available, accessible, and interpretable tools. We will provide freely available, open source, downloadable and web-based implementations of this methodology for use  by the bioinformatic and biological communities. As high-throughput sequencing becomes more widely used to study microbial communities in the human microbiome and in the environment, computational tools will be necessary to summarize their global functional activity and systems-level regulatory interactions.

"Structure based prediction of the interactome     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Molecular interactions play a central role in all biological processes. Akin to the complete sequencing of genomes, complete descriptions of interactomes is a fundamental step towards a deeper understanding of biological processes, and has a vast potential to impact systems biology, genomics, molecular biology and therapeutics. Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) and protein-RNA interactions (PRIs) are of particular interest as they are critical in maintenance of cellular integrity, metabolism, transcription/translation, and cell-cell communication. Although high-throughput experimental PPI and PRI data is rapidly accumulating, building complete and confident datasets requires multiple replicates of expensive screens. This proposal aims to develop new methods that will significantly advance our efforts at structure-based approaches to better predict PPIs and RPIs and boost confidence in emerging high-throughput (HTP) data with the goal of comprehensive interactome mapping at lower cost. Taken together, these methods will vastly expand our understanding of macromolecular networks. We will continue to devise structure-based methods for protein-protein interaction prediction and branch out to methods for protein-RNA interaction prediction; this represents a major shift from the purely sequence-based approaches that most bioinformatics approaches utilize to predict  We will also build computational frameworks for boosting confidence in HTP protein-protein and protein-RNA interaction datasets using structure-based approaches; these frameworks will provide a comprehensive assessment of in-house and public HTP data, with potential biomedical applications such as heat shock protein-kinase interactions related to development for cancer therapeutics, MAPK6's role in a cancer-related signaling network, and (long non-coding) RNA-protein binding roles in neurodegenerative disease. Finally, we will computationally screen for PPIs and PRIs at the genome scale and expand our Struct2Net webserver to disseminate tools based on our methods and results to the community. An increasing number of HTP interaction datasets are being determined, thus presenting new opportunities to leverage this data in conjunction with structural insights to map binding sites and to uncover the underlying molecular mechanisms of cellular functions. molecular interactions and will enhance coverage and accuracy of the complete interactome. Successful completion of these aims will result in computational methods that will significantly increase our confidence in high-throughput data on protein-protein and protein-RNA interactions and will reveal fundamental aspects of their functioning, as well as testable hypotheses for experimental investigations. All developed software will be made publicly available.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Biological processes are carried out through thousands of interactions between various types of molecules (the Interactome) that play fundamental roles in all biomedical processes including the maintenance of cellular integrity, metabolism, transcription/translation, and cell-cell communication.

"Time/Space-Varying Networks of Molecular Interactions: A New Paradigm for Studyin DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A major challenge in systems biology is to quantitatively understand and model the dynamic topological and functional properties of cellular networks, such as the spatial-temporally specific and context-dependent rewiring of transcriptional regulatory circuitry and signal transduction pathways that control cell behavior. Current efforts to study biological networks have primarily focused on creating a descriptive analysis of macroscopic properties. Such simple analyses offer limited insights into the remarkably complex functional and structural organization of a biological system, especially in a dynamic context. Furthermore, most existing techniques for reconstructing molecular networks based on high-throughput data ignore the dynamic aspect of the network topology and represent it as an invariant graph. To our knowledge the network itself is rarely considered as an object that is changing and evolving. In this proposal, we aim to develop principled machine learning algorithms that reverse engineer the temporally and spatially varying interactions between biological molecules from longitudinal or spatial experimental data. Our approaches will take into account biological prior information such as transcriptional factor binding targets, gene knockout experiments, gene ontology, and PPI. Contrary to traditional co-expression studies, our methods unfold the rewiring networks underlying the entire span of the biological process. This will make it possible to discover and trace transient molecular interactions, modules, and pathways during the progression of the process. We will also develop a Bayesian formalism to model and infer the ""dynamic network tomography"" - the meta-states that determine each molecule's function and relationship to other molecules, thereby driving the evolution of the network topology, possibly in response to internal perturbations or environmental changes. Using these new tools, we will carry out a case study on time series gene expression data from organotypic models of breast cancer progression/reversal to gain insight into the mechanisms that drive the temporal rewiring of gene networks during this process. Finally we will also deliver a software platform offering the tools developed in this project to the public. So far, there has not been work done to consider temporally and spatially varying biological interactions under a unified framework. Our proposed work represents an initial foray into this important problem. Our proposed work represents a significant step forward over the current methodology. We envisage a new paradigm that facilitates: 1) Statistical inference and learning of gene networks that are evolving over space and time, possibly in response to various stimuli and possibly mediating genome-environmental interactions. 2) Thorough exploration of the underlying functional underpinnings that drive the network rewiring, dynamic trajectory, and trend of functional evolution. 3) Uncovering transient events taking place in the dynamic systems, building predictive understanding of the mechanisms of gene regulation, network formation, and evolution. 4) Fast and accurate computational algorithms, with stronger statistical guarantee and greater scalability and robustness in large-scale dynamic network analysis. 5) A full spectrum of convenient software packages and user interfaces for dynamic network analysis, available to the public. Project Narrative  We propose a systematic attempt on methodological development for the largely unexplored but practically  important problem of time- and space-varying (rather than static) gene network learning, and Bayesian  inference of the latent dynamic multi-functionality of genes/proteins in the context of such evolving networks.  We intend to apply our method to the study of the dynamic genome-microenvironmental interactions during  breast cancer progression and reversal. Since any complex biological processes such as development and  disease pathogenesis involve intricate and transient regulatory events and signal transduction, it is  unreasonable to assume that the underlying network of gene interaction is invariant throughout the process.  But modern experimental and computational methodology is not able to identify such time/space specific  network due to technical difficulty, therefore our proposed new methods for inferring evolving network, and the  functional underpinnings behind network rewiring are not only needed, but also necessary; but it is beyond the  grasp of convention methods and requires the methodological innovations we propose. Unraveling and  characterizing such dynamic activities and trajectories of biological networks can provide a more  comprehensive genetic and molecular view of complex biological processes and diseases, which may lead to  better understanding of the mechanisms driving genome-microenvironmental interactions, and identification of  key elements in the network responsible for the functional integrity of the network and the system; in addition,  such an approach will allow us to formulate hypotheses regarding the roles of these genes with respect to cell  differentiation and disease pathogenesis, and to develop improved diagnostic biomarkers and treatment  scheme.

"Statistical Models and Inference in the Single-Molecule Approach to Biology    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The rapid advance of nanotechnology has generated much excitement in the scientific and engineering community. Its application to the biological front created the new area of single-molecule biology: Scientists were able to investigate biological processes on a molecule-by-molecule basis, opening the door to addressing many problems that were inaccessible just a few decades ago. The new frontier also raises many statistical challenges, calling upon an urgent need for new statistical inference tools and new stochastic models because of the stochastic nature of single-molecule experiments and because many classical models derived from oversimplified assumptions are no longer valid for single-molecule experiments. The current proposal focuses on the statistical challenges in the single-molecule approach to biology. The proposed research consists of three projects: (1) Using stochastic networks to model enzymatic reaction kinetics. The goal is to provide models not only biologically meaningful, but also capable of explaining the recent single-molecule experimental discoveries that contradict the classical Michaelis-Menten model. (2) Using the kernel method to infer biochemical properties from doubly stochastic Poisson process data, in particular, photon arrival data from single-molecule experiments. The goal is to develop nonparametric inference tools to recover the dependence structure, such as the autocorrelation function, from the doubly stochastic Poisson data. (3) Using bootstrap moment estimates to infer the helical diffusion of DNA-binding proteins. The goal is to elucidate how DNA-binding proteins interact with DNA, and estimate the associated energy landscape. The proposed research aims to provide essential statistical models and inference tools to study biological processes at the single-molecule level and to advance significantly our understanding of how important biological processes such as enzymatic reactions and protein-DNA interactions actually occur in our cells. The single-molecule approach to biology presents many opportunities for interdisciplinary research, calling upon collective efforts from mathematical, biological and physical scientists. The proposed research seeks to meet a high academic standard and aims to reach out to the general scientific community to collaborate and cross-fertilize the interdisciplinary field. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research is relevant to human health because both enzymatic reactions and protein-DNA interactions play fundamental roles in the healthy function of our cells. For example, deficiency of the beta- galactosidase, an enzyme studied in the proposal, can result in galactosialidosis or Morquio B syndrome; the misfunction of hOgg1, a DNA-repair protein studied in this proposal, can result in harmful genetic mutations.       	       n/a",Statistical Models and Inference in the Single-Molecule Approach to Biology,8100430,R01GM090202,"['Address', 'Area', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemical Reaction', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Cells', 'Communities', 'DNA', 'DNA repair protein', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'DNA-Protein Interaction', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Diffusion', 'Engineering', 'Enzymes', 'Gangliosidosis GM1', 'Gene Mutation', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Kinetics', 'Machine Learning', 'Modeling', 'Nanotechnology', 'Nature', 'Photons', 'Play', 'Property', 'Research', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Syndrome', 'base', 'computerized data processing', 'frontier', 'meetings', 'research study', 'single molecule', 'tool']",NIGMS,HARVARD UNIVERSITY,R01,2011,288150,0.015083584755552323
"Functional activity and inter-organismal interactions in the human microbiome    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): High-throughput sequencing has provided a tool capable of observing the human microbiome, but characterizing the biological roles and metabolic potential of these microbial communities remains a significant challenge. Increasing evidence points to the functional activity of gene products, rather than community taxonomic composition, as the most robust descriptor of the microflora's relationship with its host and as a potential point of intervention in modulating human health. Existing computational tools for exploring a newly sequenced metagenome rely heavily on sequence homology and do not yet leverage information from the thousands of publicly available functional experimental results. Likewise, no previous methods have provided genome-scale computational tools for biological hypothesis generation regarding specific molecular interactions among the microflora and with a human host. This proposal aims to develop computational methodology to interpret the functional activity of microfloral communities: 1. Integrate functional information from taxonomic, metagenomic, and metatranscriptomic datasets. We will develop methodology to unify these three representations of microbiome composition by incorporating  information from large scale functional genomic data collections. 2. Identify genomic predictors of inter-species functional activity, including host/microflora interactions and points of community-wide regulatory feedback. We will computationally screen microbiome assays for molecular interactions and regulatory motifs spanning multiple organisms in the community. 3. Implement these technologies as publicly available, accessible, and interpretable tools. We will provide freely available, open source, downloadable and web-based implementations of this methodology for use  by the bioinformatic and biological communities. As high-throughput sequencing becomes more widely used to study microbial communities in the human microbiome and in the environment, computational tools will be necessary to summarize their global functional activity and systems-level regulatory interactions. In the long term, by providing methodology to understand the human microbiome at the molecular level, we hope to enable its future use as a diagnostic indicator and as a point of intervention to improve human health.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: DNA sequencing technology has recently allowed us to examine the microorganisms naturally residing in and on the human body, many of which are beneficial and some of which can be harmful. Although we can now gather data on the cellular behavior of these microbes and on their interactions with human beings, computational tools are needed to interpret this information. By developing new software to study these communities of microorganisms, we hope to eventually be able to detect when they may be causing disease and modify their composition to improve human health.              2 Project Narrative DNA sequencing technology has recently allowed us to examine the microorganisms naturally residing in and on the human body, many of which are beneficial and some of which can be harmful.

"Structure-Based Prediction of the Interactome    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) play a central role in all biological processes. Akin to the complete sequencing of genomes, complete descriptions of interactomes is a fundamental step towards a deeper understanding of biological processes, and has a vast potential to impact systems biology, genomics, molecular biology and therapeutics. Although high-throughput biochemical approaches for discovering PPIs have proven very successful, the current experimental coverage of the interactome remains inadequate and would benefit from computational tools. The broad, long term goal of this proposal is to harness the information provided by structure-based computational approaches as a potentially high-quality, high-coverage data source for large-scale integrative approaches to interactome construction. Specifically, this project aims to: 1) develop new structure-based prediction methods that can be applied on a genome scale, and 2) integrate these predictions with other functional genomic information to predict PPIs at a genome scale. This project will also generate testable hypotheses for experimental investigations. A key product of the proposed research is the LTHREADER program, a localized threading program that will simultaneously align query sequence-pairs to templates of protein-protein interfaces. By exploiting information contained in the protein complex interfaces, it may significantly improve upon the state-of-the-art in coverage and prediction quality. Some of the core computational aspects are the development of algorithms for threading query sequence-pairs to templates (using linear programming), learning statistical potentials (SVMs), and combining multiple protein interface scores for PPI prediction (boosting). The output from such structure-based approaches will be combined with other functional genomic data in the Struct2Net framework for predicting PPIs (using random forests). A final product of the proposed research will be a comprehensive database of genome-wide PPI predictions derived from purely structure-based as well as integrative approaches. The database will also include extracellular ligand-receptor interactions.       The prediction of PPIs will enable better elucidation of extracellular and intracellular signaling networks, which has direct medical implications in terms of drug target identification. For example, a promising public-health application of this research is the rational design of therapeutics which inhibit or interfere with the binding of extracellular ligands to receptors. All the produced computational algorithms, software, and databases will be made publicly available for further studies.Relevance       Proteins interact with each other to communicate within and between cells, forming networks (the Interactome) that play fundamental roles in all biomedical processes including the maintenance of cellular integrity, metabolism, transcription/translation, and cell-cell communication. Understanding these interaction networks on a large scale will empower both rational, targeted drug design and more intelligent disease management.

"National Center: Multi-Scale Study of Cellular Networks(RMI)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  A network of molecular interactions, involving many thousands of genes, their products, and other molecules, underlie cellular processes. Investigation of these interactions across a wide range of scales ranging from the formation/activation of transcriptional complexes, to the availability of a signaling pathway, all the way to macroscopic processes, such as cell adhesion, calls for a new level of sophistication in the design of genome- wide computational approaches. A homogeneous environment for the comprehensive mapping and analysis of molecular cellular interactions in would be a powerful resource for the biomedical research community. We propose the creation of a National Center for the Multiscale Analysis of Genomic and Cellular Networks (MAGNet). The Center will provide an integrative computational framework to organize molecular interactions in the cell into manageable context-dependent components and will develop interoperable computational models and tools that can leverage such a map of cellular interactions to elucidate important biological processes. Center activities will involve a significant, multidisciplinary effort of biological and computational sciences. Specific areas of expertise include natural language parsing (NLP), machine learning (ML), software systems and engineering, databases, computational structural biology, reverse engineering of genetic networks, biomedical literature datamining, and biomedical ontologies, among others. The Center will 1) construct an evidence integration framework to collect and fuse a variety of diverse cellular interaction clues based on their statistical relevance 2) assemble a comprehensive set of physics- and knowledge-based methodologies to fill this framework 3) provide a set of methodologies and filters, anchored in formal domain ontologies, to associated specific interactions to an organism, tissue, molecular, and cellular context.

"Computational Strategies for Quantitative Mapping of Genetic Interaction Networks    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recent studies suggest that many diseases, particularly those that commonly afflict our population, result from interactions among multiple alleles. In an attempt to understand these complex phenotypes, recent experimental efforts in model organisms have focused on measuring such interactions by engineering combinatorial genetic perturbations. Due to the enormous space of possible mutants, brute-force experimental investigation is simply not feasible, and thus, there is a critical need for computational strategies for intelligent exploration of genetic interaction networks. The specific objective of this application is to develop a computational framework for leveraging the existing genomic or proteomic data to enable intelligent direction of combinatorial perturbation studies. The rationale for the proposed research is that although current knowledge of genetic interactions is sparse, the integration of existing genomic and proteomic data can enable the inference of network models that suggest promising candidates for high-throughput interaction screens.

"Statistical Models and Inference in the Single-Molecule Approach to Biology    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The rapid advance of nanotechnology has generated much excitement in the scientific and engineering community. Its application to the biological front created the new area of single-molecule biology: Scientists were able to investigate biological processes on a molecule-by-molecule basis, opening the door to addressing many problems that were inaccessible just a few decades ago. The new frontier also raises many statistical challenges, calling upon an urgent need for new statistical inference tools and new stochastic models because of the stochastic nature of single-molecule experiments and because many classical models derived from oversimplified assumptions are no longer valid for single-molecule experiments. The current proposal focuses on the statistical challenges in the single-molecule approach to biology. The proposed research consists of three projects: (1) Using stochastic networks to model enzymatic reaction kinetics. The goal is to provide models not only biologically meaningful, but also capable of explaining the recent single-molecule experimental discoveries that contradict the classical Michaelis-Menten model. (2) Using the kernel method to infer biochemical properties from doubly stochastic Poisson process data, in particular, photon arrival data from single-molecule experiments. The goal is to develop nonparametric inference tools to recover the dependence structure, such as the autocorrelation function, from the doubly stochastic Poisson data. (3) Using bootstrap moment estimates to infer the helical diffusion of DNA-binding proteins. The goal is to elucidate how DNA-binding proteins interact with DNA, and estimate the associated energy landscape. The proposed research aims to provide essential statistical models and inference tools to study biological processes at the single-molecule level and to advance significantly our understanding of how important biological processes such as enzymatic reactions and protein-DNA interactions actually occur in our cells. The single-molecule approach to biology presents many opportunities for interdisciplinary research, calling upon collective efforts from mathematical, biological and physical scientists. The proposed research seeks to meet a high academic standard and aims to reach out to the general scientific community to collaborate and cross-fertilize the interdisciplinary field. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research is relevant to human health because both enzymatic reactions and protein-DNA interactions play fundamental roles in the healthy function of our cells.

"Functional activity and inter-organismal interactions in the human microbiome    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): High-throughput sequencing has provided a tool capable of observing the human microbiome, but characterizing the biological roles and metabolic potential of these microbial communities remains a significant challenge. Increasing evidence points to the functional activity of gene products, rather than community taxonomic composition, as the most robust descriptor of the microflora's relationship with its host and as a potential point of intervention in modulating human health. Existing computational tools for exploring a newly sequenced metagenome rely heavily on sequence homology and do not yet leverage information from the thousands of publicly available functional experimental results. Likewise, no previous methods have provided genome-scale computational tools for biological hypothesis generation regarding specific molecular interactions among the microflora and with a human host. This proposal aims to develop computational methodology to interpret the functional activity of microfloral communities: 1. Integrate functional information from taxonomic, metagenomic, and metatranscriptomic datasets. We will develop methodology to unify these three representations of microbiome composition by incorporating  information from large scale functional genomic data collections. 2. Identify genomic predictors of inter-species functional activity, including host/microflora interactions and points of community-wide regulatory feedback. We will computationally screen microbiome assays for molecular interactions and regulatory motifs spanning multiple organisms in the community. 3. Implement these technologies as publicly available, accessible, and interpretable tools. We will provide freely available, open source, downloadable and web-based implementations of this methodology for use  by the bioinformatic and biological communities. As high-throughput sequencing becomes more widely used to study microbial communities in the human microbiome and in the environment, computational tools will be necessary to summarize their global functional activity and systems-level regulatory interactions. In the long term, by providing methodology to understand the human microbiome at the molecular level, we hope to enable its future use as a diagnostic indicator and as a point of intervention to improve human health.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: DNA sequencing technology has recently allowed us to examine the microorganisms naturally residing in and on the human body, many of which are beneficial and some of which can be harmful. Although we can now gather data on the cellular behavior of these microbes and on their interactions with human beings, computational tools are needed to interpret this information. By developing new software to study these communities of microorganisms, we hope to eventually be able to detect when they may be causing disease and modify their composition to improve human health.              2 Project Narrative DNA sequencing technology has recently allowed us to examine the microorganisms naturally residing in and on the human body, many of which are beneficial and some of which can be harmful.

"Time/Space-Varying Networks of Molecular Interactions: A New Paradigm for Studyin DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A major challenge in systems biology is to quantitatively understand and model the dynamic topological and functional properties of cellular networks, such as the spatial-temporally specific and context-dependent rewiring of transcriptional regulatory circuitry and signal transduction pathways that control cell behavior. Current efforts to study biological networks have primarily focused on creating a descriptive analysis of macroscopic properties. Such simple analyses offer limited insights into the remarkably complex functional and structural organization of a biological system, especially in a dynamic context. Furthermore, most existing techniques for reconstructing molecular networks based on high-throughput data ignore the dynamic aspect of the network topology and represent it as an invariant graph. To our knowledge the network itself is rarely considered as an object that is changing and evolving. In this proposal, we aim to develop principled machine learning algorithms that reverse engineer the temporally and spatially varying interactions between biological molecules from longitudinal or spatial experimental data. Our approaches will take into account biological prior information such as transcriptional factor binding targets, gene knockout experiments, gene ontology, and PPI. Contrary to traditional co-expression studies, our methods unfold the rewiring networks underlying the entire span of the biological process. This will make it possible to discover and trace transient molecular interactions, modules, and pathways during the progression of the process. We will also develop a Bayesian formalism to model and infer the ""dynamic network tomography"" - the meta-states that determine each molecule's function and relationship to other molecules, thereby driving the evolution of the network topology, possibly in response to internal perturbations or environmental changes. Using these new tools, we will carry out a case study on time series gene expression data from organotypic models of breast cancer progression/reversal to gain insight into the mechanisms that drive the temporal rewiring of gene networks during this process. Finally we will also deliver a software platform offering the tools developed in this project to the public. So far, there has not been work done to consider temporally and spatially varying biological interactions under a unified framework. Our proposed work represents an initial foray into this important problem. Our proposed work represents a significant step forward over the current methodology. We envisage a new paradigm that facilitates: 1) Statistical inference and learning of gene networks that are evolving over space and time, possibly in response to various stimuli and possibly mediating genome-environmental interactions. 2) Thorough exploration of the underlying functional underpinnings that drive the network rewiring, dynamic trajectory, and trend of functional evolution. 3) Uncovering transient events taking place in the dynamic systems, building predictive understanding of the mechanisms of gene regulation, network formation, and evolution. 4) Fast and accurate computational algorithms, with stronger statistical guarantee and greater scalability and robustness in large-scale dynamic network analysis. 5) A full spectrum of convenient software packages and user interfaces for dynamic network analysis, available to the public. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We propose a systematic attempt on methodological development for the largely unexplored but practically important problem of time- and space-varying (rather than static) gene network learning, and Bayesian inference of the latent dynamic multi-functionality of genes/proteins in the context of such evolving networks. We intend to apply our method to the study of the dynamic genome-microenvironmental interactions during breast cancer progression and reversal. Since any complex biological processes such as development and disease pathogenesis involve intricate and transient regulatory events and signal transduction, it is unreasonable to assume that the underlying network of gene interaction is invariant throughout the process. But modern experimental and computational methodology is not able to identify such time/space specific network due to technical difficulty, therefore our proposed new methods for inferring evolving network, and the functional underpinnings behind network rewiring are not only needed, but also necessary; but it is beyond the grasp of convention methods and requires the methodological innovations we propose. Unraveling and characterizing such dynamic activities and trajectories of biological networks can provide a more comprehensive genetic and molecular view of complex biological processes and diseases, which may lead to better understanding of the mechanisms driving genome-microenvironmental interactions, and identification of key elements in the network responsible for the functional integrity of the network and the system; in addition, such an approach will allow us to formulate hypotheses regarding the roles of these genes with respect to cell differentiation and disease pathogenesis, and to develop improved diagnostic biomarkers and treatment scheme.",Time/Space-Varying Networks of Molecular Interactions: A New Paradigm for Studyin,7865088,R01GM093156,"['3-Dimensional', 'Accounting', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Automobile Driving', 'Back', 'Behavior', 'Belief', 'Binding', 'Biochemical', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Process', 'Case Study', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Differentiation process', 'Cell Line', 'Cell physiology', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Dependency', 'Development', 'Developmental Process', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Neoplasm Staging', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Documentation', 'Drosophila genus', 'Drug Delivery Systems', 'Embryo', 'Engineering', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Exhibits', 'Foundations', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Proteins', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genome', 'Graph', 'Hand', 'Heel', 'Human', 'Imagery', 'Immune response', 'Indium', 'Individual', 'Internet', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Length', 'Light', 'Literature', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Nature', 'Network-based', 'Ontology', 'Organism', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathologic Processes', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiological Processes', 'Play', 'Problem Formulations', 'Process', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'RNA Interference', 'Regulation', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Pathway', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Role', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae', 'Sampling', 'Scheme', 'Science', 'Seminal', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Signal Transduction Pathway', 'Simulate', 'Software Tools', 'Solutions', 'Source', 'Staging', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Terminology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Time Study', 'Tissues', 'Trees', 'Ursidae Family', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Visual', 'Work', 'base', 'biological systems', 'cell behavior', 'combinatorial', 'computer based statistical methods', 'cost', 'design', 'driving force', 'environmental change', 'fitness', 'gene function', 'gene interaction', 'grasp', 'heuristics', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'knockout gene', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'mathematical model', 'novel', 'peer', 'prevent', 'programs', 'promoter', 'protein protein interaction', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'response', 'scale up', 'software systems', 'sound', 'success', 'tomography', 'tool', 'trait', 'trend', 'tumor progression', 'user friendly software', 'yeast two hybrid system']",NIGMS,CARNEGIE-MELLON UNIVERSITY,R01,2010,460864,0.029922500930813965
"Structure-Based Prediction of the Interactome    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) play a central role in all biological processes. Akin to the complete sequencing of genomes, complete descriptions of interactomes is a fundamental step towards a deeper understanding of biological processes, and has a vast potential to impact systems biology, genomics, molecular biology and therapeutics. Although high-throughput biochemical approaches for discovering PPIs have proven very successful, the current experimental coverage of the interactome remains inadequate and would benefit from computational tools. The broad, long term goal of this proposal is to harness the information provided by structure-based computational approaches as a potentially high-quality, high-coverage data source for large-scale integrative approaches to interactome construction. Specifically, this project aims to: 1) develop new structure-based prediction methods that can be applied on a genome scale, and 2) integrate these predictions with other functional genomic information to predict PPIs at a genome scale. This project will also generate testable hypotheses for experimental investigations. A key product of the proposed research is the LTHREADER program, a localized threading program that will simultaneously align query sequence-pairs to templates of protein-protein interfaces. By exploiting information contained in the protein complex interfaces, it may significantly improve upon the state-of-the-art in coverage and prediction quality. Some of the core computational aspects are the development of algorithms for threading query sequence-pairs to templates (using linear programming), learning statistical potentials (SVMs), and combining multiple protein interface scores for PPI prediction (boosting). The output from such structure-based approaches will be combined with other functional genomic data in the Struct2Net framework for predicting PPIs (using random forests). A final product of the proposed research will be a comprehensive database of genome-wide PPI predictions derived from purely structure-based as well as integrative approaches. The database will also include extracellular ligand-receptor interactions.       The prediction of PPIs will enable better elucidation of extracellular and intracellular signaling networks, which has direct medical implications in terms of drug target identification. For example, a promising public-health application of this research is the rational design of therapeutics which inhibit or interfere with the binding of extracellular ligands to receptors. All the produced computational algorithms, software, and databases will be made publicly available for further studies.Relevance       Proteins interact with each other to communicate within and between cells, forming networks (the Interactome) that play fundamental roles in all biomedical processes including the maintenance of cellular integrity, metabolism, transcription/translation, and cell-cell communication. Understanding these interaction networks on a large scale will empower both rational, targeted drug design and more intelligent disease management.

"Center for Nanobiology and Predictive Toxicology    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The Center for Nanobiology and Predictive Toxicology has assembled a multidisciplinary team with expertise in nanomaterial science, toxicology, cell biology, high throughput screening, biostatistics, mathematics and computer science with the overall goal of gaining fundamental understanding of how the physical and Chemical properties of carefully selected ENM libraries relate to interactions with cells and cellular structures, including how these bio-physicochemical interactions at the nano-bio interface may lead to pulmonary toxicity. This goal will be executed through the acquisition, synthesis and characterization of compositional and combinatorial ENM libraries that focus on the major physicochemical properties of nominated metal, metal oxide and silica nanoparticles {Scientific Core), hypothesized to play a role in pulmonary toxicity through the generation of oxidative stress, inflammation, signal pathway activation and membrane lysis. These efforts will be assisted by in silico modeling that use heatmaps, mathematical models and machine learning to perform hazard ranking and risk prediction. The major objectives of the Center are: (i) To establish an overarching predictive toxicological paradigm, which is defined as the assessment of in vivo toxic potential of ENM based on in vitro and in silico methods (integrated center effort); (ii) To establish rapid throughput cellular screening and conduct imaging to identify compositional and combinatorial ENM properties that lead to bioavailability and engagement of the injury pathways discussed above (Project 1); (iii) To establish through the performance of instillation and inhalation exposures in the rodent lung how the structure-property relationships linking ENM to in vitro injury mechanisms may be predictive of pulmonary inflammation, fibrosis and cytotoxicity in a dose-dependent fashion (Project 2); (iv) To develop in silico toxicity models that utilize multivariate analysis of the rapid throughput screening and cellular imaging data to show the relationships that can be used to develop ""nano-QSARs"" for probabilistic risk ranking (Project 3).        We propose a center to study how properties of engineered nanomaterials may lead to lung health effects by creating harmful interactions in cells and tissues that will come into contact with these materials.

"A Simulation Tool to Enable Identification of Critical Network Interactions Using    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): One of the main challenges in the discovery of intracellular biomarkers and identification of therapeutic targets is the lack of a mechanistic understanding of the complex underlying pathways. The tremendous increase in both the quantity and diversity of cellular data represents a significant challenge to researchers seeking to construct biologically relevant interaction maps, and objectively extract specific actionable information. Machine learning based clustering algorithms serve as a preliminary statistical data analysis metric, but they fail to capture the data in the proper biological context. While chemical kinetics based models have proved to be effective in elucidating the pathway mechanisms, accurate estimates for the model parameters are severely lacking and are often impossible to obtain owing to the inherent difficulties involved in making dynamic measurements of specific intracellular phenomena. Additionally, methods for rational prioritization and selection of critical intracellular interactions (in the absence of kinetic information) are sorely lacking. Therefore, there is a clear need for innovative software tools that enable quantitative analysis of available microarray data in a biological pathway context, ultimately leading to the objective identification of critical biological interactions, providing a direction for more focused future efforts. We propose to address this challenge by developing an automated software platform that utilizes microarray data to select and merge relevant canonical biological pathway models thereby placing significantly expressed genes in their biological context. The analysis software will utilize a microarray expression-weighted metric to objectively rank the most critical interactions within the network model using a novel chemical kinetics-free Boolean dynamics algorithm. In the Phase I effort, we will develop a software tool composed of an R library that enables the automated generation of a pathway model from a given microarray dataset. Additionally, a methodology, and associated R library will be developed to objectively rank critical interactions in the pathway model, using a microarray data expression-weighted metric. Demonstration and validation of proposed algorithm will be carried out using a well characterized lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulated RAW 264.7 macrophage system. In Phase II, we will extend the scope of the algorithmic framework to include proteomic and metabolomic weighting in the objective ranking of critical interactions, and add workflow improvements through the addition of a graphical user interface (GUI). Experimental verification and validation of critical interactions identified in Phase I will be carried out using gene-silencing techniques. We also intend to establish collaborative partnerships with commercial entities. The proposing team has extensive experience in the areas of systems biology and bioinformatics (CFDRC) and microarray data analysis (Shawn Levy, University of Vanderbilt). CFDRC has a strong track record in the commercialization of software and hardware. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Recently, there has been a tremendous increase in both the amount and diversity of cellular data available to researchers, representing a clear need for the development of advanced computational analysis software to enable the discovery of biomarkers of disease states, and identification of new therapeutic targets. However, currently available analysis tools do not consider the data in a proper biological context. This research proposes to develop an automated software platform that utilizes available data to develop and analyze mathematical models of complex processes in an automated fashion, resulting in the identification of critical intracellular processes.             n/a",A Simulation Tool to Enable Identification of Critical Network Interactions Using,7482734,R43GM084890,"['Address', 'Advanced Development', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Complex', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer software', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Future', 'Gene Silencing', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genomics', 'Kinetics', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Lipopolysaccharides', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Metric', 'Microarray Analysis', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phase', 'Process', 'Proteomics', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Software Tools', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Title', 'Universities', 'Urination', 'Validation', 'Weight', 'base', 'chemical kinetics', 'commercialization', 'editorial', 'experience', 'graphical user interface', 'innovation', 'macrophage', 'mathematical model', 'metabolomics', 'network models', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'simulation', 'therapeutic target', 'tool']",NIGMS,CFD RESEARCH CORPORATION,R43,2008,99571,0.021939709197496417

"System-wide Study of Transcriptional Control of Metabolism    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal is in response to the NIH call for Exploratory Collaborations with National Centers for Biomedical Computing, PAR-06-223, and it will involve a collaboration between Columbia University's MAGNet NCBC and a team at Los Alamos National Laboratory. The aim of the proposal is a system-wide tudy of integrated transcriptional and metabolic networks in Eschericia coli K-12 strain, aiming at a similar analysis of a pathogen, Bacillus anthracis, at a later date. LANL hosts an experimental research program on bacterial metabolomics. Metabolites serve several functions. The most common one is being the precursors to various cellular components. They are also regulators of cellular functions by means of modulating metabolic reactions or binding to transcription factors and subsequently regulating gene expression. Conversely, the genes regulated by a transcription factor often encode enzymes, modulating the speed of metabolic reactions. Thus, to understand and ultimately predict the cellular response to an environmental change of interest (e.g., pathogen entry into its host environment), we must integrate the analysis of the transcriptome and metabolome. To address this need, we will work with the laboratories of Pat Unkefer and John Dunbar, which will produce data sets of about 300 joint metabolic/transcriptional profiles of E.coli under different steady-state growth conditions. The resources of MAGnet NCBC, specifically the algorithms within the geWorkbench bioinformatics platform produced by the center, will be leveraged to reconstruct cellular networks. Specifically, we expect that ARACNE, an algorithm originally developed by MAGNet for high-fidelity analysis of transcriptional networks in mammalian cells, is well positioned for reconstruction of metabolic networks from high throughput system-wide metabolic activity data, provide that appropriate modifications to deal with the specifics of the metabolic data are made. We will also adapt the algorithm to discover modulated interactions, that is, metabolic interactions that are conditional on the activity of a modulator gene (enzyme), or transcriptional interactions that require the presence of a metabolite to proceed. Such integrated genome/metabolome analysis has not been attempted yet. It will be a giant leap towards a complete understanding of cellular processes in an important organism. Because of the comparatively small size of bacterial genomes and metabolomes, it will be possible to perform system-wide analyses of interactions for the entire integrated genome and metabolome. While important in its own right, especially in view of the pathogenic nature of B. anthracis, this research would also represent an important test bed for a subsequent study of metabolic diseases in higher animals, including humans.           n/a",System-wide Study of Transcriptional Control of Metabolism,7387471,R21GM080216,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Affinity', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Architecture', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Automobile Driving', 'B-Cell Lymphomas', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Bacillus anthracis', 'Bacterial Genome', 'Beds', 'Benchmarking', 'Binding', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Biochemical Reaction', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Computing', 'Biomedical Research', 'Cadherins', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules', 'Cell Separation', 'Cell physiology', 'Cell-Cell Adhesion', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Commit', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational Biology', 'Computational Technique', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Concentration measurement', 'Condition', 'Crystallography', 'DNA Binding', 'DNA-Protein Interaction', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Dissection', 'Documentation', 'Drug Formulations', 'Drug Interactions', 'Educational workshop', 'Electrical Engineering', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Enzyme Gene', 'Enzymes', 'Escherichia coli', 'Family', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Gene Proteins', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Determinism', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Head', 'Health Sciences', 'Human', 'Imagery', 'Immune system', 'In Vitro', 'Informatics', 'Institutes', 'Institution', 'Internet', 'Java', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Language', 'Life', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Mails', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammalian Cell', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Mathematics', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Control', 'Metabolic Diseases', 'Metabolism', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Molecular Structure', 'Multimedia', 'Nature', 'Noise', 'Online Systems', 'Ontology', 'Organism', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Performance', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Phenotype', 'Phosphotransferases', 'Physics', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Principal Investigator', 'Process', 'Prokaryotic Cells', 'Property', 'Protein Analysis', 'Protein Family', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Publishing', 'RNA', 'Range', 'Rate', 'Reaction', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Proposals', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Semantics', 'Sequence Analysis', 'Services', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Software Engineering', 'Solutions', 'Source Code', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Specificity', 'Speed', 'Structural Protein', 'Structure', 'Structure of germinal center of lymph node', 'Students', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Virulence', 'Visual', 'Work', 'base', 'biocomputing', 'biomedical informatics', 'computer framework', 'computer studies', 'computerized tools', 'concept', 'data acquisition', 'data mining', 'data modeling', 'design', 'environmental change', 'experience', 'forging', 'hazard', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'interoperability', 'knowledge base', 'member', 'metabolomics', 'microbial', 'multidisciplinary', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'pathogenic bacteria', 'professor', 'programs', 'protein protein interaction', 'reconstruction', 'research study', 'response', 'simulation', 'size', 'software development', 'text searching', 'tool', 'transcription factor']",NIGMS,LOS ALAMOS NAT SECTY-LOS ALAMOS NAT LAB,R21,2008,220227,0.01510686036769654

"System-wide Study of Transcriptional Control of Metabolism    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal is in response to the NIH call for Exploratory Collaborations with National Centers for Biomedical Computing, PAR-06-223, and it will involve a collaboration between Columbia University's MAGNet NCBC and a team at Los Alamos National Laboratory. The aim of the proposal is a system-wide tudy of integrated transcriptional and metabolic networks in Eschericia coli K-12 strain, aiming at a similar analysis of a pathogen, Bacillus anthracis, at a later date. LANL hosts an experimental research program on bacterial metabolomics. Metabolites serve several functions. The most common one is being the precursors to various cellular components. They are also regulators of cellular functions by means of modulating metabolic reactions or binding to transcription factors and subsequently regulating gene expression. Conversely, the genes regulated by a transcription factor often encode enzymes, modulating the speed of metabolic reactions. Thus, to understand and ultimately predict the cellular response to an environmental change of interest (e.g., pathogen entry into its host environment), we must integrate the analysis of the transcriptome and metabolome. To address this need, we will work with the laboratories of Pat Unkefer and John Dunbar, which will produce data sets of about 300 joint metabolic/transcriptional profiles of E.coli under different steady-state growth conditions. The resources of MAGnet NCBC, specifically the algorithms within the geWorkbench bioinformatics platform produced by the center, will be leveraged to reconstruct cellular networks. Specifically, we expect that ARACNE, an algorithm originally developed by MAGNet for high-fidelity analysis of transcriptional networks in mammalian cells, is well positioned for reconstruction of metabolic networks from high throughput system-wide metabolic activity data, provide that appropriate modifications to deal with the specifics of the metabolic data are made. We will also adapt the algorithm to discover modulated interactions, that is, metabolic interactions that are conditional on the activity of a modulator gene (enzyme), or transcriptional interactions that require the presence of a metabolite to proceed. Such integrated genome/metabolome analysis has not been attempted yet. It will be a giant leap towards a complete understanding of cellular processes in an important organism. Because of the comparatively small size of bacterial genomes and metabolomes, it will be possible to perform system-wide analyses of interactions for the entire integrated genome and metabolome. While important in its own right, especially in view of the pathogenic nature of B. anthracis, this research would also represent an important test bed for a subsequent study of metabolic diseases in higher animals, including humans.           n/a",System-wide Study of Transcriptional Control of Metabolism,7234993,R21GM080216,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Affinity', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Architecture', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Automobile Driving', 'B-Cell Lymphomas', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Bacillus anthracis', 'Bacterial Genome', 'Beds', 'Benchmarking', 'Binding', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Biochemical Reaction', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Computing', 'Biomedical Research', 'Cadherins', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules', 'Cell Separation', 'Cell physiology', 'Cell-Cell Adhesion', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Commit', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational Biology', 'Computational Technique', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Concentration measurement', 'Condition', 'Crystallography', 'DNA Binding', 'DNA-Protein Interaction', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Dissection', 'Documentation', 'Drug Formulations', 'Drug Interactions', 'Educational workshop', 'Electrical Engineering', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Enzyme Gene', 'Enzymes', 'Escherichia coli', 'Family', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Gene Proteins', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Determinism', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Head', 'Health Sciences', 'Human', 'Imagery', 'Immune system', 'In Vitro', 'Informatics', 'Institutes', 'Institution', 'Internet', 'Java', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Language', 'Life', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Mails', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammalian Cell', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Mathematics', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Control', 'Metabolic Diseases', 'Metabolism', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Molecular Structure', 'Multimedia', 'Nature', 'Noise', 'Online Systems', 'Ontology', 'Organism', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Performance', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Phenotype', 'Phosphotransferases', 'Physics', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Principal Investigator', 'Process', 'Prokaryotic Cells', 'Property', 'Protein Analysis', 'Protein Family', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Publishing', 'RNA', 'Range', 'Rate', 'Reaction', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Proposals', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Semantics', 'Sequence Analysis', 'Services', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Software Engineering', 'Solutions', 'Source Code', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Specificity', 'Speed', 'Structural Protein', 'Structure', 'Structure of germinal center of lymph node', 'Students', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Virulence', 'Visual', 'Work', 'base', 'biocomputing', 'biomedical informatics', 'computer framework', 'computer studies', 'computerized tools', 'concept', 'data acquisition', 'data mining', 'data modeling', 'design', 'environmental change', 'experience', 'forging', 'hazard', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'interoperability', 'knowledge base', 'member', 'metabolomics', 'microbial', 'multidisciplinary', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'pathogenic bacteria', 'professor', 'programs', 'protein protein interaction', 'reconstruction', 'research study', 'response', 'simulation', 'size', 'software development', 'text searching', 'tool', 'transcription factor']",NIGMS,LOS ALAMOS NAT SECTY-LOS ALAMOS NAT LAB,R21,2007,257655,0.01510686036769654

"Integration and analysis tools for protein interaction networks    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The growing size and diversity of biological databases has necessitated the design of new scalable tools that can search across multiple databases and integrate information from multiple data sources. We propose to develop software for integrating and understanding protein-protein interactions, a fundamental problem in biology. A set of tools will be developed for constructing large-scale probabilistic networks of protein interactions using data sources such as microarrays, bioimages, GO annotations, genomic data, literature, and experimental data. The techniques will be based on Bayesian networks (BN) and Support Vector Machines (SVM), and will be made scalable to large datasets. The second goal is to develop tools for analyzing interaction networks for pathway discovery, motif finding, and function identification. These tools will be based on current research in the areas of graph algorithms, bioinformatics, machine learning, and databases. We will target two model organisms: S. cerevisiae (yeast) and C. elegans (worm). The quality of the constructed networks will be evaluated with known protein interactions for these species. Scalability tests will be performed with the worm interactome that is about ten times larger than the yeast interactome. The developed tools will be compatible with current standards and integrated into a database backend. The resulting software will enable assimilation of heterogeneous biological data with the ultimate goal of increased understanding of fundamental processes in molecular biology. The goal of this Phase I project is to prove the feasibility of constructing and analyzing probabilistic protein interaction networks in a scalable manner using new algorithms. The integration of diverse data sources such as microarrays, genomics, literature, and high-throughput experiments into pathways will facilitate the study the biological processes behind human diseases. The understanding of protein interactions within a pathway and interactions between pathways will lead to the selection of appropriate targets for therapeutic intervention, and eventually to cheaper and faster drug discovery.             n/a",Integration and analysis tools for protein interaction networks,7155257,R43RR022659,"['information systems', 'model', 'protein protein interaction', 'proteins']",NCRR,"ACELOT, INC.",R43,2006,199950,0.0028146797870796476

"Bayesian Machine Learning Tools for Analyzing Microbiome Dynamics The human microbiota plays an important role in health and disease, and its therapeutic manipulation is being actively investigated for a wide range of diseases that span every NIH institute. Our microbiota are inherently dynamic, and analyzing these time-dependent properties is key to robustly linking the microbiota to disease, and predicting the effects of therapies targeting the microbiota; indeed, longitudinal microbiome data is being acquired with increasing frequency, and is a major component of many NIH-funded projects. However, there is currently a dearth of computational tools for analyzing microbiome time-series data, which presents several special challenges including high measurement noise, irregular and sparse temporal sampling, and complex dependencies between variables. The objective of this proposal is to introduce new capabilities, improve on, and provide state-of-the-art implementations of tools for analyzing dynamics, or patterns of change in microbiome time-series data. The tools we develop will use Bayesian machine learning methods, which are well-recognized for their strong conceptual and practical advantages, particularly in biomedical domains. Tools will be rigorously tested and validated on synthetic and real human microbiome data, including publicly available datasets and those from collaborators providing 16S rRNA sequencing, metagenomic, and metabolomics data. We propose three specific aims. For Aim 1, we will develop integrated Bayesian machine learning tools for predicting population dynamics of the microbiome and its responses to perturbations. These tools will include a new model that simultaneously learns groups of microbes with similar interaction structure and predicts their behavior over time, and that incorporates prior phylogenetic information. The model will be further improved by incorporating stochastic microbial dynamics and errors in measurements throughout the model. For Aim 2, we will develop Bayesian machine learning tools to predict host status from microbiome dynamics. The tools will learn easily interpretable, human-readable rules that predict host status from microbiome time-series data, and will be further extended to handle a variety of longitudinal study designs. For Aim 3, we will engineer our microbiome dynamics analysis software tools for optimal performance, ease-of- use, maintainability, extensibility, and dissemination to the community. In total, the proposed work will yield a suite of contemporary software tools for analyzing microbiome dynamics, with expected broad use and major impact. The software will allow investigators to answer important scientific and translational questions about the microbiome, including discovering which microbial taxa or their metagenomes are affected over time by perturbations such as changes in diet or invasion by pathogens; predicting the effects of these perturbations over time, including changes in composition or stability of the gut microbiota; and finding temporal signatures in multi-‘omic microbiome data that predict disease risk in the human host. The human microbiota, or collection of micro-organisms living on and within us, plays an important role in health, and when disrupted or abnormal, may contribute to many types of diseases including infections, kidney diseases, bowel diseases, diabetes, heart diseases, arthritis, allergies, brain diseases, and cancer. Sophisticated computer-based tools are needed to make sense of human microbiota data, particularly time- series data, which can yield important insights into how our microbiomes change over time. This work will develop new and improved computer-based tools for analyzing microbiota time-series data, which will be made freely available and will enable scientists to increase our fundamental knowledge about how our microbiota affect us and ultimately to apply this knowledge to prevent and treat human illnesses.",Bayesian Machine Learning Tools for Analyzing Microbiome Dynamics,10015315,R01GM130777,"['16S ribosomal RNA sequencing', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Antibiotics', 'Arthritis', 'Autoimmunity', 'Bayesian learning', 'Behavior', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Models', 'Brain Diseases', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Childhood', 'Clostridium difficile', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dependence', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diet', 'Disease', 'Engineering', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Health', 'Heart Diseases', 'Human', 'Human Microbiome', 'Hypersensitivity', 'Infection', 'Institutes', 'Intervention', 'Intestines', 'Investigation', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Medical', 'Metagenomics', 'Microbe', 'Modeling', 'Names', 'Noise', 'Oligosaccharides', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phylogenetic Analysis', 'Play', 'Population Dynamics', 'Property', 'Pythons', 'Readability', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Shotguns', 'Software Engineering', 'Software Tools', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Time Series Analysis', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'base', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'disorder risk', 'dynamic system', 'gut microbiota', 'human data', 'human microbiota', 'human subject', 'improved', 'insight', 'learning algorithm', 'machine learning method', 'man', 'metabolomics', 'metagenome', 'microbial', 'microbiome', 'microbiome analysis', 'microbiome sequencing', 'microbiota', 'microorganism', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'open source', 'pathogen', 'predictive tools', 'prevent', 'recurrent infection', 'response', 'software development', 'targeted treatment', 'tool']",NIGMS,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2020,312939,0.06718728968016723
"Adaptive Reproducible High-Dimensional Nonlinear Inference for Big Biological Data Big data is now ubiquitous in every field of modern scientific research. Many contemporary applications, such as the recent national microbiome initiative (NMI), greatly demand highly flexible statistical machine learning methods that can produce both interpretable and reproducible results. Thus, it is of paramount importance to identify crucial causal factors that are responsible for the response from a large number of available covariates, which can be statistically formulated as the false discovery rate (FDR) control in general high-dimensional nonlinear models. Despite the enormous applications of shotgun metagenomic studies, most existing investigations concentrate on the study of bacterial organisms. However, viruses and virus-host interactions play important roles in controlling the functions of the microbial communities. In addition, viruses have been shown to be associated with complex diseases. Yet, investigations into the roles of viruses in human diseases are significantly underdeveloped. The objective of this proposal is to develop mathematically rigorous and computationally efficient approaches to deal with highly complex big data and the applications of these approaches to solve fundamental and important biological and biomedical problems. There are four interrelated aims. In Aim 1, we will theoretically investigate the power of the recently proposed model-free knockoffs (MFK) procedure, which has been theoretically justified to control FDR in arbitrary models and arbitrary dimensions. We will also theoretically justify the robustness of MFK with respect to the misspecification of covariate distribution. These studies will lay the foundations for our developments in other aims. In Aim 2, we will develop deep learning approaches to predict viral contigs with higher accuracy, integrate our new algorithm with MFK to achieve FDR control for virus motif discovery, and investigate the power and robustness of our new procedure. In Aim 3, we will take into account the virus-host motif interactions and adapt our algorithms and theories in Aim 2 for predicting virus-host infectious interaction status. In Aim 4, we will apply the developed methods from the first three aims to analyze the shotgun metagenomics data sets in ExperimentHub to identify viruses and virus-host interactions associated with several diseases at some target FDR level. Both the algorithms and results will be disseminated through the web. The results from this study will be important for metagenomics studies under a variety of environments. Big data is ubiquitous in biological research. Identifying causal factors associated with complex diseases or traits from big data is highly important and challenging. New statistical and computational tools will be developed to control False Discovery Rate (FDR) for molecular sequence data based on the novel model-free knockoffs framework. They will be used to detect sequence motifs for viruses and motif-pairs for virus-host interactions, and to analyze multiple metagenomics data sets related to complex diseases.",Adaptive Reproducible High-Dimensional Nonlinear Inference for Big Biological Data,9923688,R01GM131407,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Archaea', 'Attention', 'Bacteria', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Bypass', 'Cells', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Consult', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Ecosystem', 'Effectiveness', 'Environment', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Gaussian model', 'Genes', 'Genetic Materials', 'Genomics', 'Healthcare', 'Human', 'Internet', 'Investigation', 'Joints', 'Length', 'Linear Regressions', 'Literature', 'Liver Cirrhosis', 'Mathematics', 'Metagenomics', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutation', 'Neurosciences', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Non-linear Models', 'Obesity', 'Organism', 'Performance', 'Planet Earth', 'Play', 'Procedures', 'Reproducibility', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Studies', 'Shotguns', 'Social Sciences', 'Testing', 'Theoretical Studies', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Viral', 'Virus', 'Visualization software', 'Work', 'base', 'biological research', 'computerized tools', 'contig', 'dark matter', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'design', 'flexibility', 'high dimensionality', 'human disease', 'human tissue', 'improved', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning method', 'metagenomic sequencing', 'microbial community', 'microbiome', 'microbiome research', 'model design', 'model development', 'new technology', 'novel', 'power analysis', 'response', 'simulation', 'statistical and machine learning', 'theories', 'trait', 'user-friendly', 'virus host interaction', 'virus identification']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,R01,2020,276700,0.042180320064067016
"Structure based Prediction of the interactome The interactions of small molecules with proteins is not only omnipresent throughout cellular processes, but also of fundamental importance to drug design and disease treatment. Much like with protein-protein and protein-RNA interactions, high-throughput (HTP) experimental methods have led to the generation of enormous volumes of protein-small molecule and related data. However, in addition to sheer scale, high degrees of heterogeneity in these data, combined with proprietary ownership concerns when originating from within industry, present significant challenges to the sharing and full use of this data in basic research and therapeutic development. This proposal aims to develop new mathematical methods that can address not only interpreting the data itself, but also the collaborative and generative process through which researchers work: new cryptographic tools can enable unprecedented forms of secure sharing and collaboration between industry and the public, and deep learning of structural features can reduce the dependence of researchers on prior assumptions as to important predictors of drug-target interactions (DTI).  In our previous granting period, we successfully developed methods for structure-based prediction and HTP data analysis of protein-protein and protein-RNA interactions, uncovering novel biology (e.g., for neurodegenerative diseases). In this renewal, we aim to: 1) develop scalable methods for multi-party computation and differential privacy to enable the secure sharing of large proprietary drug-target interaction databases among industry and public researchers; 2) develop novel integrative machine learning approaches for identifying drug-target interactions based on interactome, molecular structure and chemogenomic data (in collaboration with co-I Jian Peng); and 3) establish innovative collaborations with industry, academia and the scientific community to drive use and adoption of these computational tools and technologies among practicing biomedical researchers.  Successful completion of these aims will provide both public and private research communities with scalable access to technologies for secure sharing of proprietary drug screening data as well as flexible, accurate tools for predicting drug-target interactions. All developed software will be made available via publicly accessible web-based portals under open source software licenses. Collaborations with research partners will validate the relevance of these tools to human health and disease, while the dissemination aim will ensure research communities convenient and ongoing access to these innovations. Narrative The interactions of small molecules with proteins are omnipresent throughout cellular processes and of fundamental importance to drug design and disease treatment, yet the task of predicting these interactions brings major challenges because of the heterogeneity and proprietary nature of the data.

"Evidence Extraction Systems for the Molecular Interaction Literature Burns, Gully A. Abstract  In primary research articles, scientists make claims based on evidence from experiments, and report both the claims and the supporting evidence in the results section of papers. However, biomedical databases de- scribe the claims made by scientists in detail, but rarely provide descriptions of any supporting evidence that a consulting scientist could use to understand why the claims are being made. Currently, the process of curating evidence into databases is manual, time-consuming and expensive; thus, evidence is recorded in papers but not generally captured in database systems. For example, the European Bioinformatics Institute's INTACT database describes how different molecules biochemically interact with each other in detail. They characterize the under- lying experiment providing the evidence of that interaction with only two hierarchical variables: a code denoting the method used to detect the molecular interaction and another code denoting the method used to detect each molecule. In fact, INTACT describes 94 different types of interaction detection method that could be used in conjunction with other experimental methodological processes that can be used in a variety of different ways to reveal different details about the interaction. This crucial information is not being captured in databases. Although experimental evidence is complex, it conforms to certain principles of experimental design: experimentally study- ing a phenomenon typically involves measuring well-chosen dependent variables whilst altering the values of equally well-chosen independent variables. Exploiting these principles has permitted us to devise a preliminary, robust, general-purpose representation for experimental evidence. In this project, We will use this representation to describe the methods and data pertaining to evidence underpinning the interpretive assertions about molecular interactions described by INTACT. A key contribution of our project is that we will develop methods to extract this evidence from scientiﬁc papers automatically (A) by using image processing on a speciﬁc subtype of ﬁgure that is common in molecular biology papers and (B) by using natural language processing to read information from the text used by scientists to describe their results. We will develop these tools for the INTACT repository but package them so that they may then also be used for evidence pertaining to other areas of research in biomedicine. Burns, Gully A.

"Modeling Emergent Behaviors in Systems Biology: A Biological Physics Approach Project Summary Biology is full of stunning examples of emergent behaviors – behaviors that arise from, but cannot be reduced to, the interactions of the constituent parts that make up the system under consideration. These behaviors span the full spectrum of length scales, from the emergence of distinct cell fates (e.g. neurons, muscle, etc.) due to the interactions of genes within cells, to the formation of complex ecological communities arising from the interactions of thousands of species. The overarching goal of my research is to develop new conceptual, theoretical, and computational tools to model such emergent, system-level behaviors in biology. To do so, we utilize an interdisciplinary approach that is grounded in Biological Physics, but draws heavily from Machine Learning, Information Theory, and Theoretical Ecology. Our work is unified and distinguished by our deep commitment to integrating theory with the vast amount of biological data now being generated by modern DNA sequencing-based techniques and quantitative microscopy. An important goal of the proposed research is to find common concepts and tools that transcend traditional biological sub-disciplines and models systems. The proposed research pursues four distinct but conceptually interrelated research directions: (1) understanding how distinct cell fates emerge from bimolecular interactions within mammalian cells (2) investigating how bimolecular networks within cells exploit energy consumption to improve computations, with applications to Synthetic Biology; (3) identifying the ecological principles governing community assembly in microbial communities and developing techniques for synthetically engineering ecological communities; and (4) developing new machine learning algorithms and techniques for biological data analysis. In addition to developing physics-based models for diverse biological phenomena, the proposed research will yield a series of practical important tools and algorithms which we will make publically available including: (1) a new linear-algebra based algorithm for assessing the fidelity of directed differentiation and cellular reprogramming protocols and visualizing reprogramming/differentiation dynamics and (2) improved algorithms for inferring microbial interactions in the human microbiome from high-throughput sequence data. These computational tools will allow scientists to realize the immense therapeutic potential of cellular reprogramming and microbial ecology-based techniques for studying and treating human disease.

"Computational Explorations of Unconventional Approaches to Control Noncovalent Interactions PROJECT SUMMARY The research interests of my group are rooted in explorations of new and useful conceptual models to improve the control and prediction of noncovalent interactions. Our research involves the use of a variety of computational quantum chemical tools, applications of density functional theory (DFT), cheminformatics, and machine-learning methods. A premise of our research is that aromaticity may be used to modulate many types of noncovalent interactions (such as hydrogen bonding, π-stacking, anion-π interactions). The reciprocal relationship we find, between “aromaticity” in molecules and the strengths of “noncovalent interactions,” is surprising especially since they are typically considered as largely separate ideas in chemistry. The innovation of this research is that it will enable use of intuitive “back-of-the-envelope” electron-counting rules (such as the 4n+2πe Hückel rule for aromaticity) to make predictions of experimental outcomes regarding the impact of noncovalent interactions. A five-year goal is to realize the use of our conceptual models in real synthetic examples prepared by our experimental collaborators. My research vision is to bridge discoveries of innovative concepts to their practical impacts for biomedical and biomolecular research. PROJECT NARRATIVE This research proposal includes four projects that are jointly motivated by the challenge to control and predict noncovalent interactions in organic and biomolecular systems. The proposed work involves applications of a variety of computational quantum chemical tools and synergistic investigations with experimental collaborators. We seek to identify new and useful concepts to guide experimental designs of novel “non-natural” molecular systems (e.g., receptors, biosensors, and hydrogels) that have potential biomedical applications.",Computational Explorations of Unconventional Approaches to Control Noncovalent Interactions,10016376,R35GM133548,"['Anions', 'Back', 'Biosensor', 'Chemicals', 'Chemistry', 'Electrons', 'Experimental Designs', 'Goals', 'Hydrogels', 'Hydrogen Bonding', 'Intuition', 'Investigation', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Outcome', 'Plant Roots', 'Research', 'Research Project Summaries', 'Research Proposals', 'System', 'Vision', 'Work', 'cheminformatics', 'density', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'machine learning method', 'novel', 'quantum computing', 'receptor', 'theories', 'tool']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF HOUSTON,R35,2020,377200,0.06857005388060812
"Bioinformatics and Chemical Biology Approaches for Identifying Bioactive Natural Products of Symbiotic Actinobacteria Project Summary/Abstract Fungal and bacterial pathogens are a major threat to human health. Few therapeutics exist to treat fungal infections while bacteria are becoming increasingly resistant to existing therapeutics. Humans have been using natural products to treat infections for thousands of years, long before the causal agents of infection were understood. Natural products have continued to be used as therapeutics in the modern age of medicine. Rates of rediscovery of known natural products have increased in traditional sources of natural products, such as soil bacteria. Recently, symbiotic Actinobacteria from insect agricultural systems have been recognized as a promising source of bioactive compounds, especially antifungal agents. These bacteria often produce natural products that defend an insect’s fungal crop from pathogenic fungus. The work proposed here will use chemical biology approaches such as phenotypic interaction screens, genomics, and a new bioinformatics approach to systematically search for bioactive natural products produced by Actinobacteria symbionts and other organisms in insect agricultural systems. The first part of this proposal focuses on using existing techniques to identify new bioactive natural products. Phenotypic interaction screens can identify bioactive natural products by determining if a symbiotic bacteria produces a natural product that inhibits the growth of a fungal pathogen and vice-versa. We will then use genomic sequencing, bioinformatics, and heterologous expression to identify and characterize biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) that are not expressed in the phenotypic interaction screens. The second part of the proposed work involves the use of a new bioinformatics technique to identify interesting bioactive natural products. Existing bioinformatics techniques identify BGCs and predict the most likely chemical structure of the corresponding natural product. However, they do not conclude anything concerning the functional role that the natural product plays. The technique developed here will use machine learning to predict the function that the natural product fulfills in the ecological context of the organism. This algorithm will facilitate the identification of bioactive natural products with therapeutically relevant functions. Project Narrative Fungal infections are an underappreciated threat to human health with high mortality rates and few effective therapeutic agents for treatment. Symbiotic Actinobacteria from insect agricultural systems are a promising source of antifungal agents since they often produce natural products with antifungal activity protecting an insect’s fungal crop from pathogenic fungus. The work proposed here will use phenotypic interaction screens, genome sequencing, and the development of a novel bioinformatics method to systematically mine Actinobacteria for antifungal and antibacterial products – leading to the discovery of new bioactive small molecules along with a deeper understanding of how natural products mediate the interaction between species in insect agricultural systems.",Bioinformatics and Chemical Biology Approaches for Identifying Bioactive Natural Products of Symbiotic Actinobacteria,9963295,F32GM128267,"['Actinobacteria class', 'Age', 'Agriculture', 'Algorithms', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents', 'Antibiotics', 'Antifungal Agents', 'Ants', 'Bacteria', 'Bacterial Antibiotic Resistance', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Breathing', 'Chemical Structure', 'Chemicals', 'Collaborations', 'Computational Biology', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Ecosystem', 'Gene Cluster', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Human', 'Infection', 'Insecta', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modernization', 'Molecular Structure', 'Mycoses', 'Natural Products', 'Organism', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Public Health', 'Resistance', 'Role', 'Soil', 'Source', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Validation', 'Work', 'algorithm development', 'base', 'bioactive natural products', 'drug discovery', 'fungus', 'genetic information', 'genome sequencing', 'human disease', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mortality', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'pathogenic bacteria', 'pathogenic fungus', 'post-doctoral training', 'prediction algorithm', 'small molecule', 'symbiont']",NIGMS,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,F32,2020,65310,0.0326821741365368
"Imaging Molecular Level Details of Collagen Fibers by VSFG Microscopy In this proposed project, we plan to fill the knowledge gap of the relationships between microscopic self-assembled structures, collagen-molecule interactions and macroscopic fiber morphologies of type-I collagen, the primary component of most human tissues and a commonly used biomaterial for tissue engineering. By investigating collagen-water and collagen-protein interactions in in vitro systems that mimic basic aspects of physiologically relevant three- dimensional fibrillar tissue architectures, we aim to fill knowledge gaps in fundamental collagen research. We will achieve this goal by developing a hyperspectral imaging technique – vibrational sum frequency generation (VSFG) microscopy – at high repetition rates (400 kHz) and apply it to collagen. The long-term vision is to develop new biophysics methods to reveal molecular-level structures and interactions for pericellular space research and other complex biological environments, and eventually applying it to study various pericellular environment related diseases. In order to correlate spectral features to microscopic and macroscopic structures of type I collagen, we plan to apply machine-learning techniques to analyze our data and extract spectral signatures of collagen’s micro/macrostructures. We will two major scientific focuses: (A) understanding molecular signatures of microscopic self-assembly fibrils structures and its relationship to the macroscopic morphology (plan 1 and 2); and (B) investigating molecular level collagen-molecule interactions (plan 3 and 4). Specific plans include:  1. Obtaining hyperspectral VSFG images of collagen tissues to study their morphology in a  label free and non-invasive manner  2. Establishing molecular spectral signatures of self-assembled collagen fibril structures  3. Understanding collagen-water interaction in first solvation layer of collagen fibers.  4. Imaging spatial locations of chemicals and peptides that interact with collagens. If successful, the significance is that a label free, vibrational mode specific imaging technique specific for pericellular space will be available, which can reveal molecular level insights of collagen structures and its interactions with surrounding molecules, pertinent to fibrosis and cell— pericellular space interaction related diseases. This proposed project contributes to the scope of NIGMS by developing new technology to reveal fundamental molecular-level principle, mechanism and signatures related to morphology of collagen I at both micro- and macroscopic scales, and collagen-molecule interactions, laying foundations for biophysical/biochemical principles for future biomedical applications related to collagens. This proposed development of vibrational sum frequency generation microscopy, in the short term, will spatially resolve collagen tissues with chemical structure and molecular interaction information in a complicated environment. Machine learning and simulation approaches will be employed to build a data base to convert hyperspectral images of collagen into a spatial map with microscopic structures and molecular interaction information. In the long term, the fundamental biochemical knowledge learned from this development will lay foundations for rationally design biomedical approaches to monitor and control pericellular spaces and its interaction with cells, and further advance treatment to diseases related to it.",Imaging Molecular Level Details of Collagen Fibers by VSFG Microscopy,10028946,R35GM138092,"['3-Dimensional', 'Architecture', 'Binding', 'Biochemical', 'Biocompatible Materials', 'Biological', 'Biophysics', 'Cells', 'Chemical Structure', 'Chemicals', 'Collagen', 'Collagen Fiber', 'Collagen Fibril', 'Collagen Type I', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Fiber', 'Fibrosis', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'In Vitro', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Microscopic', 'Microscopy', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Monitor', 'Morphology', 'National Institute of General Medical Sciences', 'Peptides', 'Physiological', 'Proteins', 'Research', 'Structure', 'Sum', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Tissue Engineering', 'Tissues', 'Vision', 'Water', 'biophysical techniques', 'design', 'human tissue', 'image reconstruction', 'insight', 'molecular imaging', 'new technology', 'self assembly', 'simulation', 'vibration']",NIGMS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R35,2020,393958,0.00663435511894674

"Combining chemical and computational tools for predictive models of microbiome communities ABSTRACT The gut microbiome has a tremendous impact on health and disease, actively contributing to obesity, diabetes, inflammatory bowel disease, cardiovascular diseases, and several poorly understood neurological disorders. We do not yet have the necessary tools to precisely probe these microbial communities, though such tools could unlock extensive benefits to human health. Elucidating the contributions of individual species or consortia of bacteria would provide a rational basis for understanding microbiota-controlled disease and lead to novel therapies. To carry out the fundamental research planned in this proposal, we will tackle three major problems: First, we will build the first set of molecular tools that effectively and precisely modulate the microbiome bacteria; second, we will analyze the multiscale dynamics of microbial communities; and third, we will construct an ingestible biosensor for real-time monitoring of microbiome populations. Although antibiotics and fecal transplants can reconfigure microbial consortia, they do not precisely target individual bacteria. Conversely, antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) have evolved to selectively attack pathogenic bacteria but do not target microbiome bacteria, constituting desirable scaffolds for molecular engineering and potential sources of microbiome-targeting agents. We will develop a new computational peptide design methodology, based on classical and hybrid-quantum mechanical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, to create a groundbreaking assessment of the dynamical and emergent properties of AMPs. Chemical synthesis and large-scale screening will confirm predicted selectivity against microbiome species, and a machine learning workflow will connect sequences of individual peptides to their dynamics and activity. We will then apply the synthetic AMPs to interrogate the human microbiome by selectively removing species during bacterial consortia experiments, to be carried out in bioreactors, under regular or anaerobic conditions. We will pair our experiments with whole-cell metabolic network models, providing a systems biology perspective to the analysis of inter-species interactions. An integrated ingestible biosensing device will be developed to monitor the microbiome by electrochemically sensing unique biomarkers from gut microbes. This will provide the first real-time measurements of microbiome composition and will be integrated to our bioreactors for testing, to ultimately be used for in vivo tests. This work will build the first set of molecular and computational tools for microbiome engineering and will lay the foundation to address critical gaps in our understanding of the gut micro-environment, and of the contributions of gut bacteria to the etiology of disease. Grounded in our demonstrated expertise in synthetic biology, computer science, microbiology, and electrical engineering, this project will provide a computational- experimental framework for developing a peptide encyclopedia for the gut microbiome, in line with NIH's public health mission and goals.

"Model-guided design of next-generation bacterial therapeutics to treat cardiovascular disease PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT It is becoming increasingly evident that the composition and metabolites produced by the human gut microbiome influence the progression of cardiovascular diseases. While we are continuing to discover important associations between the gut microbiome and human physiology and diseases, we lack the tools and methodology to precisely manipulate gut microbiota to benefit human health. We propose to develop computational models and optimization frameworks to predict community dynamics and functions and design interventions to shift the gut microbiome to desired states. We will design novel bacterial therapeutics that operate autonomously in the mammalian gastrointestinal tract to steer the microbiome towards healthy states. These next-generation bacterial therapeutics will sense important gut microbiome metabolites, process information, and deliver species- specific antimicrobial proteins to reshape the dynamics and functions of this ecosystem. The performance of these bacterial therapeutics will be characterized in vitro using synthetic human gut microbiome communities and in gnotobiotic mouse models of cardiovascular disease. Model-guided microbiome engineering has the potential to transform human medicine and is becoming increasingly important as scientists continue to discover connections between the microbiome and human health and disease. PROJECT NARRATIVE Recent studies have shown close connections between the human gut microbiome and cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), which are the leading cause of death worldwide. While engineering of the gut microbiome holds tremendous potential as a novel therapeutic strategy for CVD, we currently lack the tools and methodology required to design interventions that precisely shift the structure and function of the gut microbiome.

"Predicting and analyzing variation in cellular interactomes Project Summary Over the last two decades, significant experimental efforts have determined large sets of “reference” interactions for humans and other model organisms, along with substantial knowledge about the binding specificities of proteins, including for a large fraction of human transcription factors (TFs). The resulting data have proven to be an incredibly useful resource for understanding how cells function; nevertheless, they do not capture how molecular interactions and networks are different from the reference across individuals. Indeed, while human genomes in both healthy and disease populations are rapidly being sequenced, the corresponding individual-specific interaction networks remain largely unexamined; this represents a major gap in our knowledge, as mutations that alter molecular interactions underlie a wide range of human diseases. Further, the substantial amount of genetic variation across populations makes it infeasible in the near term to experimentally determine per-individual interaction networks. Thus our long-term goal is to develop computational methods to uncover whether and how mutations within coding and non-coding portions of the genome perturb cellular interactions and networks. Our specific aims are: (1) We will develop computational structure-based approaches to identify and catalog, at proteome-scale, variations within proteins that are likely to impact their ability to bind with DNA, RNA, small molecules, peptides or ions, thereby providing a comprehensive resource for analyzing protein interaction variation. (2) We will develop novel structure-based and probabilistic methods to predict how DNA-binding specificities are altered when a TF is mutated; since mutated TFs have been linked to numerous diseases, this will be a great aid in understanding disease networks and pathology. (3) We will develop new methods to uncover non-coding somatic mutations that alter human regulatory networks in cancer; this is a critical step towards ultimately uncovering patient-specific cancer networks. Overall by pursuing these aims—which integrate mutational information with existing knowledge about reference interactions, interfaces and specificities—we will develop novel computational methods that will significantly advance our understanding of molecular interactions perturbed in disease and healthy contexts. Narrative The proposed research will yield new software tools that predict whether specific genetic mutations alter molecular interactions and networks. Since many human diseases are caused by mutations that affect molecular interactions, this research will expand our understanding of the underlying basis of disease and will provide new avenues for diagnosis and treatment.",Predicting and analyzing variation in cellular interactomes,9896829,R01GM076275,"['Affect', 'Alleles', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animal Model', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Binding Sites', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Catalogs', 'Cell physiology', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'DNA', 'DNA Binding', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'DNA-Protein Interaction', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Internet', 'Ions', 'Knowledge', 'Ligand Binding', 'Link', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Mutagenesis', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'Organism', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Peptides', 'Play', 'Population', 'Property', 'Protein Analysis', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'RNA', 'Regulator Genes', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Site', 'Software Tools', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'Work', 'Zinc Fingers', 'base', 'cancer genome', 'disease-causing mutation', 'experimental study', 'human disease', 'improved', 'interest', 'knowledge base', 'machine learning method', 'novel', 'predictive tools', 'preference', 'small molecule', 'software development', 'transcription factor', 'tumor', 'virtual']",NIGMS,PRINCETON UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,312660,0.03834168408704729
"Precision Medicine in Sarcoidosis ABSTRACT Sarcoidosis is a systemic inflammatory disease of unknown etiology characterized by non-caseating granulomas in affected organs, primarily in the lungs. Approximately 30% of patients with sarcoidosis progress to debilitating disease; however, the drivers of susceptibility or resilience to disease remain poorly understood. An inflammatory response to an undefined antigen is postulated as the etiology of granuloma formation, and the pathogenesis has been suggested to involve gene-pathogen interaction, yet analysis of single genes or microbes has not proven applicable to diagnosis of all forms of sarcoidosis. Indeed, rather than a single organism, the disease may represent an interaction between the community of organisms that comprise the lung microbiome (community of organisms that live in and on us) and the host immune response. We propose that understanding the microbiome/host interaction will suggest strategies for precision medicine approaches to sarcoidosis. This proposal addresses this significant gap by investigating interactions between the lung microbiome, host immune and clinical responses in sarcoidosis using multiomics approaches – a critically innovative strategy. Our preliminary data support our novel hypotheses. First, we identified distinct lung microbiomes that differentiated patients with sarcoidosis versus controls. Second, our results identified biomarkers of disease severity that were associated with decreased lung function. Third, a recurrent analytic theme that emerged, regardless of the type of -omic analysis, was that sarcoidosis is characterized by pathways related to apoptosis and autophagy, which is consistent with our observation of decreased abundance of peripheral lymphocytes and functional immune anergy. These data led us to our Overall Hypothesis: Lung microbiome and host immune interactions characterized by apoptosis and autophagy pathways influence sarcoidosis clinical course. This hypothesis will be tested by an observational prospective and validation study of sarcoidosis patients at 5 time points to facilitate time series analyses. Aims 1 and 2 focus on lung microbiome or host immune responses, respectively, in relation to clinical course of sarcoidosis. Using these data in Aim 3, predictive models will be constructed based on integrated data of metagenomic and host-immune interactions. The novelty and significance of our multiomics strategy is to construct models for precision medicine therapies to harness bioinformatic strategies into focused, patient-specific approaches. The long-term significance of this study is to define pathways for sarcoidosis progression or resolution, and to develop database of these findings to further develop more precise, testable, models. PROJECT NARRATIVE Sarcoidosis is a disease of unknown etiology that predominately affects the lung and may affect other organs. We propose to construct a model to predict sarcoidosis progression or resolution by identifying microbial and immune interactions. We postulate that these models will be helpful in designing therapeutic options.",Precision Medicine in Sarcoidosis,9851921,R01HL138628,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Antigens', 'Apoptosis', 'Apoptotic', 'Autophagocytosis', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Process', 'Blood', 'Bronchoalveolar Lavage', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Disease model', 'Etiology', 'Feces', 'Genes', 'Granuloma', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immunity', 'Inflammatory', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Lung', 'Lymphocyte', 'Messenger RNA', 'Metagenomics', 'Methods', 'MicroRNAs', 'Microbe', 'Modeling', 'Organ', 'Organism', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Peripheral', 'Phenotype', 'Predisposition', 'Prospective Studies', 'Recurrence', 'Resolution', 'Respiratory physiology', 'Sarcoidosis', 'Severity of illness', 'Taxonomy', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Time Series Analysis', 'Tissue-Specific Gene Expression', 'anergy', 'base', 'clinical predictors', 'clinically relevant', 'cytokine', 'deep sequencing', 'design', 'host microbiome', 'indexing', 'inflammatory marker', 'innovation', 'lung microbiome', 'machine learning algorithm', 'metagenome', 'metagenomic sequencing', 'microbial', 'microbiome', 'multiple omics', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'outcome forecast', 'pathogen', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'resilience', 'response', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'validation studies']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT CHICAGO,R01,2020,914660,-0.01572117732415492
"Automated, model-guided phenotyping to identify metabolite/gene/microbe interactions Project Summary/Abstract DNA sequencing has spawned the “microbiome revolution” -- thousands of microbes and a dizzying number of microbial interactions that are associated with human health and disease. Unfortunately, most species in the microbiome are known only by a (partial) genome. The limited phenotypic data on newly discovered bacteria reveal species that behave unlike any of our model organisms. While genome-scale modeling plays an important role in understanding the microbiome, the paucity of phenotypic data for most species prevents detailed simulation of the microbial communities that affect our health. This project will develop an automated system for profiling, synthesizing, and modeling microbial communities. The center of our approach is Deep Phenotyping, an automated robotic platform that performs complex growth experiments on demand. Data from Deep Phenotyping will be used to train metabolic and statistical models of the oral pathogens Streptococcus mutans and Candida albicans to predict conditions that keep both microbes in a nonpathogenic state. Project Narrative The microbiome revolution has uncovered thousands of species of bacteria with roles in health and disease. This project automates the identification of interactions between environments, genes, and the microbes that live in and around us. Understanding these interactions is a critical step in re-engineering the microbiome to improve human health.","Automated, model-guided phenotyping to identify metabolite/gene/microbe interactions",9852330,R21EB027396,"['Affect', 'Animal Model', 'Antibiotics', 'Area', 'Bacteria', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Candida albicans', 'Carbon', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Collaborations', 'Combinatorics', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'DNA sequencing', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Exposure to', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Human', 'Human Microbiome', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Knock-out', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Microbe', 'Microbiology', 'Modeling', 'Oral', 'Oral candidiasis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Regulator Genes', 'Research Personnel', 'Robotics', 'Role', 'Shapes', 'Source', 'Statistical Models', 'Streptococcus mutans', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Work', 'base', 'combinatorial', 'cost', 'design', 'dysbiosis', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'fitness', 'fungus', 'genome-wide', 'improved', 'instrumentation', 'large datasets', 'metabolomics', 'microbial', 'microbial community', 'microbiome', 'microorganism interaction', 'network models', 'open source', 'oral pathogen', 'pathogenic fungus', 'phenotypic data', 'preference', 'prevent', 'screening', 'simulation', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transposon sequencing']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT URBANA-CHAMPAIGN,R21,2020,178949,0.07522692958137435
"Continuous Probing of Nanoconstruct-Cell Interactions at Biologically Relevant Time Scales PROJECT SUMMARY  This proposal aims to develop live-cell, multi-channel imaging tools that can visualize—continuously, and in real time—nanoparticle interactions with cellular components. We will focus on several different time windows, where early time periods will monitor nanoparticle-cell membrane binding and uptake and later times will track endosomal accumulation and escape. The ability to resolve temporally and spatially how particle size/shape and ligand density affects interactions in 3D is critical for determining structure-activity-relationships and mechanism of action in live cells. To characterize interactions of functional nanoparticles with different cellular structures at physiologically relevant times, we propose to design a multi-channel optical microscope integrated with an opto- splitter and custom live-cell imaging chamber. Simultaneous images can be acquired in different channels of the fluorescence of dye-labeled organelles and dye-labeled ligands on the particles as well as differential interference contrast (DIC) signals of whole cells, cellular components, and nanoparticle cores. Correlation of structural and functional images provides a powerful window into how local nanoconstruct interactions can mediate a biological response. For model systems, we will compare gold nanoconstructs with oligonucleotide ligand shells of both targeting (DNA aptamers) or non-targeting (siRNA) properties. Nanoparticle shape enables a unique handle to probe rotation and orientation of intracellular particle interactions. This work can bridge a gap in understanding the behavior of nanoconstructs intracellularly and how the integrity and presentation of oligonucleotides in ligand shells affects targeting and other processes such as endosomal escape, which is critical to assess therapeutic efficacy. RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH  This proposal aims to design tools that can visualize nanoparticle interactions with cells at distinct time points with biological relevance. Our ultimate goal is to evaluate how nanoconstructs interact with cellular membranes and sub-cellular components. Such results may impact how nanoparticle shape and ligand density can inform design of particle-based drug delivery agents.",Continuous Probing of Nanoconstruct-Cell Interactions at Biologically Relevant Time Scales,10021435,R01GM131421,"['3-Dimensional', 'Affect', 'Behavior', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'Biological Process', 'Cell Communication', 'Cell membrane', 'Cells', 'Cellular Membrane', 'Cellular Structures', 'Chemicals', 'Chemistry', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complex', 'Custom', 'DNA', 'Diagnostic', 'Drug Delivery Systems', 'Dyes', 'Endosomes', 'Environment', 'Eukaryotic Cell', 'Event', 'FDA approved', 'Fluorescence', 'Functional Imaging', 'Glioblastoma', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Image', 'Imaging Device', 'Immune response', 'Label', 'Ligands', 'Lipid Bilayers', 'Mediating', 'Membrane', 'Membrane Proteins', 'Microscope', 'Microscopy', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Multiple Partners', 'Nomarski Interference Contrast Microscopy', 'Nucleic Acids', 'Oligonucleotides', 'Optics', 'Organelles', 'Particle Size', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Raman Spectrum Analysis', 'Role', 'Rotation', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Small Interfering RNA', 'Structure', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Surface', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Work', 'aptamer', 'base', 'density', 'design', 'experimental study', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'interest', 'live cell imaging', 'machine learning algorithm', 'multimodality', 'nanoparticle', 'nanoparticle drug', 'nanoprobe', 'nanoscale', 'optical imaging', 'particle', 'plasmonics', 'programs', 'response', 'simulation', 'tool', 'trafficking', 'tumor', 'uptake']",NIGMS,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,198306,0.0469315370457432
