"Discovery and Validation of AMD Biomarkers for Progression Using Deep Learning Project Abstract Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the leading cause of blindness among elderly individuals. Currently there are no proven effective therapies for treatment of advanced non-neovascular AMD, termed geographic atrophy (GA). Earlier intervention may be preferable, but this would require identification of those individuals with the highest risk for progression to atrophy. Over the last two decades, various studies including ours have identified several optical coherence tomography (OCT)-based factors that appear to associate with a higher risk for AMD progression. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that a deep learning - artificial intelligence (AI) construct can objectively and automatically learn and quantify the most important risk factors, yielding a better prediction of AMD progression risk than current subjectively specified features. In this proposal, we will first develop an AI- based system to automatically identify the “subjectively-specified” high risk factors based on individual spectral domain (SD) OCT 2D scans, and to automatically segment GA (the end-stage outcome variable of AMD) in OCT 2D en face maps. Subsequently, as a proof-of-concept study of our hypothesis, we will apply an AI-based “reverse learning” approach to objectively learn and identify AMD high risk factors in longitudinal OCT data. To achieve these objectives, we will pursue the following specific aims: Aim 1: Develop and validate an AI approach to classify individual OCT 2D scans as containing or not containing the pre-specified risk factor(s). In our previous work, we manually identified the presence or absence of the pre-specific high-risk factors and assigned to a risk score based on the entire OCT volume. Such approach was time consuming and not precise. In this proposal, an AI algorithm will be applied to detect the high risk factors from individual OCT scans. Hence, the precision of the scoring system can be greatly enhanced with high computational complexity. Aim 2: Develop and validate an AI approach to segment GA lesions from 2D OCT en face maps. For the OCT volumes having atrophy, we will perform the GA segmentation from the choroidal hypertransmission-resulted en face map using the multi-scale CNNs. Aim 3: Develop and validate an AI “reverse learning” approach to objectively identify the high risk factors using longitudinal OCT data. The “reverse learning” will be based on the multiple CNNs, followed by de- convolutional networks to identify the high risk factors objectively. Our previous scoring system will possibly be refined and optimized by the potential inclusion (or substitution) of novel risk factors derived from our objective AI approaches. The work in this proposal will be performed retrospectively in SD-OCT images from the image data pool that the multi-PI Sadda has aggregated over years as the director of the Doheny image reading center. Project Narrative Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the leading cause of blindness among elderly individuals and it may be preferable to intervene at an earlier stage in the disease process. We propose to use artificial intelligence techniques to automatically and objectively identify and quantify end-stage atrophy as well to identify the features on spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT), which are associated with a higher risk for progression to late atrophic AMD. This research should have implications for clinical practice in the staging and monitoring of AMD patients, as well as facilitating new therapeutic trials for AMD.",Discovery and Validation of AMD Biomarkers for Progression Using Deep Learning,9807978,R21EY030619,"['3-Dimensional', 'Age related macular degeneration', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Atrophic', 'Back', 'Biological Markers', 'Blindness', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Consensus', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Drusen', 'Early Intervention', 'Early intervention trials', 'Elderly', 'Future', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Monitor', 'Neurons', 'Nonexudative age-related macular degeneration', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Process', 'Reading', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Residual state', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Scanning', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Staging', 'Staging System', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Therapeutic Trials', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Visit', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'effective therapy', 'follow-up', 'geographic atrophy', 'high risk', 'imaging Segmentation', 'improved', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'primary outcome', 'prognostic', 'research study']",NEI,DOHENY EYE INSTITUTE,R21,2019,235500,0.02117488927301486
"Using natural language processing and machine learning to identify potentially preventable hospital admissions among outpatients with chronic lung diseases Project Summary Patients living with chronic lung diseases (CLDs) are frequently admitted to the hospital for potentially preventable causes. Such admissions may be discordant with patient preferences and/or represent a low-value allocation of health system resources. To anticipate such admissions, existing clinical prediction models in this ﬁeld typically produce an “all-cause” risk estimate which, even if accurate, overlooks the actionable mechanisms behind admis- sion risk and therefore fails to identify a prescribed response. This limitation may explain the only modest – at best – reductions in hospital admissions and readmissions seen in most intervention bundles that have been tested in this population. An opportunity exists, therefore, to predict hospitalization risk while simultaneously identifying patient phenotypes (i.e. some constellation of social, demographic, clinical, and other characteristics) for which known preventive interventions exist. The proposed study seeks to overcome these limitations and capitalize on this opportunity by (1) conducting semi-structured interviews with hospitalized patients with CLDs, and their caregivers and clinicians, to directly identify modiﬁable risks and their associated phenotypes driving hospital ad- missions; (2) using natural language processing techniques (NLP) to build classiﬁcation models that will leverage nuanced narrative, social, and clinical information in the unstructured text of clinical encounter notes to identify patients with these phenotypes; and (3) building risk prediction model focused on actionable phenotypes with a wide-array of traditional regression and machine learning approaches while also incorporating large numbers of predictor variables from text data and accounting for time-varying trends. The candidate's preliminary work using basic NLP techniques to signiﬁcantly improve the discrimination of clinical prediction models in an inpatient population has motivated this methodologic approach. The rising burden and costs of hospitalizations associated with CLDs, and the increasing attention from federal payers, highlights the critical nature of this work. Completion of this research will build upon the candidate's past training, which includes a Masters of Science in Health Policy Research obtained with NHLBI T32 support, and will provide the experience, education, and mentorship to allow the candidate to become a fully independent investigator. Based on the candidate's tailored training plan, he will acquire advanced skills in mixed-methods research, NLP, and trial design all through coursework, close men- toring and supervision, and direct practice. The skills will position him ideally to submit successful R01s testing the deployment of the proposed clinical prediction models in real-world settings. The candidate's primary mentor, collaborators, and advisors will ensure adherence to the proposed timeline and goals and provide a support- ive environment for him to develop an independent research career testing the real-world deployment of clinical prediction models to reduce low-value and preference-discordant care for patients with CLDs. Project Narrative Every year many people living with chronic lung diseases are admitted to the hospital despite the fact that some of these admissions may have been prevented with early identiﬁcation and intervention prior to the hospitalization. Previous attempts at preventing such hospitalizations have been limited by their ability to both accurately identify those at risk, and because most risk models do not provide a reason for the likely admission. The proposed work draws directly on the experiences of patients with chronic lung diseases who are admitted to a hospital, and then uses cutting edge statistical and computer science techniques to use information in the electronic health record to accurately predict the risk and the likely reason for future hospital admissions.",Using natural language processing and machine learning to identify potentially preventable hospital admissions among outpatients with chronic lung diseases,9681485,K23HL141639,"['Accounting', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adherence', 'Admission activity', 'Adult', 'Ambulatory Care', 'Attention', 'Automobile Driving', 'Bioinformatics', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Chronic lung disease', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Comorbidity', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Diagnosis', 'Discrimination', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Education', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health Policy', 'Health system', 'Home environment', 'Hospital Costs', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Inpatients', 'Interstitial Lung Diseases', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Machine Learning', 'Master of Science', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Nurses', 'Outpatients', 'Palliative Care', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Preferences', 'Patients', 'Pennsylvania', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Policy Research', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Primary Health Care', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Estimate', 'Social support', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'TimeLine', 'Training', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Work', 'administrative database', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'computer science', 'cost', 'design', 'discrete data', 'end of life', 'experience', 'hospital readmission', 'improved', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'interest', 'model development', 'modifiable risk', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'preference', 'prevent', 'randomized trial', 'response', 'risk prediction model', 'skills', 'social', 'supportive environment', 'trend', 'trial design']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,K23,2019,195076,0.007537522558565853
"SURPASS: (Statin Use and Risk Prediction of Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease in minority Subgroups) PROJECT SUMMARY Despite advances in technology, cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains the leading cause of death, disability, and healthcare costs in the U.S. Yet, there is a tremendous gap in accurate cardiovascular risk prediction and prevention, particularly in racial/ethnic minorities. Furthermore, there is significant heterogeneity in CVD risks and outcomes for disaggregated Hispanic and Asian subgroups. The current cardiovascular risk assessment tools have not been well-validated in these diverse populations, and it remains largely unknown why minority patients are less likely to start and more likely to stop life-saving therapies. The overall goal of Dr. Rodriguez’s K01 application is to address gaps in knowledge about CVD prediction and treatment in understudied racial/ethnic minority populations. The proposed study will utilize the electronic health record (EHR) data from an established NHLBI-funded cohort enriched with disaggregated Hispanic and Asian patients. Using this cohort, Dr. Rodriguez will first test the ACC/AHA Pooled Cohort Equations in disaggregated Asian and Hispanic subgroups using a large diverse mixed-payer cohort of 1,234,751 patients from two large healthcare systems in Northern California and Hawaii. Secondly, she will build new CVD risk prediction models for diverse patient subgroups using machine learning techniques. Finally, she will identify reasons for statin underuse and discontinuation using natural language processing in the EHR. This study, which will evaluate existing data from real-world clinical practice in a stable population, will inform future risk prediction models and cholesterol treatment guidelines for diverse racial/ethnic groups. The proposal is aligned with the NHBLI’s strategic goals to eliminate health disparities and inequities by leveraging epidemiology and data science to understand and solve complex health problems. This proposal will also prepare Dr. Rodriguez to meet her long-term goal of becoming a national leader and independent investigator in CVD prevention and minority health. The proposed didactic and applied data science experiences, including training in advanced epidemiological methods and machine learning, will prepare Dr. Rodriguez to apply her research to other areas of CVD prevention and populations. This training program builds on the strengths of Stanford University in health services research, epidemiology, and biomedical informatics. Her mentorship team, led by Dr. Latha Palaniappan, includes experts in cardiovascular prevention and health services research (Dr. Heidenreich, co-mentor), applied statistical analyses (Dr. Robert Tibshirani, advisor), machine learning in the EHR (Dr. Nigam Shah, advisor), and chronic disease prediction and medical decision making (Dr. Michael Pignone, advisor). Dr. Rodriguez’s team is committed to ensuring the success of the proposal as well as overseeing her advanced training in their respective areas of expertise. The research and training plan proposed in this K01 application will develop Dr. Rodriguez into a unique and highly-skilled clinician researcher ready to compete for R-level funding and launch her independent research career. ! PROJECT NARRATIVE Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death for racial/ethnic minority groups in the U.S., yet current CVD risk prediction algorithms fail to adequately assess risk in these populations. The proposal will address this substantial knowledge gap by validating current risk prediction models in racial/ethnic minority subgroups, improving risk prediction using modern machine learning techniques, and identifying reasons for statin discontinuation. Findings from this study will provide the foundation for clinical guidelines, research agendas, and public health interventions to improve CVD prevention strategies in diverse populations. !",SURPASS: (Statin Use and Risk Prediction of Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease in minority Subgroups),9645316,K01HL144607,"['Address', 'Adherence', 'American', 'American Heart Association', 'Area', 'Asians', 'Assessment tool', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Biometry', 'Calibration', 'California', 'Cardiology', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cause of Death', 'Cholesterol', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Decision Making', 'Diagnosis', 'Discrimination', 'Disease Outcome', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Epidemiology', 'Equation', 'Ethnic group', 'Event', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Hawaii', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Services Research', 'Health system', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hispanics', 'Hypersensitivity', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Mexican Americans', 'Minority', 'Minority Groups', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Not Hispanic or Latino', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Prevention', 'Prevention strategy', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Puerto Rican', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Estimate', 'Risk Factors', 'Savings', 'Scientist', 'South Asian', 'Stable Populations', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Veterans', 'Woman', 'Work', 'atherosclerosis risk', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'cardiovascular disorder prevention', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'career', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'college', 'disability', 'disparity reduction', 'epidemiologic data', 'ethnic minority population', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'health difference', 'health disparity', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'i(19)', 'improved', 'innovation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'men', 'minority health', 'mortality', 'neural network', 'patient subsets', 'prediction algorithm', 'prevention service', 'public health intervention', 'racial and ethnic', 'racial and ethnic disparities', 'racial diversity', 'racial minority', 'random forest', 'risk prediction model', 'side effect', 'skills', 'success', 'supervised learning', 'treatment guidelines']",NHLBI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,K01,2019,172692,0.01848259754246454
"Harnessing the Electronic Health Record to Predict Risk of Cardiovascular Disease PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the single largest killer in the United States for both men and women in every racial/ethnic group. Thus, accurate and systematic evaluation of CVD risk represents an aspect of Precision Medicine that will touch every patient. CVD risk scores that are currently the standard of care are derived from research cohorts and are particularly inaccurate in women, older patients, and those with missing data. The goal of this Precision Medicine based application is to capitalize on the depth and breadth of clinical data within electronic health record (EHR) systems to revolutionize CVD risk prediction, thereby optimizing personalized care for every patient. Our proposed approach is innovative in that we have identified and addressed the most significant barriers to development of an EHR-based risk score. Novel aspects of this research include: 1) use of complete EHR data to develop and validate algorithms to define a variety of risk factors (e.g., reproductive history), thus building a comprehensive risk profile for each patient that incorporates diagnosis and procedure codes, laboratory values, clinical test results, patient provided information (e.g., alcohol use), and natural language processing of unstructured clinical text; 2) incorporation of age at onset of risk factors; 3) use of highly flexible machine learning techniques in the form of generalized boosted regression modeling; 4) exploration of a new deep learning model for censored EHR data; and 5) determination of the extent of risk reclassification in multiple geographically-defined populations, including an underserved minority population. Furthermore, genetic studies demonstrate that incorporating variants into current risk models improves risk prediction and use of an individual's genetic risk could further enhance our ability to deliver precision medicine to every patient. Therefore, we seek to develop a sex-specific next-generation CVD risk prediction score using EHR data in combination with genetic variants. This paradigm is a significant departure from the current one that relies on scores derived from relatively small research cohorts that use only a restricted set of clinical parameters that differentially misclassify an individual's risk, especially in women. Our access to empirical clinical EHR data for hundreds of thousands of patients uniquely positions us to 1) develop a sex-specific risk prediction model for incident CVD using data from the EHR; 2) assess the performance of the sex-specific EHR risk score in an independent non-urban and rural population; and 3) identify and characterize patients for whom genetic information improves CVD prediction beyond the clinical risk score. Successful completion of these aims has the potential to impact all adult patients, drive clinical practice changes to systematically collect sex-specific risk factors, and inform attempts to embed the next-generation CVD risk score into EHR systems for automated use in clinical care. PROJECT NARRATIVE Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the single largest killer in the United States. We propose to use electronic health record data to improve our ability to accurately classify risk and identify those who would benefit from preventive therapies. Improved risk prediction will shed light on the mechanisms of CVD and potentially reduce incidence, save lives, and lower health care costs.",Harnessing the Electronic Health Record to Predict Risk of Cardiovascular Disease,9610723,R01HL136659,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Algorithms', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinics and Hospitals', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Community Hospitals', 'County', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Ethnic group', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic study', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Hybrids', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Laboratories', 'Latino', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Minnesota', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Not Hispanic or Latino', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevention strategy', 'Preventive', 'Preventive therapy', 'Procedures', 'Reproducibility', 'Reproductive History', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Rural', 'Rural Population', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Touch sensation', 'United States', 'Variant', 'Wisconsin', 'Woman', 'base', 'biobank', 'cardiovascular disorder prevention', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'clinical care', 'clinical practice', 'clinical risk', 'cohort', 'deep learning', 'electronic data', 'flexibility', 'genetic information', 'genetic panel test', 'genetic variant', 'improved', 'innovation', 'men', 'next generation', 'novel', 'older patient', 'personalized care', 'precision genetics', 'precision medicine', 'prospective', 'racial and ethnic', 'research clinical testing', 'risk prediction model', 'sex', 'standard of care', 'time use', 'underserved minority']",NHLBI,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,R01,2019,794994,-0.010628180907696542
"Detecting bleeding events using EHRs for prediction in Afib Abstract Atrial fibrillation (AF) affects millions of mostly older Americans. Atrial fibrillation contributes to stroke and weighing stroke risk against risk of bleeding from oral anticoagulants (AC) is central to AF management. AC decision-making has become more complex in recent years with the introduction of several target specific oral AC agents. It remains challenging to advise older AF patients about AC since they are frequently at high risk for stroke and complications from AC, particularly bleeding, and data are limited on real-world outcomes of AC among vulnerable populations. Our project, Detecting bleeding Events using Electronic records for Prediction in Atrial Fibrillation (DEEP AF), will leverage novel biomedical natural language processing (NLP) approaches to integrate bleeding-related information from both the structured and unstructured EHR records and statistical and deep learning approaches to predict risk of bleeding on AF patients on AC therapy. DEEP AF will address present knowledge gaps to accurately identify bleeding events from longitudinal electronic health records and to improve bleeding prediction accuracy and focus on modifiable, clinically relevant risk factors, thereby facilitating future large-scale comparative effectiveness studies evaluating AC agents, and helping clinicians develop better approaches to weighing AC risks and benefits.

"Using Machine Learning to Develop Just-in-Time Adaptive Interventions for Smoking Cessation PROJECT SUMMARY Mobile technology has enormous potential for delivering highly innovative, dynamic smoking cessation interventions. Phone sensors, wearable technology, and real time data collection methods such as ecological momentary assessment (EMA) have made it possible to collect a wealth of environmental and physiological data such as location, heart rate, and mood. Environmental and situational cues such as craving and proximity to others smoking are highly predictive of lapse among those trying to quit, suggesting that lapse risk is characterized by immediate, dynamic influences. Emerging strategies such as just-in-time adaptive interventions (JITAI), aim to prevent smoking lapse using tailored support delivered via mobile technology in the moments when it is most needed. Although research has identified antecedents of smoking lapse based on observations from EMA data, studies have been unable to utilize the full spectrum of contextual and environmental data available with current technology. Given the importance of dynamic influences on lapse risk, there is a critical need for strategies that accurately identify moments of highest lapse risk to improve cessation interventions. Recent research has demonstrated the utility of machine learning to predict individual behavior. Machine learning is a robust data analytic strategy that can produce highly accurate predictive models from large datasets and can automatically adapt to new data in real time. The overall objective of this application is to use supervised machine learning methods to develop an automated algorithm to quantify smoking lapse risk at the individual level. Specifically, we aim: 1) to apply supervised machine learning methods to quantify personalized risk of smoking lapse, and 2) to evaluate the feasibility and preliminary effectiveness of delivering a personalized, just-in-time adaptive intervention driven by machine learning prediction of smoking lapse risk in real time. The proposed research and training plan will take place at The University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center (OUHSC) and the Stephenson Cancer Center (SCC). Training will focus on increasing knowledge of machine learning methodology, and the conduct and analysis of JITAIs, which will facilitate completion of the proposed project. Results of the proposed research have the potential to reduce the amount and frequency of data needed from participants and sensors, enabling the development of less burdensome interventions. It is expected that completion of these aims will yield preliminary data to inform an automated, dynamic intervention that fully utilizes the strengths of mobile technology for measuring individual behavior and environmental context in real time. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed project will be among the first to use machine learning methods to predict risk of individual smoking lapse in real time. The resulting algorithm will provide a personalized model for each participant that adapts to new data and triggers the delivery of a tailored, precision intervention when it is most needed. If successful, this project and its methodology could be adapted to target other health behaviors such as diet, physical activity, or other substance use disorders.",Using Machine Learning to Develop Just-in-Time Adaptive Interventions for Smoking Cessation,9583421,K99DA046564,"['Accelerometer', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Behavior', 'Cancer Center', 'Car Phone', 'Classification', 'Control Groups', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Demographic Factors', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diet', 'Ecological momentary assessment', 'Effectiveness', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Health Sciences', 'Health behavior', 'Heart Rate', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Moods', 'Oklahoma', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Physical activity', 'Physiological', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Randomized', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Training', 'Risk', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Smoking', 'Smoking Behavior', 'Smoking Cessation Intervention', 'Social Environment', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'System', 'Technology', 'Telephone', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Wrist', 'adaptive intervention', 'base', 'craving', 'experience', 'improved', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mobile application', 'mobile computing', 'personalized intervention', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'psychologic', 'secondary analysis', 'sensor', 'standard care', 'supervised learning', 'trend', 'wearable device', 'wearable technology']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF OKLAHOMA HLTH SCIENCES CTR,K99,2019,92213,-0.010237087699360084
"Using Machine Learning to Predict Problematic Prescription Opioid Use and Opioid Overdose Problematic prescription opioid use, defined as nonmedical use, misuse, or abuse of opioid medications, is epidemic in the US. Prescription opioid overdose deaths more than quadrupled from 1999 to 2015. Efforts by health care systems and payers to combat the opioid epidemic are impeded by a lack of accurate and efficient methods to identify individuals most at risk for problematic opioid use and overdose, leading to broad interventions that are burdensome to patients and expensive for payers. Payers are currently defining high risk and targeting interventions (e.g. pharmacy lock-in programs) based on individual risk factors, such as high opioid dosage, identified in prior studies using traditional statistical approaches. However, these traditional approaches have significant limitations, especially when handling large datasets with numerous variables, multi-level interactions, and missing data. Moreover, the prior studies focused on identifying risk factors rather than predicting actual risk. Alternatively, machine learning is an advanced technique that handles complex interactions in large data, uncovers hidden patterns, and yields precise prediction algorithms that, in many cases, are superior to those developed using traditional methods. Machine learning is widely used in activities from fraud detection to cancer genomics, but has not yet been applied to address the opioid epidemic. Accordingly, the proposed study will apply machine learning to develop prediction algorithms that can more accurately identify patients at high risk of problematic opioid use and overdose using data sources that are readily available to payers and health care systems. The project will build on existing academic-state partnerships to apply novel machine learning approaches to administrative claims data for all Medicaid beneficiaries in Pennsylvania (PA) and Arizona (AZ). The project will also link Medicaid data in AZ to electronic health records to capture clinical information (e.g., lab results, pain severity) not available in administrative data, along with death certificate data on lethal overdose. These data, covering 2007-2016, will be used to achieve two specific aims: (1) to develop and validate two separate prediction algorithms to identify patients at risk of problematic opioid use and opioid overdose; (2) to compare the accuracy of a prediction algorithm that integrates clinical data with Medicaid claims versus a claims-based approach alone to identify patients at risk of problematic opioid use and opioid overdose. The machine learning approaches will include random forests and TreeNet with representative classification trees, and the predictive ability (e.g., misclassification rates) of these algorithms will be compared to traditional statistical models. Given the high prevalence of mental health/substance use disorders (~50%) and opioid utilization (>20%) among Medicaid enrollees and the lack of adequate prediction algorithms, Medicaid is an ideal setting for the proposed project. These analyses will provide the partnering Medicaid programs with valuable information and tools that they can apply to more precisely target interventions to prevent problematic opioid use and overdose. Prescription opioid overdose deaths quadrupled from 1999 to 2015, and drug overdose is now the leading cause of injury deaths among adults in the United States. This project will use innovative machine learning methods and readily available data for Medicaid beneficiaries in two states hard hit by the epidemic – Pennsylvania and Arizona – to develop algorithms to accurately predict who is at risk of problematic prescription opioid use and overdose. This information will empower health systems, payers, and policymakers to more effectively target interventions to prevent prescription opioid misuse and its consequences.",Using Machine Learning to Predict Problematic Prescription Opioid Use and Opioid Overdose,9727956,R01DA044985,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Arizona', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Death Certificates', 'Detection', 'Dose', 'Drug Screening', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emergency department visit', 'Ensure', 'Epidemic', 'Fee-for-Service Plans', 'Fraud', 'Genomics', 'Health system', 'Healthcare Systems', 'High Prevalence', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Inpatients', 'Intervention', 'Letters', 'Link', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Managed Care', 'Medicaid', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphine', 'Opioid', 'Outcome', 'Overdose', 'Pain', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pennsylvania', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacy facility', 'Prescription opioid overdose', 'Prevalence', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Severities', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Subgroup', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'United States', 'United States Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services', 'Urine', 'Work', 'base', 'beneficiary', 'cancer genomics', 'classification trees', 'clinical predictors', 'combat', 'design', 'dosage', 'high risk', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'milligram', 'model building', 'nonmedical use', 'novel', 'opioid epidemic', 'opioid mortality', 'opioid overdose', 'opioid use', 'overdose risk', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'prescription opioid', 'prescription opioid abuse', 'prescription opioid misuse', 'prevent', 'programs', 'random forest', 'service utilization', 'tool']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2019,588500,0.011223532091865317
"Adiposity-obesity-related subgroups discovery and metabolomics analysis for chronic kidney disease Project Summary Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is prevalent in the U.S. population and is a major cause of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), cardiovascular disease morbidity, and mortality. Current gaps exist in characterizing the heterogeneity of CKD population. Obesity further increases the risks of adverse outcomes among people with impaired kidney function. However, the mechanism between obesity and CKD is not fully understood, and numerous studies have observed “obesity paradox” or survival advantage being associated with higher body fat among advanced CKD patients. In this context, the Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort (CRIC) Study provides an ideal opportunity to study the mechanism of CKD with its rich clinical information and population characteristics, as well as its availability of non-targeted high-dimensional metabolomics data. To better understand the “adiposity-obesity-related” (AOR) mechanisms of CKD and to discover novel biomarkers, we propose to identify distinct subgroups based on AOR attributes and to perform metabolomics analysis on the identified subgroups and CKD outcomes. The overall goal of this research and the training plan is to execute three studies as the subjects of a doctoral dissertation in metabolomics analysis and CKD epidemiology. First, in Aim 1, we will identify latent AOR subgroups in the CRIC CKD population using the data-driven approach of consensus clustering. We will also evaluate the utility and the independent risk discrimination performance of the AOR subgroups with key CKD outcomes (CKD progression, CVD, and death), using Cox regression model with adjustment for known CKD risk factors. Next, in Aim 2, we will perform metabolomics analysis and identify metabolites and metabolomic patterns that are associated with the different AOR subgroups. In response to the statistical challenges in analyzing the high-dimensional metabolomics data, we will implement both the machine learning random-forest algorithm and the conventional univariate and multivariate regression analysis. Finally, in Aim 3, we will investigate the relationship between CKD outcomes and the metabolites and metabolomic patterns identified in Aim 2, using Cox regression model, extended by pathway analysis and mediation analysis. Mining high-dimensional metabolomics data with AOR phenotypes in the CRIC Study holds promise to expand our knowledge of pathophysiology and molecular characterization of CKD. Future studies can be built upon these findings to improve more effective and personalized CKD management in the setting of the obesity epidemic. A rigorous curriculum including didactic and experiential learning in biomedical data mining, statistics, and advanced epidemiology will round out the applicant's training, preparing her to be an independent and collaborative investigator and a kidney disease epidemiologist at the completion of his PhD. Project Narrative Chronic kidney disease (CKD) and its risk factors of obesity, diabetes, and hypertension are prevalent in the United States. To better understand the mechanism between adiposity-obesity-related CKD mechanism, the proposed research will implement machine learning algorithms, and identify distinct patient subgroups and discover novel CKD biomarkers, using the clinical and high-dimensional metabolomics data from a diverse cohort of CKD patients. The findings of our study hold promise to expand our knowledge of pathophysiology and molecular characterization of CKD, and facilitate personalized disease management.",Adiposity-obesity-related subgroups discovery and metabolomics analysis for chronic kidney disease,9834239,F31DK122683,"['Active Learning', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Albuminuria', 'Algorithms', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Pressure', 'Body fat', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Chronic Kidney Insufficiency', 'Clinical', 'Cohort Studies', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Disease Outcome', 'Disease Progression', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Educational Curriculum', 'End stage renal failure', 'Epidemiologist', 'Epidemiology', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Glomerular Filtration Rate', 'Glucose', 'Glycosylated hemoglobin A', 'Goals', 'Height', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hypertension', 'Impairment', 'Insulin Resistance', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Knowledge', 'Kynurenine', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Mediation', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Obesity', 'Obesity Epidemic', 'Outcome Assessment', 'PTH gene', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Population Characteristics', 'Regression Analysis', 'Renal function', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Specimen', 'Subgroup', 'Techniques', 'Training', 'Troponin T', 'Tryptophan', 'United States', 'Weight', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'cohort', 'data mining', 'fibroblast growth factor 23', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'machine learning algorithm', 'metabolomics', 'mortality', 'multidimensional data', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'patient subsets', 'personalized management', 'population based', 'preservation', 'random forest', 'response', 'statistics', 'targeted biomarker', 'tool']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,F31,2019,45016,0.007879204507348773
"Deep probabilistic predictive models for stroke and coronary heart disease Project Summary  Cardiovascular disease negatively affects millions of people worldwide. Globally, it accounts for approximately thirty percent of all deaths. Furthermore, a significant fraction of deaths caused by cardiovascular disease occur in a non-geriatric population; fifteen percent of all worldwide deaths are attributed to cardiovascular disease for people under the age of seventy. Treatment to prevent cardiovascular events should be based on highly individualized risk prediction. High risk patients should get more aggressive treatments because the risk of disease outweighs the burden of treatment, while low risk patients should be managed more conservatively. For example, anti-thrombotic therapy for coronary heart disease may increase bleeding risk and may not be appropriate for low-risk patients. Two primary kinds of cardiovascular disease are stroke and coronary heart disease, and there have been a number of developments in risk scores for both ailments. However, these risk scores only use a small fraction of the available measurements about a patient and treat risk as a collection of independent factors rather than considering how their interactions amplify or ameliorate risk. Moreover, a majority of the popular coronary heart disease and stroke risk scores are designed to be manually computed by a busy physician at the point of care, which further limits their scope and fidelity. Next generation risk scores for stroke and cardiovascular disease should take into account all of the available information in the electronic health record without the constraints of the parametric assumptions of traditional risk modeling. More accurate risk assessment of coronary heart disease and stroke will lead to better care and reduce the cardiovascular disease burden.  Our vision is to capitalize on large collections of electronic health records along with recent advances in deep learning to build risk scores that use more available health information while making minimal mathematical assumptions about the nature of clinical risk. Our proposal propels the field from human computable independent risks calculations necessitated by previous limitations of technology to calculations that make use of deep learning to learn highly nonlinear risks and risk factor interactions. We additionally demonstrate how deep learning can be used to deal with the ever-present issue of missing values in medicine. Our proposal also targets an area under- explored by previous work on risk scores: fairness. Treatment quality is affected by the quality of risk estimation. This means populations where estimated risk is less accurate may receive worse care. Risk scores developed with simple models may only capture risk accurately for the majority population as simple models are not flexible enough to cover multiple populations. We seek to identify potential risk calculation differences with respect to race and ethnicity. We will construct and evaluate deep learning methods for coronary heart disease and stroke risk assessment from electronic health records. We will develop techniques to incorporate clinical text, handle missing data, and evaluate fairness of deep learning for cardiovascular risk scores. Finally, we will make our work available as open source code written in deep learning frameworks, at clinical conferences, and publications. Project Narrative Coronary heart disease and stroke create a large burden of disease in the world and require accurate risk assessment to aid in providing appropriate treatments. We will construct and validate deep learning risk scores for both coronary heart disease and stroke using large quantities of information from the electronic health record and take care to evaluate potential racial and ethnic biases present in the algorithm. More accurate coronary heart disease and stroke risk scores provided by this approach have the potential to reduce the overall cardiovascular disease burden with a specific focus on minority communities.",Deep probabilistic predictive models for stroke and coronary heart disease,9801981,R01HL148248,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Brain hemorrhage', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caring', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Collection', 'Coronary heart disease', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Direct Costs', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Event', 'Future', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Hemorrhage', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Mathematics', 'Measurement', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Minority Groups', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Neurologic', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Productivity', 'Publications', 'Race', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Estimate', 'Risk Factors', 'Series', 'Source Code', 'Statistical Models', 'Stroke', 'Survival Analysis', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Time', 'Uncertainty', 'United States', 'Vision', 'Work', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'clinical conference', 'clinical practice', 'clinical risk', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'design', 'disorder risk', 'ethnic bias', 'ethnic diversity', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'health data', 'heart disease risk', 'high dimensionality', 'high risk', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'minority communities', 'mortality', 'natural language', 'negative affect', 'neural network', 'next generation', 'open source', 'outcome forecast', 'personalized risk prediction', 'point of care', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'racial and ethnic', 'racial bias', 'racial diversity', 'relating to nervous system', 'stroke model', 'stroke risk', 'thromboembolic stroke']",NHLBI,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,709389,-0.03161905263989929
"Studying pseudogout using naturallanguage processing and novelimaging approaches Candidate: Dr. Tedeschi is an Instructor in Medicine at Harvard Medical School (HMS) and Associate Physician in the Division of Rheumatology, Immunology and Allergy’s Section of Clinical Sciences (SCS) at Brigham and Women’s Hospital (BWH). She received an MPH from the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health (HSPH). Her 10 first-author manuscripts, two BWH grants, and foundation award exemplify her productivity and commitment to research. She has assembled an experienced team of mentors and collaborators, led by Dr. Daniel Solomon (primary mentor) and Drs. Katherine Liao and Karen Costenbader (co-mentors), to guide her training in natural language processing and machine learning approaches for clinical research, analysis of linked electronic medical record (EMR) and Medicare claims data, and interpretation of advanced imaging modalities. Focused coursework at HSPH and HMS will complement the experience she gains through her proposed studies of pseudogout risk factors and long-term outcomes. Training in dual- energy CT and ultrasound interpretation for crystalline arthritis will be obtained via one-on-one sessions. Her long-term career goal is to become an independent patient-oriented investigator focused on pseudogout. Environment: Dr. Tedeschi has a commitment from her Division for >75% protected time for research and career development activities during the K23 award period. Support from the Division and her primary mentor’s research funds will supplement her salary and project-related expenses. The SCS, a collaborative clinical research group in the Division of Rheumatology, has extensive infrastructure including the VERITY Bioinformatics Core (NIH-P30-AR072577, PI: Solomon) that will provide resources and expertise for the proposed studies. In addition, the BWH Arthritis Center is one of the largest nationally, facilitating subject recruitment, and the BWH Division of Musculoskeletal Imaging has state-of-the-art equipment and expertise applying dual-energy CT in crystalline arthritis. Coursework at HSPH and HMS, adjacent to BWH, will provide training necessary for Dr. Tedeschi’s development into an independent investigator. Research: Dr. Tedeschi’s long-term objective is to prevent and reduce morbidity from pseudogout, an understudied, painful crystalline arthritis that affects 8-10 million Americans. She will use natural language processing and machine learning approaches to enhance an algorithm for identifying pseudogout in EMR data. She will study risk factors for and long-term outcomes in pseudogout, harnessing vast amounts of information contained in Partners HealthCare EMR data and Medicare claims data, and will gain experience working with linked datasets. Dr. Tedeschi will recruit subjects with pseudogout and other types of mono- and oligoarthritis to test and compare the performance of dual-energy CT scanning, musculoskeletal ultrasound, and x-ray for identifying pseudogout. Her proposed K23 projects will lead to manuscripts and data to be leveraged in an R01 application focused on pseudogout during the award period, leading to independence as a patient-oriented investigator. Project Narrative The proposed studies will contribute fundamental knowledge about pseudogout, a common, painful crystalline arthritis for which we have little prognostic information and no targeted treatments. Results from the proposed projects could lead to methods for non-invasive, accurate pseudogout diagnosis, development of preventive strategies for pseudogout, and interventions to reduce cardiovascular disease risk. Future work stemming from the proposed projects may include predictive models of pseudogout flares, identification of serum biomarkers for pseudogout, and development of outcomes measures to be used in prospectively recruited pseudogout cohort studies.",Studying pseudogout using naturallanguage processing and novelimaging approaches,9717330,K23AR075070,"['Acute', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Arthritis', 'Award', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Markers', 'Calcium Pyrophosphate', 'Calcium pyrophosphate deposition disease', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Chronic', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Cohort Studies', 'Complement', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Crystallization', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diuretics', 'Environment', 'Equipment', 'Event', 'Female', 'Flare', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Gout', 'Grant', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitals', 'Hypersensitivity', 'Image', 'Immunology', 'Inflammatory', 'Inflammatory Arthritis', 'Infrastructure', 'Institution', 'Insurance Claim Review', 'Interleukin-1 beta', 'Intervention', 'Ischemic Stroke', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuscripts', 'Medicare claim', 'Medicine', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Oligonucleotides', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Outcomes Research', 'Pain', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Polyarthritides', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predictive Value', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention strategy', 'Productivity', 'Proton Pump Inhibitors', 'Pseudogout', 'Public Health Schools', 'Publishing', 'Questionnaires', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Rheumatoid Arthritis', 'Rheumatology', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Serum', 'Structure', 'Synovial Fluid', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Vascular calcification', 'Vascularization', 'Visit', 'Wages', 'Woman', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'accurate diagnosis', 'base', 'bisphosphonate', 'calcium indicator', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'career', 'career development', 'cohort', 'crystallinity', 'epidemiology study', 'experience', 'genetic linkage analysis', 'high risk', 'human old age (65+)', 'imaging modality', 'instructor', 'longitudinal course', 'medical schools', 'modifiable risk', 'mortality', 'mortality risk', 'musculoskeletal imaging', 'musculoskeletal ultrasound', 'novel', 'patient oriented', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'prognostic', 'prospective', 'ranpirnase', 'recruit', 'research and development', 'sex', 'side effect', 'stem', 'targeted treatment', 'unnecessary treatment']",NIAMS,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,K23,2019,176541,0.008757958586715351
"Use of a machine learning framework to predict severe maternal morbidity Severe maternal morbidity (SMM) is on the rise in the United States. Such morbidity is accompanied by delivery complications and adverse pregnancy outcomes, and can have long- term health consequences for women. To date, only a handful of studies examined risk factors for SMM in the United States, and even fewer considered the site of delivery care as potentially influencing SMM occurrence. This study will test the use of machine learning techniques to develop models for predicting women’s risk of experiencing SMM. We will use population-based data from a family of Maryland state databases linked with American Hospital Association Annual Survey data for the 2010-2014 period. Our primary analytic sample will be comprised of all delivery hospitalizations in Maryland hospitals during 2010-2014. Two SMM outcome measures will be employed: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)’s SMM algorithm, and a composite measure that includes any of the codes in the CDC SMM algorithm, ICU admission and/or blood transfusion during the delivery hospitalization. Separately for each of the two outcome measures, we will first develop multi-stage least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) models to predict SMM and then employ Multiple Additive Regression Tree to maximize the predictive ability of the LASSO models. Next, we will fit Logit regression models for SMM adjusting for LASSO-selected predictor variables and compare LASSO and Logit models’ performance using standard metrics such as sensitivity, specificity, area under the curve of receiver operator characteristic. The proposal has several areas of innovation. Classical analytics tools are not well suited to capture the full value of large data. In contrast, machine learning techniques are unconstrained by preset statistical assumptions and expected to make predictions with higher degrees of accuracy. The success of this pilot study will open up new avenues of study into the potential for machine learning to aid clinical care. Obstetrics is one of the areas that can greatly benefit from its use by predicting maternal risks early and optimizing pathways to the best possible outcomes for women and their newborns. Identifying key predictors of SMM can serve to ascertain health disparities, strengths and weaknesses in obstetric care, and prevent adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes. Severe maternal morbidity is on the rise in the United States and such morbidity can have long- term health consequences for women. This study will assess the potential use of new statistical methods, not currently employed in obstetrics, to develop prediction models for severe maternal morbidity during the delivery hospitalization. Our ability to predict a woman’s risk of developing severe maternal morbidity can help prevent such morbidity from occurring.",Use of a machine learning framework to predict severe maternal morbidity,9767258,R03HD095057,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Admission activity', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Algorithms', 'Ambulatory Surgical Procedures', 'American Hospital Association', 'Applications Grants', 'Area', 'Area Under Curve', 'Behavior', 'Blood Transfusion', 'Caring', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Cessation of life', 'Code', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Discipline of obstetrics', 'Event', 'Family', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health system', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Inpatients', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Intervention', 'Link', 'Logit Models', 'Machine Learning', 'Maryland', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Neonatal Mortality', 'Newborn Infant', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pilot Projects', 'Pregnancy Complications', 'Pregnant Women', 'Premature Birth', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Recording of previous events', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Specificity', 'Statistical Methods', 'Surveys', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States', 'United States Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality', 'Visit', 'Woman', 'adverse pregnancy outcome', 'analytical method', 'analytical tool', 'care delivery site', 'care seeking', 'clinical care', 'delivery complications', 'ethnic diversity', 'experience', 'health care service utilization', 'health disparity', 'innovation', 'insight', 'maternal morbidity', 'neonatal morbidity', 'neonatal outcome', 'population based', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'racial and ethnic', 'regression trees', 'stillbirth', 'success']",NICHD,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R03,2019,81875,0.013738618282963699
"Identifying Personalized Risk of Acute Kidney Injury with Machine Learning PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) is a common and highly lethal health problem, affecting 10-15% of all hospitalized patients and >50% of patients in intensive care units (ICUs). It has been shown that a small increase in serum creatinine (SCr) of ≥0.5 mg/dl was associated with a 6.5-fold increase in the odds of death, a 3.5-day increase in length of stay, and nearly $7,500 in excess hospital costs. Unfortunately, no specific treatment exists to cure AKI once it has developed. The ability to predict AKI in hospitalized patients would provide clinicians the opportunity to modify care pathways and implement interventions, which could in turn prevent AKI and yield better outcomes. Although electronic medical record (EMR) based monitoring systems for AKI have led to expedited interventions and may increase the percentage of patients returning to baseline kidney function, most of these systems are reactive rather than proactive, with little or no contribution to AKI prevention. Moreover, our current knowledge of AKI risk factors is far from complete, especially in the ICU and general inpatient populations, characterized by numerous deficiencies and systematic failings that may be avoidable To transform the reactive AKI care to proactive and personalized care, early identification of high risk patients and better understanding of individual modifiable risk factors for AKI is the key. In Aim 1, to discover novel risk factors predictive of AKI, we propose to develop an ensemble multi-view feature selection framework to simultaneously consider the differences and interrelations between feature spaces and obtain robust knowledge by synthesizing findings from diverse patient populations across multiple institutions in nine US states. In Aim 2, to discover general modifiable causes of AKI to help physicians design more effective AKI prevention policies, we propose to develop a novel multi-cause inference method to identify causal relationships between modifiable factors and AKI for susceptible patient subgroups. In Aim 3, to explain what caused AKI in individual patients to support physicians in designing personalized AKI intervention, we propose to develop a new causal explanation method by integrating causal inference and case based reasoning to quantify patient-level causal significance of modifiable factors. The proposed study will have a significant clinical impact by not only expanding the capacity of clinicians to identify high risk patients for AKI early and advancing the general knowledge on causal and modifiable risk factors for AKI but also supporting personalized AKI intervention with suggestions on potential patient-specific actionable items. The work will not only advance AKI but also the machine learning and clinical research informatics community and the methodology developed is generalizable to other clinical domains. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research is to identify clinical risk factors of acute kidney injury (AKI) in hospitalized patients from electronic medical records (EMRs) with machine learning. AKI risk factors discovered from EMR of diverse populations from multiple institutions across nine US states will be reliable and robust and can assist clinicians in providing proactive and personalized care to high-risk patients.",Identifying Personalized Risk of Acute Kidney Injury with Machine Learning,9819327,R01DK116986,"['Acute Renal Failure with Renal Papillary Necrosis', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Communities', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Creatinine', 'Data', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Early identification', 'Elderly', 'Event', 'Exposure to', 'Geographic Locations', 'Geographic state', 'Health', 'Health system', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hospital Costs', 'Hospital Mortality', 'Hospitals', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Injury to Kidney', 'Inpatients', 'Institution', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Intervention', 'Kidney', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Length of Stay', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Myocardial', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Physiology', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Predictive Factor', 'Renal function', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Sepsis', 'Series', 'Serum', 'Suggestion', 'System', 'Time', 'Work', 'adjudication', 'base', 'case-based', 'clinical predictors', 'clinical risk', 'design', 'high dimensionality', 'high risk', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'injury prevention', 'machine learning algorithm', 'modifiable risk', 'mortality risk', 'nephrotoxicity', 'novel', 'patient population', 'patient subsets', 'personalized care', 'prevent']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF KANSAS MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2019,512304,0.0033146792427319028
"Improving cancer family history collection through social networking and artificial intelligence PROJECT SUMMARY  The  activities  proposed  in  this  NCI  K07  application  are  designed  to  advance  the  career  development  and  research  independence  of  Dr.  Brandon  M.  Welch.  Family  health  history  (FHx)  is  one  of  the most important  resources available to help clinicians identify disease risks. By knowing a patient's FHx, clinicians can quickly  identify  disease risks and initiate risk-reducing strategies such as increased screening, prophylactic surgery,  risk-reducing  therapeutics,  and  lifestyle  changes.  FHx  is  also  the  foundation  of  genomic  medicine.  Unfortunately,  the  collection  and  use  of  FHx  by  patients  and  clinicians  is  suboptimal.  To  improve  the  collection and use of FHx among the general population, a better FHx tool that is easier and more convenient  to  use  than  current  FHx  tools  is  needed.  A  new  FHx  web  tool,  called  ​ItRunsInMyFamily.com,​  incorporates  artificial intelligence and social networking to improve user engagement with FHx collection.Utilizing artificial  intelligence  based  chat  entity  can  improve  the  collection  of  FHx  information  by  making  it  easier  and  more  engaging to record FHx information, likewise social networking allows users to tap into the collective wisdom  and  knowledge  of  the  family  to  correct  inaccuracies  and  overcome  gaps  in  FHx  knowledge.  This research  study  will  first  identify  enhancements  to  ​ItRunsInMyFamily.com  ​that  will  further  promote  user  engagement,  with  particular  focus  on  rural and underserved patients (Aim 1). We will then evaluate whether this new FHx  tool can improve collection of cancer FHx in comparison with current FHx tools (Aim 2). Finally, we will assess  the impact of ​ItRunsInMyFamily.com ​on the clinical settings (Aim 3). To implement the research plan, it will be  critical  to  apply,  skills  obtained  through  K  award  learning  objectives,  namely  clinical  oncology  (learning  objective  1),  iterative  patient-centered  design  (learning  objective  2),  and  health  technology  assessment  (learning  objective  3).  To  fulfill  these  learning  objectives,  an  interdisciplinary  group  of  mentors  will  direct  a  comprehensive training plan. The training plan includes coursework, seminars, workshops, journal clubs, and  conferences,  covering clinical oncology, patient engagement, health disparities, user-centered development,  human-computer  interaction,  clinical  research  methodologies,  health  technology  assessment,  and  ethical  conduct  of  research.  The  strong  support  of  an  excellent  team  of  mentors,  and  the  vast  resources  of  the  Medical  University  of  South  Carolina,  create  an  optimal  training  environment.  Collectively,  the  integrated  learning  objectives  and  research  plan  are  critical  to  establishing  a  successful,  innovative,  and  meaningful  academic career focused on developing patient-centric informatics tools for oncology.   PROJECT NARRATIVE Family health history (FHx) is one of the most important risk factors for cancer and the foundation of genomic medicine, but is under-utilized by patients and clinicians.

"Secondary Analysis of EHR Data to Examine Relative Impact of Oral Health History on Incident Pneumonia by Settings Project Summary (Abstract) With little change in incidence for over 50 years, pneumonia remains the top cause for morbid hospitalization1 in the USA, and is associated with healthcare costs exceeding $10 billion annually2. This study proposes to mine big data captured in an intergrated medical/dental record (iEHR) and enterprise data warehouse (EDW) of a large midwestern medical-dental integrated healthcare system and will test the hypothesis that poor oral health is an independent risk for subtypes of community-acquired and hospital-acquired pneumonia. Proposed specific aims include: 1) electronic identification and characterization of pneumonia types and 2) evaluation of the association of oral health status with risk of pneumonia. Tasks to achieve study aims are to: a) develop electronic, phenotype-based algorithm(s) to classify and characterize pneumonia by subtype and relative frequency of events; b) characterize impact of immediate and longitudinal oral health status on emergent pneumonia stratified by subtype; and c) evaluate relative risk contributed by medical and dental factors. Innovative application of natural language processing (NLP) to support evaluation of unstructured data and machine learning (ML) to identify as-yet unknown potential risk factors is proposed. These aims will be accomplished by established investigators including dentists and researchers with extensive research track records in oral and systemic health including pneumonia, clinical pulmonologist/intensivist to provide clinical expertise to inform data mining, biomedical informaticians with expertise in data mining, ML and NLP and data modeling, and experienced biostatisticians who will apply appropriate statistical approaches and traditional data modeling to big data. This team will collaboratively create and deliver a unique, well-defined, pneumonia- specific, oral health data registry resource and validated phenotype-based algorithm to classify pneumonia, stratified by subtypes, which will support future interrogation for additional permutations of medical and dental factors. Study outcomes are expected to leverage immediate translational value within the health system with high potential for relevance and portability to other settings. The project is expected to define risk factors which may represent actionable targets for reduction of pneumonia risk across various settings. Project Narrative- Relevance to public health: Pneumonia continues as a leading public health problem in hospitals, healthcare facilities and community settings. Pneumonia is the top disease-related cause for hospitalization. This study proposes to use data in electronic health records to classify pneumonia type and describe risk factors that may make individual susceptible to different types of pneumonia, including impact of diseases of the mouth, gums and teeth.

"Using existing data to understand and ameliorate risk in opioid agonist therapy PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The United States is in the midst of an opioid epidemic, leading to unprecedented levels of overdose deaths and other harms. Effective treatment for opioid use disorders is available, in the form of opioid agonist therapy (OAT) with methadone or buprenorphine. However, there are significant questions about the risk of adverse clinical outcomes, including mortality and hospitalization during and after treatment, and unplanned treatment cessation. What is the magnitude of these risks, and what patient, treatment setting, and provider factors may contribute to or protect against risk? Additionally, it is increasingly clear that more sophisticated approaches to patient assessment and treatment planning than are currently used are needed to minimise risk. We aim to: 1. Determine the magnitude of risk for specific adverse clinical outcomes (e.g. mortality, hospitalization and ED presentation, and unplanned treatment cessation) during and after OAT with methadone and buprenorphine; 2. Identify patient, treatment setting, and provider risk factors associated with adverse clinical outcomes during and after OAT with methadone and buprenorphine; and 3. Develop a risk prediction model to identify patients at greatest risk of adverse clinical outcomes during and after OAT. To achieve these aims, this project will use existing population-based Australian data on OAT, linked to several health and criminal justice datasets to provide a rich understanding of treatment exposures and outcomes. These data will be used to inform strategies to guide the delivery of high-quality treatment for opioid use disorder in the United States. Specifically, the project will provide data about the magnitude of risk of adverse clinical outcomes during specific treatment and post-treatment periods, and identify patient, treatment setting and provider factors that influence risk. Additionally, it will use innovative machine learning techniques to demonstrate the potential for routinely collected data to be used to assess patient risk at point-of-care, allowing for the development of tailored treatment plans that minimize risk and maximize treatment retention.

"Harnessing the power of CTSA-CDRN data networks: Using social determinants of health, frailty and functional status to identify at-risk patients and improve risk adjustment Postoperative complications and readmissions rates are higher in minority and low socioeconomic status (SES) patients. Low SES is associated with frailty, one of the best predictors of 30-day postoperative complications and early hospital readmission. Despite their influence on health outcomes, frailty and social risk factors are not considered in risk adjustment for reimbursement and quality measures. CMS developed financial incentive- based programs to improve quality of care. Yet this strategy disproportionately penalizes minority-serving, major teaching and safety net hospitals (SNH), further constraining resources for the care of vulnerable populations. Our long-term goal is to use frailty and social risk factors to identify at-risk patients to design more effective clinical care pathways. Frailty can be derived retrospectively using the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (ACS NSQIP) dataset. Data networks are powerful research tools that can be used to answer important questions. However, extracting data from EHR is challenging. The Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI) developed 13 Clinical Data Research Networks (CDRN) that have considerable overlapping membership with Clinical Translational Science Award (CTSA) institutions. While steady progress has been made, multiple barriers exist to efficiently access and use data. We will engage 3 CTSA hubs, each members of a different CDRN, to locally merge identified datasets developing data accessing and linking strategies at diverse institutions for dissemination across sites within CDRNs and to ultimately perform similar studies across CDRNs. We will use the SMART IRB reliance platform to harmonize the regulatory approval process as much as possible for each step of this project to identify barriers to use in data networks. We propose the following Aims: 1) Determine the predictive power of ethnicity, race, SES, and frailty for postoperative complications, mortality  and readmissions to improve risk adjustment at 3 CTSA/CDRNs 2) Estimate postoperative functional status using natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning  algorithms on inpatient physical therapy (PT), occupational therapy (OT) and nursing notes for ACS NSQIP  patients to predict long-term functional status 3) Develop methods to predict long-term loss of independence after major surgery 4) Determine hospital resource utilization stratified by SES, frailty and minority status The significance of our study is the incorporation of social risk factors, frailty and functional status in risk adjustment forming the basis for future interventions by targeting patients at the highest risk for postoperative complications and reducing health care disparities. Our innovative approach harnesses data sources at diverse institutions with the goal of disseminating these methods across 3 CDRNs and the CTSA network. Project Narrative: Patients with social risk factors, including poverty, being a minority, lack of an education and frailty are all associated with having worse health outcomes and with more difficulties recovering after surgical procedures. Safety net hospitals take care of many people with social risk factors and are being judged on the quality of care provided without accounting for the challenges faced by poor people. We will study the effect of social risk factors and frailty on health outcomes after surgery to identify patients that would benefit from care pathways that help poor and/or frail people.","Harnessing the power of CTSA-CDRN data networks: Using social determinants of health, frailty and functional status to identify at-risk patients and improve risk adjustment",9749954,U01TR002393,"['Accounting', 'Agreement', 'Ambulatory Care Facilities', 'American', 'American College of Surgeons', 'Authorization documentation', 'Caring', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical and Translational Science Awards', 'Community Surveys', 'Costs and Benefits', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Discipline of Nursing', 'Education', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Fibrinogen', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hispanics', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Inpatients', 'Institution', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'Intervention', 'Link', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Occupational Therapy', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Physical therapy', 'Postoperative Complications', 'Postoperative Period', 'Poverty', 'Predictive Analytics', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quality of Care', 'Race', 'Recovery of Function', 'Registries', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Institute', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Adjustment', 'Risk Factors', 'Site', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Testing', 'Text', 'United States Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'base', 'clinical care', 'cost effective', 'data access', 'design', 'electronic data', 'financial incentive', 'frailty', 'functional status', 'health care disparity', 'high risk', 'hospital readmission', 'improved', 'incentive program', 'innovation', 'low socioeconomic status', 'machine learning algorithm', 'member', 'mortality', 'outcome prediction', 'payment', 'postoperative recovery', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'readmission rates', 'safety net', 'simulation', 'social', 'social health determinants', 'tool', 'usability']",NCATS,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCIENCE CENTER,U01,2019,100000,0.00356104615509853

"Olfactory and facial markers of developmental risk for psychosis in 22q11 deletion syndrome Project Summary: 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11DS) is associated with an increased risk for psychiatric disorders, including psychosis with similar symptoms to individuals with idiopathic schizophrenia (SZ), and about 1-2% of cases of idiopathic SZ have 22q11.2 deletions. Thus, targeted approaches detailing specific brain dysfunction in 22q11DS may elucidate critical neural mechanisms in psychosis. Specifically, approaches that capture abnormalities common to individuals at-risk for psychosis and with a genetic risk to psychosis, such as 22q11DS, may help explain risk and resilience for psychosis. Minor physical anomalies (MPAs) are phenotypic abnormalities of aberrant development. MPAs include subtle abnormalities of morphological structures encompassing numerous body parts including eyes, ears, mouth and head. Abnormalities of the face and head likely represent a disruption of early embryologic development, including the olfactory system and facial morphology, making these promising entry points for understanding neurodevelopmental neuropathology associated with 22q11DS and psychosis In this study, we seek to compare 1) measures of olfactory function; 2) structural abnormalities of the olfactory system and 3) structural abnormalities of the face in a large cohort of patients with 22q11DS (n=100), including those with and without psychosis, to typically developing (TD) individual. Finally, we will employ machine learning algorithms to select features that best differentiate 22q11DS+ from 22q11DS- and use those features to classify individual with idiopathic risk for psychosis (PS). In addition, analyses will leverage recent advances in machine learning to predict salient features associated with dimensional measures of psychosis. We believe this innovative approach can significantly advance our understanding of the etiology of psychosis and provide advances to precision medicine in psychiatry. Through the proposed multi-level analysis, this innovative research will provide a substantial advance in our understanding of the neurodevelopmental substrates of psychosis. RELEVANCE: Psychosis is a debilitating psychiatric condition. Greater understanding of how abnormalities in neural development lead to dysfunction during youth and produce symptoms of psychosis or psychosis risk may be critical for the conceptualization of earlier and more effective treatments. This would benefit public health by reducing the great costs of psychosis to individuals and society at large.",Olfactory and facial markers of developmental risk for psychosis in 22q11 deletion syndrome,9885029,R01MH119185,"['22q11.2', '3-Dimensional', 'Acoustic Rhinometry', 'Behavioral', 'Biometry', 'Body part', 'Brain region', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Craniofacial Abnormalities', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diffuse', 'Dimensions', 'Distress', 'Dysmorphology', 'Ear', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Eye', 'Face', 'Functional disorder', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genetic Risk', 'Geometry', 'Head', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Mandible', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Mental disorders', 'Minor', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Nasal cavity', 'Neurobiology', 'Nose', 'Odors', 'Olfactory Cortex', 'Olfactory Pathways', 'Oral cavity', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Peripheral', 'Phenotype', 'Process', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychophysics', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Severities', 'Smell Perception', 'Societies', 'Structural defect', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Testing', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Work', 'Youth', 'associated symptom', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'brain dysfunction', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'conotruncal anomaly face syndrome', 'cost', 'effective therapy', 'functional outcomes', 'genetic disorder diagnosis', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'microdeletion', 'multilevel analysis', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuromechanism', 'neuropathology', 'olfactory bulb', 'olfactory sulcus', 'precision medicine', 'psychotic symptoms', 'resilience', 'trait']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2019,746845,0.004248241768897272
"Development and validation of an electronic health record prediction tool for first-episode psychosis Psychosis is a major public health challenge, with approximately 100,000 adolescents and young adults in the US experiencing a first episode of psychosis (FEP) every year. Early intervention following FEP is critical for achieving improved outcomes, yet treatment of FEP is often delayed between 1 and 3 years in the US due to delays in detection and referral. The World Health Organization has advocated shortening the duration of untreated psychosis (DUP) to three months or less. The goal of this study is to develop and validate a universal EHR-based screening tool for early detection of FEP across large clinical populations in diverse healthcare settings. In order to maximize the impact and generalizability of the tool across a wide range of healthcare settings, we will rely only on coded medical information collected in the course of care and thus widely available in EHRs. The tool will be developed and validated with data from three diverse health systems that cover over 8 million patients spanning a wide range of demographic, socioeconomic and ethnic backgrounds: Partners Healthcare System, Boston Children's Hospital, and Boston Medical Center. The study will be conducted by a closely collaborating interdisciplinary team of clinical specialists, psychosis researchers, and risk modeling experts based at these health systems and Harvard Medical School, with extensive experience in treating psychosis patients, and developing strategies for detecting FEP and EHR-based risk screening tools for early detection of various clinical conditions. Our preliminary studies show that EHR-based risk models can be used to sensitively and specifically detect FEP cases, on average 2 years before the first psychosis diagnosis appears in their EHR. Our specific aims include: 1. Define a robust cross-site case definition for FEP that relies only on information commonly available in EHRs and validate it through expert chart review; 2. Train and validate a predictive model for early detection of FEP based on large samples of patient data from the three sites; 3. Develop and validate FEP early detection models for key subpopulations, including patients receiving care at mental health clinics, adolescent medicine outpatient programs, and substance abuse treatment programs; and 4. Engage clinical stakeholders in the process of developing a prototype clinician-facing EHR-based risk screening tool for FEP, and release it as an open source SMART App, enabling further validation and clinical integration across a wide range of healthcare settings. Completion of these aims would provide a novel, clinically deployable, and potentially transformative tool for improving the trajectory of those affected with psychosis and reducing the burden and costs of untreated illness. Psychosis is a major public health challenge, with difficulties and delays in detecting its onset that can lead to worse clinical outcomes. The proposed research will develop a clinician-facing electronic-health-record-based automated screening tool for early detection of the first episode of psychosis, with implications for reducing the duration of untreated psychosis as recommended by the NIMH and World Health Organization. The tool will be validated across three large and diverse health systems and released as an open source application (SMART App), increasing its potential for rapid implementation in health systems and clinical care.",Development and validation of an electronic health record prediction tool for first-episode psychosis,9660167,R01MH116042,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Adolescent Medicine', 'Adolescent and Young Adult', 'Advocate', 'Affect', 'Boston', 'Calibration', 'Caring', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Electronic Health Record', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Health system', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Inpatients', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Mental Health', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Primary Health Care', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Support', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Screening procedure', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Site', 'Specialist', 'Suicide', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Work', 'World Health Organization', 'base', 'clinical care', 'cost', 'data resource', 'design', 'experience', 'first episode psychosis', 'health care settings', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'individual patient', 'interest', 'medical schools', 'medical specialties', 'novel', 'open source', 'outpatient programs', 'predictive modeling', 'prototype', 'random forest', 'socioeconomics', 'substance abuse treatment', 'tool', 'treatment program']",NIMH,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2019,892010,0.00010685135558719966
"Contextualized daily prediction of lapse risk in opioid use disorder by digital phenotyping PROJECT SUMMARY Opioid use disorder is increasingly widespread, leading to devastating consequences and costs for patients and their families, friends, and communities. Available treatments for opioid and other substance use disorders (SUD) are not successful at sustaining sobriety. The vast majority of people with SUD relapse within a year. Critically, they often fail to detect dynamic, day-by-day changes in their risk for relapse and do not adequately employ skills they developed or take advantage of support available through continuing care. The broad goals of this project are to develop and deliver a highly contextualized, lapse risk prediction models for forecasting day-by-day probability of opioid and other drug use lapse among people pursuing drug abstinence. This lapse risk prediction model will be delivered within the Addiction-Comprehensive Health Enhancement Support System (A-CHESS) mobile app, which has been established by RCT as a state-of-the-art mHealth system for providing continuing care services for alcohol and substance use disorders. To accomplish these broad goals, a diverse sample of 480 participants with opioid use disorder who are pursing abstinence will be recruited. These participants will be followed for 12 months of their recovery, with observations occurring as early as one week post-abstinence and as late as 18 months post-abstinence across participants in the sample. Well-established distal, static relapse risk signals (e.g., addiction severity, comorbid psychopathology) will be measured on intake. A range of more proximal, time-varying opioid (and other drug use) lapse risk signals will also be collected via participants’ smartphones. These signals include self-report surveys every two months, daily ecological momentary assessments, daily video recovery “check-ins”, voice phone call and text message logs, text message content, moment-by-moment location (via smartphone GPS and location services), physical activity (via smartphone sensors), and usage of the mobile A-CHESS Recovery Support app. The predictive power of these risk signals will be further increased by anchoring them within an inter-personal context of known people, locations, dates, and times that support or detract from participants’ abstinence efforts. Machine learning methods will be used to train, validate, and test opioid (and other drug) lapse risk prediction models based on these contextualized static and dynamic risk signals. These lapse risk prediction models will provide participant specific, day-by-day probabilistic forecast of a lapse to opioid (or other drug) use among opioid abstinent individuals. These lapse risk prediction models will be formally added to the A-CHESS continuing care mobile app at the completion of the project for use in clinical care. These project goals position A-CHESS to make relapse prevention and recovery support, information, and risk monitoring available to patients continuously. Compared to conventional continuing care, A-CHESS will provide personalized care and be available and implemented during moments of greatest need. Integrated real-time risk prediction holds substantial promise to encourage sustained recovery through adaptive use of these continuing care services. PROJECT NARRATIVE The project’s goals are to develop and deliver a real-time model for forecasting day-by-day opioid use lapse among abstinent patients with opioid use disorder.

"Developing data tools to reduce CVD disparities via Health Information Exchanges ABSTRACT CVD disparities across the race/ethnic and socioeconomic gradients are exacerbated by barriers to receiving guideline-based primary or secondary preventive treatment—such as appropriate blood pressure, dyslipidemia, and type 2 diabetes treatment.1–6 Most patients not receiving guideline-based treatment are actually insured and have seen a primary care provider in the past year.1 To reduce CVD disparities by better targeting disease prevention and treatment, healthcare administrators and county departments of public health have begun pooling data resources across healthcare and public health systems—such as across clinics, emergency rooms and hospitals, pharmacies, laboratories, and administrative datasets.7–9 The idea behind pooling such datasets is to better identify persons most in need, and direct targeted interventions to them. Solano County, California, a medium-sized, diverse, low-income county, has developed one of the first, and most comprehensive health information exchanges (HIEs), including: (i) electronic health record data from all emergency rooms, hospitals, primary care and specialty clinics and care facilities in the county; (ii) labs from all laboratory service providers; (iii) prescription details from all pharmacies; (iv) validated social determinants of health surveys administered in clinics; and (v) administrative datasets, including welfare, disability, housing, and geocoded neighborhood features. While several other counties are following suit to develop large, secure HIEs across healthcare and public health systems, a key challenge remains: how to cheaply, accurately, and rapidly analyze HIEs to identify which persons should be targeted for interventions. Without reliable, user- friendly, cost-effective, and generalizable data analysis programs, counties are unable to use the massive data at their disposal to address preventable causes of morbidity and mortality. The objective of this application is to apply our unique machine-learning innovations to develop open-source programs that can enable counties to identify persons at high risk for preventable CVD events and deaths. We will test the hypothesis that electronic health record data alone are insufficient to provide accurate risk prediction for preventable CVD events and deaths. Rather, we believe that key survey and administrative data providing information on social determinants of health will improve identification of high-risk patients. To test our hypothesis, we will develop and validate open-source, generalizable programs to: (Aim 1) rapidly identify persons in need of improved primary and secondary prevention of CVD by systematically comparing the performance of three alternative machine learning approaches to read HIE data, as compared to human clinician chart reviewers; and (Aim 2) perform multi-level risk assessment by automatically calibrating and validating models of CVD event risk, utilization and cost to HIE data, to identify the added value of administrative and social determinants data as compared to clinical or claims-based data alone. Our work will produce generalizable software tools for counties across the country to analyze HIE data and reduce preventable CVD disparities. PROJECT NARRATIVE Cardiovascular disease (CVD) disparities are exacerbated by inadequate guideline-based treatment of CVD risk factors. Furthermore, risk adjustment models currently used to target interventions and pay for healthcare services only use claims-based data such as demographics and clinical diagnostic codes, ignoring social determinants of health. Our research will rigorously develop and test novel machine learning methods that incorporate social determinants data from large Health Information Exchanges, producing novel data tools that will enable health systems nationwide to better detect individuals who could use improvements in their preventive therapy for CVD, and improve risk adjustment models to identify persons at high risk for preventable healthcare utilization and cost.",Developing data tools to reduce CVD disparities via Health Information Exchanges,9766361,R21MD012867,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Address', 'Administrator', 'Blood Pressure', 'California', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular Models', 'Case Management', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Country', 'County', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Dyslipidemias', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Event', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Personnel', 'Health Surveys', 'Health care facility', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Heart failure', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Housing', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Information Systems', 'Insurance', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Literature', 'Low income', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Neighborhoods', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Pharmacy facility', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Population Surveillance', 'Preventive therapy', 'Preventive treatment', 'Primary Health Care', 'Primary Prevention', 'Public Health', 'Race', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Adjustment', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Secondary Prevention', 'Secure', 'Social Work', 'Software Tools', 'Standardization', 'Stroke', 'Surveys', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Unemployment', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Vocabulary', 'Work', 'base', 'cardiovascular disorder prevention', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'cardiovascular disorder therapy', 'care providers', 'clinical diagnostics', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'data exchange', 'data resource', 'deep learning', 'demographics', 'disability', 'disorder prevention', 'health care service', 'health care service utilization', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'medical specialties', 'mortality', 'novel', 'open source', 'payment', 'programs', 'prospective', 'residence', 'risk prediction model', 'safety net', 'semiparametric', 'service providers', 'social', 'social health determinants', 'socioeconomics', 'tool', 'treatment disparity', 'user-friendly', 'welfare']",NIMHD,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R21,2019,190864,0.012697493976098914
"Imaging the Suicide Mind using Neurosemantic Signatures as Markers of Suicidal Ideation and Behavior ABSTRACT: The assessment of suicidal risk is critical for treatment planning and monitoring of therapeutic progress for suicidal individuals. Current standard-of-care relies on patient self-report and clinician impression, which are not strongly predictive of imminent suicidal risk. This project advances a highly innovative approach to the assessment of suicidal risk, by using machine-learning detection of brain activation patterns that are neural signatures of individual concepts that have been altered in suicidal individuals. The overarching goal is to establish reliable neurocognitive markers of suicidal ideation (SI) and attempt (SA) in individual participants, and to assess these measures’ ability to predict future ideation and attempts. In previous work, this approach was applied to the fMRI-based neurosemantic signature (NSS’s) during the thinking about each of 30 words related to either to suicide, negative concepts, or positive concepts in 17 SI young adults and 17 healthy controls (HCs). A machine learning classifier was able to discriminate between the SI and HCs with 91% accuracy, based on differential brain activation patterns in the L superior medial frontal cortex and anterior cingulate, areas known to be involved in self-referential thinking. Within the ideators, NSS’s also discriminated between those with a history of a SA from those without such a history with 94% accuracy. Moreover, using the classification algorithm derived from this sample, we were able to accurately classify a second sample of suicidal individuals with 87% accuracy. It was also possible to assess the emotions differentially manifested during the thinking about these words, and thus to differentiate SI from HC with 85% accuracy, and SI with and without SA with 88% accuracy. On the basis of these promising pilot findings, we propose to study 300 young adult SI (about half of whom will have made a SA), 100 never-suicidal psychiatric controls, and 100 HCs, use fMRI to assess NSS at intake and 3 months, and assess for suicidal ideation and behavior at intake, 3, 6, and 9 months thereafter. The goals are to determine if: (1) NSS’s are sensitive to changes in level of suicidal ideation when repeated at 3 months; and (2) whether NSS can predict trajectories of suicidal ideation and behavior upon prospective follow-up. We will also examine the relationship between NSS activation of circuits related to self-referential thinking and the death/suicide Implicit Association Test (IAT) that examines the extent to which a person associates suicide-related concepts with self. Finally, as a translational goal, we aim to develop and test a neurally based IAT that examines associations of suicidal concepts with self and with emotions as informed by NSS findings. This study, by shedding light on alterations in suicidal individuals’ neural representation of suicide-relevant concepts could be extremely useful for: (1) identification of those with suicidal ideation who may not self-report their level of risk; (2) monitoring fluctuations in suicidal risk over time; (3) identification of emotional states associated with suicidal ideation; (4) guiding therapy to mitigate these alterations; and (5) the prediction of future suicidal ideation and behavior. PROJECT NARRATIVE: This project takes a novel approach to the study of suicidal risk by examining the differences in brain activation patterns between suicidal and non-suicidal young adults when thinking about concepts related to suicide, negative, and positive emotions while undergoing neuroimaging. We use modern computing techniques called machine learning to identify brain activation patterns that differentiate suicidal and non-suicidal individuals and that can help to predict future suicidal ideation and behavior and will develop an easy-to-use computer test based on these brain activation studies that we hope will also be predictive of future suicidal ideation and behavior. If this project is as successful as our preliminary work, it will advance clinical practice by improving clinicians’ ability to: (1) detect and monitor suicidal risk, (2) understand alterations in thinking and feelings related to suicide in their patients; and (3) develop personalized treatment strategies for their suicidal patients based on their altered patterns of thinking and feeling that can more precisely and effectively reduce suicidal risk.",Imaging the Suicide Mind using Neurosemantic Signatures as Markers of Suicidal Ideation and Behavior,9716663,R01MH116652,"['Affect', 'Age', 'Anterior', 'Area', 'Brain', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical assessments', 'Computers', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Feeling', 'Feeling suicidal', 'Frequencies', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Implicit Association Test', 'Individual', 'Intake', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Methods', 'Mind', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Neurocognitive', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Pilot Projects', 'Recording of previous events', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Severities', 'Shame', 'Suicide', 'Suicide attempt', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'cingulate cortex', 'classification algorithm', 'clinical practice', 'design', 'follow-up', 'frontal lobe', 'ideation', 'impression', 'improved', 'innovation', 'longitudinal design', 'neural patterning', 'neuroimaging', 'novel strategies', 'personalized medicine', 'positive emotional state', 'predictive test', 'prospective', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'standard of care', 'suicidal', 'suicidal behavior', 'suicidal individual', 'suicidal morbidity', 'suicidal patient', 'suicidal risk', 'treatment planning', 'treatment strategy', 'young adult']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2019,723673,-0.10584253680747203
"Cancer Prevention through Dietary Change: Training in translational neuroimaging PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Unhealthy eating increases the risk of developing several kinds of cancer. This occurs directly through consumption of carcinogenic food, and indirectly through overweight and obesity. Because nearly 70% of American adults are overweight or obese, it is critical to develop effective interventions to alter eating behavior. One key factor that influences eating behavior and weight gain is cue-induced food craving. Craving stimulates appetitive motivation to eat, but can be regulated via cognitive strategies such as reappraisal, or the reconstrual of a stimulus to change its affective meaning. Reappraisal increases the salience of consumption- related costs and reduces food craving for unhealthy food. Craving reappraisal is therefore a promising target for interventions designed to reduce unhealthy eating and risk for diet-related cancers. However, individual differences in treatment efficacy remain a persistent problem with interventions. To understand why an intervention works for some individuals and not for others requires clearly defined neurobiological mechanisms of change, as well as sensitive and specific tools to evaluate individual differences in psychological targets. To fill this gap, the goal of this project is to leverage machine learning and multivariate neuroimaging methods to develop and validate a sensitive and specific neural signature of craving reappraisal that can be used as a neurobiological index of craving reappraisal ability. To achieve this goal, this project will pursue the following Aims: 1) develop and validate a neural signature of craving reappraisal in an independent sample of existing data, and 2) establish the predictive and incremental validity the neural signature in the context of an ongoing randomized control trial of cognitive reappraisal training to reduce unhealthy eating in overweight and obese adults. Specifically, after development, I will test the construct validity of the neural signature by assessing whether expression of the signature is greater while participants reappraise their desire for craved food than while they simply view these foods (Aim 1). I will also test the predictive and incremental validity of the neural signature by assessing the extent to which individual differences the neural signature change predict intervention outcomes, such as the value of unhealthy food and eating behavior, above and beyond standard methods (Aim 2). Upon completion of this project, I will have developed and validated a sensitive and specific neurobiological index of craving reappraisal ability that can be readily used by other researchers to evaluate intervention efficacy and individual differences in responsivity to treatment. I will also receive in-depth training in translational neuroscience interventions for cancer control, and multivariate neuroimaging and machine learning. This work will facilitate the refinement of reappraisal-based interventions to reduce unhealthy eating that will ultimately reduce the prevalence of overweight and obesity and risk for diet-related cancers. Further, by documenting my analysis process and sharing my analysis code, the results of this work can readily be adopted by others to study a variety of psychological processes relevant to eating behavior and cancer risk. PROJECT NARRATIVE Cognitive reappraisal can be used to reduce food craving and unhealthy eating (a key risk factor for several kinds of cancer), but interventions to train reappraisal ability are not equally effective for all individuals. This project aims to leverage multivariate neuroimaging and machine learning techniques to develop an objective, neurobiological index of craving reappraisal ability that can be used to assess individual differences in treatment responsivity. The knowledge and research training gained from this project will prepare the trainee to build and refine interventions to reduce unhealthy eating that will ultimately reduce the prevalence of overweight and obesity, and risk for diet-related cancers.",Cancer Prevention through Dietary Change: Training in translational neuroimaging,9756118,F31CA232357,"['Adopted', 'Adult', 'Affective', 'American', 'Behavior', 'Cancer Control', 'Cancer Intervention', 'Code', 'Cognitive', 'Consumption', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Desire for food', 'Development', 'Diet', 'Eating', 'Eating Behavior', 'Exhibits', 'Food', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Goals', 'Health Promotion', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Informal Social Control', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motivation', 'Neurobiology', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Overweight', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Randomized', 'Reproducibility', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Specificity', 'Stimulus', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Validation', 'Weight Gain', 'Work', 'adult obesity', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'cancer prevention', 'cancer risk', 'carcinogenicity', 'cognitive reappraisal', 'control trial', 'cost', 'craving', 'design', 'effective intervention', 'experience', 'food craving', 'increased appetite', 'indexing', 'intervention effect', 'neurobiological mechanism', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'obesity risk', 'open source', 'parent grant', 'post intervention', 'predictive test', 'psychologic', 'relating to nervous system', 'therapy design', 'tool', 'translational neuroscience']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF OREGON,F31,2019,39535,-0.00864398672814534
"Sudden Cardiac Arrest (SCA): Prediction and Prevention Project Summary: The recent advances in information technologies and biotechnologies is an opportunity to substantially improve healthcare. To exploit the power of data to benefit patients, however, effective clinical decision support tools and novel, individualized interventions must be designed, tested, and implemented. Although there has been progress in the development of statistical/machine learning methods, numerous challenges remain to tailor and translate them into useful clinical decision support tools. Sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) accounts for 15-20% of all adult deaths and is the industrial world’s leading cause of death. Clinical studies of SCA produce repeated measures on risk factors and multiple different kinds of events over time. We refer to these data as survival, longitudinal, and multivariate (SLAM) data. In this project, we will develop novel statistical learning methods for SLAM data and apply them to two distinct aspects of the SCA problem. First, we propose to develop novel statistical learning algorithms that better predict an individual’s multivariate longitudinal data with a focus on the risk of first and subsequent SCA. Second, we propose to develop micro-randomization and just-in-time adaptive intervention trial designs to reduce behavioral risk factors for SCA among persons at high risk. The methods that we propose to develop will be applicable in many areas of medicine. However, they are motivated by and applied to SCA in this project. Our team has expertise in statistics including causal inference, longitudinal data and survival analyses, plus machine learning, epidemiology, cardiology, and behavioral interventions through mobile health (mHealth). This proposed collaboration has the following specific aims: Aim 1: Develop and test statistical learning tools for real-time risk prediction of survival, longitudinal, and multivariate (SLAM) outcome data. Aim 2: Estimate the risk of SCA and its dependence on dynamic modifiable and non-modifiable factors in population-based and clinical cohorts. Aim 3: Plan and conduct a feasibility-usability study of micro-randomization and just-in-time adaptive intervention trial designs for behavioral change to reduce SCA risk. Upon successful completion of these aims, we will have contributed to the progress of healthcare delivery through the application of computational statistics to medicine. ! ! Project Narrative: Although sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) is the industrial world’s leading cause of death, SCA prediction and prevention strategies remain limited. In this project, we contribute towards addressing the global burden of SCAs through the development of novel statistical/machine learning methods for SCA risk prediction and the design of mobile health (mHealth) interventions for risk reduction. While developed in the context of SCA, these methods will be applicable in many areas of medicine and public health. !",Sudden Cardiac Arrest (SCA): Prediction and Prevention,9790928,F30HL142131,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Archives', 'Area', 'Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Biomedical Technology', 'Biotechnology', 'Cardiac health', 'Cardiology', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical assessments', 'Collaborations', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Epidemiology', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Future', 'Growth', 'Health Promotion', 'Health Technology', 'Healthcare', 'Heart Arrest', 'Heart failure', 'Hospitalization', 'Implantable Defibrillators', 'Individual', 'Industrialization', 'Information Technology', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Modernization', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Physicians', 'Prevention', 'Prevention strategy', 'Preventive Medicine', 'Public Health', 'Randomized', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Research Proposals', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Estimate', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk Reduction', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Subgroup', 'Survival Analysis', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'adaptive intervention', 'career', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical decision-making', 'cohort', 'design', 'health care delivery', 'high risk', 'improved', 'interest', 'learning algorithm', 'learning strategy', 'mHealth', 'mobile application', 'modifiable risk', 'novel', 'open source', 'population based', 'prospective', 'randomized trial', 'statistics', 'support tools', 'survival prediction', 'time use', 'tool', 'trial design', 'usability']",NHLBI,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,F30,2019,50016,0.004519597790411179
"In Vivo Knee Motion and ACL Biomechanics During Dynamic Activities Abstract: Radiographic evidence of OA is present in more than 50% of patients 10 years after ACL reconstruction. However, the etiology of early onset OA after ACL reconstruction is not well understood. While previous work has demonstrated changes in joint motion following reconstruction, it is unclear how these altered motions relate to changes in the local mechanical response of cartilage to in vivo loading. This information may be critical to understanding the onset of OA, as the mechanical response of cartilage affects cartilage homeostasis. In line with this mechanism, our pilot data indicates that regions of high cartilage strain measured in patients with ACL injury and reconstruction are susceptible to decreased cartilage thickness, a characteristic feature of OA. Importantly, these degenerative changes are observed as early as 18 months post-reconstruction. Therefore, in this proposal our overall hypothesis is that site-specific changes in the mechanical response of cartilage to loading following ACL injury and reconstruction are predictive of long-term cartilage degeneration. Specifically, we hypothesize that in regions of cartilage experiencing elevated strain during loading, early degeneration will be reflected by altered composition and decreased cartilage thickness. Thus, we will measure localized cartilage strain, composition, and thickness at four time-points: after ACL injury but prior to reconstruction, as well as at 3 months, 1 year, and 2 years after surgery. At each time point, a combination of high-speed biplanar radiography and MR imaging will be used to measure local cartilage strains during in vivo loading. To assess cartilage degeneration, we will use MRI to measure site-specific changes in composition (using T1rho and T2 relaxation times) and cartilage thickness. Additionally, our analyses will account for relevant biological variables such as age, sex, and BMI, and clinical factors such as graft placement characteristics and meniscus injuries. In addition to mechanical factors, biological factors such as joint inflammation and lubrication may also play a role in cartilage degeneration after ACL reconstruction. Therefore, synovial fluid and serum will be collected to measure inflammatory mediators and metabolic biomarkers. Using this data, we will develop a predictive model of cartilage degeneration after ACL reconstruction that utilizes both mechanical and biological factors, as well as other demographic and clinical characteristics, to predict declines in cartilage health. Furthermore, this comprehensive dataset will be used to develop clinical phenotypes to identify those at high risk for cartilage degradation after ACL reconstruction. Importantly, the development of these phenotypes will enable targeted treatment approaches focusing on surgical procedures, pharmaceutical targets, and non- pharmacological interventions such as physical therapy or weight loss in preventing cartilage degeneration. Therefore, our findings will both elucidate the role of alterations in the local mechanical response of cartilage on degeneration after ACL reconstruction and improve the identification and treatment of patients at high risk for cartilage degeneration. Project Narrative Early onset osteoarthritis (OA) is a major concern after ACL reconstruction. This project will develop a predictive model of cartilage degeneration after ACL reconstruction using a novel combination of mechanical factors, biological factors, demographics, and clinical characteristics. This information is critical to developing new targets aimed at OA prevention after ACL reconstruction.",In Vivo Knee Motion and ACL Biomechanics During Dynamic Activities,9830438,R01AR065527,"['Affect', 'Age', 'Biological', 'Biological Factors', 'Biological Markers', 'Biomechanics', 'Body Weight decreased', 'Cartilage', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Degenerative polyarthritis', 'Development', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Etiology', 'Future', 'Health', 'Homeostasis', 'Image', 'Inflammation Mediators', 'Inflammatory', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Knee', 'Lubrication', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Meniscus structure of joint', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'Motion', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Pain', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Outcomes Assessments', 'Patients', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Phenotype', 'Physical therapy', 'Play', 'Prevention', 'Reconstructive Surgical Procedures', 'Relaxation', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Serum', 'Site', 'Speed', 'Statistical Models', 'Synovial Fluid', 'Techniques', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Validation', 'Walking', 'Work', 'anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction', 'articular cartilage', 'cartilage degradation', 'clinical phenotype', 'demographics', 'early onset', 'experience', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'joint destruction', 'joint inflammation', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'psychosocial', 'random forest', 'reconstruction', 'response', 'sex', 'targeted treatment', 'three-dimensional modeling', 'treadmill']",NIAMS,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,645744,-0.010982513345736007
"Determining critical skill deficits that predict novice driver crashes: A prospective study using a novel virtual driving test at point of licensure, state licensing data and crash outcomes Project Summary Motor vehicle crashes lead causes of adolescent mortality, making this a major health threat facing US adolescents. Given that 95.6% of novice driver crashes are due to driver error, improved skill should reduce crash incidence. Research supports this: novice driver crash rates peak immediately following licensure and decline steeply with experience gained over the months following licensure. However, it is not known which critical driving skill deficits present at licensure predict crashes. The long-term goal of this research is to develop interventions prior to licensure that can lead to the safest independent driving post licensure. With this R21 project, we will identify deficits in driving skills that are (a) associated with major predictors of early crash risk (age at licensure and sex) and that (b) can predict differences in crash rates within the first year of independent licensure. We will leverage our exclusive access to an innovative, newly available data source for young driver research. To enable study of safety critical driving skill deficits in novice drivers, results from a new (as of July 2017) virtual driving test (VDT) - developed by the PI, adopted by the State of Ohio and delivered immediately prior to the on-road licensing examination - will be linked to Ohio licensing and crash data. We propose these aims: Aim 1: identify skill clusters using multivariate clustering, regression and machine learning techniques to test the hypothesis that these clusters are related to age at licensure, sex, and time spent in the learner period; Aim 2a: use data on driving skills linked with reported crash data in Ohio to determine whether the skill clusters identified in Aim 1 are associated with crash risk; and Aim 2b: determine if those skill clusters from Aim1 are predictive of crashes in rural teen drivers. With a large sample of new driver applicants (>25,000), this study will examine, for the first time, differences in skill, starting at an age (adolescence) and a time (within the first year of licensure) when crash risk is high. We will create a normative dataset of novice driver skills; classify skill deficits by age, sex and time in learner period; and quantify the relationship between skill deficits and crash rates during the first 2 months of licensure (when crash rates are highest for young drivers) and the following 10 months as experience accumulates. If the use of the VDT proves successful in predicting crash risk, we will be able to identify novice drivers with elevated crash risk before granting a license. This R21 will enable the following lines of research: (1) Develop new interventions that address skill deficits through training, individualized to the needs of the novice driver (in partnership with Ohio). (2) Develop or adapt advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) or self-driving vehicle technology to mitigate identified skill deficits (as part of Dr. Winston’s National Science Foundation Industry/University Cooperative Research Center). (3) Conduct a prospective study (R01) of the interacting trajectories of driving skill acquisition and cognitive development that lead to individual differences in skills at the time of licensure and the ensuing crash risk. Narrative We will identify safety-critical driving skill deficits immediately prior to licensure that predict crashes, starting at an age (adolescence) and a time (within the first year of licensure) when crash risk is high. We will leverage exclusive access to newly available data on >25,000 novice drivers: state licensing and crash data linked to results from a new (as of July 2017), well-validated virtual driving test that identifies driving skill deficits (adopted by Ohio). If this R21 finds the VDT successful in predicting crash risk, we plan to: (1) conduct a future study of the interacting trajectories of driving skill acquisition and cognitive development that lead to individual differences in skills at the time of licensure and the ensuing crash risk and (2) develop new interventions (training and vehicle technology) to address this risk.","Determining critical skill deficits that predict novice driver crashes: A prospective study using a novel virtual driving test at point of licensure, state licensing data and crash outcomes",9808966,R21HD099635,"['Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adopted', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Automobile Driving', 'Behavior', 'Cognitive', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Incidence', 'Individual Differences', 'Industry', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Licensing', 'Licensure', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Ohio', 'Outcome', 'Police', 'Population', 'Population Study', 'Populations at Risk', 'Prospective Studies', 'Proxy', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Support', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Rural', 'Safety', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Site', 'Speed', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Teenagers', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Time Factors', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Vehicle crash', 'Young driver', 'base', 'cognitive development', 'design', 'driving skills', 'experience', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'mortality', 'novel', 'personalized intervention', 'programs', 'prospective', 'safety study', 'sex', 'skill acquisition', 'skills', 'suburb', 'virtual']",NICHD,CHILDREN'S HOSP OF PHILADELPHIA,R21,2019,294653,0.011004592191766879
"iTransform: Wearable Biosensors to Detect the Evolution of Opioid Tolerance in Opioid Naïve Individuals PROJECT SUMMARY The integrated research and training plans outlined in this K23 submission will prepare me for a career as a clinician-scientist conducting translational substance abuse research. My career goal is to perform hypothesis- driven original research investigations directed toward reducing morbidity and mortality from opioid overdose. In this proposal, I intend to deploy wearable biosensors (small devices that continuously record physiology) to study the effects of therapeutic administration of opioid analgesics. I have already studied wearable biosensors in individuals receiving opioids; my preliminary data demonstrates that opioid-tolerant individuals have different biometric signals than non-tolerant individuals. This observation suggests that biosensors can be used to identify the onset of tolerance, an important event that correlates with higher doses of opioid analgesics, and higher risk of death from opioid overdose. Biosensor data management and analysis requires signal processing, data analytic, and machine learning techniques; these approaches are beyond the areas of traditional medical training. My short-term goal is to utilize this K23 award to fill my knowledge gaps in wearable biosensing and advanced data analysis so that I can generate ever more innovative responses to the problem of opioid prescribing, tolerance, misuse, addiction, and overdose. To optimize this important line of investigation, I have developed a training plan that includes: 1) completing a PhD through the Millennium PhD program; 2) expanding my skills in wearable biosensing and behavioral health-based research; 3) developing an understanding of signal processing and machine learning; 4) developing data analytic and data science skills; and 5) expanding my research presentation and dissemination skills. I will achieve these goals through directed coursework, focused seminars, and practical experience. My mentorship team of expert investigators who will ensure my productivity and success includes E. Boyer (primary mentor), D. Smelson, J. Fang, and P. Indic (secondary mentors), and D. Ganesan (advisor) My research plan has three specific aims: 1) to deploy a wearable biosensor technology to detect digital biomarkers associated with the initiation of opioid analgesic therapy in an opioid naïve population; 2) to use signal-processing analytics to identify transitions in digital biomarkers with progressive opioid use and to identify individual characteristics associated with this transition; and, 3) to apply and explore supervised learning algorithms that can predict transitions in digital biomarkers that herald the onset of opioid tolerance. To identify dynamic patterns in response to opioids, I will study the digital biomarkers of opioid-naïve patients with acute fractures who are prescribed opioid analgesics. Results will be used to develop “big data” approaches to apply predictive algorithms to identify the onset of opioid tolerance. This work has the potential to prevent development of problematic opioid use and will provide the basis for subsequent R01 submissions to implement sensor-based interventions triggered by the onset of tolerance in individuals receiving opioid analgesics. PROJECT NARRATIVE Morbidity and mortality related to opioids (both prescription and illicit) has reached staggering proportions: more than half of individuals who currently abuse heroin report that opioid abuse began with a prescription opioid. Dr. Carreiro has demonstrated that wearable biosensors can discriminate between individuals who are naïve to the effects of opioids from those who are opioid tolerant, a characteristic that increases risk for opioid-related death. This career development award will provide her with the training to use of wearable biosensors to identify the onset of opioid tolerance and the expertise to reach her ultimate goal of developing tools to prevent opioid-related death and increase the safety of opioid prescribing.",iTransform: Wearable Biosensors to Detect the Evolution of Opioid Tolerance in Opioid Naïve Individuals,9666315,K23DA045242,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Acute', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Analgesics', 'Area', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Biological Markers', 'Biometry', 'Biosensing Techniques', 'Biosensor', 'Characteristics', 'Consent', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Collection', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Dose', 'Drug abuse', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Fracture', 'Funding', 'Galvanic Skin Response', 'Gender', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Heroin Abuse', 'Immersion Investigative Technique', 'Individual', 'Ingestion', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Italy', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Motion', 'Opiate Addiction', 'Opioid', 'Opioid Analgesics', 'Overdose', 'Pain', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Predictive Analytics', 'Productivity', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Records', 'Relapse', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Research Training', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Safety', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Signal Transduction', 'Skin Temperature', 'Source', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Teacher Professional Development', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Effect', 'Therapeutic Uses', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'Wrist', 'addiction', 'analytical method', 'base', 'behavioral health', 'career', 'comparative', 'data integrity', 'data management', 'digital', 'experience', 'high risk', 'innovation', 'insight', 'learning algorithm', 'learning strategy', 'mHealth', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mortality', 'novel', 'opiate tolerance', 'opioid abuse', 'opioid mortality', 'opioid overdose', 'opioid therapy', 'opioid use', 'prediction algorithm', 'prescription opioid', 'prevent', 'programs', 'recruit', 'response', 'sensor', 'signal processing', 'skills', 'social', 'success', 'supervised learning', 'tool']",NIDA,UNIV OF MASSACHUSETTS MED SCH WORCESTER,K23,2019,188575,-0.012883064814030325

Finally, this award will support a research project that extends Dr. Alonso's ongoing work on understanding the factors influencing the development of the AF substrate, understanding AF pathophysiology, and preventing AF-related outcomes. The specific aims of this research are: (1) to identify novel AF phenotypes (phenogroups) using extensive clinical and multi-omic data (“phenomapping”), (2) to discover specific risk factors for the different AF phenogroups, and (3) to determine associations of AF phenogroups with selected endpoints (stroke, heart failure, mortality). These research aims will be carried out in the context of the Emory Cardiovascular Biobank, an ongoing prospective registry of patients undergoing cardiac catheterization in three Emory-affiliated hospitals currently including approximately 7,000 unique individuals with detailed phenotyping, clinical outcomes, and multi-omic markers. In summary, the activities proposed in this application will favorably impact Dr. Alonso's capabilities to conduct cutting-edge and innovative patient-oriented research on cardiovascular prevention and his ability to perform as a highly qualified mentor for junior clinicians pursuing research on clinical cardiovascular epidemiology and prevention. PROJECT NARRATIVE Despite progress, atrial fibrillation, a common cardiac arrhythmia, remains a major public health program. This award will contribute to advance our understanding of the causes and consequences of atrial fibrillation.

"Evidence to improve heat warning effectiveness in reducing morbidity and mortality Project Summary/Abstract  While exposure to high ambient temperature (i.e., heat) has long been recognized as a threat to public health, the burden of illness and death attributable to heat in the US remains high. In an effort to reduce heat- related mortality and morbidity, the US National Weather Service (NWS) issues heat alerts in advance of forecasted extreme heat events to communicate these risks to the public and government officials. However, it is largely unknown: (1) what are the optimal metrics of heat stress to inform when to issue heat alerts, (2) how effective are heat alerts in protecting the public’s health and (3) what factors make heat alerts comparatively more or less effective in some places or in some people versus others. In the absence of such information, we will fail to maximize the public health benefits of heat alerts.  The goals of this proposal are to identify the optimal health-based and location-specific metrics for issuing heat alerts, to estimate the causal benefits of heat alerts, and to identify characteristics of individuals or communities associated with the greatest reductions in morbidity or mortality following heat alerts. Specifically, using national claims data on deaths and hospital admissions among the large, geographically diverse population of >60 million US Medicare beneficiaries age ≥65 years enrolled between 2001 and 2015, and on emergency department visits among >130 million participants of all ages from one of the nation’s largest health insurers, we propose to: (Aim 1) Use novel machine learning methods to identify the heat metric(s) (e.g., heat index, ambient temperature, spatial synoptic classification, wet bulb globe temperature, absolute humidity) that best predict excess heat-related deaths, emergency hospitalizations, and emergency departments visits in each location, (Aim 2) estimate the causal effects of NWS heat alerts on rates of mortality, hospitalizations, and emergency department visits across the country and within groups stratified by health outcome, sex, and age group, and (Aim 3) assess how the benefits of heat alerts vary across characteristics of communities.  Key innovations of this proposal include a very large sample size, geographic diversity encompassing the entire US, the assessment across multiple health endpoints and age groups, and the use of sophisticated methods in statistical learning and causal inference. Collectively, the findings from this proposal will provide meteorologists, public health and emergency management officials, and local policy-makers with critical information to better protect public health during extreme heat events and guide more targeted future research on strategies to mitigate the adverse health effects of heat. Project Narrative Extreme heat is recognized as an important threat to public health, and the burden of illness and death attributable to heat in the US remains high. In an effort to reduce heat-related mortality and morbidity, the US National Weather Service (NWS) issues heat alerts in advance of forecast extreme heat events to communicate these risks to the public and local government officials, although it remains largely unknown whether such alerts are effective in protecting people. We propose to provide forecasters and public health officials across the country with location-specific, health-based evidence as to the effectiveness of heat alerts and insights into how to improve them to better protect the public’s health.",Evidence to improve heat warning effectiveness in reducing morbidity and mortality,9638880,R01ES029950,"['Age', 'Air Conditioning', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Communities', 'Country', 'Data', 'Effectiveness', 'Emergency Situation', 'Emergency department visit', 'Enrollment', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Event', 'Exposure to', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Government Agencies', 'Government Officials', 'Health', 'Health Benefit', 'Heat Stress Disorders', 'Hospitalization', 'Humidity', 'Individual', 'Insurance Carriers', 'Knowledge', 'Local Government', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Medicare', 'Methods', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Policy Maker', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Predisposition', 'Prevalence', 'Public Health', 'Race', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Sample Size', 'Seasons', 'Services', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Structure', 'Temperature', 'United States', 'Weather', 'age group', 'attributable mortality', 'base', 'beneficiary', 'burden of illness', 'comparative', 'evidence base', 'extreme heat', 'human old age (65+)', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'mortality', 'mortality risk', 'novel', 'prevent', 'public health emergency', 'response', 'sex']",NIEHS,BROWN UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,662969,-0.004712805839490724
"Temperamental emotionality in preschoolers and depression risk PROJECT SUMMARY Depressive disorders (DD) are one of the most prevalent forms of mental disorders, and are associated with significant mortality, morbidity, and economic costs. The incidence of DD begins to increase in early-mid adolescence and peaks in emerging adulthood. The Stony Brook Temperament Study is a longitudinal study that seeks to identify early behavioral and neural precursors and risk factors for DD and understand the neurobiological and psychosocial processes through which these early manifestations develop into clinically significant psychopathology. We initially assessed a large community sample of 3-year old children, and have followed them at 3-year intervals through age 15. This competing renewal application seeks to re-evaluate the sample at ages 18 and 21. Specifically, we propose to trace pathways from laboratory observations of temperamental low positive emotionality and high negative emotionality at age 3 to neural indices of emotional and social information processing and DD symptoms and onsets from middle childhood through emerging adulthood. In addition, we seek to understand how life stress over the lifespan and the developmental challenges of emerging adulthood contribute to risk for DD, and to examine the specificity of these risk pathways in comparison with anxiety and substance use disorders. Finally, we will use cutting-edge machine learning techniques to maximize prediction of DD and understand which domains and developmental periods contribute most to prediction. This information about risk pathways and processes should contribute to understanding when and how to intervene in order to prevent DD and limit their progression. PROJECT NARRATIVE Depressive disorders are highly prevalent and associated with significant impairment and mortality. Rates of depression begin to rise rapidly in early-mid adolescence and peak in early adulthood. This project seeks to identify early antecedents and risk factors for the onset of depressive disorders and to understand the processes through which these early manifestations develop into clinically signficant psychopathology.

"Diseases of Despair in Young Adulthood: Risk, Resilience, and Prevention ABSTRACT After decades of improvement, premature mortality is uniquely on the rise in the U.S. among White non- Hispanic adults with low education. Suicide, drug poisoning (particularly from opiates), and alcoholic liver disease appear to be the culprits and have been coined “deaths of despair.” Suicidal thoughts and behaviors, illicit drug use, and alcohol problems (or “diseases of despair,” DoD)—the conditions that likely precede these deaths—are the focus of this application, as are the pathways to these DoD. Despite many years of research and in the face of rising suicides and a nationwide opiates public health emergency, we lack accurate and appreciable predictions of who will succumb to DoD and who will be shielded from them. Speedy new insights on the development of DoD are needed to inform efforts to reverse the rising tide of DoD. These can only be generated with decades' worth of prospective-longitudinal data with rich coverage of multiple levels of risk and protective factors—from community contexts to molecular mechanisms—with clinically-relevant characterizations of DoD. Realistically, no single extant dataset can fulfill these requirements. Secondary data analysis of multiple long- term longitudinal studies of recent cohorts, with recent young adult assessments, can provide an unprecedented opportunity here. We capitalize on three complementary, long-standing, prospective- longitudinal data sets spanning childhood, adolescence, and young adulthood, with recent assessments in young adulthood. (1) The nationally representative National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (Add Health) allows for fine-grained socio-structural characterizations of individuals and communities affected by DoD. (2) The community-representative psychiatric-diagnostic Great Smoky Mountains Study (GSMS) was collected in mostly impoverished rural communities in Appalachia—one of the epicenters of the DoD epidemic. It features a quasi-experiment that allows testing for whether cash transfers—received by a subgroup of participants for over 15 years—are protective against DoD. (3) Fast Track is a comprehensive 10- year randomized clinical intervention trial with 15 years of follow-up data that targeted mechanisms that are key in recent models of pathways to DoD. The first aim is to look longitudinally at the developmental epidemiology of DoD across the early lifespan in the nationally-representative Add Health and in the rural- Appalachian GSMS with a large American Indian subsample. The second aim is to test a childhood/adolescent strain  young adult social/economic disengagement  despair  DoD pathways model and also to test protective factors that could intervene on each pathway. We will also use discovery-focused machine learning algorithms to uncover new pathways to DoD in Add Health and GSMS. The third aim is to assess the impact of childhood interventions on DoD in GSMS and Fast Track. PROJECT NARRATIVE This interlocking series of aims allows us to identify who is at risk for DoD in contemporary America, how they came to be, and whether DoD could be prevented by early intervention. Results will provide direct, actionable and fine-tuned knowledge for prevention science and public policy efforts to curb the troubling new premature mortality trends.","Diseases of Despair in Young Adulthood: Risk, Resilience, and Prevention",9903905,R01MH117559,"['Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Alcohol abuse', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Alcoholic Liver Diseases', 'Algorithms', 'American Indians', 'Americas', 'Appalachian Region', 'Behavior', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Biological Response Modifier Therapy', 'Censuses', 'Cessation of life', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Coin', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'County', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Economics', 'Education', 'Epidemic', 'Epidemiology', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Exposure to', 'Feeling suicidal', 'Grain', 'Health', 'Immune', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Trial', 'Knowledge', 'Life Expectancy', 'Longevity', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Mediation', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Neighborhoods', 'Not Hispanic or Latino', 'Opioid', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Poisoning', 'Premature Mortality', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Psychopathology', 'Public Policy', 'Quasi-experiment', 'Race', 'Randomized', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Rural', 'Rural Appalachia', 'Rural Community', 'Science Policy', 'Series', 'Societies', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Suicide', 'Testing', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'cost', 'deprivation', 'disorder risk', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'illicit drug use', 'insight', 'longitudinal dataset', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mortality risk', 'multimodality', 'prevent', 'programs', 'prospective', 'protective factors', 'psychosocial', 'public health emergency', 'resilience', 'secondary analysis', 'sex', 'social', 'sociodemographics', 'suicidal behavior', 'trend', 'young adult']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF VERMONT & ST AGRIC COLLEGE,R01,2019,418818,-0.06302934282097648
"PsycheMERGE: Leveraging electronic health records and genomics for mental health research Neuropsychiatric disorders are the leading causes of disability in the US and are associated with increased mortality (e.g. through suicide and associations with chronic diseases and their risk factors). Evidence suggests that early detection and treatment of psychiatric illness is essential to improving long-term outcomes and may even modify illness trajectories at a biological level. Unfortunately, a substantial proportion of patients undergo a long diagnostic odyssey before receiving an appropriate diagnosis and initiating effective treatment. Efforts to improve surveillance for emerging or occult psychopathology are often complex, costly, and have limited yield. Thus, there is an urgent public health need to improve clinical decision support for the early detection of psychiatric disorders in clinical settings. The growing availability of large-scale biobanks linking EHRs to biospecimens has created a powerful, but still relatively untapped, opportunity for psychiatric research. In 2007, the NHGRI organized the Electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) network which has brought together investigators around the U.S. to facilitate EHR-based genomic research and the implementation of genomic medicine. To date, however, EHR-based risk prediction and genomics have not been widely leveraged for psychiatric research. To address this gap, we have created a new, large-scale collaborative consortium—PsycheMERGE—which leverages the resources and existing infrastructure of the eMERGE network, the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium (PGC), and local EHR and biobank resources. In this proposal, we aim to: (1) phenotypically and genomically validate and harmonize case and control phenotypes across multiple disorders (2) build clinically-useful risk surveillance models for mood disorders that also leverage cross-institutional genomewide data, and (3) examine whether EHR- and genomic-based risk profiles are associated with clinically-relevant health outcomes. We will further use these risk profiles to examine disparities in diagnostic delay by age, sex and race/ethnicity. The resulting diagnostic and risk prediction algorithms will be made available to the scientific community through the eMERGE network. Successful completion of these aims would represent a major advance in demonstrating the utility of EHR resources for precision medicine approaches to psychiatry, provide the first step toward clinical decision support tools that can be implemented within health systems, and create an invaluable resource for the scientific community. Neuropsychiatric disorders are leading causes of disability and even mortality. We have created a collaborative consortium of health systems--PsycheMERGE—to enable clinical and genetic research that will improve the understanding and early detection of psychiatric disorders. We will use cutting-edge computational and genetic methods to examine the predictors of psychiatric illness and provide a key step toward the goals of “precision psychiatry”.",PsycheMERGE: Leveraging electronic health records and genomics for mental health research,9641499,R01MH118233,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Biological', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Childhood', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Communities', 'Comorbidity', 'Complex', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Eating Disorders', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Electronic Medical Records and Genomics Network', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Research', 'Genomic medicine', 'Genomics', 'Gilles de la Tourette syndrome', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health system', 'Heritability', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Insurance Coverage', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'National Human Genome Research Institute', 'Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychopathology', 'Public Health', 'Race', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Schizophrenia', 'Site', 'Suicide', 'Surveillance Modeling', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'biobank', 'case control', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical risk', 'clinically relevant', 'cost', 'data resource', 'delay sex', 'disability', 'disorder risk', 'effective therapy', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'genomic predictors', 'health care service utilization', 'high risk', 'improved', 'indexing', 'mortality', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'precision medicine', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'random forest', 'sex', 'support tools']",NIMH,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2019,855687,-0.0186554625396381
"Biobehavioral Studies of Cardiovascular Disease ABSTRACT Biobehavioral Studies of Cardiovascular Disease (PO1-HL040962) This Program Project (P01) continuation application focuses on the human brain substrates of behavioral and socio-environmental influences on cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk in midlife adults. Proposed are 3 Projects that are conceptually cross-linked and supported by 3 Core Units. Collaborative investigators represent multiple disciplines, including psychology, neuroscience, biophysics, medicine, psychoneuroimmunology, epidemiology, machine learning, bioinformatics, and statistics. Project 1 aims to elucidate functional and structural brain phenotypes that predict the multiyear progression of preclinical vascular disease and dysfunction, with a focus on neural circuitries for visceral control that coordinate autonomic, neuroendocrine, hemodynamic, and immune physiology with stress- and emotion-related behavioral processes. Project 2 aims to establish whether functional characteristics of these visceral control circuits moderate the influences of stress-related environmental exposures on the progression of preclinical vascular disease and dysfunction, tracking individuals' behavior and cardiovascular physiology in daily life to test a novel neuro-diathesis model of CVD risk. Project 2 also tests for the first time whether daily life physical activity associates with daily life stress physiology through its effects neural circuits for visceral control. Project 3 aims extend those of the other Projects by elucidating the neural and peripheral processes linking physical activity with physiological and psychophysiological markers of CVD risk (including daily life affect and stress physiology) using an experimental intervention methodology. These P01 aims are unique in cardiovascular behavioral medicine, and they will be pursued in the context of multi-component data collection efforts that satisfy all project-specific aims. As a result, the P01 will create new opportunities for integrative and translational science on the human neurobiology of CVD risk that cuts across multiple methods and levels of analysis. Helping to advance its parent field, the P01 will generate and disseminate original and expansive public-domain resources and tools to the broader scientific and clinical communities through comprehensive data and software sharing and educational objectives. Enabling a precise focus on early CVD etiology, the study cohorts comprise nearly 900 midlife adults without clinically apparent CVD, and study methods will include novel combinations of neuroimaging, ecological momentary assessments of experienced environments, ambulatory hemodynamic monitoring, autonomic, neuroendocrine, immune, and vascular assessments, laboratory clinical evaluations, hetero-method health behavior assessments, and arterial imaging. The 3 Core Units of this P01 provide for synergy and inter-project coordination by administrative, data management and participant accrual services; measurement and instrumentation support; and direction in cutting-edge bio-statistical and data-intensive (machine learning) analyses. The present application thus represents a thematic continuation and next- generation extension of translational neurobiological research on CVD by this P01, which was initiated in 1988. PROJECT NARRATIVE Biobehavioral Studies of Cardiovascular Disease (PO1-HL040962) This Program Project focuses on human brain substrates of behavioral and socio-environmental influences on cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk in midlife, with an emphasis on factors that moderate and mediate brain-to- risk relationships.

"Characterizing Trauma Outcomes: From Pre-trauma Risk to Post-trauma Sequelae Abstract Background: Trauma is common, but we have little ability to predict who will develop post-trauma psychopathology. Consistent challenges to our understanding of the etiology of post-trauma psychopathology include: (1) obtaining unbiased prospective data on risk factors preceding or concurrent with trauma; (2) the inability to model large comprehensive risk structures with traditional null hypothesis testing methods, despite the knowledge that risk factors do not operate in isolation; and (3) the almost universal focus on PTSD outcomes to date, while post-trauma psychopathology likely involves various symptoms spanning multiple disorder categories. The aims of this study are to (1) use data from a large, prospective population trauma cohort to establish multidimensional classes of post-trauma psychopathology which include diagnoses from various theoretically derived categories (e.g., stress diagnoses, mood disorders, personality disorders) and (2) to discover multivariate predictor sets and novel interactions which predict post- trauma psychopathology class membership and class transitions over time. Given the projected sample size we will also be able to examine gender differences in psychopathology and resilience, as well as differences by trauma type. Study Design: This study will make use of national prospective data previously assembled as part of an R21 project (and augmented with additional trauma data and more years of follow-up) to establish a trauma cohort from 1995 – 2015. Trauma cohort members will have experienced at least one of 10 traumatic events (i.e., fires/explosions, accidents and assaults, poisoning, life-threatening illness/injury, pregnancy-related trauma and sudden family deaths). Extensive pre- trauma and post-trauma data on psychiatric diagnoses, treatment (medication and psychotherapy) and social variables will be included. We will use latent class analyses to characterize multidimensional post-trauma psychopathology outcomes (including the absence of psychopathology) and latent transition analyses to examine changes in class membership over time. Machine learning statistical methods will be applied to the expansive risk factor data to develop multivariate predictor sets for outcome classes and class transitions over time. Bias analyses will be used to assess the impact of various forms of systematic error on our results. Implications: This study fulfills NIMH’s strategic priorities of (1) charting mental illness trajectories to determine when, where, and how to intervene and (2) strengthening the public health impact of NIMH-supported research. Our approach will achieve robust and valid risk profiles of post-trauma psychopathology in the most efficient way possible by using pre- existing prospective data from a full and unselected population. A life course multidimensional approach to trauma research is a critical next step in this field. In future work, psychopathology classes and multivariate predictor sets discovered as part of this study can be replicated and expanded in other populations to examine variations of our findings, and used as the basis for a more detailed exploration of newly discovered pathways to psychopathology risk and resilience following trauma. Narrative This large general population-based trauma cohort study will elucidate risk profiles for multidimensional psychopathology and resilience following trauma. Use of registry-based data from an unselected population and rigorous epidemiologic methods allows us to efficiently examine predictor combinations (e.g., psychiatric diagnoses, treatments, social variables), while minimizing bias.

"Novel computational techniques to detect the relationship between sitting patterns and metabolic syndrome in existing cohort studies. Abstract Metabolic syndrome is a cluster of conditions (increased blood pressure, high blood sugar, excess body fat around the waist, and abnormal cholesterol or triglyceride levels) that occur together, increasing risk of heart disease, stroke and diabetes. Epidemiological studies have shown that prolonged sitting is deleterious to metabolic indicators, even after adjusting for physical activity (PA). Acute laboratory trials have shown that breaking up sitting time can improve metabolic factors. Sitting is a prevalent behavior in all population groups by age, gender and ethnicity. Associations with metabolic syndrome factors, such as obesity, have also been shown in all population groups. Epidemiological studies have mostly depended on reported sitting time, especially TV reviewing. More recently large cohort studies have collected data from hip worn accelerometers and applied a cut point (e.g., 100 counts per minute) on single axis data to estimate sedentary time. Such devices have been included in numerous studies, principally because of their accuracy to measure PA intensity. Primarily used in intervention trials to reduce sitting, the thigh worn ActivPAL has been shown to more accurately assess posture and provide valid measures of sitting, standing, and sit-stand transitions. To date, very few health outcome cohort studies have included the ActivPAL. Compared to the ActivPAL and free living observations of sitting time, the 100 count cut point has been shown to underestimate prolonged sitting by substantially overestimating sit-stand transitions. New studies are showing that how we accumulate sitting time (i.e. in long or short bouts) is associated with metabolic health outcomes, and may be independent of total sitting time and PA. Study results on prolonged sitting and metabolic risk factors from accelerometer data are inconsistent and may be due to measurement error in the cut points employed. In a small sample of older women, adults, and youth we have demonstrated that novel machine learned methods can greatly improve estimates of prolonged sitting and transitions. Further development and testing of these methods would support valid applications to existing large cohort studies with raw accelerometer data to improve estimates of associations between sitting patterns and metabolic health. There are also many large cohorts (e.g. NHANES 2003/6), with quality health outcomes, but non raw accelerometer count data, so calibration methods to adjust non raw estimates of sitting time are also needed and would be attractive to researchers not yet familiar with the machine learning process. We proposed to employ 7 existing data sets (N=20,000) matched for age and spanning youth, adults and older adults. We will scale up our training and test the performance of the refined algorithms to detect sit-stand frequencies, prolonged sitting, usual bout duration and Alpha (a combination of duration & frequency). We will test performance of the algorithms against ActivPAL (ground truth) and in new samples assess predictive validity with objective health outcomes. We will test differences between the existing and new techniques using R2 and mean-squared error of prediction (via bootstrapping) and GEE techniques. Narrative There are many large studies with existing data that could be better used to understand health behaviors. We will focus on improving measurement of sitting patterns from body worn devices. We will see how sitting is related to obesity and other metabolic risk factors for chronic disease across different age groups.",Novel computational techniques to detect the relationship between sitting patterns and metabolic syndrome in existing cohort studies.,9778822,R01DK114945,"['Accelerometer', 'Acute', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'American Heart Association', 'Behavior', 'Blood Glucose', 'Blood Pressure', 'Body Patterning', 'Body fat', 'Calibration', 'Cholesterol', 'Chronic Disease', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cohort Studies', 'Computational Technique', 'Data', 'Data Quality', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Elderly', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Frequencies', 'Gender', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health behavior', 'Hip region structure', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Trial', 'Laboratories', 'Longitudinal cohort study', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic syndrome', 'Methods', 'National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Physical activity', 'Population Group', 'Posture', 'Process', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Stroke', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thigh structure', 'Time', 'Training', 'Triglycerides', 'Use of New Techniques', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Youth', 'age group', 'cohort', 'epidemiology study', 'heart disease risk', 'improved', 'indexing', 'novel', 'older women', 'performance tests', 'response', 'scale up', 'sedentary', 'young adult']",NIDDK,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2019,660041,-0.02695599303702724
"Risk Assessment of Influenza A Viruses Title: Risk Assessment of Influenza A Viruses Project Summary  Influenza A viruses (IAVs) have caused large losses of life around the world and continue to present a great public health challenge. Risk assessment of influenza viruses is a key component in pandemic influenza preparedness (PIP), and it can help optimize resources for influenza surveillance, vaccine development and other control measurements to help minimize losses due to an emerging influenza virus. Risk assessment of influenza viruses includes emergence risk and public health impact of novel influenza viruses. Emergence risk assesses the probability for a novel influenza virus to infect and easily spread among humans; it is the first risk to be evaluated in risk assessment.  Although a number of individual mutations or structural/functional motifs have been reported to be associated with influenza infection and transmission, their effects on emergence risk are difficult to predict a priori. Thus, conventional methods for assessment of the emergence risk of a novel IAV often require laboratory generation of reassortants and subsequent measurement of their infectivity, pathogenesis, and transmission, which is often done in a mammalian system. However, this strategy can lead to laboratory mutants with gain of function (i.e., mutants with new or enhanced activity on pathogenesis and/or transmissibility in mammals). Thus, an ideal system for influenza risk assessment should be able to quantify emergence risk for a novel IAV solely by using genomic sequences.  Avian influenza A viruses facilitated the emergence of all four known pandemic human influenza A viruses: the hemagglutinin genes of 1918, 1957, and 1968 pandemic viruses are all of avian origin, and the polymerase PB2 and PA genes of the 2009 pandemic virus are of avian origin. Risk assessment of potential reassortants from contemporary endemic human influenza viruses and enzootic avian influenza viruses has been a key component of the pandemic influenza preparedness process.  The objectives of this study are to develop and validate a machine learning method to assess the emergence risk for a novel IAV using genomic sequences. The study will focus on emergence risk from contemporary endemic human influenza viruses and enzootic avian influenza viruses. We expect to identify genetic features within and across gene segments and ascertain their synergistic effects as emergence risk determinants. We also expect to develop a computational model for estimating the probability of a possible reassortant to emerge, given the genomic sequences of one human influenza virus and one avian influenza virus. The study results should help with understanding the fundamental mechanisms for genetic reassortment and with assessing emergence risk of influenza virus; thus, the results should facilitate pandemic influenza preparedness. Project Narrative This project will develop a computational model for influenza risk assessment, and it will help with understanding the fundamental mechanisms for genetic reassortment and for assessing the emergence risk of influenza viruses, and thus the project will facilitate pandemic influenza preparedness.",Risk Assessment of Influenza A Viruses,9693661,R21AI135820,"['Affect', 'Animals', 'Avian Influenza A Virus', 'Base Sequence', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Birds', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Funding', 'Gene Combinations', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Materials', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Government', 'Hemagglutinin', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Influenza', 'Influenza A Virus, H1N1 Subtype', 'Influenza A Virus, H7N9 Subtype', 'Influenza A virus', 'Information Theory', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Luciferases', 'Machine Learning', 'Mammals', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mutation', 'Pathogenesis', 'Phenotype', 'Polymerase', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Readiness', 'Reassortant Viruses', 'Reporter', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Ribonucleoproteins', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Trees', 'Validation', 'Viral', 'Virus', 'Virus Replication', 'base', 'cost', 'enzootic', 'flu transmission', 'gain of function', 'genetic variant', 'in vivo', 'influenza surveillance', 'influenzavirus', 'learning strategy', 'multitask', 'mutant', 'novel', 'novel virus', 'pandemic disease', 'pandemic influenza', 'transmission process', 'vaccine development', 'virus genetics']",NIAID,MISSISSIPPI STATE UNIVERSITY,R21,2019,5173,0.0017368252743150642
"Brain substrates for cardiovascular stress physiology Project Summary/Abstract The candidate’s long-term goal is to become an independent investigator focused on the neurophysiological pathways that link psychological stress with cardiovascular disease (CVD). Individual differences in biological responses to acute psychological stress have been shown to predict risk for subclinical and clinical markers of CVD, indicating that variation in the stress response relates to measurable health outcomes. The proposed research and career development program will position the candidate to definitively address open and mechanistic questions on cardiovascular stress physiology with a multi-dimensional approach. The overall objective of the current project is to identify the ‘brain–cardiovascular’ pathways of metabolically excessive cardiovascular responses to stress. The central hypothesis is that metabolically excessive cardiovascular responses to stress are caused by increased brain activation in areas associated with cardiovascular and autonomic control. In extension, the candidate will test whether altering brain function via neuromodulation will regulate downstream cardiovascular responses. Proposed are two independent studies. In Aim 1, we will newly examine the relationship between metabolically excessive cardiovascular and neural responses using a cross-sectional approach. In Aim 2, we will measure stressor-evoked metabolic and cardiovascular responses before and after neuromodulation in an experimental approach. Participants will engage in a novel, non-invasive neuromodulation technique, transcranial infrared laser stimulation (TILS), known to alter the brain by increasing oxygenation, and will be compared to an established control. This research plan will help the candidate develop essential skills for career development including cardiovascular and metabolic testing, machine learning and cross-validation methods for functional magnetic resonance imaging analyses, and utilizing a neuromodulation technique, TILS. The proposed Mentored Research Scientist Development Award will provide 5 years of training through a combination of research, classroom experiences, and mentoring to further the candidate in preparation for scientific independence. Specifically, the candidate will gain expertise in measuring metabolic activity, advance her computational neuroimaging analysis skills, become proficient in experimentally manipulating brain function, and develop necessary statistical skills. The project brings together a mentoring team of experts in their respective areas to provide the candidate with the necessary skills to continue on the trajectory to make a transformative contribution to the field of Cardiovascular Behavioral Medicine. This project will provide vital information regarding the pathways between psychological stress and CVD risk while at the same time providing training and mentoring for the candidate’s further career. PROJECT NARRATIVE Exaggerated physiological responses to psychological stress are commonly regarded as contributing to cardiovascular disease (CVD), nonetheless, we lack an understanding of the mechanisms by which psychological responses to threat are translated into cardiovascular responses that are excessive to the immediate physiological needs of the individual. The project will use both cross-sectional and experimental approaches to examine how the brain and cardiovascular system interact during psychological stress and will provide a a more comprehensive understanding of the role the brain plays in metabolically-excessive responses to stress. This research is relevant to public health because it is a crucial step in understanding how psychological stress relates to a risk factor for CVD and is necessary to develop appropriate brain- based approaches to CVD risk prevention and stratification.",Brain substrates for cardiovascular stress physiology,9821766,K01HL145021,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Area', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Base of the Brain', 'Behavioral Medicine', 'Biological', 'Blood Vessels', 'Brain', 'Brain Stem', 'Brain region', 'Calibration', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular Physiology', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Clinical Markers', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Energy Metabolism', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Insula of Reil', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lasers', 'Limbic System', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurable', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Mentored Research Scientist Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Pathway', 'Metabolic stress', 'Methods', 'Nature', 'Neuraxis', 'Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'Outcome', 'Oxygen Consumption', 'Participant', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Peripheral', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Preparation', 'Prevention', 'Professional Competence', 'Program Development', 'Psychological Stress', 'Public Health', 'Reaction', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk stratification', 'Role', 'Source', 'Stratification', 'Stress', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'biological adaptation to stress', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'career', 'career development', 'experience', 'neuroimaging', 'neurophysiology', 'neuroregulation', 'novel', 'pre-clinical', 'psychologic', 'relating to nervous system', 'research and development', 'response', 'skills', 'stressor', 'time use']",NHLBI,BAYLOR UNIVERSITY,K01,2019,152227,0.002813648280395946
"Magnetic Resonance Imaging Based Calf Muscle Perfusion To Assess Patients With Symptomatic Peripheral Artery Disease Abstract: Peripheral artery disease (PAD) is associated with impaired leg function, possible limb loss and an increased risk of cardiovascular events. Intermittent claudication (IC) is a classic PAD symptom occurring in 40% of symptomatic patients, and is associated with 5-, and 15-year mortality rates of 30% and 70%, respectively. PAD is a debilitating illness affecting more than 8.5 million Americans of age 40 and older and 202 million people globally. Despite the high prevalence, PAD patients are less likely to receive appropriate treatment for their atherosclerotic risk factors than patients with coronary artery disease. Advances in endovascular therapy have reduced risks associated with intervention, enabling revascularization as a routine procedure in patients with lower extremity ischemia. However, revascularization success rates vary substantially and numerous PAD patients do not improve at 1-year despite technically good revascularization. Previous findings suggest that alterations in the microcirculation due to a paucity of collateralization may contribute to functional impairment in PAD patients. We hypothesize that the change in microvascular perfusion can identify PAD patients who do not improve at 12-months after revascularization. We will utilize contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (CE-MRI) to assess skeletal muscle perfusion in PAD patients. The CE-MRI measures will be associated with hemodynamics and symptoms. The early identification of individuals with a likely poor prognosis post intervention could help to improve surgical treatment strategies. We will investigate the association of microvascular perfusion (Aim 1) and measures of arterial hemodynamics (Aim 2) with leg function and PAD symptoms. We will utilize machine learning methodologies to identify predictors of poor leg function and symptoms (Aim 3). Given the high incidence of PAD and the associated high risk of cardiovascular events, it is paramount to identify individuals who are less likely to improve following lower extremity revascularization. The data of this clinical imaging study will provide novel information on the etiology of microvascular blood flow in PAD. Relevance: The proposed research study is of considerable public health importance given that patients with peripheral artery disease (PAD) have an increased risk of atherothrombotic cardiovascular events and mortality. The development of improved non-invasive imaging techniques to assess PAD may enable optimized treatment for individuals who are at an increased risk of future cardiovascular events.",Magnetic Resonance Imaging Based Calf Muscle Perfusion To Assess Patients With Symptomatic Peripheral Artery Disease,9988737,R01HL137763,"['Affect', 'Age', 'American', 'Ankle', 'Arteries', 'Blood Vessels', 'Blood flow', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical assessments', 'Comorbidity', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Data', 'Data Reporting', 'Development', 'Disease Outcome', 'Early identification', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Exercise', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'High Prevalence', 'Hospitals', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Impairment', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Intermittent Claudication', 'Intervention', 'Ischemia', 'Leg', 'Legal patent', 'Limb structure', 'Literature', 'Lower Extremity', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical center', 'Methodist Church', 'Methodology', 'Microcirculation', 'Muscle', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Oxygen', 'Partial Pressure', 'Participant', 'Patient imaging', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perfusion', 'Peripheral arterial disease', 'Phase', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Pilot Projects', 'Procedures', 'Public Health', 'Recovery', 'Reference Values', 'Resolution', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Signal Transduction', 'Skeletal Muscle', 'Standardization', 'Superficial Femoral Artery', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Toes', 'Treadmill Tests', 'Ultrasonography', 'Validation', 'Veterans', 'Walking', 'atherosclerosis risk', 'base', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'contrast enhanced', 'contrast imaging', 'functional disability', 'hemodynamics', 'high risk', 'imaging modality', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'mortality', 'non-invasive imaging', 'novel', 'off-patent', 'outcome forecast', 'post intervention', 'recruit', 'regional difference', 'research study', 'skeletal', 'success', 'successful intervention', 'symptomatic improvement', 'treadmill', 'treatment optimization', 'treatment strategy', 'two-dimensional']",NHLBI,PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIV HERSHEY MED CTR,R01,2019,544562,-0.0014615503808355357
"Obesity Prevention in Early Life (OPEL): Risk Screening and Targeted Intervention Given the difficulty of reversing obesity once present, there has been increasing focus on the primary prevention of obesity early in the lifecourse. Few attempts have been made to prevent obesity during the first years of life. This proposal summarizes a 5-year program of mentored professional development tied to a multi-method research project intended to improve the identification and potential treatment of infants and toddlers with high risk for obesity. My long-term goal is to prevent obesity by identifying infants at greatest risk and providing for them an effective, family-centered intervention that targets modifiable, life course factors. My central hypothesis, based on my prior research, is that identifying infants at risk for obesity prior to the onset of unhealthy weight gain will enable early intervention. My research plan aims to: (1) create risk prediction models for obesity at age 24 months by linking three existing data systems that combine birth certificate, contextual- level, and health outcome data; (2) test the feasibility of linking these data prospectively to validate the Aim 1 obesity risk prediction models over a 24-month period within a contemporary, clinical cohort; and (3) identify best approaches for family-focused risk communication regarding the prevention of excessive weight gain and obesity in infants and toddlers using a human-centered design approach. Through my career development plan and guidance from my mentors, I will expand upon a foundation in epidemiology and pediatric health services research to develop expertise in machine learning, health informatics, data integration, qualitative methods, human-centered design, and behavior change. Together, the research and educational aims of this proposal will provide me with the necessary groundwork to compete for additional funding as an independent investigator. Specifically, I will seek R03-level grant funding from the NIDDK in year 4 of my K01 award to test the communication strategy developed in Aim 3 and to partner with families to modify an existing behavioral change intervention for use in infancy. By the end of this award, I will be well positioned to apply for funding from the NIDDK to conduct a robust R01-level study that combines the validated prediction models, family- focused communication strategy, and modified intervention to determine whether we can effectively prevent obesity in those infants and toddlers identified as being at the highest risk. This line of research will help ensure that prevention efforts are deployed in an efficient, cost-effective manner and accepted by those who need them. I will accomplish this work under the mentorship of Dr. Aaron E. Carroll, a child health services researcher, and a multidisciplinary team of faculty with expertise machine learning, health informatics, data integration and surveillance, qualitative research, human-centered design approaches, behavior change, and childhood obesity. I am ideally suited to complete this research due to my past research productivity, current mentorship team, open access to health care data, and the established clinical decision support infrastructure at the Indiana University School of Medicine. ! Project Narrative Increasing evidence suggests that the infancy and toddler periods represent the best opportunity for obesity prevention, but few attempts have been made to prevent obesity during the first years of life. The current proposal seeks to develop practical methods to assess the risk of future obesity in infants and toddlers in the clinical setting, and to partner with families to explore new ways to communicate early life obesity risk in ways that account for their perceptions, concerns and beliefs. This proposal has the promise to lead to targeted, tailored interventions for infants most at-risk for obesity, ensuring that prevention efforts are deployed in an efficient, cost-effective manner and accepted by those who need them.",Obesity Prevention in Early Life (OPEL): Risk Screening and Targeted Intervention,9701190,K01DK114383,"['Address', 'Age', 'Age-Months', 'Award', 'Behavioral', 'Belief', 'Birth Certificates', 'Child', 'Child Health Services', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Epidemiology', 'Faculty', 'Family', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Geographic Information Systems', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health Services Research', 'Health Status', 'Human', 'Indiana', 'Infant', 'Information Systems', 'Infrastructure', 'Intervention', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mentored Research Scientist Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Child Health and Human Development', 'National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases', 'Obesity', 'Obesity Epidemic', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Perception', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Pregnancy Histories', 'Prevention', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Primary Prevention', 'Process', 'Productivity', 'Public Health Informatics', 'Publishing', 'Qualitative Methods', 'Qualitative Research', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Source', 'Testing', 'Toddler', 'Universities', 'Weight', 'Weight Gain', 'Work', 'approach behavior', 'base', 'behavior change', 'career development', 'clinical decision support', 'cohort', 'cost effective', 'data access', 'data integration', 'data warehouse', 'design', 'epidemiologic data', 'health care availability', 'health data', 'healthy weight', 'high risk', 'improved', 'infancy', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'medical schools', 'multidisciplinary', 'obesity in children', 'obesity prevention', 'obesity risk', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'programs', 'prospective', 'risk prediction model', 'screening', 'sociodemographics', 'tool']",NIDDK,INDIANA UNIV-PURDUE UNIV AT INDIANAPOLIS,K01,2019,139614,0.020271168376573185
"Epidemiology and clinical outcomes of diabetic macular edema Approximately 25% of the millions of veterans (est. 8.92 million FY 2013) enrolled for care in Veterans Health Administration (VHA) have diabetes mellitus, and diabetic macular edema (DME) is the leading cause of vision loss in the adult diabetic population world-wide. Although diabetic retinopathy has been well-studied, comparatively little is known about the burden of DME. In fact, only two national prevalence studies and no national study on the incidence of DME in persons with type 2 diabetes have been conducted. Similarly many risk factors have been characterized for DR, but no large studies have established predictors for DME.  Beyond the Medicare claims database, the VHA National Patient Care Database (NPCD) contains standardized administrative data for several aspects of patient care including diagnoses, procedures, medications, lab test results, vital signs, clinical text notes, and mortality. Because the VA uses teleretinal screening as routine clinical care for all patients with diabetes with these results included in the NPCD, the NPCD is an ideal source for studying the epidemiology of and risk factors for DME.  This study proposes to determine the burden of diabetic macular edema, establish risk factors, and examine treatment outcomes in a previously extracted dataset on 1.98 million veterans who have undergone diabetic retinopathy screening at least once since 2004. Currently invaluable ophthalmic data are encoded in unstructured clinical encounter notes in the Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS), and no validated automated extraction method exists to capture these data elements. An automated extraction method using natural language processing will be created and validated to unlock key ophthalmic variables. These text extraction methods will be applicable to extracting ophthalmology data from not only notes of patients with DME but also any ophthalmology clinical note. This will enable future large scale studies in ophthalmology using NPCD and be immediately valuable to the research community at large.  The candidate, Dr. Aaron Lee, MD MSCI, is an ophthalmologist with subspecialty training in retina surgery with a strong background in computer science and epidemiology. His career goal is to become an independent clinician scientist studying diabetic eye disease with large-scale electronic medical record extracted data. While he possesses the foundational skills, he seeks to gain training in advanced statistics and natural language processing to unlock the data captured in unstructured clinical encounter notes. He has assembled an outstanding mentorship team under the primary mentor, Dr. Edward Boyko, MD MPH. This mentorship team includes renowned experts in clinical epidemiology, health informatics, ophthalmology, and natural language processing. This K23 will provide Dr. Lee the structured coursework, mentorship, and applied learning needed to acquire new research skills. He will leverage key local resources to carry out the proposed research at the University of Washington and the VA Seattle Epidemiologic Research and Information Center. Despite the significant visual loss associated with diabetic macular edema, little is known about the frequency of its occurrence, its risk factors, and the real-world effectiveness of existing treatments. The purpose of this proposed research is to utilize the VA National Patient Care Database to extract relevant data elements to examine these three clinical questions: 1) what is the incidence and prevalence of diabetic macular edema, 2) what are the risk factors associated with its development, and 3) what is the comparative real-world effectiveness of its treatments, including intravitreal anti-VEGF therapy, intravitreal corticosteroid therapy and macular laser. The methods developed in this research proposal will not only further our understanding of DME but also generalize and enable future large-scale ophthalmic studies.",Epidemiology and clinical outcomes of diabetic macular edema,9756410,K23EY029246,"['Adopted', 'Adrenal Cortex Hormones', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Anemia', 'Blindness', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Caring', 'Cataract Extraction', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Computerized Patient Records', 'Data', 'Data Element', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diabetic Retinopathy', 'Diagnosis', 'Dyslipidemias', 'Effectiveness', 'Enrollment', 'Epidemiology', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Exclusion Criteria', 'Expressed Sequence Tags', 'Eye', 'Eye diseases', 'Foundational Skills', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Handedness', 'Hypertension', 'Incidence', 'Information Centers', 'Injections', 'Intervention', 'Lasers', 'Lead', 'Light Coagulation', 'Manuals', 'Masks', 'Measures', 'Medicare claim', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Ophthalmologist', 'Ophthalmology', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Prevalence', 'Prevalence Study', 'Procedures', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health Informatics', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Regimen', 'Research', 'Research Proposals', 'Resources', 'Retina', 'Retinal', 'Risk Factors', 'Scientist', 'Severities', 'Sleep Apnea Syndromes', 'Smoking Status', 'Source', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'System', 'Test Result', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Treatment outcome', 'Universities', 'Use Effectiveness', 'Validation', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factors', 'Veterans', 'Visual', 'Visual Acuity', 'Washington', 'bevacizumab', 'career', 'clinical care', 'clinical epidemiology', 'cohort', 'comparative', 'computer science', 'diabetes management', 'diabetic', 'epidemiology study', 'hands-on learning', 'health administration', 'intravitreal injection', 'kidney dysfunction', 'laser photocoagulation', 'macula', 'macular edema', 'mortality', 'proliferative diabetic retinopathy', 'screening', 'skills', 'statistics', 'therapy outcome', 'traditional therapy', 'treatment optimization']",NEI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,K23,2019,233078,-0.008777366283109352
"Dynamic, real-time prediction of alcohol use lapse using mHealth technologies ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Available psychosocial and pharmacological treatments for alcohol use disorder are effective at establishing abstinence. However, the vast majority of patients relapse within a year and often within the first few months following treatment. Patients often fail to detect dynamic changes in their relapse risk. Furthermore, the majority of patients fail to adequately sustain use of skills developed during treatment and/or through continuing care. Well-established theoretical models indicate that alcohol and other drug use lapse risk is a dynamic, non-linear function of both distal, relatively static, patient characteristics and often moment-by- moment dynamic changes in proximal, precipitating risk factors. However, comprehensive, precise assessment of dynamic risk indicators in real-time has not been possible until very recently. Furthermore, innovative methods from predictive analytics have not been applied to the lapse risk prediction problem. The broad goals of this project are to develop, validate, preliminarily optimize, and deliver a dynamic, real-time lapse risk prediction model for forecasting alcohol use among abstinent alcoholics. To pursue these goals, we propose to follow 200 patients for three months during or following completion of standard of care treatment for alcohol use disorder. We will measure well-established distal, static relapse risk indicators on study intake. More importantly, we will use innovative mHealth technology to densely sample dynamic risk indicators including patient physiology, subjective experience, and behavior daily for three months using smartphones and wearable biometric sensors. Data obtained for these static and dynamic risk indicators will provide the foundation to accomplish the following Specific Aims: 1. Assess burden (feasibility, cost, and patient acceptability) to collect innovative, densely sampled risk indicators via smartphone and wearable sensors. 2. Use machine learning methods to develop, train, and validate a real-time quantitative lapse risk prediction signal based on static and dynamic risk indicators. 3. Use innovative Markov decision process models to optimize decisions about if, when, and how to provide additional treatment or support. 4. Integrate and deliver risk prediction and decision model within the Comprehensive Health Enhancement Support System for Addiction (A-CHESS) program. These project aims position A-CHESS to make relapse prevention and recovery support, information, and risk monitoring available to patients continuously. Compared to conventional continuing care, A-CHESS will provide personalized care and be available and implemented during moments of greatest need. Integrated real-time risk prediction holds substantial promise to encourage sustained recovery through adaptive use of these continuing care services. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goals of this project are to develop and deliver a dynamic, real-time model for forecasting alcohol use lapse among abstinent alcoholics. This lapse risk prediction model will be integrated into an existing validated mHealth platform to encourage sustained recovery through adaptive use of continuing care services.","Dynamic, real-time prediction of alcohol use lapse using mHealth technologies",9709183,R01AA024391,"['Abstinence', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Behavior', 'Biometry', 'Caring', 'Cellular Phone', 'Characteristics', 'Communities', 'Comorbidity', 'Competence', 'Data', 'Decision Modeling', 'Dependence', 'Distal', 'Drug Use Disorder', 'Drug usage', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Galvanic Skin Response', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Services', 'Heart Rate', 'Intake', 'Intervention', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Mobile Health Application', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motivation', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmacological Treatment', 'Physiology', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predictive Analytics', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Psychopathology', 'Recovery', 'Relapse', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Services', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sleep', 'Support System', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Theoretical model', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'United States Department of Veterans Affairs', 'Validation', 'Voice', 'Withdrawal', 'addiction', 'alcohol abuse therapy', 'alcohol and other drug', 'alcohol involvement', 'alcohol use disorder', 'base', 'care systems', 'clinical application', 'coping', 'cost', 'craving', 'disorder later incidence prevention', 'experience', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'mHealth', 'model development', 'optimal treatments', 'personalized care', 'prevent', 'problem drinker', 'programs', 'psychosocial', 'public health relevance', 'real time model', 'relapse patients', 'relapse risk', 'relative cost', 'response', 'risk prediction model', 'sensor', 'skills', 'standard of care', 'stressor', 'wearable device']",NIAAA,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R01,2019,381816,-0.035999116974761894
"Developing a Pediatric Readmission (PERE) Risk Prediction Tool for Decision Support During Pre-Discharge Planning Project Summary/Abstract Pediatric Potentially Preventable Readmissions (“PPRs”) take a toll on the quality of life of young patients and their families and also place extra strain on health care systems that care for children. Accurate readmission risk prediction algorithms can aid clinicians in identifying patients most at risk for PPRs and thereby facilitate improved identification of patients most in need of more intensive discharge planning. Such focused risk assessments help with allocation of staffing and resources. Unfortunately, existing PPR risk predictions rarely explicitly consider pediatric patients and are not highly accurate. With recent advances in machine learning and deep learning, assessment of a large range of risk factors for pediatric PPRs is possible. To that end, our primary objective is to develop a suite of Pediatric Readmission (“PERE”) risk prediction algorithms to predict risk of a PPR within three (3), seven (7), and thirty (30) days of discharge from a child’s current inpatient stay. We will do this by leveraging recent advances in statistical data science algorithms. We will also develop PERE predictions such that they can be used to assess risk for PPRs prior to and during the discharge planning phases of a patient’s current inpatient stay. In environments of limited staffing and resources, the PERE risk prediction suite will support clinicians with a means of identifying patients most at risk for PPRs who may be candidates for increased discharge planning related care. Relevance We will focus our PERE risk prediction efforts on an AHRQ priority population: Children. Children represent a vulnerable population due to their developing physiology, limited communication abilities, and reliance on a caregiver to appropriately understand instructions and administer care after discharge.1,2 Early identification of risk for PPRs in three (3), seven (7), and thirty (30) days in this vulnerable population will alert hospital nurses and care managers of the increased risk a particular patient may face that can be more fully attended to during discharge planning. By using deep-learning and other emerging machine learning methods to optimize risk prediction, this proposal also supports AHRQ’s mission to harness data and technology to improve health care quality and patient outcomes and to facilitate improved measurement, monitoring, and surveillance of patient risk. This technology will be implemented using data from a very large pediatric patient care database to develop and validate PERE risk predictions. Project Narrative Pediatric discharge planning benefits from understanding which patients are most at risk for Potentially Preventable Readmissions (“PPRs”). This study will use the Children's Hospital Association's Pediatric Health Information System and machine learning to produce a Pediatric Readmission (“PERE”) suite of risk prediction tools appropriate for use at the outset and during discharge planning across a range of hospital IT support infrastructures.",Developing a Pediatric Readmission (PERE) Risk Prediction Tool for Decision Support During Pre-Discharge Planning,9808871,R03HS027024,[' '],AHRQ,VARIETY CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,R03,2019,51077,0.01648975065332002
"Reducing Non-Medical Opioid Use: An automatically adaptive mHealth Intervention ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In recent years in the U.S., problems associated with opioid prescriptions, including non-medical use and overdose, increased to historically unprecedented levels and represent a public health crisis. Emergency departments (EDs) play an important role in opioid prescribing, particularly to individuals at high risk for adverse opioi-related outcomes. Half of all ED visits are for a painful condition, and one third of all ED visits result in an opioid being prescribed. Moreover, in our pilot work, a quarter of patients surveyed at the ED study site reported non-medical opioid use in the prior three months. Despite the importance of this problem, strategies to reduce non-medical opioid use after an ED visit have not been well-studied. Our recent trial of a motivational intervention delivered to patients in the ED by a therapist resulted in modest reductions in non- medical use after the ED visit compared to a control condition. However, the intervention was unable to address the implications of opioids prescribed as a result of the ED encounter on post-ED opioid use behavior. This project will adapt the intervention for delivery after the ED visit through mobile technology in order to directly address the use of ED-provided opioids. Patients (n=600) will be recruited during an ED visit for a randomized controlled trial of the adapted intervention based on having used opioids non-medically in the prior three months and being given an opioid by an ED prescriber. In the intervention condition, interactive voice response calls will repeatedly assess non-medical opioid use and pain level and deliver intervention content. The intervention will include several potential actions that vary in intensity: assessment only, a brief message, extended messaging, or connection to a therapist by phone. Because the most helpful intensity of intervention is unknown and likely to vary between patients, the project will use an artificial intelligence stratey called reinforcement learning (RL). The RL system will continuously ""learn"" from the success of prior actions in similar situations with similar patients in order to select the action most likelyto reduce non-medical opioid use for each participant during each call. The RCT will be complemented by qualitative interviews to inform later implementation. The specific aims are to: (1) Adapt and enhance an existing motivational intervention to decrease non-medical opioid use after an ED visit by optimizing intervention intensity and duration through RL; (2) Examine the impact of the intervention on non-medical opioid use level during the six months post-ED visit; (3) Examine the impact of the intervention on driving after opioid use, overdose risk behaviors, and subsequent opioid-related ED visits. Secondary Aims are: (1) to examine differences in intervention effects between participants with high and low baseline levels of non-medical opioid use; and (2) to understand barriers and facilitators of implementation. This project will use a highly innovative strategy, artificial intelligence, to address a highly significant problem, non-medical opioid use. Ultimately, this study can lead to reductions in opioid- related harms and move forward the field of mobile health. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Non-medical use of opioid pain medications has increased substantially over the last decade, and ensuring the safe use of opioids prescribed as part of medical care has become a critical public health priority. Emergency Departments (EDs) are on the front lines of this emerging public health problem. This randomized controlled trial will test the impact of a mobile health intervention, which incorporates an innovative artificial intelligenc component to determine intervention duration and intensity, on non-medical opioid use and related harms for adult ED patients treated with opioids and who have a history of non-medical opioid use.",Reducing Non-Medical Opioid Use: An automatically adaptive mHealth Intervention,9416993,R01DA039159,"['Abnormal coordination', 'Accident and Emergency department', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Automobile Driving', 'Behavior', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Complement', 'Emergency Care', 'Emergency Department patient', 'Emergency department visit', 'Ensure', 'Future', 'Guidelines', 'Health Technology', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Medical', 'Methodology', 'Monitor', 'Opioid', 'Opioid Analgesics', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Overdose', 'Pain', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Play', 'Process', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Psychotherapy', 'Public Health', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Resources', 'Risk Behaviors', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Severities', 'Site', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Voice', 'Work', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'behavioral outcome', 'brief motivational intervention', 'clinical practice', 'drugged driving', 'experience', 'high risk', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'innovation', 'intervention effect', 'learning progression', 'mHealth', 'mobile computing', 'motivational intervention', 'multidisciplinary', 'new technology', 'nonmedical use', 'opioid misuse', 'opioid therapy', 'opioid use', 'overdose risk', 'post intervention', 'prescription opioid', 'public health priorities', 'public health relevance', 'recruit', 'response', 'screening', 'skills', 'success', 'treatment as usual']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2019,537201,-0.009160542172244797
"Devaluing Energy-Dense Foods for Cancer Control: Translational Neuroscience 7. Abstract Obesity and intake of certain foods increases cancer risk, but the most common treatment (behavioral weight loss programs) rarely produces lasting weight loss and eating behavior change, apparently because caloric restriction increases the reward value of food and prompts energy-sparing adaptations. Interventions that reduce the implicit valuation of cancer-risk foods (e.g., red meats, refined sugar) may be more effective. Emerging data suggest that behavioral response training and cognitive reappraisal training reduce valuation of such foods, which leads to decrease intake of these foods and weight loss. Internalized incentive value is reflected in a ventromedial prefrontal/orbitofrontal cortex valuation system (“vmPFC”), which encodes the implicit reward value of food and is central to a reinforcement cycle that perpetuates unhealthy eating. Thus, the vmPFC valuation system is a promising target for intervention because changes to the system might disrupt the unhealthy reinforcement cycle. Interestingly, various interventions influence the vmPFC through distinct pathways. Behavioral training alters motor input to valuation regions, whereas cognitive training relies on lateral prefrontal “top-down” regions. The proposed translational neuroscience experiment will compare the efficacy with which two novel treatments cause lasting change in food valuation, and whether a composite of theory-based baseline individual differences in relevant processes (such as response tendencies and cognitive styles) moderate treatment effects. We will randomize 300 overweight/obese adults who are at risk for eating- and obesity-related cancers to behavioral response training toward healthy foods and away from cancer-risk foods, a cognitive reappraisal intervention focused on cancer-risk foods, or non–food inhibitory control training. Aim 1 compares the efficacy and mechanisms of action of these two interventions to reduce valuation of cancer-risk foods relative to the active control condition, using neural, behavioral, self-report, and physiological measures of the process and outcomes. Aim 2 is to establish the temporal pattern and durability of the effects across time ; food intake and habits , body fat, BMI, and waist-to-hip ratio will be measured pre, post, and at 3-, 6-, and 12-month follow-up. Aim 3 uses machine learning to build and validate a low-cost, easy-to-administer composite that predicts whether and for how long an individual is likely to respond to intervention, and to which treatment. We hypothesize that self-report measures specifically related to valuation (e.g., willingness-to-pay) and to intervention-specific pathways to valuation (e.g., behavioral response tendencies, cognitive style) will predict differential response. Discovering these individual differences will provide a practical, low-cost tool to help interventionists “match” a given person to an effective treatment for that person . This project is very innovative because no study has directly compared the distinct and common effects of these treatments on valuation, used brain imaging to study the mechanism of effects, tested whether these interventions produce a lasting change in food valuation and body fat, or built and validated a composite that moderates response . 8. Project Narrative Excessive eating of energy-dense and obesity are risk factors for a range of cancers. There are programs to reduce intake of these foods and weight loss, but the effects of the programs rarely last. This project tests whether altering the value of cancer-risk foods can create lasting change, and uses neuroimaging to compare the efficacy of two programs to engage the valuation system on a neural level. Results will establish the pathways through which the programs work and suggest specific treatments for individuals based on a personalized profile.",Devaluing Energy-Dense Foods for Cancer Control: Translational Neuroscience,9751223,R01CA211224,"['Adopted', 'Adult', 'Behavioral', 'Body Weight decreased', 'Body fat', 'Body mass index', 'Brain imaging', 'Caloric Restriction', 'Calories', 'Cancer Control', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive Therapy', 'Data', 'Dietary intake', 'Eating', 'Eating Behavior', 'Food', 'Food Habits', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Health Food', 'High-Risk Cancer', 'Incentives', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Informal Social Control', 'Intake', 'Intervention', 'Lateral', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Meat', 'Mediating', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Neurobiology', 'Obesity', 'Obesity associated cancer', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Overweight', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Physiological', 'Process', 'Process Measure', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Randomized', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Route', 'Stimulus', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Waist-Hip Ratio', 'Work', 'active control', 'adult obesity', 'arm', 'base', 'behavior change', 'behavioral economics', 'behavioral response', 'cancer risk', 'cognitive reappraisal', 'cognitive training', 'common treatment', 'comparative efficacy', 'cost', 'cost efficient', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'experimental arm', 'experimental study', 'follow-up', 'food consumption', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'intervention effect', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'obesity risk', 'personalized medicine', 'programs', 'recruit', 'reduced food intake', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sugar', 'theories', 'tool', 'translational neuroscience', 'treatment arm', 'treatment effect', 'weight loss program', 'willingness to pay']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF OREGON,R01,2019,571889,0.005006145873287825
"LEVERAGING PREDICTIVE ANALYTICS WITHIN SOCIAL NETWORKS TO MAXIMIZE DRUG ANDALCOHOL TREATMENT EFFICACY AND RELAPSE PREVENTION PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Sober Grid™ has developed a smartphone-based mobile application currently in use by over 120,000 individuals worldwide who are in, or seeking, recovery from drug and alcohol addiction. The “Grid”, as it is known, is a mobile-based, social recovery community providing rapid context- specific peer support, efficient help seeking, motivational enhancement exercises, and member ratings of support content – all aimed to prevent relapse. The overarching goal of this phase II project is to extend the current capabilities of the Sober Grid app to achieve a comprehensive social recovery support app featuring intelligent, context appropriate resource matching and 24/7 rapid response peer-coaching that is effective in reducing disordered substance use and is cost effective. We hypothesize that providing this functionality to high-risk members will be acceptable, feasible, increase access to and engagement with resources, and have a positive effect in increasing time to relapse and days of consecutive abstinence. The company’s priority commercial goal is to leverage the insights gained from its large database of information and behaviors recorded in its existing addiction recovery-focused social network, combined with its recently completed SBIR phase I work, to identify users at risk for relapse and deliver tailored lay and professional peer support, telehealth, and provider interventions prompted by near real-time automated risk indicators built into an Enhanced Sober Grid (ESG) solution. The specific goals of this proposed phase II project include: (1) implementing the relapse risk scoring algorithm successfully developed in phase I in a production environment, (2) developing a ML resource relevancy matching algorithm, and (3) using this system to pilot test the feasibility and acceptability as well as to estimate the effect on abstinence of providing peer-coaching and resource information to a national sample of Sober Grid members in recovery from non- alcohol/nicotine substances who are predicted to be at high risk for relapse. We will accomplish our objectives by: (Aim 1) Implementing an accurate, near real-time production risk prediction system; (Aim 2) Developing an enhanced, in-app substance-addiction recovery resource locator; and, (Aim 3) Determining the feasibility, acceptability and estimating the effect size of the proposed ESG among high relapse-risk participants in recovery from opioid, stimulant, or cannabis use. The expected impact of this project is to substantially enhance Sober Grid's ability to deliver effective and timely interventions to the right individuals, at the right time – including those high-need and underserved populations that would otherwise lack access to care and draw considerable resources from the healthcare system. This capability holds the promise to reduce drug and alcohol relapse and the associated negative health impacts at both an individual and societal level while reducing the total cost of providing treatment services. PROJECT NARRATIVE Sober Grid is combining near real-time risk prediction with automated phone-app messaging, peer-coaching, and resource visibility and transparency in order to dramatically improve support for recovery from substance abuse. The strategy is to provide continuously available responsive connection and support with simple and familiar ways to search, filter, sort, identify, and review/rate resource options in order to lower overall relapse rates within the population, enabling Sober Grid users to achieve improved health outcomes and institutional payers to reduce the total cost of achieving those outcomes. Over time, the innovations resulting from this project will significantly reduce costs for individuals, public and private payers, the healthcare system, and society at large.",LEVERAGING PREDICTIVE ANALYTICS WITHIN SOCIAL NETWORKS TO MAXIMIZE DRUG ANDALCOHOL TREATMENT EFFICACY AND RELAPSE PREVENTION,9681118,R44DA044062,"['Abstinence', 'Aftercare', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohol dependence', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Algorithms', 'Android', 'Back', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Cannabis', 'Caring', 'Cellular Phone', 'Characteristics', 'Client', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Cost Control', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Diagnostic', 'Drug Addiction', 'Drug usage', 'Enhancement Technology', 'Environment', 'Exercise', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Group Meetings', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Individual', 'Insurance', 'Intelligence', 'Intervention', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motivation', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nicotine', 'Opiate Addiction', 'Opioid', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Personality Traits', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Predictive Analytics', 'Privatization', 'Process', 'Production', 'Provider', 'Published Comment', 'Randomized', 'Recovery', 'Relapse', 'Reporting', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Services', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Social Network', 'Social support', 'Societies', 'Stream', 'Substance Addiction', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Support Groups', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Technology', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Underserved Population', 'Work', 'Writing', 'addiction', 'alcohol relapse', 'base', 'cloud based', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'design', 'disorder later incidence prevention', 'drug relapse', 'effective therapy', 'help-seeking behavior', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'machine learning algorithm', 'marijuana use', 'medication-assisted treatment', 'member', 'mobile application', 'mobile computing', 'new technology', 'opioid use', 'peer', 'peer coaching', 'peer support', 'phase 2 study', 'prediction algorithm', 'preference', 'prevent', 'provider intervention', 'relapse risk', 'response', 'satisfaction', 'sobriety', 'social', 'social media', 'stimulant use', 'success', 'telehealth', 'tool', 'treatment center', 'treatment program', 'treatment services']",NIDA,"SOBER GRID, INC.",R44,2019,499907,-0.027968301799977335
"Using a Natural Experiment to Evaluate the Long-Term Effects of Neighborhood Deprivation on Alzheimer's Disease and Vascular Risk Factors ABSTRACT  The NIA has called for social science and community-based studies to clarify risk and protective factors for Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD), particularly among racial minorities who are disproportionately affected. Place, including both neighborhood of residence and region/state of birth, has consistently been correlated with ADRD, stroke, and impaired cognitive function. Yet it is unclear whether modifiable mechanisms explain this association, or whether the association is merely due to the selection of unhealthy individuals into poor regions. The goal of this study is to produce the first quasi-experimental evidence to understand the influence of neighborhood socioeconomic deprivation on ADRD and its vascular risk factors. We take advantage of a unique natural experiment, overcoming methodological challenges in the previous literature on neighborhood effects on ADRD. From 1986 to 1998, the Danish government actively dispersed roughly 76,000 incoming refugees across the country in a nearly randomized (“quasi-random”) fashion to avoid over-crowding in major cities. This cohort includes nearly 12,000 individuals who lived until at least age 60 in Denmark during the 30-year follow-up. Over 90% of families agreed to participate in the program, creating a natural experiment in which these individuals were quasi-randomly assigned to neighborhoods with different levels of deprivation. We will employ unique data spanning over 30 years from Denmark's population and clinical registers, which provide data on sociodemographics, clinical encounters, and prescriptions for all Danish residents. We identify cases of ADRD and its vascular risk factors among this racially diverse cohort via validated techniques using ICD codes and prescription data in clinical registers. We have successfully linked these registers to detailed geocoded data sources on eight measures of neighborhood socioeconomic deprivation. In Aim 1, our goal is to test the hypothesis that neighborhood deprivation increases the incidence of ADRD later in life. In Aim 2, we will examine the effects of neighborhood deprivation on vascular risk factors for ADRD, including highly prevalent conditions that occur across the life course. In Aim 3, we will identify vulnerable subgroups whose development of ADRD and vascular risk factors differs in response to neighborhood deprivation, taking advantage of the large sample size and complete register data available on all subjects. We will employ both hypothesis-driven and hypothesis-generating statistical techniques, including innovative machine learning methods that allow for more complex and robust subgroup identification. This will enable future interventions to be tailored to the most vulnerable individuals. Overall, the expected outcome of this research is to produce rigorous evidence on the effects of neighborhood characteristics on ADRD and vascular risk factors, overcoming the methodological challenges in previous work. This will directly inform the development of clinical, community, and policy strategies to address the neighborhood determinants of ADRD among vulnerable populations who are most at-risk. PROJECT NARRATIVE  The goal of this research is to examine the effects of neighborhood deprivation on Alzheimer's dementia and its vascular risk factors. We will examine the association of specific neighborhood characteristics with Alzheimer's and its risk factors, and we will assess whether specific subgroups may be more vulnerable to neighborhood deprivation. This will inform the development of interventions to address the neighborhood factors that affect Alzheimer's disease.",Using a Natural Experiment to Evaluate the Long-Term Effects of Neighborhood Deprivation on Alzheimer's Disease and Vascular Risk Factors,9745267,R01AG063385,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Attention', 'Biological Factors', 'Birth', 'Blood Vessels', 'Characteristics', 'Cities', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Community Developments', 'Complex', 'Country', 'Crowding', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Denmark', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Disadvantaged', 'Discrimination', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Exposure to', 'Family', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Government', 'Health', 'Hyperlipidemia', 'Hypertension', 'Immigrant', 'Impaired cognition', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'International Classification of Disease Codes', 'Intervention', 'Life', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Life Experience', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Logistics', 'Long-Term Effects', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Minority Groups', 'Natural experiment', 'Neighborhoods', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Poverty', 'Race', 'Randomized', 'Refugees', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Schools', 'Social Sciences', 'Socialization', 'Stroke', 'Subgroup', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Violence', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical development', 'cognitive function', 'cohort', 'dementia risk', 'deprivation', 'diabetes risk', 'environmental enrichment for laboratory animals', 'ethnic minority population', 'evidence base', 'experimental study', 'follow-up', 'forest', 'high risk', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'member', 'prevent', 'programs', 'protective factors', 'racial and ethnic', 'racial diversity', 'racial minority', 'residence', 'response', 'social', 'sociodemographics', 'socioeconomic disadvantage', 'socioeconomics', 'stressor', 'theories', 'therapy development', 'treatment effect', 'vascular risk factor', 'young adult']",NIA,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2019,567836,0.01258866508590409
"Lifecourse CVD Risk and Midlife Cognitive Trajectories and Brain Aging: Implications for Alzheimer's and Dementia Prevention ABSTRACT Vascular health has emerged as one of the most important determinants of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias. Early adult and midlife cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors and subclinical disease may be important drivers of cognitive decline in midlife, a period that most likely is critical for influencing later life dementia risk. Yet, few studies have investigated early adulthood CVD risk exposures, including timing of exposure and whether subthreshold levels impact later life cognition. To accomplish these goals, we propose, to add cognitive testing to the Year 35 visit of the ongoing multisite Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study. At baseline, CARDIA enrolled 5,115 black and white participants (mean age 24) who have been carefully followed for 30 years and had cognitive testing at visit years 25 and 30. Cognitive evaluation at Year 35 will allow us to determine 10-year cognitive change (mean age 50 to 60) at a critical time point when cognitive decline starts to diverge and potentially impacts late-life dementia risk. Our specific aims are: 1) To determine, using a life-course approach, the independent associations of 10-year midlife cognitive decline with timing, level (both subthreshold and threshold) and trend in CVD risk factors including body mass index, blood pressure, and fasting glucose, assessed over 35 years from early adult to midlife; 2) To determine the association of 10-year midlife cognitive decline with novel subclinical CVD markers over time including carotid artery intima thickness, coronary artery calcification and cardiac function; 3) To determine whether CVD risk factors and subclinical CVD markers are associated with brain aging indices in midlife, derived by the application of machine-learning neuroimaging pattern analysis to brain MRI and diffusion tensor imaging data obtained on nearly 700 CARDIA participants at midlife; Exploratory) To assess black/white disparities in 10- year cognitive decline and determine the extent to which such disparities are explained by burden of CVD risk. Guided by strong preliminary data, our main hypothesis is that CVD risk factors begin to exert influence as early as the third decade of life and that subthreshold levels (eg systolic blood pressure ≥120 mm) are important drivers for this. In addition, we hypothesize that subclinical CVD measures (especially cardiac function and atherosclerosis) are associated with greater decline in midlife cognition and accelerated brain aging. No other study in the US has such comprehensive data on a wide array of early adult CVD risk factors that may influence cognitive aging. As an experienced multidisciplinary team using innovative statistical methods to analyze essentially unique longitudinal data on early adult and midlife CVD risk factors and subclinical disease, we have the opportunity to investigate the associations of these life-course exposures with cognitive decline and brain health in midlife. Identifying dementia risk factors early in the life-course may lead to interventions to help maintain healthy brain aging and prevent the onset of dementia. PROJECT NARRATIVE We propose to study how cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors such as high blood pressure, diabetes and obesity may influence cognitive function changes in midlife. We will apply a life-course approach to this investigation by carefully studying how CVD risk and preclinical markers beginning in early adulthood (20s and 30s) may affect midlife cognitive functioning and brain aging. In this way, the study has great public health value as it will inform ways to possibly prevent Alzheimer disease and vascular changes in the brain.",Lifecourse CVD Risk and Midlife Cognitive Trajectories and Brain Aging: Implications for Alzheimer's and Dementia Prevention,9798942,R01AG063887,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Atrophic', 'Blood Pressure', 'Blood Vessels', 'Body mass index', 'Brain', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Carotid Arteries', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive aging', 'Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults Study', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Disease Marker', 'Dose', 'Elderly', 'Enrollment', 'Evaluation', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hypertension', 'Impaired cognition', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pathologic', 'Pattern', 'Prevention', 'Prevention strategy', 'Public Health', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Science', 'Statistical Methods', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Time trend', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Visit', 'aging brain', 'black/white disparity', 'brain health', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'cognitive change', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive testing', 'cohort', 'coronary artery calcification', 'critical period', 'dementia risk', 'early life exposure', 'emerging adult', 'experience', 'fasting glucose', 'heart function', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'middle age', 'multidisciplinary', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'pre-clinical', 'prevent', 'racial difference', 'racial disparity', 'treatment strategy', 'trend', 'white matter', 'young adult']",NIA,NORTHERN CALIFORNIA INSTITUTE/RES/EDU,R01,2019,829290,-0.0022500200477100526
"Phase II - HazPrep Worker Training - Community Risk Profile PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT A worker's personal hazard profile (PHP) is a function of hazards present and his/her exposure level to those hazards.

"Robust Predictors of Mania and Psychosis PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  The purpose of the new funding opportunity announcement, RFA-OD-17-004 for Intensive Longitudinal Analysis of Health Behaviors: Leveraging New Technologies To Understand Health Behaviors (U01), is to establish a cooperative agreement network to collaboratively study factors that influence key health behaviors in the dynamic environment of individuals, using intensive longitudinal data collection and analytic methods. Importantly, progress has been slow and frustrating in translating knowledge of the brain to new and more effective treatments for human brain diseases such as severe mental disorders. In fact, severe mental disorders, which include psychotic disorders, are brain diseases that are not only devastating because they result in severe disruptions that occur early in life, but, for many, the course of illness is progressive, leading to chronic debilitation and early mortality. Thus the need to accelerate knowledge about the factors that trigger (or increase or decrease the likelihood) of manic and psychotic episodes, and to translate this knowledge to more effective treatment interventions, is critical. The primary goal of the proposed “Robust Predictors of Mania and Psychosis” is to identify biological, environmental, and social factors that trigger dangerous mental states, particularly mania and psychosis, in individuals known to be at risk for these conditions. The eventual goal of this work is to provide quantifiable and predictable information that can be used to scaffold biological observations and tailor intervention strategies to maximize efficacy at the individual level. We first develop models to predict conventional clinical measures specific to psychosis and mania using (1) digital, low- to-minimal burden interactions through smartphones and wearables (Aim 1), and (2) measures extracted from face and voice during in-person clinical interactions (Aim 2), work which leverages existing data we have already collected. We will next collect one hundred person-years of pseudo-continuous multivariate behavioral data from one hundred individuals with a psychotic disorder, to further test and validate our early observations in a wider array of individuals with affective and non-affective psychotic disorders, who are likely to experience illness fluctuations within a one-year timeframe, employing several strategies to optimize participant engagement (Aim 3). We will also perform, as a representative example, a study comparing sleep, energy expenditure, and mania symptoms over time, using data obtained in the first three aims, to quantify how the relationship between energy expenditure and energy perception varies across our study population in ways that could have important consequences for health behaviors (Aim 4). The main goals of this project are thus to acquire high quality, temporally dense behavioral, cognitive, and clinical data on an important cohort of young adult patients, not only to facilitate future investigations linking these behavioral change points to neurobiological processes but also as a precursor to more effective, targeted therapeutics, such as real-time interventions that could be delivered based on dynamic factors in an individual's environment. 8. PROJECT NARRATIVE The main goal of the proposed “Robust predictors of mania and psychosis” is to identify biological, environmental, and social factors that trigger dangerous mental states, particularly mania and psychosis, in individuals known to be at risk for these conditions by acquiring high quality, temporally dense, longitudinal behavioral data, and using machine learning approaches to iteratively identify factors that increase or decrease the likelihood of these conditions. We focus on early psychosis (both affective and non-affective psychosis), which is a critical time period when there are fewer confounds such as prolonged medication exposure and chronicity, and when early intervention strategies will be most effective, prior to the progression that often leads to debilitating and chronic illnesses, to great suffering, and to an enormous public health problem and economic burden. By developing predictors for mania and psychosis from smartphone, wearable, and audio- video data and then testing these predictors over 100 person-years in individuals with active psychotic disorders, the data collected will make it possible to identify specific factors in the physical, social, and/or built environment that facilitate or hinder healthy behaviors in early psychosis and bipolar disorder and lay the groundwork for tailored intervention strategies that fully account for these factors to maximize efficacy at the individual level.",Robust Predictors of Mania and Psychosis,9920544,U01MH116925,"['Acoustics', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Categories', 'Cellular Phone', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Cognitive', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Dangerousness', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Collection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Early Intervention', 'Economic Burden', 'Energy Metabolism', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Face', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding Opportunities', 'Future', 'Gestures', 'Goals', 'Health behavior', 'Hospitalization', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Manic', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medical Records', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Neurobiology', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Perception', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physical environment', 'Process', 'Prospective Studies', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Risk', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sleep', 'Social Environment', 'Symptoms', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translating', 'U-Series Cooperative Agreements', 'Visual', 'Voice', 'Work', 'Wrist', 'actigraphy', 'analytical method', 'base', 'built environment', 'case control', 'cohort', 'design', 'digital', 'disability', 'early onset', 'effective therapy', 'energy balance', 'experience', 'gaze', 'individual patient', 'longitudinal analysis', 'longitudinal design', 'mental state', 'mortality', 'new technology', 'phenotypic data', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive test', 'prospective', 'psychotic symptoms', 'scaffold', 'sensor', 'severe mental illness', 'social', 'study population', 'targeted treatment', 'theories', 'time use', 'wearable device', 'young adult']",NIMH,MCLEAN HOSPITAL,U01,2019,86955,-0.012039586732984981
"Robust Predictors of Mania and Psychosis PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  The purpose of the new funding opportunity announcement, RFA-OD-17-004 for Intensive Longitudinal Analysis of Health Behaviors: Leveraging New Technologies To Understand Health Behaviors (U01), is to establish a cooperative agreement network to collaboratively study factors that influence key health behaviors in the dynamic environment of individuals, using intensive longitudinal data collection and analytic methods. Importantly, progress has been slow and frustrating in translating knowledge of the brain to new and more effective treatments for human brain diseases such as severe mental disorders. In fact, severe mental disorders, which include psychotic disorders, are brain diseases that are not only devastating because they result in severe disruptions that occur early in life, but, for many, the course of illness is progressive, leading to chronic debilitation and early mortality. Thus the need to accelerate knowledge about the factors that trigger (or increase or decrease the likelihood) of manic and psychotic episodes, and to translate this knowledge to more effective treatment interventions, is critical. The primary goal of the proposed “Robust Predictors of Mania and Psychosis” is to identify biological, environmental, and social factors that trigger dangerous mental states, particularly mania and psychosis, in individuals known to be at risk for these conditions. The eventual goal of this work is to provide quantifiable and predictable information that can be used to scaffold biological observations and tailor intervention strategies to maximize efficacy at the individual level. We first develop models to predict conventional clinical measures specific to psychosis and mania using (1) digital, low- to-minimal burden interactions through smartphones and wearables (Aim 1), and (2) measures extracted from face and voice during in-person clinical interactions (Aim 2), work which leverages existing data we have already collected. We will next collect one hundred person-years of pseudo-continuous multivariate behavioral data from one hundred individuals with a psychotic disorder, to further test and validate our early observations in a wider array of individuals with affective and non-affective psychotic disorders, who are likely to experience illness fluctuations within a one-year timeframe, employing several strategies to optimize participant engagement (Aim 3). We will also perform, as a representative example, a study comparing sleep, energy expenditure, and mania symptoms over time, using data obtained in the first three aims, to quantify how the relationship between energy expenditure and energy perception varies across our study population in ways that could have important consequences for health behaviors (Aim 4). The main goals of this project are thus to acquire high quality, temporally dense behavioral, cognitive, and clinical data on an important cohort of young adult patients, not only to facilitate future investigations linking these behavioral change points to neurobiological processes but also as a precursor to more effective, targeted therapeutics, such as real-time interventions that could be delivered based on dynamic factors in an individual's environment. 8.

"Understanding the Multilevel Drivers of Liver Cancer Disparities Project Summary/Abstract From 2000-2014, hepatocellular carcinoma, or HCC, incidence rates increased nearly 4% per year, while most cancers in the United States were on the decline. HCC disproportionately impacts minority racial/ethnic groups who are diagnosed at rates approximately twice that of non-Hispanic Whites. To inform primary prevention strategies that will reduce disparities in HCC risk, we need to determine the relative contribution of well- established and emerging (e.g., hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus, alcohol, smoking, cirrhosis, NAFLD, metabolic disorders, diabetes, HIV infection), and novel (e.g., medications, comorbidities, neighborhood attributes) risk factors to these disparities. To inform secondary and tertiary prevention strategies to reduce disparities in HCC burden, we need to understand the multilevel factors that contribute to HCC surveillance disparities. Answering these gaps in knowledge requires a robust high-quality study with a sample enriched for racial/ethnic minorities. Thus, we propose to leverage existing multi-disciplinary collaborations to develop an integrated dataset that includes electronic health records (EHR) data linked to population-based state cancer registry data and geospatial contextual data. This multilevel resource will include data on nearly 2.3 million individuals from three healthcare systems (mixed payer, integrated healthcare, federally qualified health centers) in California and Hawaii, thus providing diversity in healthcare settings and enrichment for racial/ethnic minorities: 59,400 are Black, 189,500 are Hispanic, and 441,700 are Asian American/Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander (AANHPI). With this resource, we specifically aim to: (1) assess the relative importance of established and emerging examine the extent to which these factors independently and jointly contribute to racial/ethnic disparities in HCC risk; (2) discover novel risk factors and assess their relative importance to HCC risk; and (3) assess racial/ethnic disparities in adherence with surveillance for HCC as well as examine the extent to which these disparities are attributable to modifiable individual-, clinician-, system-, and neighborhood factors (Aim 3). For Aim 1, using prospective data, we will assess the relative importance of risk factors and their contribution to racial/ethnic disparities in HCC risk with causal inference methods. For Aim 2, we will apply innovative machine learning methods to identify novel factors and validate their associations with HCC risk using modeling strategy from Aim 1. For Aim 3, we will use multilevel generalized linear regression to investigate the patient, clinician, institutional and geographic factors that contribute to disparities in HCC surveillance. Given the importance of sex and age/birth cohort for HCC risk, these social determinants will be considered together with race/ethnicity using an intersectional approach. By applying a multilevel framework to understand how biological, clinical, and social factors at multiple levels contribute to HCC disparities in incidence and surveillance, the proposed study will identify modifiable factors that can be translated to the clinical and community settings to collaboratively identify strategies to ameliorate racial/ethnic disparities in HCC. Project Narrative While most cancer incidence and mortality in the United States are declining, the burden of liver cancer is increasing; yet, we do not understand what causes 40% of these cancers. Furthermore, this cancer impacts racial/ethnic groups disproportionately, with minority racial/ethnic groups who are diagnosed at rates approximately twice that of non-Hispanic Whites. Therefore we propose to study the relative contribution of established and emerging risk factors, discover and validate novel risk factors, and to understand patient, clinician, healthcare system and geographic factors that influence surveillance; these findings can then be used to inform strategies in clinical and community settings to reduce the burden of liver cancer particularly for those at high risk.",Understanding the Multilevel Drivers of Liver Cancer Disparities,9679122,R01CA225478,"['Address', 'Adherence', 'Alcohols', 'Asian Americans', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Biological', 'Biological Factors', 'Biology', 'Biometry', 'Birth', 'California', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Cirrhosis', 'Clinical', 'Comorbidity', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Education', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemiologic Monitoring', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Ethnic group', 'Federally Qualified Health Center', 'Female', 'Fibrinogen', 'Future', 'Geographic Factor', 'Geography', 'HIV Infections', 'Hawaii', 'Health Insurance', 'Health Maintenance Organizations', 'Health Services Research', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hepatitis B', 'Hepatitis B Virus', 'Hepatitis C', 'Hepatitis C virus', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hispanics', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Institution', 'Insurance Coverage', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Linear Regressions', 'Link', 'Liver neoplasms', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of liver', 'Metabolic Diseases', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Native Hawaiian', 'Neighborhoods', 'Not Hispanic or Latino', 'Pacific Island Americans', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Prevention strategy', 'Preventive measure', 'Primary Prevention', 'Primary carcinoma of the liver cells', 'Race', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Studies', 'Secondary Prevention', 'Services', 'Shapes', 'Smoking', 'Social Sciences', 'System', 'Tobacco smoking behavior', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'United States', 'built environment', 'cancer epidemiology', 'cancer health disparity', 'chronic alcohol ingestion', 'cohort', 'community setting', 'data registry', 'disparity reduction', 'electronic data', 'ethnic minority population', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'health care settings', 'high risk', 'innovation', 'intersectionality', 'learning strategy', 'male', 'mortality', 'neoplasm registry', 'non-alcoholic fatty liver disease', 'nonalcoholic steatohepatitis', 'novel', 'population based', 'prospective', 'racial and ethnic', 'racial and ethnic disparities', 'racial minority', 'sex', 'social', 'social disparities', 'socioeconomics', 'tertiary prevention']",NCI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2019,680549,0.017702553773692765
"Identifying primary care patients at increased risk of atrial fibrillation for screening interventions Project Summary/Abstract Atrial Fibrillation (AF) increases the risk of stroke 5-fold and accounts for roughly 15% of all strokes in the United States. Many individuals may have undiagnosed AF whose arrhythmia does not prompt evaluation either because of minimal symptoms or brief episodes. Oral anticoagulation (OAC) is highly effective at reducing stroke risk in patients with AF, but is only prescribed to individuals with recognized disease. Identifying subjects with undiagnosed AF is important so they may be treated with OAC and prevent strokes from occurring. This project will help advance our knowledge of screening patients for undiagnosed AF in the primary care setting by identifying patients at high risk of developing AF for targeted clinic and home-based screening strategies. Fundamental questions of who to target and how to implement a screening program in the United States remain unanswered. To address these gaps in knowledge, the principal investigator (PI) proposes a career development program that blends rigorous methodologic and content area training with an innovative research agenda. This plan has three scientific objectives: 1) To identify predictors of AF incidence from electronic health record structured and free-text data, 2) To develop and implement an electronic algorithm that improves upon existing models to identify patients at increased risk for AF in a primary care population, and 3) To implement and evaluate feasibility, acceptability, appropriateness, and usability of a clinic and home-based screening program to identify undiagnosed AF. This project aligns with several objectives of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute’s Strategic Vision by implementing novel diagnostic tools to diagnose AF and prevent strokes, by optimizing clinical and implementation research to improve health and reduce disease, and leveraging emerging opportunities in data science, through the use of natural language processing of text data in the electronic health record, to improve identification of patients at high risk for AF. The long-term goal of this career development award is to establish the PI as an independent researcher with expertise in cardiovascular disease and targeting populations for prevention of cardiovascular disease events. Career development activities include training in biomedical informatics, data mining and risk prediction, survey research design, implementation research, and cardiovascular disease pathophysiology and clinical management through formal coursework, clinical shadowing, as well as mentorship by an exceptionally qualified team of senior scientists. Successful completion of this career development proposal will improve prediction of which patients are at the highest risk of developing AF, and evaluate how to use this risk information to implement an effective screening strategy in primary care. Pilot data from this award will lay the groundwork for a highly competitive application for NIH R01 funding. Project Narrative Atrial fibrillation increases the risk of ischemic stroke and the prevalence is estimated to increase from 5.2 million adults in the United States to more than 12 million by 2030, however, many additional individuals have undiagnosed disease. The proposed research program will significantly advance our understanding of screening for undiagnosed atrial fibrillation, by 1) improving identification of patients at high risk of developing atrial fibrillation, and 2) targeting patients at high risk of developing atrial fibrillation in the primary care setting with an efficient strategy for clinic and home-based screening. This program will significantly increase knowledge of how to overcome the real-world issue of how to effectively and efficiently screen for atrial fibrillation in clinical practice.",Identifying primary care patients at increased risk of atrial fibrillation for screening interventions,9806592,K01HL148506,"['Address', 'Adhesives', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Anticoagulation', 'Area', 'Arrhythmia', 'Atrial Fibrillation', 'Award', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caring', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Research', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'General Hospitals', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Technology', 'Home environment', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Ischemic Stroke', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Massachusetts', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Oral', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Primary Health Care', 'Principal Investigator', 'Program Development', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Senior Scientist', 'Stroke', 'Stroke prevention', 'Structure', 'Survey Methodology', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'Target Populations', 'Techniques', 'Text', 'Training', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vision', 'Work', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'cardiovascular disorder prevention', 'career development', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'data mining', 'data registry', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'implementation research', 'implementation science', 'improved', 'innovation', 'mHealth', 'medical specialties', 'mobile computing', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'patient screening', 'population based', 'practice setting', 'primary care setting', 'programs', 'prospective', 'randomized trial', 'risk minimization', 'screening', 'screening program', 'stroke risk', 'tool', 'usability']",NHLBI,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,K01,2019,176990,-0.054769560523544626
"SCH: Prediction of Preterm Birth in Nulliparous Women Preterm Birth (PTB) is a major long-lasting public health problem being the leading cause of mortality and long-term disabilities among neonates, with heavy emotional and financial consequences to families and society. Prediction of PTB risk has been an exceedingly challenging problem, in particular for first time mothers (nulliparous women) due to the lack of prior pregnancy history. Most studies to date have examined individual risk factors, genetic, environmental, or behavioral, through univariate analyses of their association with PTB, including GWAS identifying modest contribution of common variants across six gene regions. The challenge of improving PTB prediction is due to the inherent complexity of its multifactorial etiology and the lack of approaches capable of integrating and interpreting large multidisciplinary data. Our previous work [NSF Eager 1454855, 1454814] developed predictive models for PTB based on non-genetic maternal attributes. An important question is to know whether factors other than history of PTB can be used to identify a nullipara patient at risk. We plan on devising longitudinal risk prediction methods for PTB that integrate every piece of available data. We will address three important gaps in current literature as our three project objectives: a focused study of nulliparous women and their risk for PTB; combining genetic factors with other clinical factors to determine risk ; and using longitudinal data and models to optimize scheduling of patient visits, testing and treatment. We will focus on a recently released NIH-NICHD dataset called nuMoM2b, which is a prospective cohort study of a racially/ethnically/geographically diverse  population of10 ,038 nulliparous women with singleton gestation . Our aims are as follows: (1) Longitudinal Preterm Birth Prediction ; (2) Combining clinical and genetic features for risk prediction ; (3) Assessing the effectiveness of the methods in clinical practice. RELEVANCE (See instructions) . Over 26 billion dollars are spent annually on the delivery and care of the 12% of infants who are born preterm in the United States. A crucial challenge is to identify women who are at the highest risk for early preterm birth and to develop interventions. Equally important, would be the ability to identify women at the lowest risk to avoid unnecessary and costly interventions. Our project has the potential to advance knowledge about this long-lasting public health problem. n/a",SCH: Prediction of Preterm Birth in Nulliparous Women,9928205,R01LM013327,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Behavioral', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Effectiveness', 'Emotional', 'Etiology', 'Family', 'Female', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Geography', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Instruction', 'Intervention', 'Journals', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medical Genetics', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mothers', 'National Institute of Child Health and Human Development', 'New York', 'Nulliparity', 'Paper', 'Patient Schedules', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Histories', 'Premature Birth', 'Presbyterian Church', 'Prospective cohort study', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Series', 'Social Impacts', 'Societies', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'Visit', 'Woman', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'design', 'disability', 'genetic association', 'genetic information', 'genome wide association study', 'graduate student', 'high risk', 'improved', 'insight', 'intervention cost', 'minority student', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'neonate', 'non-genetic', 'phenotypic data', 'predictive modeling', 'racial and ethnic', 'recruit', 'symposium', 'undergraduate research']",NLM,COLUMBIA UNIV NEW YORK MORNINGSIDE,R01,2019,259112,0.02814735808181138
"Evolution of Psychosis in Youth: Multimodal Risk and Resilience Markers PROJECT SUMMARY Efforts at early identification of individuals at risk for psychosis are propelled by the realization that psychosis is neurodevelopmental, with brain and behavioral abnormalities anteceding diagnosis of schizophrenia (SZ) by years. As longer duration of untreated psychosis portends poor outcome, early identification is important to bend the developmental trajectory in a favorable direction. Since most current studies of psychosis risk are based on help-seeking samples, there is a gap in knowledge on how psychosis unfolds in diverse community samples. While it is generally recognized that genomic and environmental factors (GxE) contribute to risk for psychosis, there is a paucity of complementary integrative studies that can chart causal pathways. Genomic “case-control” GWAS studies of SZ identified multiple common alleles permitting calculation of a polygenic risk score (PRS). Recently, increased attention has been given to childhood adversity related to SZ. The goal of the proposed R01 is to build on our genotyped ~10,000 Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort (PNC) of 8 to 21 years old youths studied in 2009-2011, where we are following those who meet criteria or are at risk for psychosis (PS) and typically developing (TD) participants, whose current age range is 15-30 years. Available multi-level “deep phenotyping” includes clinical, neurocognition and multi-modal neuroimaging on a subsample of ~1600. We have developed a preliminary environmental risk score (ERS) and will use it to dissect GxE. The proposed followup design will recruit PS and TD participants with the highest and lowest scorers (quartile) on the ERS, and within each of these four cells we will examine 120 individuals, 60 males and 60 females (total N=480). This sample will be examined clinically, neurocognitively and with multimodal neuroimaging. We will test the hypothesis that genomic vulnerabilities, based on PRS and family history, and environmental adversity, based on ERS, updated longitudinally, affect onset and course of PS by altering brain development in temporolimbic regions affecting fronto-limbic connectivity that underlies social functioning. We will augment current data with information on risk and resilience and multimodal brain-behavior parameters to establish developmental trajectories during this critical period of brain maturation when psychosis emerges. Our aims are: 1. Examine effects of ERS on PS clinical features and progression in relation to PRS. 2. Investigate brain- behavior parameters that bridge from genetic and environmental factors to clinical manifestations. 3. Establish developmental trajectories for PS features, associated brain parameters and neurocognitive deficits, and apply novel computational models to enable an adaptive “risk and resilience calculator”. The proposed study will produce the data absent for a diverse US community sample but needed to move psychiatry into the precision medicine era. The project will inform on genomic and environmental risk and resilience indicators, offering an essential rung in the ladder toward individualized prediction, a part of implementation science. As with the PNC, data and associated algorithms will be a resource shared with the scientific community. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed R01 aims to bridge genomic, environment and phenotypic brain-behavior measures to advance the understanding of risk and resilience to psychosis. We will build on informative samples of the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort and integrate multidimensional behavioral measures of psychosis and cognition, multimodal neuroimaging parameters of brain structure, function and connectivity, environmental parameters, and genomic variations in risk for schizophrenia.

"Applying statistical learning tools to personalize cardiovascular treatment Abstract Cardiovascular disease (CVD) treatment is often guided by risk stratification tools (to decide who to treat), and randomized controlled trials (to decide which treatments to select). Prior CVD research reveals two major  obstacles to improving our treatment approach: (i) longitudinal cohort data are unavailable for recalibrating risk stratification tools for local-area estimation (by zip code), or for people with major CVD-promoting  comorbidities (e.g., chronic kidney disease); and (ii) the average treatment effect in randomized trials can be highly erroneous when projected onto individuals that vary from the ‘average’ participant in a trial. CVD risk- stratification and treatment effect estimation can be improved and personalized if we overcome a critical barrier to progress: correctly estimating risk and treatment effect from new, large participant data repositories, which have greater population size and include patients with more co-morbid conditions than common cohort studies, and which permit personalized risk/benefit prediction tool development from individual-level data. Our prior studies show that we can critically advance the field by applying novel statistical learning methods to this data, to address: (i) false-positives from multiple testing; (ii) the reliance on standard regressions that cannot account for non-linear, complex interactions between factors; and (iii) identifying the optimal approach among many alternative statistical learning methods. We propose to apply our work in these areas to (Aim 1) Develop CVD risk stratification tools for patients with inadequate sample sizes in common cohort studies. We will enhance CVD risk stratification to include local-area adjustment (by zip code) and major co-morbid conditions affecting CVD risk (e.g., chronic kidney disease). We will additionally (Aim 2) develop personalized treatment effect  prediction tools to guide decisions for CVD therapies with high potential benefit and risk, for therapies where  individual participant data from trials are available. We have obtained the individual participant data from the large randomized trials that reveal wide variations in CVD risk reduction and serious adverse event risk increase from three drug classes: non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants, intensive blood pressure treatment, and sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors for diabetes. Our preliminary research shows that traditional  regression methods cannot distinguish which patients are most likely to benefit or be harmed by such therapies, but our statistical learning methods can. Finally, we will (Aim 3) develop open-source tools to improve the ability of researchers to choose an optimal statistical learning approach for their dataset and problem. While numerous statistical learning methods have been proposed in the literature, a key problem for biomedical scientists  without access to RCT data is: which method should I use to estimate treatment effects from observational data? Building on our innovative approach to identify the optimal inference method for observational data, we will construct an open-source tool to compare methods, identifying which method most often results in optimal treatment decisions that minimize error and maximize performance on standardized metrics. Public health relevance  Using current cardiovascular disease risk stratification tools, about 31.6 million Americans will receive an incorrect cardiovascular disease risk estimate that will lead to wrong treatment, per current guidelines.  Furthermore, extrapolating the average treatment effect for major preventive cardiovascular disease treatments— rather than calculating a personalized risk/benefit score—contributes to 4.9 million serious adverse events from treatment complications each year.

"Reducing Drug-Related Mortality Using Predictive Analytics: A Randomized, Statewide, Community Intervention Trial PROJECT SUMMARY Overdose deaths have skyrocketed in the United States since 1999. The epidemic has prompted widespread federal and state actions, yet the number of people who die of an overdose continues to increase. In light of the accelerating and rapidly evolving overdose epidemic, new strategies are needed to identify communities most at risk, and to utilize resources more effectively to curb overdose deaths. To address these public health priorities, we will develop a forecasting tool to predict overdose deaths before they occur, and then conduct a randomized, statewide, community-level intervention to evaluate resource targeting based on these predictions. The study will take place in Rhode Island, a state with the 10th highest rate of overdose fatality in 2016. The study has two phases. First, we will develop a predictive analytics model that forecasts future overdose mortality at the neighborhood-level, using publicly available information and data from a multicomponent overdose surveillance system. This tool, called PROVIDENT (Preventing Overdose using Information and Data from the Environment) will be used to predict the likelihood of magnitude of future overdose deaths in every neighborhood across Rhode Island. Next, we will conduct a randomized policy experiment to evaluate whether targeting overdose prevention interventions to neighborhoods at highest risk reduces overdose morbidity and mortality. The state's department of health will receive PROVIDENT model predictions for half of the 39 cities/towns in Rhode Island. Within these cities/town, the health department will work with stakeholders to target overdose prevention interventions to neighborhoods with the highest probability of future overdose deaths. Interventions include efforts to: (1) prevent high-risk prescribing (through academic detailing and other educational efforts); (2) expand access to opioid agonist therapy, including buprenorphine and methadone; (3) increase naloxone distribution (through community and pharmacy-based efforts); and (4) expand street-based peer recovery coaching and referrals. Control cities/town will continue to receive these interventions, but without targeting to specific neighborhoods. Fatal and non-fatal opioid overdose rates in the control cities/towns will be compared to those that received the PROVIDENT model predictions. To achieve these aims, we will leverage a unique partnership between an academic institution and a state's health department, which allows for unprecedented access to and sharing of population-based overdose surveillance data. Our results will improve public health decision-making and inform resource allocation to communities that should be prioritized for evidence-based prevention, treatment, recovery, and overdose rescue services. If found to be effective, the PROVIDENT forecasting model will be disseminated to other states, which could adapt the tool to guide resource allocation and maximize public health impact. In sum, this project is highly responsive to a top research priority of the National Institute on Drug Abuse, and directly addresses one of the nation's most challenging public health crises. PROJECT NARRATIVE The objectives of this project are to leverage surveillance data to predict future overdose outbreaks, and to evaluate the impact of a randomized, statewide, community-level intervention trial to target overdose prevention programs to neighborhoods at highest risk of future overdose deaths. This study develops and tests an opioid overdose forecasting tool, which will allow other states to identify and deploy interventions to communities at highest risk of opioid-related death. This results study will significantly improve the allocation of resources to curb the opioid overdose epidemic in the United States.","Reducing Drug-Related Mortality Using Predictive Analytics: A Randomized, Statewide, Community Intervention Trial",9817054,R01DA046620,"['Academic Detailing', 'Address', 'Admission activity', 'American', 'Area', 'Buprenorphine', 'Censuses', 'Cities', 'Classification', 'Communities', 'Community Pharmacy', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Dose', 'Emergency medical service', 'Environment', 'Epidemic', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Priorities', 'Hospitals', 'Institution', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Community Trial', 'Intervention Trial', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Methadone', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Naloxone', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'Neighborhoods', 'Overdose', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Predictive Analytics', 'Prevention', 'Prevention program', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Probability', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Randomized', 'Recording of previous events', 'Records', 'Recovery', 'Research Priority', 'Resource Allocation', 'Resources', 'Rhode Island', 'Risk', 'Services', 'Source', 'Strategic Planning', 'Sum', 'System', 'Testing', 'United States', 'Visit', 'Work', 'addiction', 'base', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'high risk', 'improved', 'indexing', 'learning strategy', 'mortality', 'novel', 'opioid agonist therapy', 'opioid misuse', 'opioid mortality', 'opioid overdose', 'opioid policy', 'opioid use disorder', 'overdose death', 'overdose prevention', 'overdose risk', 'peer', 'population based', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'prescription opioid', 'prevent', 'primary outcome', 'programs', 'public health priorities', 'referral services', 'resource guides', 'response', 'spatiotemporal', 'surveillance data', 'tool', 'treatment arm']",NIDA,BROWN UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,718669,0.0033961843014658293
"Multi-Parametric Spatial Assessment of Bone with HR-pQCT ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Osteoporosis is a skeletal disorder characterized by compromised bone strength predisposing a person to an increased risk of fracture. In the U.S. today, 10 million individuals are estimated to already have the disease and almost 34 million more are estimated to have low bone density, placing them at increased risk for osteoporosis and broken bones. Currently, determination of fracture risk, aging effects, and therapeutic efficacy is primarily based on bone mineral density (BMD) measured by areal or volumetric X-ray-based imaging techniques. BMD can predict bone strength and fracture risk to some extent, however, studies have shown that BMD only explains about 70%-75% of the variance in strength, while the remaining variance has been attributed to the cumulative and synergistic effect of other factors such as bone structure, topology, geometry, tissue composition, microdamage, and biomechanical factors. High-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography (HR-pQCT) is a noninvasive in-vivo imaging technique which depicts many of these features, including density, geometry, structure, topology, and mechanics of cortical and trabecular bone in the distal radius and distal tibia. To date HR-pQCT imagery has been analyzed using conventional quantitative approaches that average bone features over large regions of interest. The individual quantification of average bone features (uni-parametric) or their statistical combination (multi-parametric) disregard how these three-dimensional (3D) features synergistically contribute to bone strength. As a result the traditional methods fail to capture the spatial patterning of the effect being studied, which is key to understanding the underlying biology. Bone is a 3D organ experiencing constant adaptation through remodeling, and should therefore be analyzed with 3D techniques that reflect the complementary and interdependent nature of different bone features. Statistical parametric mapping (SPM) is a technique that enables 3D spatial comparisons of multi-parametric maps between groups of subjects. Instead of measuring summary properties for arbitrary or subjective volumes of interest, this data-driven process identifies regions significantly associated with a variable of interest through valid statistical tests, thus generating 3D statistical and P-value maps that facilitate the visualization and consequently the interpretation of comparisons between target populations. The ultimate goal of this proposal is to establish a framework to automatically identify relevant bone sub-regions and features in specific populations for the targeted quantitative assessment of the spatial distribution and prediction of bone strength using HR-pQCT. For this purpose, specialized SPM techniques have been developed for HR-pQCT. To evaluate the potential of SPM in clinical science, we propose to apply SPM to image data from three existing in-vivo HR-pQCT studies investigating: a) regional variations in bone structure related to gender and age; b) differences due to fracture of the forearm; and c) longitudinal effects of two osteoporosis treatments.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  We propose a population-based framework to automatically identify relevant bone sub-regions and features in specific populations for the targeted quantitative assessment of the spatial distribution and prediction of bone strength using HR-pQCT. To demonstrate the potential of this framework in clinical science, we apply it to existing HR-pQCT studies to identify bone sub-regions and features significantly associated with age, gender, fracture status and response to osteoporosis treatment in post menopausal women; identify spatial associations between the central and distal skeleton with respect to treatment response; and improve fracture discrimination, and the prediction and understanding of the effects of osteoporosis treatment. This framework could improve the development of innovative, more active and safer drugs and therapies, and directly benefit patients suffering osteoporosis and other bone disorders since based on HR-pQCT maps of parameters estimating bone density and quality, a treatment offering the most clinical benefits to them could be prescribed.            ",Multi-Parametric Spatial Assessment of Bone with HR-pQCT,9688116,R01AR068456,"['3-Dimensional', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Biology', 'Biomechanics', 'Bone Density', 'Bone Diseases', 'Bone structure', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Distal', 'Elderly', 'Etiology', 'Exercise', 'Forearm Fracture', 'Fracture', 'Gender', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Hip region structure', 'Hormonal', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Information Distribution', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Nature', 'Organ', 'Osteoporosis', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Peripheral', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Population', 'Postmenopause', 'Process', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Radial', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Role', 'Screening procedure', 'Skeleton', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Target Populations', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Variant', 'Vertebral column', 'Woman', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'age effect', 'base', 'bone', 'bone quality', 'bone strength', 'cortical bone', 'cost', 'density', 'experience', 'fracture risk', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'in vivo imaging', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'population based', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'skeletal', 'skeletal disorder', 'spatial relationship', 'substantia spongiosa', 'tibia', 'treatment response']",NIAMS,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,R01,2019,275934,0.0016970178473665917
"Infrared Eyes(iREyes) Infrared Eyes Abstract Eden Medical, Inc. is pleased to resubmit this Phase 2 SBIR proposal to develop the “Infrared Eyes” (iREyes) imager system, an affordable and powerful mobile health (mHealth) tool for healthcare. The hand-held iREyes system will acquire both thermal and visible spectrum imagery to quantify healing via thermal indexing methodology. The iREyes will offer a user-friendly product with automated categorization. Diabetic foot wounds are common, complex and costly. Foot areas that are likely to ulcerate are associated with increased local skin temperature due to inflammation and enzymatic autolysis of tissue. Inflammation is characterized by the cardinal signs including redness, swelling, and heat. In addition to identifying inflammation associated with healing, the iREyes will also identify hot spots associated with repetitive stress to reduce ulceration and re-ulceration risk for people in diabetic foot remission. The iREyes will directly quantify inflammation pathophysiology implementing a powerful revised two-part strategy: wound healing via regional foot index analysis and ulcer reoccurrence risk through temperature asymmetry threshold analysis. The combined thermal indexing for healing existing wounds and asymmetry predictive analysis represents a significant breakthrough over current practice.

"Applying Novel Passive Sensing Technology to Target Adherence to Diet in Behavioral Obesity Treatment for Patients with Cardiovascular Disease Risk Project Summary This National Research Service Award (F32) is designed to promote the development of Stephanie Goldstein as an independent, clinical research scientist focused on developing and evaluating strategies for measuring and intervening on health behaviors that capitalize on digital health technology. Behavioral obesity treatment (BOT) produces clinically significant weight loss and health benefits for many individuals with overweight/obesity and cardiovascular disease (CVD). Yet, about half of patients fall short of expected outcomes and most experience gradual weight regain, thus negating the benefits over time. Lapses (i.e., self- reported eating instances that deviate from the BOT prescribed diet) could explain poor outcomes, but the behavior is understudied because it is difficult to assess in-lab and via self-report. We therefore propose to study lapses using a multimethod approach with the following tools: ecological momentary assessment (EMA; repeated sampling method via mobile device), a wrist-worn device that automatically detects eating behavior and various eating characteristics (frequency, rate, and duration of eating episodes), and 24-hour dietary recalls. We will recruit participants (n=40) with overweight/obesity and one additional CVD risk factor to enroll in a 12-week BOT program and follow them through an additional 12-week period of weight loss maintenance. Participants will complete a biweekly 7-day EMA protocol to self-report on eating behavior, including the occurrence of dietary lapse. Participants will continuously wear the wrist-worn ActiGraph Link to characterize eating behavior. Lastly, participants will complete 24-hour dietary recalls via structured interview (split between days with and without lapses) at 6-week intervals to measure the composition of all food and beverages consumed. The proposed study approach is consistent with priorities of NHLBI to optimize clinical research and diagnostic strategies to improve CVD and related risk factors. This project will be conducted in combination with an individualized training program including a curriculum designed to facilitate the acquisition of key skills and experience to move the applicant towards her career goals. This includes didactic and experiential training related to the use of passive sensing technology and related analytic strategies in research, factors that can impede weight maintenance and dietary adherence in BOT, and administration and interpretation of validated nutritional assessment. The applicant will work closely with her primary sponsor, Dr. J. Graham Thomas, her co-sponsors Dr. Rena Wing (renowned expert in weight maintenance), Dr. Adam Hoover (electrical and computer scientist), and Dr. Whitney Evans (nutritional epidemiologist and registered dietician). This mentorship team, in combination with the infrastructure and resources available through the Miriam Hospital Weight Control and Diabetes Research Center and Alpert Brown Medical School, represent the ideal environment to accomplish the applicant's training goals, foster professional development and increase the applicant's autonomy as an independent clinical obesity researcher. Project Narrative The current project is evaluating the utility of a wrist-worn passive sensing device for detecting dietary lapses (i.e., discrete eating instances that deviate from a prescribed diet) and evaluating the behavior's association with weight loss outcomes. Participants, with overweight/obesity and one additional CVD risk factor, will wear wrist-worn devices, complete ecological momentary assessment (EMA; repeated sampling method via mobile device) on dietary lapses, and provide information on dietary composition via semi-regular 24-hour food recalls throughout the duration of a 12-week behavioral weight loss program and 12-week weight maintenance period. This study aims to 1) identifying characteristics of lapse behavior by measuring passively-sensed timing, duration, frequency, and rate of eating amongst known lapse episodes, 2) test the association between dietary lapse frequency and weight change, and 3) estimate nutrition composition of dietary lapses.",Applying Novel Passive Sensing Technology to Target Adherence to Diet in Behavioral Obesity Treatment for Patients with Cardiovascular Disease Risk,9771304,F32HL143954,"['Adherence', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Awareness', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Medicine', 'Beverages', 'Body Weight Changes', 'Body Weight decreased', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Computers', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diet', 'Diet Habits', 'Dietary Assessment', 'Dietary intake', 'Dietetics', 'Eating', 'Eating Behavior', 'Ecological momentary assessment', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Energy Intake', 'Engineering', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Epidemiologist', 'Food', 'Fostering', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Benefit', 'Health Technology', 'Health behavior', 'Healthy Eating', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Laboratories', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Moods', 'Motion', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'National Research Service Awards', 'Nutrition Assessment', 'Nutritional', 'Obesity', 'Oral cavity', 'Outcome', 'Overweight', 'Participant', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Periodicity', 'Phase', 'Physical activity', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Specialist', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Weight', 'Weight maintenance regimen', 'Wing', 'Work', 'Wrist', 'actigraphy', 'adaptive intervention', 'base', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'career', 'clinical diagnostics', 'clinically significant', 'contextual factors', 'design', 'dietary adherence', 'digital', 'experience', 'falls', 'food consumption', 'handheld mobile device', 'improved', 'innovation', 'mHealth', 'medical schools', 'novel', 'nutrition', 'obesity treatment', 'prevent', 'real time monitoring', 'sensor', 'sensor technology', 'skills', 'sleep pattern', 'tool', 'training opportunity', 'treatment program', 'weight loss program', 'weight maintenance', 'willingness']",NHLBI,MIRIAM HOSPITAL,F32,2019,60552,0.0006672794299058954
"Mammary and milk microbiomes and metabolomes - Understanding early variation and impacts on risk for mammary inflammation and mastitis PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Exclusive breastfeeding for at least 4 mo is considered the optimal form of nutrition for most newborns, yet many women experience substantial roadblocks in meeting this goal. One of the most common reason for  lactation cessation is mastitis (inflammation of the breast). Mastitis is also a significant concern for the US dairy industry because, not only does it represent a significant challenge to animal welfare, but it also decreases milk production and is the most common reason animals are treated with antibiotics. Despite decades of research, mastitis prevention and treatment are poorly understood in both species. One reason for this is that, although mastitis has historically been attributed to the presence of bacterial pathogens in the mammary gland, this dogma is now known to be incorrect. Modern advances in the use of DNA sequencing (rather than needing to grow bacteria in culture media) have resulted in a paradigm shift in this regard such that researchers now know that all milk produced by both healthy and mastitic cows and women contains a rich community of microbes. Experts now believe that a dysbiosis in these microbes or a shift in their metabolism causes mammary  inflammation. Consequently, we must now re-examine everything we thought we knew about the etiology and risk factors for this disease. Fundamental to filling this research gap is the rigorous characterization of the  microbiome in milk produced by healthy and mastitic women and cows; and identification of microbial community  “fingerprints” and metabolomic modifiers, thereof, that alter risk of mammary inflammation. In addition,  understanding the similarities and dissimilarities in mammary inflammation between cows and women will help  researchers understand whether the former can be used as a model for the latter (and vice versa). The overall objectives for this project are to 1) compare and contrast the milk microbiome, its functionality, immune  parameters, and inflammatory markers in healthy and mastitic women and cows, and 2) identify milk microbial  profiles and their functionality related to risk for mammary inflammation. Our central hypotheses are that  1) mammary inflammation in both species is associated with shifts in microbes and their function, concentrations of selected markers of immunity and mammary inflammation, and that 2) there exist detectable milk microbiome patterns (or functions) that predispose some women and cows to increased risk of inflammation, and these patterns are related to (and perhaps modified by) environmental and behavioral parameters, some of which are currently considered risk factors for mastitis. To test these hypotheses, we will compare healthy and mastitic cows and women (case-control design) during the first 6 wk postpartum (longitudinal, repeated-measures  design during a high-risk period in both species). Importantly, we will utilize a multi-omics approach and machine learning to understand complex relationships within and between species. The results of this work will lead to better understanding of how the microbiology of the lactating mammary gland is related to mammary  inflammation and will lay the groundwork for future studies to determine how this disease can be prevented and treated. PROJECT NARRATIVE Inflammation of the mammary gland (mastitis) is the leading cause for cessation of breastfeeding, considered the optimal form of nutrition for almost all newborns worldwide, and a major animal welfare and economic  burden for the dairy industry. Mastitis has been attributed to bacterial pathogens in the mammary gland, but new evidence demonstrates that all milk (healthy and mastitic) contains a community of microbes. Understanding the bacterial community in milk, and its function, with related host immune response will lead to a reduction in the risk of inflammation in dairy cows and women, support breastfeeding, and promote optimal health in  mothers and infants.",Mammary and milk microbiomes and metabolomes - Understanding early variation and impacts on risk for mammary inflammation and mastitis,9776590,R01HD092297,"['Address', 'Affect', 'American', 'Animal Welfare', 'Animals', 'Antibiotics', 'Bacteria', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Breast', 'Breast Feeding', 'Cattle', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Culture Media', 'DNA sequencing', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Economic Burden', 'Economics', 'Etiology', 'Exclusive Breastfeeding', 'Fingerprint', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Gland', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immunity', 'Industry', 'Infant', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Lactation', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Mammary gland', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Microbe', 'Microbiology', 'Milk', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Molecular', 'Mothers', 'Newborn Infant', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Partner in relationship', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Postpartum Period', 'Prevention', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Woman', 'Work', 'bacterial community', 'case control', 'cost', 'design', 'dysbiosis', 'experience', 'high risk', 'inflammatory marker', 'inflammatory milieu', 'macromolecule', 'mastitis', 'mathematical model', 'meetings', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'microbial', 'microbial community', 'microbiome', 'milk microbiome', 'milk production', 'multiple omics', 'nutrition', 'offspring', 'pathogenic bacteria', 'prevent', 'protein metabolite', 'virtual']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF IDAHO,R01,2019,501342,0.008731928715271951
"VIP:Visual-Valid Dietary Behavior Pattern Recognition for Local-National Trials PROJECT SUMMARY  Chronic diseases and conditions such as obesity, diabetes and cardiovascular disease are among the most common, costly, and preventable of all health problems in the United States. A healthy dietary pattern is paramount in disease risk reduction. Since 2010, the dietary pattern approach has been recommended to examine the relation of the totality of diet and health outcomes by U.S. Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committees; meanwhile longitudinal dietary data have become increasingly available. Yet, methods are underdeveloped for characterizing longitudinal diet-quality variations and even rudimentary for validating diet- quality patterns that describe these dynamic variations, therefore, leading to unclear evidence for assessing diet-health/disease relationships and formulating dietary guidelines. A noticeable gap exists between dietary pattern literature and the fast-growing statistical learning field. We propose to develop an innovative statistical learning tool for diet-quality trajectory pattern-recognition based on rich and highly-comparable longitudinal dietary datasets from randomized controlled trials (RCT) and observational studies (OS) pertaining to a variety of individuals, race/ethnicities, and geographical locations, and spanning up to 30 years, collected across 4 NIH- funded RCTs in Massachusetts, and 2 large-scale multi-site national RCT and OS studies as well as simulated dietary data based on these trials. Our project builds on PI Fang’s NIH-funded behavioral trajectory pattern-recognition tool (Multiple-Imputation based Fuzzy Clustering, MIFuzzy) which processes longitudinal trial data with missing and zero-inflated values, and identifies latent trajectory patterns that characterize patients’ complex engagement and cognitive response variations during multi-component RCTs and better explains the heterogeneity of treatment effects. This project will enhance and expand MIFuzzy to a Visual- Valid Dietary Behavior Pattern Recognition tool (VIP), adapted to diet-quality trajectory pattern analyses and chronic disease risk assessment. Our goal is to provide a new multi-view of diet-quality trajectory patterns and associated outcomes from longitudinal studies. Based upon high-quality and comparable RCT and OS longitudinal dietary data from NIDDK-, NHLBI-, and NIMH-funded studies, this VIP project will help grow more valid evidence for developing dietary guidelines and clarify our understanding of diet-disease relationships for a range of patient/individual types, potentially enabling better personalized, adaptive dietary strategies. Developing this evidence-based VIP tool will also contribute to the infrastructure for diet-related studies, advance pattern- recognition methods, help scientific communities and the lay public compare with local and national diet-quality guidelines, and assess dietary health risks. In the long run, this VIP project will contribute to creating a data management platform that support near-real-time pattern analyses and adaptive interventions. PROJECT NARRATIVE / PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Evaluating diet quality and encouraging healthful dietary change is paramount for preventing, or managing, many chronic conditions and diseases, including obesity, diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Our innovative Visual-Valid Dietary Behavior Pattern-recognition (VIP) method will identify clusters of distinct diet-quality patterns in multiple longitudinal dietary datasets from local and national NIH-funded randomized controlled trials and observational studies. This work will help formulate stronger evidence for national dietary guidelines, deepen our understanding of diet quality trajectory patterns, and elucidate relationships between these patterns and chronic diseases for a range of patient/individual types; it can potentially enable personalized, adaptive dietary strategies. Open-access dissemination of our diet quality pattern recognition tool will contribute to the infrastructure of dietary-intervention studies, advance pattern recognition methodology, and help the scientific community and the public to compare individual dietary behaviors with local and national diet-quality patterns and associated health risks.",VIP:Visual-Valid Dietary Behavior Pattern Recognition for Local-National Trials,9907572,R56DK114514,"['Address', 'Advisory Committees', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults Study', 'Data', 'Data Quality', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diet', 'Dietary Intervention', 'Dietary Practices', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Eating', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Funding', 'General Population', 'Geographic Locations', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Imagery', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Intervention Studies', 'Literature', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Longitudinal observational study', 'Machine Learning', 'Massachusetts', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Nutrient', 'Obesity', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Physical activity', 'Process', 'Psychological Factors', 'Race', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Research Design', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Reduction', 'Site', 'Software Tools', 'Subgroup', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Visual', 'Visual Pattern Recognition', 'Women&apos', 's Health', 'Work', 'adaptive intervention', 'base', 'cohort', 'cost', 'data management', 'depressive symptoms', 'design', 'dietary guidelines', 'disorder risk', 'evidence base', 'field study', 'good diet', 'indexing', 'individual patient', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'longitudinal dataset', 'outcome prediction', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'simulation', 'social media', 'sociodemographics', 'tool', 'treatment effect', 'user-friendly']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF MASSACHUSETTS DARTMOUTH,R56,2019,452178,-0.03742441159565911
"Concussion and Driving Skills in the Young Driver PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Research Objectives. This prospective cohort study rigorously examines the neurocognitive impact of concussion on simulated and real-world driving performance among young drivers aged 16-24 years. Importance. Concussion impairs cognitive processing speed, attention, concentration and integration – skills which are also important for safe driving. Unlike new “Return to Learn” guidelines, there are no evidence-based “Return to Drive” guidelines for when individuals with concussion may be safe to return to driving. Objectives. Conduct a prospective matched cohort study to explore the risk of concussion in simulated and real-world driving conditions. We propose three specific aims and a fourth exploratory aim:  (i) Examine whether concussion negatively impacts simulated driving performance among young  drivers, relative to a cohort of young drivers without concussion.  (ii) Determine whether simulated driving task performance correlates with recovery from  concussion symptoms and signs in the month following concussion, relative to young drivers  without recent concussion.  (iii) Measure the impact of concussion and recovery on real-world driving exposure and performance.  (iv) [Exploratory] Examine whether concussion symptoms and neuropsychometric impairment are  associated with higher rates of driving citations or reported crashes. Study design. Prospective controlled matched cohort study. Setting/participants. 50 drivers with recent concussion; 50 age/gender matched controls aged 16-25 years. Study protocol. Concussion participants will be recruited within two weeks of concussion. Case and control participants will complete 1) driving risk survey; 2) neuropsychological testing an 3) simulated driving tasks at baseline and 1 month. Commercially available monitoring technology will record risky driving for 3 months Outcome measures. (i) simulated driving risk scores; (ii) real world driving risk scores (rapid braking, rapid acceleration, speeding); (iii) reported citations and crash rates. Impact. This study will have a significant population health impact in elucidating the neurocognitive sequelae of recent concussion on driving. Results will inform return to safe driving among young drivers with concussion.

"Effects of Functional Food Diets on Cardiometabolic and Metabolomics Profiles in Minority Youth PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT This proposal outlines a career development plan to help Dr. Jaapna Dhillon complete her postdoctoral training and establish an independent research program focused on personalized dietary interventions to reduce cardiometabolic risk in minority populations. Her training will be conducted in a multidisciplinary group of scientists with research expertise in nutrition science, health disparities, molecular cell biology, metabolomics and computational biology. Her advisory team will provide an outstanding training environment that will allow her to fill critical gaps in her toolkit needed to use an integrative and personalized approach to nutrition. This award will enhance her knowledge in developing culturally sensitive nutrition interventions and cardiovascular physiology, and provide advanced training in metabolomics and computational biology. During the training phase of this award, she will strengthen her scholarly activities, establish important collaborations, and acquire critical data that will ensure her successful transition to independence. Rational: The incidence of diet-related cardiometabolic disorders is increasing at an alarming rate in racial/ethnic minority groups such as Asians and Hispanics, and are much higher than Non-Hispanic Whites in the United States. [8]. However, whether improvements in diet quality will influence minority groups at high risk of cardiometabolic diseases differentially than Whites at high risk is not well understood. Functional foods such as nuts, whole grains and vegetables can help ameliorate cardiovascular disease and reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes. However, most studies on functional foods and health have been overwhelmingly performed in middle-aged to older non-Hispanic White adults, with young minority populations being greatly neglected. Adapting a functional food diet at earlier life stages may prevent or ameliorate metabolic disorders later in life in minority populations that are at greater risk for developing chronic metabolic diseases. Our central hypothesis is that adapting a personalized functional food diet at earlier life stages will have greater beneficial effects on carbohydrate and lipid regulation pathways in minority youth at risk for developing cardiometabolic disorders compared to White youth at risk. Design: The mentored phase study will 1) examine the effects of almonds on blood glucose regulation pathways using metabolomics techniques and 2) provide preliminary data for the development and testing of a model that can predict effects of almonds on metabolic consequences in minority youth. The independent phase study will evaluate the long term effects of a personalized diet rich in functional foods on pathways of carbohydrate and lipid regulation in relation to the gut microbiome and cardiovascular outcomes in minority youth at high risk for cardiometabolic disorders. Relevance: The proposed studies will provide an initial evidence base for the health benefits of personalized functional food interventions in minority youth. This innovative dietary strategy may be more effective at reducing risk and ameliorating diet-related cardiometabolic disorders than conventional dietary advice in this population.

"Metabolomics and risk of Parkinson's Disease ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Parkinson disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease in the United States and affects over one million Americans; this number is growing due to population aging. Current treatments do not prevent the disease progression that ultimately results in severe disability. There is thus a compelling need to develop neuroprotective treatments. Because at the time of the clinical diagnosis of PD there is already substantial neuronal loss, such treatments should ideally be initiated earlier. Aims of the proposed investigation are to implement and validate a novel metabolomic approach for the identification of early changes in peripheral blood of individuals with preclinical or premotor PD. The metabolomic results will be integrated with detailed and validated information on risk factors for PD, which has been collected prospectively and periodically updated. We expect by this means to identify new clues to the etiology of PD and to identify a metabolomic signature of PD that could contribute to an early diagnosis. To achieve these goals, we will take advantage of data and blood samples collected from over 80,000 participants in three large ongoing cohorts, the Nurses' Health Study (NHS), the Health Professional Follow-up Study (HPFS), and the Cancer Prevention Study-II Nutrition, who have been followed for over 25 years for incident Parkinson disease. We expect to include a total of 805 incident cases of PD that will be matched to 805 controls, using a nested case-control design.

"Biological Mechanisms of Mindfulness Training for Health PROJECT SUMMARY Nearly 10% of Americans practice meditation to improve health. Randomized controlled trials support this practice and show that mindfulness training is effective in improving a broad range of health outcomes. In particular, mindfulness training has been shown to reduce biomarkers of systemic inflammation that contribute to the pathophysiology of disease and predict risk for all-cause mortality. Still, little is known about the biological processes linking mindfulness training with inflammation. This proposal tests the hypothesis that mindfulness training aids the regulation of inflammation by mitigating glucocorticoid resistance (GCR). GCR is a leading candidate mechanism linking psychosocial threat with systemic inflammation. Whereas cortisol released in response to threat normally binds to glucocorticoid receptors and down-regulates inflammation, chronic perceptions of threat lead to a state of GCR, in which glucocorticoid receptors become insensitive to the anti-inflammatory effects of circulating cortisol. Mindfulness training is proposed to diminish perceptions of threat in ways that restore glucocorticoid receptor sensitivity. To test this biological pathway, this study assesses functional GCR and biomarkers of inflammation before and after a Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) or control Health Enhancement Program (HEP) in a sample of lonely older adults (N=188). Loneliness is a form of chronic psychosocial threat, and is consistently associated with GCR and systemic inflammation, yet MBSR is one of very few interventions successful in reducing loneliness. MBSR is expected to decrease GCR (and restore glucocorticoid receptor sensitivity) compared to HEP from pre- to post- intervention. Moreover, these decreases in GCR are expected to mediate the effects of MBSR (vs. HEP) on lowering systemic inflammation (CRP and IL-6) from pre-intervention to 3-month follow-up. In sum, this proposal investigates decreased GCR as a biological mechanism through which mindfulness training reduces inflammatory disease risk. It addresses NCCIH's call for research on understanding the biological mechanisms of action underlying mind-body intervention approaches and complements NCCIH's special interest in alleviating inflammatory processes. The knowledge gained from this research will contribute to a better understanding of the basic biological pathways underlying mindfulness practices, which may help to identify and target populations likely to benefit from mindfulness training. The research and training plan described in this application provide opportunities for the applicant to develop a knowledge base and methodology in psychoneuroimmunology, learn statistical techniques for analyzing complex mechanistic pathways, and develop the professional skills necessary for a successful career testing biological and psychological mechanisms underlying mind-body interventions. PROJECT NARRATIVE Mindfulness meditation practices are widely used to alleviate physical symptoms, and growing evidence suggests that mindfulness training may reduce systemic inflammation, but less is known about the biological pathways linking mindfulness training with inflammatory processes. The proposed project investigates a biological mechanism, glucocorticoid sensitivity, to explain how mindfulness training lowers inflammation among lonely older adults who are at risk for multiple inflammatory diseases. From a public health perspective, clarifying this mechanistic pathway will help to identify who is likely to show health benefits from mindfulness training.",Biological Mechanisms of Mindfulness Training for Health,9688917,F32AT009508,"['Address', 'Adult', 'American', 'Antiinflammatory Effect', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Process', 'Biological Testing', 'Blood Circulation', 'Breast Cancer survivor', 'Cells', 'Chronic', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Dexamethasone', 'Disease', 'Distress', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Elderly', 'Feeling', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Glucocorticoid Receptor', 'Glucocorticoids', 'Health', 'Health Benefit', 'Hydrocortisone', 'Immune', 'Immunology procedure', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Interleukin-6', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Loneliness', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Meditation', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Methodology', 'Mind-Body Intervention', 'Mindfulness Training', 'National Research Service Awards', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Perception', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Process', 'Psychoneuroimmunology', 'Public Health', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Receptor Gene', 'Receptor Signaling', 'Regulation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Training', 'Resistance', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Standardization', 'Stress', 'Sum', 'Symptoms', 'Target Populations', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Work', 'cardiometabolism', 'career', 'cost', 'disorder risk', 'efficacy trial', 'epidemiology study', 'experience', 'falls', 'feasibility trial', 'follow-up', 'health training', 'hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis', 'improved', 'inflammatory marker', 'interest', 'knowledge base', 'mindfulness', 'mindfulness intervention', 'mindfulness meditation', 'mindfulness-based stress reduction', 'mortality', 'physical conditioning', 'physical symptom', 'post intervention', 'programs', 'psychologic', 'psychosocial', 'receptor function', 'receptor sensitivity', 'recruit', 'response', 'skills', 'social', 'successful intervention', 'training aid', 'training opportunity']",NCCIH,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,F32,2019,66110,-0.022369377048745337
"Development of Mucosal and Systemic Immunity and Risk of Food Allergy The microbiome plays a critical role in the development of the immune system and alterations in the microbiome diversity almost certainly play an important role in the surge of allergic and autoimmune diseases in developed nations that began in the 1950's and continues today. Living on farms, avoiding antibiotics, vaginal delivery, and other environmental factors leading to greater diversity in the microbiome have been associated with a major reduction in the risk of atopic diseases. Understanding the development of the immune system in populations at low risk for allergy compared to high-risk populations, developing biomarkers for “protective” immune development, and assessing immune responses to the microbiome are fundamental for designing and assessing future interventions. In this proposal, we will compare the Old Order Mennonites (OOM) with a very low risk for food allergies (<1%), other allergic diseases and asthma and a lifestyle associated with a diverse microbiome (e.g. growing up on a farm, consumption of raw milk, large families, home deliveries, low rate of antibiotic use), and neonates born to families with food-allergic children with a very high risk for developing atopic diseases, e.g. a 15-20% risk of food allergy in the first year of life. We hypothesize that accelerated development of IgA mucosal immunity will be a biomarker for “protective” immune development. Abundant IgA-coated fecal bacteria are seen in early life and data from animal models indicate the importance of microbial diversity in the induction of this secretory IgA. Early studies suggest that the predisposition to the development of IgE antibodies (“atopy”) is associated with a slow development of IgA responses, e.g. our own data shows a delay in development of specific IgA in cow's milk-allergic infants. Exciting new discoveries further support the role for specific IgA come from trials of orally induced tolerance in established food allergy. Because there is an intimate reciprocal development of gut microbial communities with the IgA repertoire, we hypothesize that mucosal exposure to a diverse and immunogenic microbiome accelerates the development of IgA secretory immunity, counteracts development of IgE responses, and protects from allergic diseases.  We will assess how B cell subsets, immunoglobulin repertoire and somatic mutation rates (Aim 1), and gut microbiome and IgA antibody responses to microbiome develop in cohorts of high- and low-risk for allergy (Aim 2), and how these B cell biomarkers and gut microbiome relate to the development of food and other allergic diseases and humoral responses to allergens (Aim 3). In summary, this proposal will determine whether accelerated development of IgA responses is a biomarker for “protective” immune development, identify fecal bacteria inducing IgA responses, and assess the association of specific IgA immune responses with clinical tolerance, i.e. protection from early-onset food allergy and eczema. NARRATIVE The microbiome plays a critical role in the development of the immune system, and alterations in the microbiome diversity almost certainly play an important role in the surge of allergic and autoimmune diseases in developed nations. A major gap is our understanding of how the microbiome prevents allergic diseases. In this proposal, we will evaluate the development of infant immune system in populations at high risk and those at low risk for food allergy and other allergic diseases. The Old Order Mennonites (OOM) have a very low risk for allergic diseases and asthma and a lifestyle associated with a diverse microbiome; high-risk population includes families with food allergic children. These studies of immune system development in a population “protected” from allergic diseases will provide critical new knowledge about the development of the mucosal and systemic immunity, and lay the groundwork for future studies of prevention of allergic diseases in childhood.",Development of Mucosal and Systemic Immunity and Risk of Food Allergy,9675217,U01AI131344,"['16S ribosomal RNA sequencing', 'Age-Months', 'Allergens', 'Allergic', 'Allergic Disease', 'Allergy to peanuts', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Antibiotics', 'Antibodies', 'Antibody Response', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'B-Cell Development', 'B-Lymphocyte Subsets', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Bacteria', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth', 'Cattle', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Childhood Asthma', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cohort Studies', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Defect', 'Developed Countries', 'Developing Countries', 'Development', 'Diet', 'Disease', 'Eczema', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Exhibits', 'Exposure to', 'Extrinsic asthma', 'Family', 'Farming environment', 'Feces', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Food', 'Food Hypersensitivity', 'Future', 'Genomics', 'Germ-Free', 'Home environment', 'Hypersensitivity', 'IgE', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immune system', 'Immunity', 'Immunoglobulin A', 'Immunoglobulin Class Switching', 'Immunoglobulin G', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region', 'Immunoglobulins', 'Immunology', 'Infant', 'Infant Development', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Life Style', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Memory B-Lymphocyte', 'Mennonite', 'Milk', 'Mucosal Immunity', 'Mucous Membrane', 'Neonatal', 'Oral', 'Outcome', 'Plasma Cells', 'Play', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Prevention', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Saliva', 'Secretory Immunoglobulin A', 'Serum', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Sorting - Cell Movement', 'Systems Development', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Training', 'Transcript', 'Umbilical Cord Blood', 'Vaginal delivery procedure', 'animal data', 'atopy', 'base', 'cohort', 'design', 'early onset', 'food allergen', 'gut microbiome', 'gut microbiota', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'immunogenic', 'immunogenicity', 'infancy', 'microbial', 'microbiome', 'microorganism antigen', 'mucosal site', 'neonate', 'peripheral blood', 'postnatal', 'prevent', 'response']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF ROCHESTER,U01,2019,452545,-0.016838160468538928
"Impact of Cognition on Balance and Gait Markers for FXTAS Abstract:  The primary objective of this K01 application is to provide research training and mentorship to the candidate to enable her to become an independent medical rehabilitation researcher. The candidate has clinical experience in Physical Therapy and doctoral training in basic neurobiology and is transitioning to a new clinical research area investigating balance and gait in a neurodegenerative disorder called Fragile X Tremor and Ataxia Syndrome (FXTAS) which occurs in some premutation (PM) carriers of the Fragile X (FMR1) gene. The short term goals are to develop an early detection model for FXTAS and identify additional molecular risk factors for developing this disorder. The plan has 3 aims: 1) To identify quantitative markers of balance and gait impairments in PM carriers with and without FXTAS, 2) To determine the impact of executive function and cognitive interference on balance and gait function in PM carriers with and without FXTAS, and 3) to determine the relationship between age, sex, executive function, and FMR1 molecular variables and the presence and severity of balance and gait impairment in PM carriers with and without FXTAS. The candidate’s long term scientific goal is to become a leading independent research scientist in movement neuroscience and neurological disorders and in the precise identification of balance and gait dysfunction in FXTAS from the earliest stage. In order to reach these goals the candidate needs to develop expertise in patient outcomes and neuroepidemiology research. The candidate’s short term goals which form the basis for this five year K development plan include training in 1) large scale subject recruitment, data management and advanced biostatistics, 2) balance and gait analysis and application to clinical trials in movement disorders, 3) design, implementation and analysis of large scale epidemiological studies and 4) introduction to rehabilitation intervention and clinical trial research methodology. Results of this research will help clarify neurological mechanisms underlying balance and gait deficits in FXTAS, establish reliable and quantitative outcomes measures of motor impairment, and provide data for future clinical rehabilitation trials. This research will be the first step in characterizing the longitudinal history of motor dysfunction in FXTAS from its earliest stages, thus paving the way for establishing disease monitoring and modifying strategies in premutation carriers. This proposal is relevant to the NIH Research Plan on FXS and Associated Disorders which includes the following goals: 2.2 validation of quantitative instruments to detect early clinical signs of FXTAS and its progression, 2.3 identification of molecular and clinical risk factors in individuals associated with penetrance of FXTAS, and 2.5 defining genotype, including FMR1 molecular factors, and clinical phenotype relationships in FXTAS. Over one million people in the US carry a premutation expansion in the Fragile X gene. A significant portion of these individuals will experience debilitating symptoms of a neurodegenerative disorder known as fragile X- associated tremor ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) including balance deficits, falls and progressive disability. This proposal addresses a critical need to identify early indicators of FXTAS onset in order to provide earlier intervention, including preventative and rehabilitative treatments, to delay disease progression, reduce the morbidity associated with falls and functional disability, and improve quality of life. This research will also provide quantitative outcome measures that may be used in future clinical trials.",Impact of Cognition on Balance and Gait Markers for FXTAS,9722280,K01HD088762,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alleles', 'Area', 'Biometry', 'CGG repeat', 'CGG repeat expansion', 'Cerebellar Ataxia', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Counseling', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Defect', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Elderly', 'Equilibrium', 'Executive Dysfunction', 'FXTAS', 'Family', 'Fragile X Gene', 'Fragile X Syndrome', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Gait', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Trial', 'Length', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Mental Retardation', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Movement Disorders', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neuroepidemiology', 'Neurologic', 'Neurosciences', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Penetrance', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Physical therapy', 'Posture', 'Predictive Factor', 'Quality of life', 'Recording of previous events', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk Marker', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Severities', 'Statistical Models', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Tremor', 'Tremor/Ataxia Syndrome', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Walking', 'Woman', 'X Chromosome', 'base', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinical risk', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive task', 'computerized', 'data management', 'design', 'disability', 'disabling symptom', 'epidemiology study', 'executive function', 'experience', 'falls', 'functional disability', 'gait examination', 'improved', 'instrument', 'male', 'men', 'motor disorder', 'motor impairment', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'recruit', 'sensor', 'sex']",NICHD,RUSH UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,K01,2019,129089,0.010003034491225846
"The Gut Microbiome in Parkinson Disease Project Summary/Abstract This is a first R01 application from an early stage, new investigator and current NIEHS K01 awardee. Parkinson disease (PD) is a disabling neurodegenerative disease for which there is no cure. Years before the diagnosis of PD and the onset of motor symptoms, PD patients develop non-motor symptoms, including, importantly, constipation and gastrointestinal dysfunction. Constipation affects over 80% of PD patients and is one of the strongest risk factors for PD. Recent research shows that the enteric nervous system in the gut and the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus nerve which anatomically links the GI system to the brain, are among the first and most severely affected by alpha-synuclein pathology characteristic of PD5 leading to the hypothesis that the gastrointestinal tract might be the site of initiation of PD. We propose to conduct a comprehensive investigation of the relation between human gut microbiome and PD, focusing on the pre- onset microbiome. We will do this by building on an ongoing Department of Defense funded project that has identified participants with pre-parkinson syndrome (PPS - defined as the co- occurrence of constipation, pRBD (probable rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder) and hyposmia) that in a pilot study has been associated with a ~200 fold increase in PD risk. Studying the microbiome among this group, who are highly likely to develop PD or are already in the premotor state, will give us a unique look at the microbiome in PD patients prior to any potential disease-associated effects of changes in diet and lifestyle that may have confounded prior case-control studies. The proposed study will take advantage of 25 years of prospectively collected data on environmental and dietary exposures and disease outcomes in two prospective cohorts of men and women. Project Narrative Our appreciation of the impact of the gut microbiome on brain health, and especially PD, is in the early stages. This study will be the first to examine the gut microbiome in participants with premotor PD and compare it to healthy controls, controls with constipation and to recently onset PD cases. This project will thus advance our understanding of how the human gut microbiome contributes to the pathophysiology of PD and will contribute to the development of tools needed for a preclinical diagnosis and/or treatment.",The Gut Microbiome in Parkinson Disease,9606513,R01NS097723,"['Affect', 'Anatomy', 'Anti-inflammatory', 'Bacteria', 'Biometry', 'Blood - brain barrier anatomy', 'Brain', 'Butyrates', 'Caffeine', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic Disease', 'Confounding Factors (Epidemiology)', 'Constipation', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Department of Defense', 'Diagnosis', 'Diet', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Enteric Nervous System', 'Enterobacteriaceae', 'Epidemiology', 'Exhibits', 'Feces', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Gait', 'Gastrointestinal tract structure', 'Genes', 'Health Professional', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Inflammatory', 'Inflammatory disease of the intestine', 'Intestines', 'Investigation', 'Life Style', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Metabolic', 'Mucous Membrane', 'National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences', 'Nature', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Nurses&apos', ' Health Study', 'Onset of illness', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Parkinsonian Disorders', 'Participant', 'Pathology', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Permeability', 'Pilot Projects', 'Production', 'Prospective cohort', 'Prospective cohort study', 'Proteobacteria', 'REM Sleep Behavior Disorder', 'Ralstonia', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Site', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Update', 'Vagus nerve structure', 'Volatile Fatty Acids', 'Woman', 'alpha synuclein', 'brain health', 'cigarette smoking', 'cohort', 'disorder risk', 'dorsal motor nucleus', 'dysbiosis', 'follow-up', 'gastrointestinal', 'gut bacteria', 'gut microbiome', 'gut microbiota', 'hyposmia', 'illness length', 'men', 'microbiome', 'microbiome analysis', 'microbiome composition', 'microbiome research', 'microbiota profiles', 'motor symptom', 'non-motor symptom', 'posture instability', 'pre-clinical', 'predictive signature', 'prospective', 'stool sample', 'tool development']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF MASSACHUSETTS LOWELL,R01,2019,422761,-0.003318669100775583
"The initial care of younger adults with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes PROJECT SUMMARY Dr. Anjali Gopalan, MD, MSHP is a board-certified Internist at the Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC) Oakland Medical Center and a Research Scientist I (equivalent to Assistant Professor) at the KPNC Division of Research (DOR). With the proposed K23 mentored career development award, Dr. Gopalan will gain the advanced training and expertise necessary to become an independent investigator who can develop and implement tailored interventions for patients with early-onset type 2 diabetes (EOT2D). By focusing on adults with EOT2D, she seeks to address the comparatively poor micro- and macrovascular outcomes in this population that may result partly from inadequate management of hyperglycemia and other cardiovascular disease risk factors. Dr. Gopalan’s research premise posits that it is particularly critical for newly diagnosed patients with EOT2D to achieve early disease control, since tighter glycemic control during the year following diagnosis confers long-lasting micro- and macrovascular benefits. In support of the premise, the Research Aims of this K23 are to: 1) use electronic health record [EHR] data to identify EOT2D patient subgroups at highest risk of inadequate early disease control, 2) identify barriers to and facilitators of initial EOT2D management, and 3) examine prospective associations between patient-reported factors (e.g., disease-related distress, health literacy) and inadequate early disease control. The proposed research will be supported by experienced mentors and advisors, as well as advanced training in the following areas: 1) the use of advanced statistical modeling, 2) qualitative data analysis to inform intervention development, 3) the role of social determinants in health, and 4) implementation science. KPNC and DOR are ideal environments for the proposed work. KPNC is an integrated learning healthcare delivery system with a diverse membership of 4.2 million people (>350,000 with diabetes). DOR has a long track record of effectively training early stage investigators and has well-established internal research programs and collaborative relationships with nearby institutions that provide the infrastructure needed for career development. This environment, along with the proposed Research and Training Plans and an outstanding mentorship team, will enable Dr. Gopalan to continue to build the skills and generate the foundational data needed to submit an R01-level proposal during the final years of the proposed award period. In this planned R01, Dr. Gopalan will refine and implement an intervention (with a design based on the results of the three K23 Research Aims) to improve early care for newly diagnosed EOT2D patients and evaluate its impact on early outcomes in this growing, high-risk population. In summary, the proposed K23 award will support the career development of Dr. Gopalan and is vital to her acquiring the skill set and expertise required to become a successful, independent investigator. PROJECT NARRATIVE Adults diagnosed with type 2 diabetes at a younger age have higher rates of complications than those diagnosed later in life. Given the lasting benefit conferred by early disease control, the initial care provided to this growing, high-risk population is particularly crucial. With this proposed career development award, Dr. Gopalan will acquire the research skills necessary to identify patients at highest risk for inadequate early disease control, define barriers to initial disease management, and develop an intervention designed to improve the care of adults (ages 21-44) with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes.",The initial care of younger adults with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes,9785527,K23DK116968,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Area', 'Award', 'California', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Complications of Diabetes Mellitus', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Reporting', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Distress', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Face', 'Familiarity', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Sciences', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hyperglycemia', 'Hyperlipidemia', 'Hypertension', 'Infrastructure', 'Institution', 'Integrated Health Care Systems', 'Internist', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Latino', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical center', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pharmacy facility', 'Population', 'Population Characteristics', 'Provider', 'Qualitative Research', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Resources', 'Retrospective cohort', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk Management', 'Risk Reduction', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Smoke', 'Statistical Models', 'Stress', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Trees', 'United Kingdom', 'Work', 'barrier to care', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'career', 'career development', 'cohort', 'comparative', 'design', 'diabetes education', 'diabetes management', 'disorder control', 'eHealth', 'early onset', 'ethnic diversity', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'glycemic control', 'health care delivery', 'health literacy', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'implementation science', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'individual patient', 'insight', 'literacy', 'macrovascular disease', 'member', 'older patient', 'patient population', 'patient subsets', 'professor', 'programs', 'prospective', 'protective effect', 'racial and ethnic', 'skills', 'social stigma', 'therapy design', 'therapy development', 'young adult']",NIDDK,KAISER FOUNDATION RESEARCH INSTITUTE,K23,2019,192917,-0.0052235697346386814
"Digital Phenotyping for Computational Models of Relapse Prediction in Early Course Psychosis Project Summary  The candidate requests support for a four-year program of training and research to better understand how smartphone based digital phenotyping and computational methods can predict relapse and create digital phenotypes of symptoms and clinical outcomes in early course psychosis.  In the proposed training plan, the candidate will build upon his previous experiences in engineering, clinical informatics, and clinical psychiatry to perform a multidisciplinary project at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. His training plan includes training in: 1) statistical methods for multivariate longitudinal analysis and predictive inference 2) the neuropsychiatric assessment of schizophrenia 3) longitudinal clinical research methodology with a focus on mobile technologies, and 4) the responsible conduct of research.  Even with appropriate care, relapse is common in early course psychosis and each episode is associated higher costs of care, poorer lifetime outcomes, and chronicity of the disease. There is a need to learn more about the personal factors associated with relapse for individual patients in order to improve risk predictions, ensure appropriate early interventions, and support coordinated specialty care services for schizophrenia. This study proposes that smartphones sensors eg (GPS, accelerometer), wearable devices like smartwatches collecting physiology, and smartphone based surveys and cognitive tests, when combined with appropriate statistical methods, can capture digital biomarkers, refereed to here as digital phenotypes, of early course psychosis that can offer personalized relapse prediction and augment population level risk factors.  This candidate's research plan seeks to: 1) propose digital phenotypes and relapse models of early course psychosis captured in an affordable and scalable manner from subject's personal smartphones as well as a wearable sensor in order to automatically collect self-report of symptoms, behaviors, cognition, and physiology 2) and evaluate the accuracy of digital phenotypes and the relapse prediction models.  This study proposes to address this hypothesis by utilizing smartphone based digital phenotyping methods, primarily through running the Beiwe app on subjects' own smartphones, to capture longitudinal data on symptoms, behaviors, cognition, and physiology across subjects' natural environments. These studies will be performed across 3.5 years in subjects with early course psychosis and range between 6 to 12 months.  The broader aim of this research is to understand the systems and processes, both personal and environmental, which contribute to relapse in early course psychosis. An understanding of the computational basis of relapse will inform better nosology, allow development of biomarkers of illness that may offer better targets for biological research, inform development of personalized interventions for psychotic illnesses, and help support early interventions for schizophrenia. Schizophrenia is a chronic and disabling disorder that is characterized by episodes of relapse, and  is thought to impact ~1.5% of the population.  Our current treatments and ability to predict  relapse early are limited by our understanding of the longitudinal course, environmental factors,  and variability of clinical presentation. This study seeks to model this complexity using  computational methods and digital phenotyping so that we may design more effective early  interventions for this disease.",Digital Phenotyping for Computational Models of Relapse Prediction in Early Course Psychosis,9676982,K23MH116130,"['Accelerometer', 'Address', 'Anxiety', 'Award', 'Awareness', 'Back', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Caregiver Burden', 'Caring', 'Cellular Phone', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Effectiveness', 'Emergency department visit', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Event', 'Feedback', 'Goals', 'Health Sciences', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Hospitalization', 'Human', 'Impaired cognition', 'In Situ', 'Individual', 'Interview', 'Israel', 'Learning', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical center', 'Medicine', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Moods', 'Nature', 'Outcome', 'Ownership', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Physical activity', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Process', 'Productivity', 'Prospective Studies', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Quality of life', 'Relapse', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Running', 'Schizophrenia', 'Science', 'Severity of illness', 'Sleep', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Treatment Cost', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'biological research', 'biomarker development', 'care costs', 'care systems', 'clinical heterogeneity', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinically relevant', 'cognitive testing', 'computational basis', 'cost effective', 'data modeling', 'design', 'digital', 'disease classification', 'economic cost', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'fitbit', 'functional disability', 'functional outcomes', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'individual patient', 'learning strategy', 'longitudinal analysis', 'longitudinal course', 'mHealth', 'medical specialties', 'mobile computing', 'multidisciplinary', 'neural circuit', 'neuropsychiatry', 'neurotoxic', 'open source', 'personalized intervention', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'primary outcome', 'relapse prediction', 'relapse risk', 'responsible research conduct', 'secondary outcome', 'sensor', 'severe mental illness', 'smart watch', 'social', 'tool', 'wearable device']",NIMH,BETH ISRAEL DEACONESS MEDICAL CENTER,K23,2019,190676,0.015842669544742317
"Chronic Inflammation and Type 2 Diabetes: A Multi-omics Approach ABSTRACT The etiology of type 2 diabetes (T2D) likely involves a complex interaction of polygenic, metabolic, and environmental factors including diet. Accumulating experimental, epidemiological, and clinical evidence supports a pathogenic role of chronic inflammation in T2D development. However, the precise mechanisms underlying these findings are largely unknown, and current evidence on the causal relationships between specific inflammatory pathways and T2D risk is inconclusive. Advances in omics technologies have led to the identification of genes and metabolites associated with T2D risk, but data on mechanisms and causality are still very limited. Multi-omics integration in the framework of systems epidemiology may provide new avenues to enhance our understanding of disease mechanisms. To systematically investigate the relation between chronic inflammation and T2D, I propose to examine 3 Specific Aims by leveraging the rich resources in the UK Biobank, Nurses’ Health Studies (NHS), Health Professional Follow-up Study (HPFS), Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos (SOL), and Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx). In Aim 1 [K99], I will integrate existing genomic data from the UK Biobank, NHS/HPFS, SOL, and transcriptomic data in the GTEx to examine shared genetic architectures between systemic inflammatory markers and T2D and whether polygenic susceptibility to chronic inflammation confers T2D risk. Meanwhile, I will receive extensive training in T2D systems biology and cutting-edge high-dimensional data analytics and bioinformatics. In Aim 2 [R00], I will integrate dietary and metabolomic data to examine metabolomic profiles mediating the association between dietary inflammatory potentials and T2D risk in the prospective NHS/HPFS and the SOL. In Aim 3 [R00], I will conduct plasma proteomic profiling in a nested case-control study within the NHS to identify inflammatory protein networks in relation to T2D risk, and as a Secondary Aim, integrate findings from Aim 1-3 to explore T2D-related pathways co-regulating at multiple biological dimensions. Findings from this project may improve the understanding of inflammatory mechanisms underlying T2D and identify novel targets/pathways suitable for early detection and prevention. I will be mentored/advised by an interdisciplinary team that includes Dr. JoAnn Manson (diabetes epidemiologist), Dr. Liming Liang (expert in statistical omics methodologies), Dr. Frank Hu (nutritional epidemiologist), Dr. Peter Kraft, (statistical geneticist), Dr. Qibin Qi (genetic epidemiologist), Dr. Towia Libermann (expert in proteomics), and Dr. Clary Clish (expert in metabolomics). The outstanding training opportunities with key leaders in these areas will provide me advanced knowledge and skills, positioning me for a successful, independent career as a diabetes epidemiologist with expertise in systems biology and integrated-omics. This project aligns with the NIDDK’s goal of integrating multi-omics technologies into diabetes research. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project seeks to systematically examine the relationship between chronic inflammation and type 2 diabetes (T2D) by incorporating multi-omics data from several large prospective cohort studies. The proposed research will yield novel evidence on the biological mechanisms underlying the relationship between chronic inflammation and T2D risk. Novel pathways, and specific genes, proteins, and metabolites identified in this research will serve as the critical first steps for future development of biomarkers and therapeutic targets for T2D prevention and treatment.",Chronic Inflammation and Type 2 Diabetes: A Multi-omics Approach,9805982,K99DK122128,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Applications Grants', 'Area', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'C-reactive protein', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diabetes prevention', 'Diet', 'Dietary Assessment', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemiologist', 'Epidemiology', 'Etiology', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Food', 'Future', 'Gene Proteins', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genomics', 'Genotype-Tissue Expression Project', 'Goals', 'Health Professional', 'Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos', 'IL6 gene', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Intake', 'Interleukin-6', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Knowledge', 'Limes', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Mentors', 'Metabolic', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Multiomic Data', 'National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases', 'Nested Case-Control Study', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Nurses&apos', ' Health Study', 'Nutritional', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Pilot Projects', 'Plasma', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predisposition', 'Prevention', 'Prospective cohort study', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Proteomics', 'Public Health', 'Qi', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Retinal Diseases', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Study of Latinos', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'TNFRSF1A gene', 'Technology', 'Training', 'White Blood Cell Count procedure', 'Work', 'adiponectin', 'base', 'biobank', 'biomarker development', 'cardiometabolism', 'career', 'case control', 'cohort', 'cytokine', 'diabetes risk', 'disorder prevention', 'genetic architecture', 'genomic data', 'high dimensionality', 'i(19)', 'improved', 'indexing', 'inflammatory marker', 'innovation', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'mortality', 'multidimensional data', 'multiple omics', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'prospective', 'protein metabolite', 'response', 'skills', 'therapeutic target', 'training opportunity', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptomics', 'whole genome']",NIDDK,HARVARD SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH,K99,2019,91499,0.001576935577032361
"Combining Systems Pharmacology Modeling With Machine Learning To Identify Sub-Populations At Risk Of Drug-Induced Torsades de Pointes No abstract available Project Narrative Current standards for identifying patients at risk of forming the rare but lethal ventricular tachycardia, Drug- induced Torsades de Pointes include measuring the QT interval on the electrocardiogram (ECG). Although this decently predicts susceptibility, there remains a percentage of patients who still succumb to an arrhythmia with a normal QT. To improve patient risk stratification, this research project aims to develop an algorithm that can unmask subtle precursors at both the physiological and clinical levels, classify high risk patients, and upgrade the current imperfect standards for prescribing these therapies.",Combining Systems Pharmacology Modeling With Machine Learning To Identify Sub-Populations At Risk Of Drug-Induced Torsades de Pointes,9835668,F31HL149358,[' '],NHLBI,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,F31,2019,43416,0.007994925420435109
"Advanced Risk Adjusters and Predictive Formulas for ICD-10 Based Risk Adjustment Diagnosis-based risk adjustment is widely used in the US and abroad for health plan payment, notably for Medicare Parts C and D, for commercial contracting and quality assessment, and in numerous state Medicaid programs. Yet the risk adjustment technology used for payments has not kept up with improved classification systems, larger patient datasets, improved estimation algorithms or recent theoretical and clinical developments. Our work will take advantage of the richer ICD-10-CM classification system, in use since October 2015, with over 5 times as many diagnoses as ICD-9-CM Codes. ICD-10 codes now recognize: left vs. right side for thousands of conditions, distinguish between initial, subsequent and sequela diagnoses, and incorporate hundreds of new clinical, demographic and biometric variables. Based on the ICD-10, more exact models can leverage increased diagnostic coding accuracy to reduce opportunities for gaming or discriminating against patients with conditions who are predicted to be unprofitable. Led by two of the three developers of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Hierarchical Condition Category (CMS-HCC) existing classification system, our team of physicians, public policy experts, statisticians and economists will comprehensively improve the accuracy of risk adjustment and predictive models using larger sample sizes, clinical judgment and state-of-art economic and statistical modeling. We will also expand the conventional regression methods explored, to include machine learning algorithms, constrained regression, and LASSO estimation. We will calculate a new “appropriateness to include” (ATI) score that captures diagnostic vagueness, discretion and suitability for use in risk adjustment models, and use this score to inform which variables are included in plan payment formulas. Selection incentives remain of concern in public US health plan payments formulas and may be costing Medicare over $5 billion per year (NBER 2017). Prediction and payment models from this project can reduce overpayment and offset plan incentives to skimp on services that attract sick people. To ensure that these models and formulas are useful for enrollees of all ages, they will initially be calibrated and tested on large commercially-insured claims data, covering ages 0 to 64. They will then be validated and refined for Medicare, Medicaid, and state employees using data from All-Payer Claims Data from five states and a second large commercial dataset. We will make development steps, statistical programs, and full details of the classification system and prediction formulas publicly available for comment, refinement, and use by health care delivery system researchers, payers and providers. Project Narrative This project will develop new classification systems and new prediction and payment models that take advantage of the fivefold increase in diagnostic codes available with the October 2015 change from ICD- 9-CM to ICD-10-CM. Using data from two national claims datasets and five state all-payer claims datasets that collectively cover over 75 million enrollees, we will identify new, underutilized ICD-10 capabilities, create new clusters of diagnoses useful for prediction, develop new algorithms for using these clusters, and estimate formulas that predict spending, utilization and diverse health care outcomes for all ages. Methods and results will be publicly described and software posted on the web for use in risk adjustment and diverse clinical, financial, policy evaluation, and quality assessment outcomes by health care delivery system researchers, payers and providers.",Advanced Risk Adjusters and Predictive Formulas for ICD-10 Based Risk Adjustment,9775421,R01HS026485,[' '],AHRQ,BOSTON UNIVERSITY (CHARLES RIVER CAMPUS),R01,2019,384093,0.0041279807256919005
"Optical Body Composition and Health Assessment ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):1 Of all markers of human health, the most intuitive is body shape but based on quantitative evidence.  2 Anthropometry and regional composition measures such as waist circumference (WC), waist to hip ratio  3 (WHR), and visceral adipose tissue area (VAT) are better predictors of obesity-related diseases and mortality  4 risk than body mass index (BMI). Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) can quantify regional adiposity in  5 more detail than the above measures but is underutilized for many reasons including potential harm from  6 ionizing radiation, cost, and training. A study is needed to take advantage of rapid technological developments  7 in the ""quantified self movement"" to better describe phenotypes of body shape and its relation to metabolic  8 risks. The candidate developed in this proposal is 3D optical whole body scanning. If successful, sophisticated  9 obesity phenotype profiles could be constructed to clarify the underlying associations of body composition with 10 disease, genetics, lifestyle exposures, metabolomics, and be highly assessable using self-assessment 11 technology. Whole body 3D imaging technology is already so accessible that it can be done with video games 12 such as the Microsoft Xbox Kinect, and consumer cameras. 13 The long term goal of the Optical Body Shape and Health Assessment Study is 1) to provide phenotype 14 descriptors of health using body shape, and 2) to provide the tools to visualize and quantify body shape in 15 research, clinical practice, and personal health assessment. Our overall approach is to first derive predictive 16 models of how body shape relates to regional and total body composition (subcutaneous fat, visceral fat, 17 muscle mass, lean mass, and percent fat), and then show how our 3DO body composition estimates are 18 associated to important metabolic risk factors. Our central hypothesis is that 3DO measures of body 19 composition with shape classification better predict metabolic risk factors than anthropometry or DXA body 20 composition alone. Our specific aims are: 1. Identify the unique associations of body shape to body 21 composition indices in a population that represents the variance of sex, age, BMI, and ethnicity found 22 in the US population; 2. Describe the precision and accuracy of 3DO scans to monitor change in body 23 composition and metabolic health interventions; and 3. Estimate the level of association of 3DO to 24 common health indicators including metabolic risk factors by gender, race, age, and BMI. In an 25 exploratory aim, we investigate holistic, high-resolution descriptors of 3D body shape as direct 26 predictors of body composition and metabolic risk using statistical shape models and Latent Class 27 Analysis. By the end of this study, we expect to have models of the shape and composition suitable for self- 28 assessment technologies that are capable of representing over 95% of the shape variance in the US 29 population, and how these models relate to important metabolic status and body composition. The positive 30 impact will be the immediate applicability to clinicians and individuals for personalized risk assessment. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research is relevant to public health because they have the potential to provide a better understanding of who is at high risk of metabolic diseases because of a poor metabolic profile. Thus, the advances proposed are expected to have a high impact to the health and wellbeing of all US citizens because metabolic diseases, such as obesity and its complications, are currently the number one killers of adults.

"Shape up! Kids Project Summary/Abstract Of all markers of pediatric health, the most intuitive is body shape. Human and animal studies indicate that weight loss/gain correlates closely with increasing/decreasing insulin sensitivity, respectively. Anthropometry and regional composition measures such as waist circumference, waist to hip ratio (WHR), and visceral adipose tissue area are better predictors of obesity-related diseases and mortality risk than pediatric body mass index Z-score. Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry can quantify regional adiposity in more detail than these measures but is underutilized for many reasons including the sensitivity to children to ionizing radiation, cost, and training. A study is needed to take advantage of rapid technological developments in optical technology to better describe phenotypes of pediatric body shape and its relation to metabolic risks (obesity, “failure to thrive”) and bone density and size. If successful, sophisticated obesity phenotype profiles could be constructed to clarify the underlying associations of body composition with disease, genetics, lifestyle exposures, metabolomics, and be highly assessable using self-assessment technology. The long term goal of the Shape Up! Kids Study is 1) to provide pediatric phenotype descriptors of health using body shape, and 2) to provide the tools to visualize and quantify body shape in research, clinical practice, and personal health assessment. Our overall approach is to first derive predictive models of how body shape relates to regional and total body composition (subcutaneous fat, visceral fat, muscle mass, lean mass, and percent fat) and bone mineral density (BMD) over a wide range of ages (5 to 18 years), weights and heights, stratified by sex, and ethnicity. Our central hypothesis is that optical estimates with shape classification of soft tissue composition and bone density better predict fracture and metabolic risk factors than anthropometry (WC, WHR, and BM) alone. The Investigators will highly leverage existing data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey and Bone Mineral Density in Children Study. Our specific aims are: 1) Identify the unique associations of body shape to body composition and bone density indices in a pediatric population that represents the variance found in the US population, 2) Describe the precision and accuracy of optical scans to monitor change in body composition, bone density, 3) Estimate the level of association of optical scans to common health indicators including metabolic risk factors. Our exploratory aim is to investigate holistic, high-resolution descriptors of 3D body shape as direct predictors of body composition and metabolic risk using statistical shape models and Latent Class Analysis. By the end of this study, we expect to have models of the shape and composition suitable for self-assessment technologies that are capable of representing over 95% of the shape variance in the US pediatric population, and to define how these models relate to important metabolic status indicators. The positive impact of these outcomes will be the immediate applicability to other researcher studies and clinicians using the automated tools and models developed here for 3D optical images.

"Molecular Biomarkers of Dangerous Intracranial Aneurysms Abstract Rupture of intracranial aneurysms (IAs) causes intracranial hemorrhaging that leads to high rates of neurological deficits and death. Although rupture rates are low, clinicians must decide whether to treat or monitor these potentially dangerous lesions. In the current clinical practice, the most common metric to measure risk of rupture is aneurysm size (≥7 mm or ≥5 mm). However, clinical data show that small aneurysms can also rupture. As a result, alternative clinical stratification scores have been proposed, including the PHASES (Population, Hypertension, Age, Size, Earlier subarachnoid hemorrhage, and Site) score based on patient demographics and IA characteristics to stratify ruptured and unruptured IAs, and the Rupture Resemblance Score (RRS) that stratifies ruptured and unruptured IAs based on hemodynamic and morphological properties. However, all metrics require imagining on digital subtraction angiography (DSA), which is invasive, expensive, requires the use of X-rays, and is associated with transient or permanent neurological and non-neurological complications. In previous studies, we found that patients with and without IAs have RNA expression differences in their circulating blood that reflect leukocyte activation and inflammatory signaling. Expression differences could both identify the presence of IAs and stratify IA samples by size. We therefore hypothesize that individuals with dangerous IAs have detectable gene expression differences in their blood that could be used as biomarkers to determine rupture risk. In this Phase-I study, we propose to use whole blood transcriptomes to develop a “one- stop” diagnostic test that can detect the presence of IAs and determine the risk of rupture based on circulating RNA expression biomarkers using our prototype AneuScreenTM platform. We aim to: 1) Develop and validate biomarkers to predict risk indicated by the currently-used size metric, 2) Develop and validate biomarkers to predict risk indicated by the clinical PHASES score, and 2) Develop and validate biomarkers to predict risk indicated by the RRS. These biomarkers will save the healthcare millions in unnecessary high-cost imaging procedures and unnecessary aneurysm treatments. Project Narrative Intracranial aneurysms (IAs) can lead to devastating health consequences upon rupture. Because rupture is uncommon, there is a need for clinicians to have an objective metric of rupture risk that can help classify IAs as high-risk or low-risk lesions. In this project we aim to develop circulating whole blood gene expression biomarker of aneurysm risk. This biomarker once incorporated into our AneuScreenTM diagnostic platform will help avoid unnecessary aneurysm treatments by: (1) stratifying IA cases between those that are high-risk and require treatment, and those that are low-risk and can be periodically monitored; (2) enabling a low-cost, non-invasive alternative to frequently monitor IAs; and (3) determining the need for follow-up imaging in the case of a positive AneuScreenTM test, as low risk IAs may only need magnetic resonance angiography (MRA), while high risk IAs may directly receive DSA for imaging and possible preventive treatment. Successful completion of this Phase I will clarify if a pre-imaging blood test can stratifying IA risk. This augmented capability will lead to more vigilant and cost-effective IA management.",Molecular Biomarkers of Dangerous Intracranial Aneurysms,9907236,R43NS115314,"['3-Dimensional', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Aneurysm', 'Area', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biomechanics', 'Blood', 'Blood Tests', 'Cells', 'Cerebrum', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical stratification', 'Complex', 'Complication', 'Dangerousness', 'Data Set', 'Demographic Factors', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Digital Subtraction Angiography', 'Dose', 'Endothelium', 'Event', 'Face', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitals', 'Hypertension', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Individual', 'Inflammatory', 'Intracranial Aneurysm', 'Intracranial Hemorrhages', 'Lead', 'Lesion', 'Liquid substance', 'Magnetic Resonance Angiography', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morphology', 'Natural History', 'Nature', 'Neurologic', 'Neurologic Deficit', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Preventive treatment', 'Property', 'RNA', 'Risk', 'Risk stratification', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Rupture', 'Ruptured Aneurysm', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Subarachnoid Hemorrhage', 'Surface', 'Survivors', 'Testing', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Training', 'Whole Blood', 'base', 'biomarker development', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'demographics', 'differential expression', 'disability', 'follow-up', 'hemodynamics', 'high risk', 'image processing', 'indexing', 'leukocyte activation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'molecular marker', 'mortality', 'patient population', 'phase 1 study', 'prototype', 'response', 'shear stress', 'transcriptome']",NINDS,"NEUROVASCULAR DIAGNOSTICS, INC.",R43,2019,224975,0.010130707412859477
"Identifying phenomic patterns of dental anomalies in orofacial clefting Project Summary/Abstract Background and Candidate: Children with orofacial clefting present with increased rate of dental anomalies in shape, size, number, symmetry, abnormal eruption and malposition of teeth both inside and outside the cleft area, leading to dental problems and reduction of quality of life. Although the scientific community has recognized these findings for a long time, the specific etiological factors underlying such anomalies still remain elusive. An important step to understanding etiology is via careful phenotypic approaches that can detect the co-occurrence of such anomalies in discernable patterns that can simplify the identification of risk factors. Dr. Brian Howe is a Clinical Assistant Professor at the College of Dentistry of the University of Iowa. His primary research focus is on the identification and characterization of oral phenotypes in an effort to identify etiological factors underlying the oral phenotypic spectrum of nonsyndromic orofacial clefting. Career Goals: Dr. Howe's short term goals are to deepen is knowledge of complex craniofacial phenotypes and expand his current understanding of craniofacial development. His long term goals are to become a funded independent researcher and a leading clinician and educator in the field of craniofacial phenomics and dentistry as a tenure track faculty at a University of Iowa. His research plan is innovative in that it leverages unique bioinformatics algorithms to identify complex oral phenotypic patterns amenable for studies of risk factors and causality. Environment: The University of Iowa has an established reputation for the successful training of graduate and postdoctoral students in research and clinical areas. It offers learning and development seminars focused on career development and advancement with particular benefits from training opportunities from its Institute for Clinical and Translational Sciences (ICTS). Career Development Plan: Dr. Howe is committed to attend courses, tutorials, seminars and relevant conferences as well as meeting regularly with his mentors, collaborators, and advisory committee to fulfill is training aims and gain the knowledge necessary to achieve his future research goals and become an independent clinical researcher. Research Study: This research aims to identify oral phenotypic patterns in orofacial clefting using modern and traditional pattern mining methods in a diverse international population with existing environmental and genetic variables. This knowledge will have key implications in our understanding of the etiology of orofacial clefting as well as driving the implementation of innovative treatment approaches to improve dental outcomes and future preventive strategies. Project Narrative  Individuals with nonsyndromic orofacial clefting present with a wide range of dental anomalies leading to more intricate oral rehabilitation procedures which increases dental morbidity and reduces quality of life in those affected. In the largest international cohort of families with orofacial clefting and controls to date, this project will utilize pattern mining approaches to detect the co-occurrence of particular dental anomalies in discernable patterns that will likely simplify the search for the etiological factors underlying these anomalies. This research will aid in our understanding of the etiology of orofacial clefting by expanding and further defining oral phenotypes which will drive biologically meaningful strategies for the identification of genetic risk factors as well as helping to improve clinical care.",Identifying phenomic patterns of dental anomalies in orofacial clefting,9743788,K08DE028012,"['Advisory Committees', 'Affect', 'Age-Months', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Automobile Driving', 'Awareness', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Birth', 'Career Mobility', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Dental', 'Dental Enamel', 'Dental crowns', 'Dentistry', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Environment', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Faculty', 'Family', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Risk', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'High Prevalence', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'International', 'Iowa', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Maxilla', 'Mentors', 'Mesenchymal', 'Mesenchyme', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modernization', 'Molecular', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Nature', 'Odontogenesis', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Oral', 'Oral cavity', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Pierre Robin Syndrome', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevention strategy', 'Preventive', 'Primary Dentition', 'Procedures', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publications', 'Quality of life', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Severities', 'Shapes', 'Side', 'Signal Transduction', 'Students', 'Surgical Flaps', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Tooth Germ', 'Tooth structure', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Universities', 'Vascular blood supply', 'analytical tool', 'calcification', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical care', 'cohort', 'college', 'craniofacial', 'craniofacial complex', 'craniofacial development', 'design', 'genetic risk factor', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'meetings', 'novel', 'orofacial cleft', 'palatogenesis', 'permanent tooth', 'phenomics', 'professor', 'programs', 'repaired', 'research study', 'risk variant', 'symposium', 'tenure track', 'tool', 'training opportunity', 'trend']",NIDCR,UNIVERSITY OF IOWA,K08,2019,12553,0.001090757291574782
"Predicting the Risk of Severe Hypoglycemic and Hyperglycemic Events in Adults with Diabetes PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Dr. McCoy is an endocrinologist and primary care physician specializing in the care for patients with diabetes and other chronic health conditions. Her long-term goal is to become an independent researcher and leader in evaluating, improving, and individualizing diabetes care through effective use of big data completed by qualitative insights from patients and those involved in their care. The short-term training goals of this proposal are to acquire: 1) proficiency in statistics and data science; 2) experience in qualitative research; 3) skills in clinical trial design; and 4) communication and leadership skills to lead multi-disciplinary research. The proposal's research will be conducted at Mayo Clinic, which has a strong history of training physician scientists and a well-developed infrastructure for education and research. Dr. McCoy has access to an ideal set of data assets, the OptumLabs Data Warehouse and the Kaiser Permanente Northern California Diabetes Registry, and the support of an exceptional team of mentors and advisors who are national leaders in diabetes outcomes and health care delivery research, shared decision-making, qualitative research, and data science. Optimization of glycemic control, while avoiding severe hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia, is the cornerstone of diabetes management. Severe hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia are often preventable, yet continue to incur substantial morbidity, psychological distress, impaired quality of life, and economic burden. There are no validated tools to predict these events and as a result clinicians lack a practical and reliable means to identify high risk patients. The goal of Dr. McCoy's work is to address this critical gap in diabetes management. In Aim 1, she will use large database analysis and novel analytic methods to characterize the patterns of severe hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia among adults with diabetes in the U.S. In Aim 2, she will build on Aim 1 to develop and validate computationally efficient concurrent risk prediction models for severe hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia that could be used in clinical encounters. In Aim 3, she will directly engage patients and their clinicians in conversation about severe hypoglycemia /hyperglycemia risk in order to better understand how information about severe hypoglycemia/ hyperglycemia risk is perceived, interpreted, and used. These studies will serve as foundation for two R01 applications to be submitted during Years 4 and 5, and will advance the science and practice of personalized diabetes care through integration of data science and qualitative methods for the purpose of understanding, predicting, and ultimately preventing severe hypoglycemic/hyperglycemic events. Dr. McCoy has a proven track record of scientific productivity and innovation, and a strong foundation in using secondary data for health services and outcomes research in diabetes. In summary, the training, mentoring, and research proposed here are essential for Dr. McCoy's career development as she develops research independence and expertise in the crucial interface between patients and their clinical teams, evidence-based medicine, and big data. PROJECT NARRATIVE Severe hypoglycemic and hyperglycemic events in the management of diabetes mellitus continue to incur high morbidity, psychological distress, and economic costs; yet, these events may be prevented with individualization of treatment goals and regimens if high risk patients are identified prospectively. The proposed research will leverage big data analytics and qualitative research to 1) characterize the epidemiology of severe hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia in the U.S.; 2) develop and validate concurrent risk prediction models for severe hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia; and 3) enrich the understanding of severe hypoglycemia/ hyperglycemia risk and risk model utilization through qualitative patient and clinician engagement.",Predicting the Risk of Severe Hypoglycemic and Hyperglycemic Events in Adults with Diabetes,9747912,K23DK114497,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Big Data', 'Big Data Methods', 'Calibration', 'California', 'Caring', 'Chronic', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Communication', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Discrimination', 'Economic Burden', 'Endocrinologist', 'Epidemiology', 'Event', 'Evidence Based Medicine', 'Face', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hospitalization', 'Hyperglycemia', 'Hypoglycemia', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Interview', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Learning', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Outcomes and Health Services Research', 'Patient Care', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physicians', 'Primary Care Physician', 'Productivity', 'Qualitative Methods', 'Qualitative Research', 'Quality of life', 'Recording of previous events', 'Regimen', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Proposals', 'Research Training', 'Risk', 'Risk Estimate', 'Risk Factors', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Self Care', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Protocols', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical care', 'clinical decision support', 'data integration', 'data registry', 'data warehouse', 'diabetes management', 'disease phenotype', 'economic cost', 'education research', 'experience', 'glycemic control', 'health care delivery', 'health data', 'high risk', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'individualized medicine', 'innovation', 'insight', 'machine learning algorithm', 'member', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'patient oriented', 'point of care', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'psychologic', 'psychological distress', 'risk prediction model', 'shared decision making', 'skills', 'social', 'statistics', 'support tools', 'tool']",NIDDK,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,K23,2019,168896,-0.007077362319150515
"Using natural language processing and machine learning to identify potentially preventable hospital admissions among outpatients with chronic lung diseases Project Summary Patients living with chronic lung diseases (CLDs) are frequently admitted to the hospital for potentially preventable causes. Such admissions may be discordant with patient preferences and/or represent a low-value allocation of health system resources. To anticipate such admissions, existing clinical prediction models in this ﬁeld typically produce an “all-cause” risk estimate which, even if accurate, overlooks the actionable mechanisms behind admis- sion risk and therefore fails to identify a prescribed response. This limitation may explain the only modest – at best – reductions in hospital admissions and readmissions seen in most intervention bundles that have been tested in this population. An opportunity exists, therefore, to predict hospitalization risk while simultaneously identifying patient phenotypes (i.e. some constellation of social, demographic, clinical, and other characteristics) for which known preventive interventions exist. The proposed study seeks to overcome these limitations and capitalize on this opportunity by (1) conducting semi-structured interviews with hospitalized patients with CLDs, and their caregivers and clinicians, to directly identify modiﬁable risks and their associated phenotypes driving hospital ad- missions; (2) using natural language processing techniques (NLP) to build classiﬁcation models that will leverage nuanced narrative, social, and clinical information in the unstructured text of clinical encounter notes to identify patients with these phenotypes; and (3) building risk prediction model focused on actionable phenotypes with a wide-array of traditional regression and machine learning approaches while also incorporating large numbers of predictor variables from text data and accounting for time-varying trends. The candidate's preliminary work using basic NLP techniques to signiﬁcantly improve the discrimination of clinical prediction models in an inpatient population has motivated this methodologic approach. The rising burden and costs of hospitalizations associated with CLDs, and the increasing attention from federal payers, highlights the critical nature of this work. Completion of this research will build upon the candidate's past training, which includes a Masters of Science in Health Policy Research obtained with NHLBI T32 support, and will provide the experience, education, and mentorship to allow the candidate to become a fully independent investigator. Based on the candidate's tailored training plan, he will acquire advanced skills in mixed-methods research, NLP, and trial design all through coursework, close men- toring and supervision, and direct practice. The skills will position him ideally to submit successful R01s testing the deployment of the proposed clinical prediction models in real-world settings. The candidate's primary mentor, collaborators, and advisors will ensure adherence to the proposed timeline and goals and provide a support- ive environment for him to develop an independent research career testing the real-world deployment of clinical prediction models to reduce low-value and preference-discordant care for patients with CLDs. Project Narrative Every year many people living with chronic lung diseases are admitted to the hospital despite the fact that some of these admissions may have been prevented with early identiﬁcation and intervention prior to the hospitalization. Previous attempts at preventing such hospitalizations have been limited by their ability to both accurately identify those at risk, and because most risk models do not provide a reason for the likely admission. The proposed work draws directly on the experiences of patients with chronic lung diseases who are admitted to a hospital, and then uses cutting edge statistical and computer science techniques to use information in the electronic health record to accurately predict the risk and the likely reason for future hospital admissions.",Using natural language processing and machine learning to identify potentially preventable hospital admissions among outpatients with chronic lung diseases,9505570,K23HL141639,"['Accounting', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adherence', 'Admission activity', 'Adult', 'Ambulatory Care', 'Attention', 'Automobile Driving', 'Bioinformatics', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Chronic lung disease', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Comorbidity', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Diagnosis', 'Discrimination', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Education', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health Policy', 'Health system', 'Home environment', 'Hospital Costs', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Inpatients', 'Interstitial Lung Diseases', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Machine Learning', 'Master of Science', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Nurses', 'Outpatients', 'Palliative Care', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Preferences', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Pennsylvania', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Policy Research', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Primary Health Care', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Estimate', 'Social support', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'TimeLine', 'Training', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Work', 'administrative database', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'collaborative environment', 'computer science', 'cost', 'design', 'discrete data', 'end of life', 'experience', 'hospital readmission', 'improved', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'interest', 'model development', 'modifiable risk', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'preference', 'prevent', 'randomized trial', 'response', 'skills', 'social', 'trend', 'trial design']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,K23,2018,195205,0.007537522558565853
"Harnessing the Electronic Health Record to Predict Risk of Cardiovascular Disease PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the single largest killer in the United States for both men and women in every racial/ethnic group. Thus, accurate and systematic evaluation of CVD risk represents an aspect of Precision Medicine that will touch every patient. CVD risk scores that are currently the standard of care are derived from research cohorts and are particularly inaccurate in women, older patients, and those with missing data. The goal of this Precision Medicine based application is to capitalize on the depth and breadth of clinical data within electronic health record (EHR) systems to revolutionize CVD risk prediction, thereby optimizing personalized care for every patient. Our proposed approach is innovative in that we have identified and addressed the most significant barriers to development of an EHR-based risk score. Novel aspects of this research include: 1) use of complete EHR data to develop and validate algorithms to define a variety of risk factors (e.g., reproductive history), thus building a comprehensive risk profile for each patient that incorporates diagnosis and procedure codes, laboratory values, clinical test results, patient provided information (e.g., alcohol use), and natural language processing of unstructured clinical text; 2) incorporation of age at onset of risk factors; 3) use of highly flexible machine learning techniques in the form of generalized boosted regression modeling; 4) exploration of a new deep learning model for censored EHR data; and 5) determination of the extent of risk reclassification in multiple geographically-defined populations, including an underserved minority population. Furthermore, genetic studies demonstrate that incorporating variants into current risk models improves risk prediction and use of an individual's genetic risk could further enhance our ability to deliver precision medicine to every patient. Therefore, we seek to develop a sex-specific next-generation CVD risk prediction score using EHR data in combination with genetic variants. This paradigm is a significant departure from the current one that relies on scores derived from relatively small research cohorts that use only a restricted set of clinical parameters that differentially misclassify an individual's risk, especially in women. Our access to empirical clinical EHR data for hundreds of thousands of patients uniquely positions us to 1) develop a sex-specific risk prediction model for incident CVD using data from the EHR; 2) assess the performance of the sex-specific EHR risk score in an independent non-urban and rural population; and 3) identify and characterize patients for whom genetic information improves CVD prediction beyond the clinical risk score. Successful completion of these aims has the potential to impact all adult patients, drive clinical practice changes to systematically collect sex-specific risk factors, and inform attempts to embed the next-generation CVD risk score into EHR systems for automated use in clinical care. PROJECT NARRATIVE Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the single largest killer in the United States. We propose to use electronic health record data to improve our ability to accurately classify risk and identify those who would benefit from preventive therapies. Improved risk prediction will shed light on the mechanisms of CVD and potentially reduce incidence, save lives, and lower health care costs.",Harnessing the Electronic Health Record to Predict Risk of Cardiovascular Disease,9442890,R01HL136659,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Algorithms', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinics and Hospitals', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Community Hospitals', 'County', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Ethnic group', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic study', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Hybrids', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Laboratories', 'Latino', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Minnesota', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Not Hispanic or Latino', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevention strategy', 'Preventive', 'Preventive therapy', 'Procedures', 'Reproducibility', 'Reproductive History', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Rural', 'Rural Population', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Touch sensation', 'United States', 'Variant', 'Wisconsin', 'Woman', 'base', 'biobank', 'cardiovascular disorder prevention', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'clinical care', 'clinical practice', 'clinical risk', 'cohort', 'deep learning', 'electronic data', 'flexibility', 'genetic information', 'genetic panel test', 'genetic variant', 'improved', 'innovation', 'men', 'next generation', 'novel', 'older patient', 'personalized care', 'precision genetics', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'prospective', 'racial and ethnic', 'research clinical testing', 'sex', 'standard of care', 'time use', 'underserved minority']",NHLBI,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,R01,2018,794994,-0.010628180907696542
"Detecting bleeding events using EHRs for prediction in Afib Abstract Atrial fibrillation (AF) affects millions of mostly older Americans. Atrial fibrillation contributes to stroke and weighing stroke risk against risk of bleeding from oral anticoagulants (AC) is central to AF management. AC decision-making has become more complex in recent years with the introduction of several target specific oral AC agents. It remains challenging to advise older AF patients about AC since they are frequently at high risk for stroke and complications from AC, particularly bleeding, and data are limited on real-world outcomes of AC among vulnerable populations. Our project, Detecting bleeding Events using Electronic records for Prediction in Atrial Fibrillation (DEEP AF), will leverage novel biomedical natural language processing (NLP) approaches to integrate bleeding-related information from both the structured and unstructured EHR records and statistical and deep learning approaches to predict risk of bleeding on AF patients on AC therapy. DEEP AF will address present knowledge gaps to accurately identify bleeding events from longitudinal electronic health records and to improve bleeding prediction accuracy and focus on modifiable, clinically relevant risk factors, thereby facilitating future large-scale comparative effectiveness studies evaluating AC agents, and helping clinicians develop better approaches to weighing AC risks and benefits.

"Harnessing the power of CTSA-CDRN data networks: Using social determinants of health, frailty and functional status to identify at-risk patients and improve risk adjustment Postoperative complications and readmissions rates are higher in minority and low socioeconomic status (SES) patients. Low SES is associated with frailty, one of the best predictors of 30-day postoperative complications and early hospital readmission. Despite their influence on health outcomes, frailty and social risk factors are not considered in risk adjustment for reimbursement and quality measures. CMS developed financial incentive- based programs to improve quality of care. Yet this strategy disproportionately penalizes minority-serving, major teaching and safety net hospitals (SNH), further constraining resources for the care of vulnerable populations. Our long-term goal is to use frailty and social risk factors to identify at-risk patients to design more effective clinical care pathways. Frailty can be derived retrospectively using the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (ACS NSQIP) dataset. Data networks are powerful research tools that can be used to answer important questions. However, extracting data from EHR is challenging. The Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI) developed 13 Clinical Data Research Networks (CDRN) that have considerable overlapping membership with Clinical Translational Science Award (CTSA) institutions. While steady progress has been made, multiple barriers exist to efficiently access and use data. We will engage 3 CTSA hubs, each members of a different CDRN, to locally merge identified datasets developing data accessing and linking strategies at diverse institutions for dissemination across sites within CDRNs and to ultimately perform similar studies across CDRNs. We will use the SMART IRB reliance platform to harmonize the regulatory approval process as much as possible for each step of this project to identify barriers to use in data networks. We propose the following Aims: 1) Determine the predictive power of ethnicity, race, SES, and frailty for postoperative complications, mortality  and readmissions to improve risk adjustment at 3 CTSA/CDRNs 2) Estimate postoperative functional status using natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning  algorithms on inpatient physical therapy (PT), occupational therapy (OT) and nursing notes for ACS NSQIP  patients to predict long-term functional status 3) Develop methods to predict long-term loss of independence after major surgery 4) Determine hospital resource utilization stratified by SES, frailty and minority status The significance of our study is the incorporation of social risk factors, frailty and functional status in risk adjustment forming the basis for future interventions by targeting patients at the highest risk for postoperative complications and reducing health care disparities. Our innovative approach harnesses data sources at diverse institutions with the goal of disseminating these methods across 3 CDRNs and the CTSA network. Project Narrative: Patients with social risk factors, including poverty, being a minority, lack of an education and frailty are all associated with having worse health outcomes and with more difficulties recovering after surgical procedures. Safety net hospitals take care of many people with social risk factors and are being judged on the quality of care provided without accounting for the challenges faced by poor people. We will study the effect of social risk factors and frailty on health outcomes after surgery to identify patients that would benefit from care pathways that help poor and/or frail people.","Harnessing the power of CTSA-CDRN data networks: Using social determinants of health, frailty and functional status to identify at-risk patients and improve risk adjustment",9528240,U01TR002393,"['Accounting', 'Admission activity', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Ambulatory Care Facilities', 'American', 'American College of Surgeons', 'Authorization documentation', 'Caring', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical and Translational Science Awards', 'Community Surveys', 'Costs and Benefits', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Discipline of Nursing', 'Education', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Fibrinogen', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hispanics', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Inpatients', 'Institution', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'Intervention', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Occupational Therapy', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient risk', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Physical therapy', 'Postoperative Complications', 'Postoperative Period', 'Poverty', 'Predictive Analytics', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quality of Care', 'Race', 'Recovery', 'Recovery of Function', 'Registries', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Institute', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Adjustment', 'Risk Factors', 'Site', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Testing', 'Text', 'United States Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'base', 'clinical care', 'cost effective', 'data access', 'design', 'electronic data', 'financial incentive', 'frailty', 'functional status', 'health care disparity', 'high risk', 'hospital readmission', 'improved', 'incentive program', 'innovation', 'low socioeconomic status', 'member', 'mortality', 'outcome prediction', 'payment', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'readmission rates', 'safety net', 'simulation', 'social', 'social health determinants', 'tool', 'usability']",NCATS,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCIENCE CENTER,U01,2018,100000,0.00356104615509853
"Use of a machine learning framework to predict severe maternal morbidity Severe maternal morbidity (SMM) is on the rise in the United States. Such morbidity is accompanied by delivery complications and adverse pregnancy outcomes, and can have long- term health consequences for women. To date, only a handful of studies examined risk factors for SMM in the United States, and even fewer considered the site of delivery care as potentially influencing SMM occurrence. This study will test the use of machine learning techniques to develop models for predicting women’s risk of experiencing SMM. We will use population-based data from a family of Maryland state databases linked with American Hospital Association Annual Survey data for the 2010-2014 period. Our primary analytic sample will be comprised of all delivery hospitalizations in Maryland hospitals during 2010-2014. Two SMM outcome measures will be employed: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)’s SMM algorithm, and a composite measure that includes any of the codes in the CDC SMM algorithm, ICU admission and/or blood transfusion during the delivery hospitalization. Separately for each of the two outcome measures, we will first develop multi-stage least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) models to predict SMM and then employ Multiple Additive Regression Tree to maximize the predictive ability of the LASSO models. Next, we will fit Logit regression models for SMM adjusting for LASSO-selected predictor variables and compare LASSO and Logit models’ performance using standard metrics such as sensitivity, specificity, area under the curve of receiver operator characteristic. The proposal has several areas of innovation. Classical analytics tools are not well suited to capture the full value of large data. In contrast, machine learning techniques are unconstrained by preset statistical assumptions and expected to make predictions with higher degrees of accuracy. The success of this pilot study will open up new avenues of study into the potential for machine learning to aid clinical care. Obstetrics is one of the areas that can greatly benefit from its use by predicting maternal risks early and optimizing pathways to the best possible outcomes for women and their newborns. Identifying key predictors of SMM can serve to ascertain health disparities, strengths and weaknesses in obstetric care, and prevent adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes. Severe maternal morbidity is on the rise in the United States and such morbidity can have long- term health consequences for women. This study will assess the potential use of new statistical methods, not currently employed in obstetrics, to develop prediction models for severe maternal morbidity during the delivery hospitalization. Our ability to predict a woman’s risk of developing severe maternal morbidity can help prevent such morbidity from occurring. !",Use of a machine learning framework to predict severe maternal morbidity,9506935,R03HD095057,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Admission activity', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Algorithms', 'Ambulatory Surgical Procedures', 'American Hospital Association', 'Applications Grants', 'Area', 'Area Under Curve', 'Behavior', 'Blood Transfusion', 'Caring', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Cessation of life', 'Code', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Discipline of obstetrics', 'Event', 'Family', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health system', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Inpatients', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Intervention', 'Link', 'Logit Models', 'Machine Learning', 'Maryland', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Neonatal Mortality', 'Newborn Infant', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pilot Projects', 'Pregnancy Complications', 'Pregnant Women', 'Premature Birth', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Recording of previous events', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Specificity', 'Statistical Methods', 'Surveys', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Trees', 'United States', 'United States Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality', 'Visit', 'Woman', 'adverse pregnancy outcome', 'analytical method', 'analytical tool', 'care delivery site', 'care seeking', 'clinical care', 'delivery complications', 'ethnic diversity', 'experience', 'health care service utilization', 'health disparity', 'innovation', 'insight', 'maternal morbidity', 'neonatal morbidity', 'neonatal outcome', 'population based', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'racial and ethnic', 'stillbirth', 'success']",NICHD,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R03,2018,81875,0.013738618282963699
"Using Machine Learning to Predict Problematic Prescription Opioid Use and Opioid Overdose Problematic prescription opioid use, defined as nonmedical use, misuse, or abuse of opioid medications, is epidemic in the US. Prescription opioid overdose deaths more than quadrupled from 1999 to 2015. Efforts by health care systems and payers to combat the opioid epidemic are impeded by a lack of accurate and efficient methods to identify individuals most at risk for problematic opioid use and overdose, leading to broad interventions that are burdensome to patients and expensive for payers. Payers are currently defining high risk and targeting interventions (e.g. pharmacy lock-in programs) based on individual risk factors, such as high opioid dosage, identified in prior studies using traditional statistical approaches. However, these traditional approaches have significant limitations, especially when handling large datasets with numerous variables, multi-level interactions, and missing data. Moreover, the prior studies focused on identifying risk factors rather than predicting actual risk. Alternatively, machine learning is an advanced technique that handles complex interactions in large data, uncovers hidden patterns, and yields precise prediction algorithms that, in many cases, are superior to those developed using traditional methods. Machine learning is widely used in activities from fraud detection to cancer genomics, but has not yet been applied to address the opioid epidemic. Accordingly, the proposed study will apply machine learning to develop prediction algorithms that can more accurately identify patients at high risk of problematic opioid use and overdose using data sources that are readily available to payers and health care systems. The project will build on existing academic-state partnerships to apply novel machine learning approaches to administrative claims data for all Medicaid beneficiaries in Pennsylvania (PA) and Arizona (AZ). The project will also link Medicaid data in AZ to electronic health records to capture clinical information (e.g., lab results, pain severity) not available in administrative data, along with death certificate data on lethal overdose. These data, covering 2007-2016, will be used to achieve two specific aims: (1) to develop and validate two separate prediction algorithms to identify patients at risk of problematic opioid use and opioid overdose; (2) to compare the accuracy of a prediction algorithm that integrates clinical data with Medicaid claims versus a claims-based approach alone to identify patients at risk of problematic opioid use and opioid overdose. The machine learning approaches will include random forests and TreeNet with representative classification trees, and the predictive ability (e.g., misclassification rates) of these algorithms will be compared to traditional statistical models. Given the high prevalence of mental health/substance use disorders (~50%) and opioid utilization (>20%) among Medicaid enrollees and the lack of adequate prediction algorithms, Medicaid is an ideal setting for the proposed project. These analyses will provide the partnering Medicaid programs with valuable information and tools that they can apply to more precisely target interventions to prevent problematic opioid use and overdose. Prescription opioid overdose deaths quadrupled from 1999 to 2015, and drug overdose is now the leading cause of injury deaths among adults in the United States. This project will use innovative machine learning methods and readily available data for Medicaid beneficiaries in two states hard hit by the epidemic – Pennsylvania and Arizona – to develop algorithms to accurately predict who is at risk of problematic prescription opioid use and overdose. This information will empower health systems, payers, and policymakers to more effectively target interventions to prevent prescription opioid misuse and its consequences.",Using Machine Learning to Predict Problematic Prescription Opioid Use and Opioid Overdose,9547370,R01DA044985,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Arizona', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Death Certificates', 'Detection', 'Dose', 'Drug Screening', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emergency department visit', 'Ensure', 'Epidemic', 'Fee-for-Service Plans', 'Fraud', 'Genomics', 'Health system', 'Healthcare Systems', 'High Prevalence', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Inpatients', 'Intervention', 'Letters', 'Link', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Managed Care', 'Medicaid', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphine', 'Opioid', 'Outcome', 'Overdose', 'Pain', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pennsylvania', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacy facility', 'Prescription opioid overdose', 'Prevalence', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Severities', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Subgroup', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Trees', 'United States', 'United States Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services', 'Urine', 'Work', 'base', 'beneficiary', 'cancer genomics', 'clinical predictors', 'combat', 'design', 'dosage', 'forest', 'high risk', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'milligram', 'model building', 'nonmedical use', 'novel', 'opioid epidemic', 'opioid mortality', 'opioid overdose', 'opioid use', 'overdose risk', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'prescription opioid', 'prescription opioid abuse', 'prescription opioid misuse', 'prevent', 'programs', 'service utilization', 'tool']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2018,585626,0.011223532091865317
"Improving cancer family history collection through social networking and artificial intelligence PROJECT SUMMARY  The  activities  proposed  in  this  NCI  K07  application  are  designed  to  advance  the  career  development  and  research  independence  of  Dr.  Brandon  M.  Welch.  Family  health  history  (FHx)  is  one  of  the most important  resources available to help clinicians identify disease risks. By knowing a patient's FHx, clinicians can quickly  identify  disease risks and initiate risk-reducing strategies such as increased screening, prophylactic surgery,  risk-reducing  therapeutics,  and  lifestyle  changes.  FHx  is  also  the  foundation  of  genomic  medicine.  Unfortunately,  the  collection  and  use  of  FHx  by  patients  and  clinicians  is  suboptimal.  To  improve  the  collection and use of FHx among the general population, a better FHx tool that is easier and more convenient  to  use  than  current  FHx  tools  is  needed.  A  new  FHx  web  tool,  called  ​ItRunsInMyFamily.com,​  incorporates  artificial intelligence and social networking to improve user engagement with FHx collection.Utilizing artificial  intelligence  based  chat  entity  can  improve  the  collection  of  FHx  information  by  making  it  easier  and  more  engaging to record FHx information, likewise social networking allows users to tap into the collective wisdom  and  knowledge  of  the  family  to  correct  inaccuracies  and  overcome  gaps  in  FHx  knowledge.  This research  study  will  first  identify  enhancements  to  ​ItRunsInMyFamily.com  ​that  will  further  promote  user  engagement,  with  particular  focus  on  rural and underserved patients (Aim 1). We will then evaluate whether this new FHx  tool can improve collection of cancer FHx in comparison with current FHx tools (Aim 2). Finally, we will assess  the impact of ​ItRunsInMyFamily.com ​on the clinical settings (Aim 3). To implement the research plan, it will be  critical  to  apply,  skills  obtained  through  K  award  learning  objectives,  namely  clinical  oncology  (learning  objective  1),  iterative  patient-centered  design  (learning  objective  2),  and  health  technology  assessment  (learning  objective  3).  To  fulfill  these  learning  objectives,  an  interdisciplinary  group  of  mentors  will  direct  a  comprehensive training plan. The training plan includes coursework, seminars, workshops, journal clubs, and  conferences,  covering clinical oncology, patient engagement, health disparities, user-centered development,  human-computer  interaction,  clinical  research  methodologies,  health  technology  assessment,  and  ethical  conduct  of  research.  The  strong  support  of  an  excellent  team  of  mentors,  and  the  vast  resources  of  the  Medical  University  of  South  Carolina,  create  an  optimal  training  environment.  Collectively,  the  integrated  learning  objectives  and  research  plan  are  critical  to  establishing  a  successful,  innovative,  and  meaningful  academic career focused on developing patient-centric informatics tools for oncology.   PROJECT NARRATIVE Family health history (FHx) is one of the most important risk factors for cancer and the foundation of genomic medicine, but is under-utilized by patients and clinicians.

"Project FIGARO - Factors Important to Gather for Anticipating Relapses for Opioids PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT For individuals with opioid use disorder (OUD) the propensity for relapse is high when experiencing craving, independent of a desire to stay sober. Historically, tools to fight opioid addiction have been limited and retrospective. By the time a traditional intervention occurs, they are often already reusing. Addiction relapses too often lead to a costly downward spiral - committing crimes, getting rearrested, being hospitalized, overdosing, and/or dying. Recent advances in wearable sensors, smartphones and artificial intelligence have created an unprecedented opportunity to produce positive health outcomes by predicting and preventing OUD relapses and overdoses. With sensing and associated algorithms, it will be possible to detect relapse risk states and intervene in advance - before a relapse actually occurs. The first step in this new era of proactive opioid relapse prediction is to identify and measure digital biomarkers associated with reinitiating drug use and relapse and implement a predictive model with minimal false positive alerts to achieve just-in-time intervention. This will begin with the collection of quantitative and qualitative data on patients and healthcare professionals to identify desired features and functions. Behaivior LLC will develop a relapse prevention platform that will consider a combination of physiological sensor data from the patient’s wearable devices in combination with smartphone usage data, location data and – importantly – reports from people in his/her support network to identify and detect relapse triggers in real-time. SA-1​: Demonstrate what makes a wrist wearable device acceptable and usable for people with OUD. SA-2.A​: Identify positive correlations between physiological, location and smartphone data, and self-reported opioid cravings: ​Results will be used to create a predictive model that can operate in real-time. SA-2.B​: Demonstrate feasibility of using support-network-reported data to predict opioid cravings. SA-3​: Create a predictive model to anticipate opioid relapse as a step towards just-in-time intervention. SA-4​: Demonstrate feasibility of predictive model by obtaining a sufficiently low false positive rate. A successful outcome of this project will be a wearables platform capable of predicting and preventing opioid addiction relapses, stemming the tide of the opioid epidemic. The platform will be ready for regulatory approvals and integration into existing electronic health records and monitoring systems. To achieve behavior modification, Behaivior will implement and commercialize a wearables platform and suite of effective interventions utilizing individualized, active machine learning, and continued iteration of next generation wearables and supporting mobile applications. ​A​ robust platform prototype capable of producing measurable change will be tested. Further development of the most promising MVP(s) will be pursued by a Phase II SBIR proposal. Project Narrative Knowing in real­time when someone with opioid use disorder is at a high risk of relapsing will revolutionize the ability to intervene at the right moment to help people stay clean and sober. Our research will contribute to fundamental knowledge about the specific information needed to be gathered in order to accurately detect when someone struggling with opioid use disorder is in a high­risk opioid craving/obsession state, and will enable the creation of a predictive model for just­in­time intervention. The number of deaths from opioid overdose is increasing every day, so reducing opioid addiction relapses will save lives and families and it will reduce rearrests, reincarcerations, and rehospitalizations.",Project FIGARO - Factors Important to Gather for Anticipating Relapses for Opioids,9545451,R43DA046149,"['Aftercare', 'Agreement', 'Alcohol abuse', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Algorithms', 'Ambulatory Care', 'American', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Biological Markers', 'Cellular Phone', 'Cessation of life', 'Chest', 'Collection', 'Computer software', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Crime', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Reporting', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Dropout', 'Drug usage', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Family', 'Future', 'Galvanic Skin Response', 'General Population', 'Hand', 'Health', 'Health Professional', 'Heart Rate', 'Heroin', 'Hospitalization', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurable', 'Measures', 'Monitor', 'Moods', 'Movement', 'Obsession', 'Opiate Addiction', 'Opioid', 'Outcome', 'Overdose', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Prescription drug overdose', 'Recovery', 'Relapse', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Risk Factors', 'Schools', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Source', 'Specificity', 'Stress', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'System', 'Technology', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Vehicle crash', 'Wrist', 'addiction', 'base', 'cohort', 'computer science', 'cost', 'craving', 'digital', 'disorder later incidence prevention', 'drinking', 'drug craving', 'drug relapse', 'effective intervention', 'experience', 'fighting', 'heart rate variability', 'high risk', 'improved', 'instrument', 'mobile application', 'next generation', 'opioid epidemic', 'opioid mortality', 'opioid use disorder', 'outcome forecast', 'outcome prediction', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'prototype', 'rearrest', 'recidivism', 'reincarceration', 'relapse prediction', 'relapse risk', 'sensor', 'sobriety', 'stem', 'support network', 'tool', 'usability', 'wearable device']",NIDA,"BEHAIVIOR, LLC",R43,2018,223791,-0.014348805540061254
"Secondary Analysis of EHR Data to Examine Relative Impact of Oral Health History on Incident Pneumonia by Settings Project Summary (Abstract) With little change in incidence for over 50 years, pneumonia remains the top cause for morbid hospitalization1 in the USA, and is associated with healthcare costs exceeding $10 billion annually2. This study proposes to mine big data captured in an intergrated medical/dental record (iEHR) and enterprise data warehouse (EDW) of a large midwestern medical-dental integrated healthcare system and will test the hypothesis that poor oral health is an independent risk for subtypes of community-acquired and hospital-acquired pneumonia. Proposed specific aims include: 1) electronic identification and characterization of pneumonia types and 2) evaluation of the association of oral health status with risk of pneumonia. Tasks to achieve study aims are to: a) develop electronic, phenotype-based algorithm(s) to classify and characterize pneumonia by subtype and relative frequency of events; b) characterize impact of immediate and longitudinal oral health status on emergent pneumonia stratified by subtype; and c) evaluate relative risk contributed by medical and dental factors. Innovative application of natural language processing (NLP) to support evaluation of unstructured data and machine learning (ML) to identify as-yet unknown potential risk factors is proposed. These aims will be accomplished by established investigators including dentists and researchers with extensive research track records in oral and systemic health including pneumonia, clinical pulmonologist/intensivist to provide clinical expertise to inform data mining, biomedical informaticians with expertise in data mining, ML and NLP and data modeling, and experienced biostatisticians who will apply appropriate statistical approaches and traditional data modeling to big data. This team will collaboratively create and deliver a unique, well-defined, pneumonia- specific, oral health data registry resource and validated phenotype-based algorithm to classify pneumonia, stratified by subtypes, which will support future interrogation for additional permutations of medical and dental factors. Study outcomes are expected to leverage immediate translational value within the health system with high potential for relevance and portability to other settings. The project is expected to define risk factors which may represent actionable targets for reduction of pneumonia risk across various settings. Project Narrative- Relevance to public health: Pneumonia continues as a leading public health problem in hospitals, healthcare facilities and community settings. Pneumonia is the top disease-related cause for hospitalization. This study proposes to use data in electronic health records to classify pneumonia type and describe risk factors that may make individual susceptible to different types of pneumonia, including impact of diseases of the mouth, gums and teeth. The project expects to create models that can identify patients at risk for pneumonia based on information in their medical record so that those risks may be recognized and reduced.",Secondary Analysis of EHR Data to Examine Relative Impact of Oral Health History on Incident Pneumonia by Settings,9599192,R03DE027020,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Antibiotic Resistance', 'Aspiration Pneumonia', 'Big Data', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Climate', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Communities', 'Comorbidity', 'Complement', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Element', 'Data Set', 'Dental', 'Dental Care', 'Dental Hygiene', 'Dental Records', 'Dentists', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'General Hospitals', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Status', 'Health care facility', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Inpatients', 'Integrated Health Care Systems', 'Intervention Studies', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Link', 'Logic', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Medical Records', 'Modeling', 'Mouth Diseases', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nosocomial pneumonia', 'Oral', 'Oral health', 'Outcome Study', 'Outpatients', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patients', 'Periodontitis', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Pneumococcal vaccine', 'Pneumonia', 'Population Study', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Public Health', 'Pulmonology', 'Recording of previous events', 'Records', 'Recurrence', 'Relative Risks', 'Research', 'Research Institute', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Respiratory Signs and Symptoms', 'Retrospective cohort', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Scoring Method', 'Site', 'Smoking', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tooth structure', 'Translational Research', 'Update', 'Ventilator', 'Visit', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'case finding', 'clinically relevant', 'community setting', 'cost', 'data mining', 'data modeling', 'data registry', 'data warehouse', 'demographics', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'health care delivery', 'health record', 'healthcare community', 'high risk', 'innovation', 'member', 'mortality', 'novel', 'outreach', 'patient population', 'patient screening', 'pneumonia model', 'portability', 'secondary analysis', 'systems research', 'ventilator-associated pneumonia']",NIDCR,MARSHFIELD CLINIC RESEARCH FOUNDATION,R03,2018,174917,-0.004938660395183379
"Assess and Model the Health Effects, Population, and Infrastructural Vulnerabilities of Power Outage PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Climate change will lead to more intense and longer-lasting extreme weather events, such as floods, hurricanes, and severe storms, which will lead to more frequent power outage (PO). Significant gaps remain in our understanding of the impact of PO on human health: most previous studies were based on self-reported survey data, which is subject to reporting bias. In addition to weather factors that directly affect human health, other concurrent factors such as PO may also mediate with extreme weather on health, for which research is also lacking. Few studies assessed both power infrastructures and population vulnerabilities, and compared the effects of different PO causes. Furthermore, no health prediction models have been developed for PO. To fill these knowledge gaps, the proposed study will build upon multiple ongoing/ completed studies to: 1) assess the effects and mediating pathways of PO on electricity-dependent health outcomes, co-morbidities, and nursing home transfers; 2) identify infrastructure, environmental, and population vulnerabilities (individual and community); and 3) develop a vulnerability index and prediction model. We will effectively link the accessible New York statewide hospital admission and emergency department (ED) visit data with the existing data on PO, weather, air pollution, census, and nursing home transfer data. The associations between PO causes, frequency, duration, or area coverage of PO and electricity-dependent hospitalizations or ED visits due to asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), dialysis, water-/food-borne diseases, injury, and carbon monoxide poisoning will be assessed through Bayesian spatial-temporal model. This advanced technique will be able to control for both socio-demographic differences by regions and multiple temporal variables simultaneously. To improve scientific rigor, we will use control days (without PO and extreme weather) to separate PO from weather effects, and control diseases (e.g. appendicitis) to examine temporal changes of disease reporting. To understand PO’s natural direct and indirect effects, causal mediation analysis will be used. Furthermore, new variable selection methods, including Sure Independence Screening and Generalized Additive Model Selection will be used to screen and select predictors highly associated with outcomes. A composite vulnerability index weighed by risk factors identified and vulnerability maps will be developed. We will establish PO and PO-related health predictive models using the state-of-the-art data mining techniques, including Random Forest, Gradient Boosted Tree, and Ensemble Learning Decision Tree model. The excellent team with multidisciplinary and experienced investigators, numerous already collected and geocoded datasets, innovative data mining and analysis methods, continuation of student training, and successful prior partnerships with government agencies will maximize the probability of our success and feasibility. This project will also significantly enhance our institute’s environment and students’ involvement in research, and our findings will identify evidence-based strategies for emergency management and public health preparedness. NARRATIVE The proposed study will evaluate whether frequency, duration, coverage, and certain causes of power outage (PO) are associated with increased risks of electricity-dependent diseases, including asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), dialysis, water-/food-borne diseases, injury, and carbon monoxide poisoning. This may be the first study to assess whether people with certain demographic characteristics (e.g. elderly or different sex), living in a neighborhood with certain vulnerabilities (e.g. high land coverage or low hospital density), in certain seasons, degree of urbanicity, or specific causes of PO are more vulnerable to the impact of PO. The findings, vulnerability index and maps, and the forecast models derived from this study will help guide the state or federal environmental and health agencies to plan interventions and climate adaptation programs.","Assess and Model the Health Effects, Population, and Infrastructural Vulnerabilities of Power Outage",9440510,R15ES028000,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Address', 'Admission activity', 'Adverse effects', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Air Pollution', 'Appendicitis', 'Area', 'Asthma', 'Carbon Monoxide Poisoning', 'Censuses', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Climate', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Comorbidity', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Trees', 'Dialysis procedure', 'Disasters', 'Disease', 'Elderly', 'Electricity', 'Emergency Situation', 'Emergency department visit', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Environmental Health', 'Equipment Failure', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Event', 'Evidence based intervention', 'Floods', 'Frequencies', 'Gender', 'Geographic Factor', 'Government Agencies', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Hurricane', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Institutes', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Natural Disasters', 'Neighborhoods', 'New York', 'Nursing Homes', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Population', 'Population Characteristics', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predisposition', 'Probability', 'Public Health', 'Readiness', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recovery', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Seasons', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Statistical Methods', 'Students', 'Surveys', 'Techniques', 'Trees', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Water', 'Weather', 'Work', 'base', 'climate change', 'climate impact', 'data mining', 'density', 'disorder control', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'extreme heat', 'foodborne', 'forest', 'health data', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'low socioeconomic status', 'member', 'modifiable risk', 'multidisciplinary', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'public health priorities', 'screening', 'sex', 'student training', 'success']",NIEHS,STATE UNIVERSITY OF NEW YORK AT ALBANY,R15,2018,443750,-0.03911780466181358
"Developing Risk Algorithms of Internalizing Disorder Etiology and Course ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Anxiety and mood disorders (internalizing disorders [IDs]) are common and debilitating conditions. The proposed Career Development Award will provide the candidate with the necessary skills to develop an independent research program focused on identifying how psychological/personality, environmental, and biomarker vulnerabilities predict the development and course of IDs using prospective observational survey designs. The applicant's prior research training involved studying the influence of psychological/personality vulnerabilities on ID severity and course in patient samples. In order to expand his research program, the applicant is seeking advanced training in two key areas (psychiatric epidemiology; machine learning methods) and supplemental training in two additional areas (self-assessed biomarkers; environmental vulnerabilities). Collectively, this training will provide the applicant with the skills (1) to study ID onset and course using prospective survey designs, and (2) to use machine learning methods to develop clinically-useful risk algorithms of ID onset and course using multiple vulnerability domains (psychological/ personality; environmental; biomarker). These skills will be developed through a combination of didactic training, guided readings, and mentored research projects. Training will occur in the Department of Health Care Policy at Harvard Medical School under the mentoring of Dr. Ronald Kessler (an expert in psychiatric epidemiology) and Dr. Sherri Rose (an expert in machine learning). The proposed research plan involves two phases. In Phase 1, machine learning methods will be used to analyze cross-sectional ID data from the World Mental Health (WMH) Surveys in order to develop risk algorithms that predict the onset of major depression, bipolar disorder, and generalized anxiety disorder (Specific Aim 1). Machine learning methods will also be applied to WMH Survey data to develop subtypes of bipolar disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, and posttraumatic stress disorder that maximize the prediction of their long-term course (Specific Aim 2). The proposed Phase 1 studies are highly innovative; in contrast to other areas of medicine, virtually no studies have attempted to develop ID risk algorithms or subtypes using machine learning methods. However, Phase 1 studies are also preliminary; replication and expansion of the algorithms is needed in prospective samples. Accordingly, Phase 2 of the research plan (Specific Aim 3) aims to test the feasibility of conducting a large prospective web-based survey study of psychological/personality (assessed via self-report and behavior), environmental (assessed via self-report), and biomarker (assessed via self-administered salivary assays) vulnerabilities of ID onset and course. Participants will be recruited online to complete a baseline survey and those determined to have an ID or be at high-risk of developing an ID will be asked to complete bimonthly follow-ups over the course of one year. The Phase 2 study is also innovative. Despite being called ""the future"" of epidemiological research, web-based survey studies of the IDs are rare. In addition, existing prospective epidemiological studies coarsely (i.e., dichotomously) assess IDs and their vulnerabilities, and have long gaps (1-4 years) between follow-ups. The use of bimonthly online surveys of the severity of IDs and their vulnerabilities will address these limitations. Phase 2 exploratory analyses will also be conduct in which latent ID trajectories are predicted using machine learning methods. Overall, the outlined training activities and mentored research projects will be used to develop an R01 application for a prospective epidemiological study that uses machine learning methods to develop clinically useful algorithms of ID onset and course using a broad range of psychological/personality, environmental, and biomarker vulnerabilities factors. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research aims to use cutting-edge statistical methods to develop clinically-useful (1) risk algorithms to identify who is at greatest risk of developing different internalizing disorders, and (2) subtypes of internalizing disorders that identify who is most likely to experience a persistence and chronic long-term disorder course. This research has important clinical and public health implications. With this research, individuals at risk of developing internalizing disorders can be targeted using early detection and prevention efforts, while those at risk of experiencing a persistent and chronic long-term course can be targeted using tailored/intensive internalizing disorder interventions.",Developing Risk Algorithms of Internalizing Disorder Etiology and Course,9544317,K01MH106710,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Appointment', 'Area', 'Baseline Surveys', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Childhood', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'DSM-IV', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Dropout', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemiology', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Generalized Anxiety Disorder', 'Growth', 'Health Policy', 'Health Surveys', 'Healthcare', 'Individual', 'International', 'Intervention', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Life', 'Literature', 'Logistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Medicine', 'Mental Health', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Mood Disorders', 'Online Systems', 'Onset of illness', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Personality', 'Personality Traits', 'Phase', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Predictive Factor', 'Prevention', 'Prospective Studies', 'Psychiatric epidemiology', 'Public Health', 'Questionnaires', 'Rare Diseases', 'Reading', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Research Training', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Studies', 'Self-Administered', 'Severities', 'Societies', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stressful Event', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Validation', 'clinical decision-making', 'college', 'cost', 'design', 'disorder risk', 'disorder subtype', 'epidemiology study', 'experience', 'follow up assessment', 'follow-up', 'forest', 'high risk', 'innovation', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'longitudinal course', 'medical schools', 'phase 1 study', 'phase 2 study', 'population based', 'prediction algorithm', 'programs', 'prospective', 'psychologic', 'public health relevance', 'recruit', 'salivary assay', 'secondary analysis', 'self reported behavior', 'skills', 'theories', 'virtual']",NIMH,BOSTON UNIVERSITY (CHARLES RIVER CAMPUS),K01,2018,164330,-0.004193899756086163
"Developing data tools to reduce CVD disparities via Health Information Exchanges ABSTRACT CVD disparities across the race/ethnic and socioeconomic gradients are exacerbated by barriers to receiving guideline-based primary or secondary preventive treatment—such as appropriate blood pressure, dyslipidemia, and type 2 diabetes treatment.1–6 Most patients not receiving guideline-based treatment are actually insured and have seen a primary care provider in the past year.1 To reduce CVD disparities by better targeting disease prevention and treatment, healthcare administrators and county departments of public health have begun pooling data resources across healthcare and public health systems—such as across clinics, emergency rooms and hospitals, pharmacies, laboratories, and administrative datasets.7–9 The idea behind pooling such datasets is to better identify persons most in need, and direct targeted interventions to them. Solano County, California, a medium-sized, diverse, low-income county, has developed one of the first, and most comprehensive health information exchanges (HIEs), including: (i) electronic health record data from all emergency rooms, hospitals, primary care and specialty clinics and care facilities in the county; (ii) labs from all laboratory service providers; (iii) prescription details from all pharmacies; (iv) validated social determinants of health surveys administered in clinics; and (v) administrative datasets, including welfare, disability, housing, and geocoded neighborhood features. While several other counties are following suit to develop large, secure HIEs across healthcare and public health systems, a key challenge remains: how to cheaply, accurately, and rapidly analyze HIEs to identify which persons should be targeted for interventions. Without reliable, user- friendly, cost-effective, and generalizable data analysis programs, counties are unable to use the massive data at their disposal to address preventable causes of morbidity and mortality. The objective of this application is to apply our unique machine-learning innovations to develop open-source programs that can enable counties to identify persons at high risk for preventable CVD events and deaths. We will test the hypothesis that electronic health record data alone are insufficient to provide accurate risk prediction for preventable CVD events and deaths. Rather, we believe that key survey and administrative data providing information on social determinants of health will improve identification of high-risk patients. To test our hypothesis, we will develop and validate open-source, generalizable programs to: (Aim 1) rapidly identify persons in need of improved primary and secondary prevention of CVD by systematically comparing the performance of three alternative machine learning approaches to read HIE data, as compared to human clinician chart reviewers; and (Aim 2) perform multi-level risk assessment by automatically calibrating and validating models of CVD event risk, utilization and cost to HIE data, to identify the added value of administrative and social determinants data as compared to clinical or claims-based data alone. Our work will produce generalizable software tools for counties across the country to analyze HIE data and reduce preventable CVD disparities. PROJECT NARRATIVE Cardiovascular disease (CVD) disparities are exacerbated by inadequate guideline-based treatment of CVD risk factors. Furthermore, risk adjustment models currently used to target interventions and pay for healthcare services only use claims-based data such as demographics and clinical diagnostic codes, ignoring social determinants of health. Our research will rigorously develop and test novel machine learning methods that incorporate social determinants data from large Health Information Exchanges, producing novel data tools that will enable health systems nationwide to better detect individuals who could use improvements in their preventive therapy for CVD, and improve risk adjustment models to identify persons at high risk for preventable healthcare utilization and cost.",Developing data tools to reduce CVD disparities via Health Information Exchanges,9584874,R21MD012867,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Address', 'Administrator', 'Blood Pressure', 'California', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular Models', 'Case Management', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Country', 'County', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Dyslipidemias', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Event', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Personnel', 'Health Surveys', 'Health care facility', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Heart failure', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Housing', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Information Systems', 'Insurance', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Literature', 'Low income', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Neighborhoods', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Pharmacy facility', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Population Surveillance', 'Preventive therapy', 'Preventive treatment', 'Primary Health Care', 'Primary Prevention', 'Public Health', 'Race', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Adjustment', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Secondary Prevention', 'Secure', 'Social Work', 'Software Tools', 'Standardization', 'Stroke', 'Surveys', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Unemployment', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Vocabulary', 'Work', 'base', 'cardiovascular disorder prevention', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'cardiovascular disorder therapy', 'care providers', 'clinical diagnostics', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'data exchange', 'data resource', 'deep learning', 'demographics', 'disability', 'disorder prevention', 'health care service', 'health care service utilization', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'medical specialties', 'mortality', 'novel', 'open source', 'payment', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'prospective', 'residence', 'safety net', 'semiparametric', 'service providers', 'social', 'social health determinants', 'socioeconomics', 'tool', 'treatment disparity', 'user-friendly', 'welfare']",NIMHD,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R21,2018,229089,0.012697493976098914
"Prediction of short-term risk of coronary heart disease and overall risk of ischemic cardiomyopathy PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Coronary heart disease (CHD) is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. In the United States, although mortality from CHD has declined over recent decades, the incidence of CHD has remained high. This year, nearly 600,000 Americans will experience their first myocardial infarction (MI) and a larger number will have undiagnosed ischemia. Both groups are at risk of developing ischemic cardiomyopathy (ICM), which compounds the burden of morbidity and mortality they face. Efforts to prevent CHD and its complications like ICM have been hampered by poor patient adherence, which is in large part due to misperceptions of risk. Patients are more likely to engage in preventive behaviors if they know their risk of disease, particularly if their risk is imminent. However, although several models estimate long-term risk of CHD over the next 10 years, there are no established models for predicting short-term risk of CHD within a one year time frame. Likewise, among patients with CHD, there are no existing models to assess the overall risk of coexisting ICM. To address these knowledge gaps in the field, I will build robust prediction models by applying the latest machine learning algorithms to the recently available large datasets comprising the UK Biobank and the Veterans Affairs (VA) cohorts.  In Aim 1, I will examine the 477,000 UK Biobank participants without preexisting CHD to develop a prediction model for one-year risk of new onset CHD. I will use several different machine learning algorithms, compare their respective predictive performances, and select the best-performing and most clinically applicable model. I will also compare the risk classification ability of this new model with existing long-term risk prediction models such as the Framingham and Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease (ASCVD) risk scores.  In Aim 2, I will apply machine learning techniques to a large VA patient cohort consisting of over 300,000 patients with known coronary anatomy and left ventricular systolic function to develop a prediction model for the presence of ICM. In light of the two primary mechanisms for ischemic cardiomyopathy, irreversible myocyte loss from MI and hibernating myocardium from chronic ischemia, I will perform a stratified analysis by history of prior MI to determine if the risk factors for ICM vary depending on whether the pathological mechanism is infarction versus ischemia.  An improved understanding of the predictors of CHD and ICM will lead to insights into the biological basis of ischemic heart disease. Moreover, accurate identification of individuals who are at imminent risk for CHD and its complication, ICM, is of central importance to efforts in preventing cardiovascular disease. PROJECT NARRATIVE Coronary heart disease and its complications such as ischemic cardiomyopathy are the global leading cause of morbidity and mortality, and an improved ability to assess risk along this continuum of ischemic heart disease is urgently needed. I will apply the latest machine learning techniques to the recently available large datasets comprising the UK Biobank and VA cohorts to develop robust prediction models for short-term risk of coronary heart disease and overall risk of ischemic cardiomyopathy.

"Imaging the Suicide Mind using Neurosemantic Signatures as Markers of Suicidal Ideation and Behavior ABSTRACT: The assessment of suicidal risk is critical for treatment planning and monitoring of therapeutic progress for suicidal individuals. Current standard-of-care relies on patient self-report and clinician impression, which are not strongly predictive of imminent suicidal risk. This project advances a highly innovative approach to the assessment of suicidal risk, by using machine-learning detection of brain activation patterns that are neural signatures of individual concepts that have been altered in suicidal individuals. The overarching goal is to establish reliable neurocognitive markers of suicidal ideation (SI) and attempt (SA) in individual participants, and to assess these measures’ ability to predict future ideation and attempts. In previous work, this approach was applied to the fMRI-based neurosemantic signature (NSS’s) during the thinking about each of 30 words related to either to suicide, negative concepts, or positive concepts in 17 SI young adults and 17 healthy controls (HCs). A machine learning classifier was able to discriminate between the SI and HCs with 91% accuracy, based on differential brain activation patterns in the L superior medial frontal cortex and anterior cingulate, areas known to be involved in self-referential thinking. Within the ideators, NSS’s also discriminated between those with a history of a SA from those without such a history with 94% accuracy. Moreover, using the classification algorithm derived from this sample, we were able to accurately classify a second sample of suicidal individuals with 87% accuracy. It was also possible to assess the emotions differentially manifested during the thinking about these words, and thus to differentiate SI from HC with 85% accuracy, and SI with and without SA with 88% accuracy. On the basis of these promising pilot findings, we propose to study 300 young adult SI (about half of whom will have made a SA), 100 never-suicidal psychiatric controls, and 100 HCs, use fMRI to assess NSS at intake and 3 months, and assess for suicidal ideation and behavior at intake, 3, 6, and 9 months thereafter. The goals are to determine if: (1) NSS’s are sensitive to changes in level of suicidal ideation when repeated at 3 months; and (2) whether NSS can predict trajectories of suicidal ideation and behavior upon prospective follow-up. We will also examine the relationship between NSS activation of circuits related to self-referential thinking and the death/suicide Implicit Association Test (IAT) that examines the extent to which a person associates suicide-related concepts with self. Finally, as a translational goal, we aim to develop and test a neurally based IAT that examines associations of suicidal concepts with self and with emotions as informed by NSS findings. This study, by shedding light on alterations in suicidal individuals’ neural representation of suicide-relevant concepts could be extremely useful for: (1) identification of those with suicidal ideation who may not self-report their level of risk; (2) monitoring fluctuations in suicidal risk over time; (3) identification of emotional states associated with suicidal ideation; (4) guiding therapy to mitigate these alterations; and (5) the prediction of future suicidal ideation and behavior. PROJECT NARRATIVE: This project takes a novel approach to the study of suicidal risk by examining the differences in brain activation patterns between suicidal and non-suicidal young adults when thinking about concepts related to suicide, negative, and positive emotions while undergoing neuroimaging. We use modern computing techniques called machine learning to identify brain activation patterns that differentiate suicidal and non-suicidal individuals and that can help to predict future suicidal ideation and behavior and will develop an easy-to-use computer test based on these brain activation studies that we hope will also be predictive of future suicidal ideation and behavior. If this project is as successful as our preliminary work, it will advance clinical practice by improving clinicians’ ability to: (1) detect and monitor suicidal risk, (2) understand alterations in thinking and feelings related to suicide in their patients; and (3) develop personalized treatment strategies for their suicidal patients based on their altered patterns of thinking and feeling that can more precisely and effectively reduce suicidal risk.",Imaging the Suicide Mind using Neurosemantic Signatures as Markers of Suicidal Ideation and Behavior,9543193,R01MH116652,"['Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Anterior', 'Area', 'Brain', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical assessments', 'Computers', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Feeling', 'Feeling suicidal', 'Frequencies', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Implicit Association Test', 'Individual', 'Intake', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Methods', 'Mind', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Neurocognitive', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Pilot Projects', 'Recording of previous events', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Severities', 'Shame', 'Suicide', 'Suicide attempt', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'cingulate cortex', 'clinical practice', 'design', 'follow-up', 'frontal lobe', 'ideation', 'impression', 'improved', 'innovation', 'longitudinal design', 'neural patterning', 'neuroimaging', 'novel strategies', 'personalized medicine', 'positive emotional state', 'predictive test', 'prospective', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'standard of care', 'suicidal', 'suicidal behavior', 'suicidal individual', 'suicidal morbidity', 'suicidal patient', 'suicidal risk', 'treatment planning', 'treatment strategy', 'young adult']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2018,798597,-0.10584253680747203
"Sudden Cardiac Arrest (SCA): Prediction and Prevention Project Summary: The recent advances in information technologies and biotechnologies is an opportunity to substantially improve healthcare. To exploit the power of data to benefit patients, however, effective clinical decision support tools and novel, individualized interventions must be designed, tested, and implemented. Although there has been progress in the development of statistical/machine learning methods, numerous challenges remain to tailor and translate them into useful clinical decision support tools. Sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) accounts for 15-20% of all adult deaths and is the industrial world’s leading cause of death. Clinical studies of SCA produce repeated measures on risk factors and multiple different kinds of events over time. We refer to these data as survival, longitudinal, and multivariate (SLAM) data. In this project, we will develop novel statistical learning methods for SLAM data and apply them to two distinct aspects of the SCA problem. First, we propose to develop novel statistical learning algorithms that better predict an individual’s multivariate longitudinal data with a focus on the risk of first and subsequent SCA. Second, we propose to develop micro-randomization and just-in-time adaptive intervention trial designs to reduce behavioral risk factors for SCA among persons at high risk. The methods that we propose to develop will be applicable in many areas of medicine. However, they are motivated by and applied to SCA in this project. Our team has expertise in statistics including causal inference, longitudinal data and survival analyses, plus machine learning, epidemiology, cardiology, and behavioral interventions through mobile health (mHealth). This proposed collaboration has the following specific aims: Aim 1: Develop and test statistical learning tools for real-time risk prediction of survival, longitudinal, and multivariate (SLAM) outcome data. Aim 2: Estimate the risk of SCA and its dependence on dynamic modifiable and non-modifiable factors in population-based and clinical cohorts. Aim 3: Plan and conduct a feasibility-usability study of micro-randomization and just-in-time adaptive intervention trial designs for behavioral change to reduce SCA risk. Upon successful completion of these aims, we will have contributed to the progress of healthcare delivery through the application of computational statistics to medicine. ! ! Project Narrative: Although sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) is the industrial world’s leading cause of death, SCA prediction and prevention strategies remain limited. In this project, we contribute towards addressing the global burden of SCAs through the development of novel statistical/machine learning methods for SCA risk prediction and the design of mobile health (mHealth) interventions for risk reduction.

"Using existing data to understand and ameliorate risk in opioid agonist therapy PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The United States is in the midst of an opioid epidemic, leading to unprecedented levels of overdose deaths and other harms. Effective treatment for opioid use disorders is available, in the form of opioid agonist therapy (OAT) with methadone or buprenorphine. However, there are significant questions about the risk of adverse clinical outcomes, including mortality and hospitalization during and after treatment, and unplanned treatment cessation. What is the magnitude of these risks, and what patient, treatment setting, and provider factors may contribute to or protect against risk? Additionally, it is increasingly clear that more sophisticated approaches to patient assessment and treatment planning than are currently used are needed to minimise risk. We aim to: 1. Determine the magnitude of risk for specific adverse clinical outcomes (e.g. mortality, hospitalization and ED presentation, and unplanned treatment cessation) during and after OAT with methadone and buprenorphine; 2. Identify patient, treatment setting, and provider risk factors associated with adverse clinical outcomes during and after OAT with methadone and buprenorphine; and 3. Develop a risk prediction model to identify patients at greatest risk of adverse clinical outcomes during and after OAT. To achieve these aims, this project will use existing population-based Australian data on OAT, linked to several health and criminal justice datasets to provide a rich understanding of treatment exposures and outcomes. These data will be used to inform strategies to guide the delivery of high-quality treatment for opioid use disorder in the United States. Specifically, the project will provide data about the magnitude of risk of adverse clinical outcomes during specific treatment and post-treatment periods, and identify patient, treatment setting and provider factors that influence risk. Additionally, it will use innovative machine learning techniques to demonstrate the potential for routinely collected data to be used to assess patient risk at point-of-care, allowing for the development of tailored treatment plans that minimize risk and maximize treatment retention. PROJECT NARRATIVE Opioid agonist therapy is an effective treatment for opioid use disorder, including prescription opioid use disorder. However, important questions about safety and risks during treatment remain unanswered.

"Understanding Severe Maternal Morbidity: Predictors, Trends, and Disparities PROJECT SUMMARY Severe maternal morbidity (SMM) includes serious threats to maternal health and survival that occur at delivery or postpartum. SMM, which includes postpartum hemorrhage, hypertensive disorders, sepsis, and other serious conditions, can be life-threatening and have long-term effects on a woman’s health as well as adversely impact her infant’s health and well-being. Over the past 15 years, the prevalence of SMM has doubled in the U.S., currently affecting more than 65,000 women each year. Additionally, the prevalence of SMM is highest in women of minority races and ethnicities, particularly women who are non-Hispanic black or Hispanic. However, the most important risk factors for SMM are not established and it is unknown what is contributing to racial/ethnic disparities and increasing trends in SMM. Our goal is to improve the understanding of SMM and its risk factors to provide evidence that supports efforts to reduce the prevalence of SMM and racial/ethnic disparities in SMM. The proposed project will use linked vital statistics, patient discharge, and U.S. Census data for over 4 million births in California from 2007 to 2014. We will test trends in SMM prevalence and calculate the population attributable risks for three key potential risk factors—advanced maternal age, prepregnancy obesity, and cesarean delivery—and their combination across the years of study (Aim 1). Additionally, we will examine a wide range of potential risk factors to identify those that are most important using a machine-learning/data-adaptive approach (Aim 2). Both study aims will be done in the overall sample and separately in racial/ethnic groups. Understanding SMM trends and determining the strongest predictors of SMM are critical steps to launch forward research of this pressing and understudied public health problem. Many factors may present crucial opportunities to prevent the development severe maternal morbidity—saving the lives of mothers and helping ensure a healthy future for their children. PROJECT NARRATIVE Each year, more and more new mothers are diagnosed with serious pregnancy-related medical conditions, particularly mothers who identify as racial/ethnic minorities. Research is urgently needed to understand what is driving this alarming problem and what puts women most at risk so future research can be conducted to guide interventions and clinical care for childbearing women.","Understanding Severe Maternal Morbidity: Predictors, Trends, and Disparities",9485199,F32HD091945,"['Affect', 'Automobile Driving', 'Birth', 'Birth Certificates', 'California', 'Censuses', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Cesarean section', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Child Care', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disadvantaged', 'Discipline of obstetrics', 'Disease', 'Ensure', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Ethnic group', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hispanics', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'ICD-9', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Infant Health', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Life', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Link', 'Long-Term Effects', 'Machine Learning', 'Maternal Age', 'Maternal Health', 'Maternal Mortality', 'Maternal Physiology', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Minority Groups', 'Modeling', 'Mothers', 'Neighborhoods', 'Not Hispanic or Latino', 'Outcome', 'Patient Discharge', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Population', 'Population Attributable Risks', 'Population Study', 'Postpartum Hemorrhage', 'Postpartum Period', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Outcome', 'Prevalence', 'Procedures', 'Public Health', 'Race', 'Records', 'Research', 'Retrospective cohort study', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Savings', 'Sepsis', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Time trend', 'Vital Statistics', 'Woman', 'Women&apos', 's Health', 'advanced maternal age', 'base', 'child bearing', 'clinical care', 'design', 'effective intervention', 'ethnic minority population', 'improved', 'indexing', 'maternal morbidity', 'outcome prediction', 'prepregnancy', 'prepregnancy obesity', 'prevent', 'racial and ethnic', 'racial and ethnic disparities', 'social', 'trend']",NICHD,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,F32,2018,58392,0.028221862121502767
"Adolescent Personality and the Incidence of Alzheimer's Disease and Alzheimer's Related Dementias in Later Life. Alzheimer’s Disease and Alzheimer’s related dementias (ADRD) are now regarded as a public health problem of pressing importance. While the race for disease-altering treatments continues, another strand of work has focused on identifying social and psychological precursors of these conditions. Such biopsychosocial risks often can be traced back to phases of life that predate symptom onset by years or decades. Therefore, a robust social and life course epidemiology of ADRD requires study designs that feature a) broad and deep psychosocial characterization of b) a large, population-relevant cohort c) during early phases of life, with d) medically-documented outcome data. Parent project R01AG053155 features a) through c), specifically in 90,000 members of the Project Talent cohort assessed in 1960 and again in 1970-74. The current supplement expands its scope to all members of Project Talent baseline (roughly 340,000) from 1960, and focuses on two scientific aims. The first seeks to estimate the relative risk of ADRD by the early 70s arising from adolescent personality traits, as documented in Medicare data linked to the cohort. One key feature of this aim is to determine if aspects of personality in adolescence are associated with ADRD incidence in later life independently of adolescent IQ, which is a known predictor. The second key aspect of this aim is to use the size and population representativeness of the sample to derive reasonably precise population-relevant effect size estimates of personality relative risks, and compare these effect sizes to benchmark risk estimates of adolescent IQ and socioeconomic status, which are considered to have policy and public health significance. The second aim also leverages the size and scope of the sample to identify personality traits which may moderate the ADRD risk of low adolescent IQ, in more complex and realistic patterns than can be studied in smaller or less representative data sets. This is accomplished via machine learning methods focused on identifying non-linear interactions via intensive cross-validation, another scientific question that takes full advantage of the size and scope of this unique cohort. Alzheimer’s Disease and Alzheimer’s related dementias are on the rise, due to both increasing life spans and the size of the Baby Boom generation as it reaches these later years. While scientists have yet to develop cures for dementias, it may be possible to learn how to prevent or delay their onset by studying life circumstances that give rise to these conditions. The goal of this project is to determine how personality traits in adolescence may compensate for the dementia risk posed by low adolescence IQ scores.",Adolescent Personality and the Incidence of Alzheimer's Disease and Alzheimer's Related Dementias in Later Life.,9688395,R01AG053155,"['Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease model', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Area', 'Awareness', 'Baby Booms', 'Back', 'Behavioral', 'Benchmarking', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Deltastab', 'Dementia', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Elderly', 'Etiology', 'Funding', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'High School Student', 'Incidence', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Life course epidemiology', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Medical', 'Medicare', 'Methods', 'Modification', 'Neurotic Disorders', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Personality', 'Personality Traits', 'Phase', 'Policies', 'Policy Maker', 'Population', 'Psychosocial Factor', 'Public Health', 'Race', 'Relative Risks', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Estimate', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Symptoms', 'Talents', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Validation', 'Work', 'biopsychosocial', 'cohort', 'epidemiologic data', 'exhaustion', 'flexibility', 'follow-up', 'learning strategy', 'member', 'middle age', 'mortality', 'parent project', 'population based', 'pre-clinical', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'psychologic', 'psychosocial', 'public health priorities', 'social', 'trait']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF ROCHESTER,R01,2018,287001,-0.036570392810075035
"Biobehavioral Studies of Cardiovascular Disease ABSTRACT Biobehavioral Studies of Cardiovascular Disease (PO1-HL040962) This Program Project (P01) continuation application focuses on the human brain substrates of behavioral and socio-environmental influences on cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk in midlife adults. Proposed are 3 Projects that are conceptually cross-linked and supported by 3 Core Units. Collaborative investigators represent multiple disciplines, including psychology, neuroscience, biophysics, medicine, psychoneuroimmunology, epidemiology, machine learning, bioinformatics, and statistics. Project 1 aims to elucidate functional and structural brain phenotypes that predict the multiyear progression of preclinical vascular disease and dysfunction, with a focus on neural circuitries for visceral control that coordinate autonomic, neuroendocrine, hemodynamic, and immune physiology with stress- and emotion-related behavioral processes. Project 2 aims to establish whether functional characteristics of these visceral control circuits moderate the influences of stress-related environmental exposures on the progression of preclinical vascular disease and dysfunction, tracking individuals' behavior and cardiovascular physiology in daily life to test a novel neuro-diathesis model of CVD risk. Project 2 also tests for the first time whether daily life physical activity associates with daily life stress physiology through its effects neural circuits for visceral control. Project 3 aims extend those of the other Projects by elucidating the neural and peripheral processes linking physical activity with physiological and psychophysiological markers of CVD risk (including daily life affect and stress physiology) using an experimental intervention methodology. These P01 aims are unique in cardiovascular behavioral medicine, and they will be pursued in the context of multi-component data collection efforts that satisfy all project-specific aims. As a result, the P01 will create new opportunities for integrative and translational science on the human neurobiology of CVD risk that cuts across multiple methods and levels of analysis. Helping to advance its parent field, the P01 will generate and disseminate original and expansive public-domain resources and tools to the broader scientific and clinical communities through comprehensive data and software sharing and educational objectives. Enabling a precise focus on early CVD etiology, the study cohorts comprise nearly 900 midlife adults without clinically apparent CVD, and study methods will include novel combinations of neuroimaging, ecological momentary assessments of experienced environments, ambulatory hemodynamic monitoring, autonomic, neuroendocrine, immune, and vascular assessments, laboratory clinical evaluations, hetero-method health behavior assessments, and arterial imaging. The 3 Core Units of this P01 provide for synergy and inter-project coordination by administrative, data management and participant accrual services; measurement and instrumentation support; and direction in cutting-edge bio-statistical and data-intensive (machine learning) analyses. The present application thus represents a thematic continuation and next- generation extension of translational neurobiological research on CVD by this P01, which was initiated in 1988. PROJECT NARRATIVE Biobehavioral Studies of Cardiovascular Disease (PO1-HL040962) This Program Project focuses on human brain substrates of behavioral and socio-environmental influences on cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk in midlife, with an emphasis on factors that moderate and mediate brain-to- risk relationships.

"Characterizing Trauma Outcomes: From Pre-trauma Risk to Post-trauma Sequelae Abstract Background: Trauma is common, but we have little ability to predict who will develop post-trauma psychopathology. Consistent challenges to our understanding of the etiology of post-trauma psychopathology include: (1) obtaining unbiased prospective data on risk factors preceding or concurrent with trauma; (2) the inability to model large comprehensive risk structures with traditional null hypothesis testing methods, despite the knowledge that risk factors do not operate in isolation; and (3) the almost universal focus on PTSD outcomes to date, while post-trauma psychopathology likely involves various symptoms spanning multiple disorder categories. The aims of this study are to (1) use data from a large, prospective population trauma cohort to establish multidimensional classes of post-trauma psychopathology which include diagnoses from various theoretically derived categories (e.g., stress diagnoses, mood disorders, personality disorders) and (2) to discover multivariate predictor sets and novel interactions which predict post- trauma psychopathology class membership and class transitions over time. Given the projected sample size we will also be able to examine gender differences in psychopathology and resilience, as well as differences by trauma type. Study Design: This study will make use of national prospective data previously assembled as part of an R21 project (and augmented with additional trauma data and more years of follow-up) to establish a trauma cohort from 1995 – 2015. Trauma cohort members will have experienced at least one of 10 traumatic events (i.e., fires/explosions, accidents and assaults, poisoning, life-threatening illness/injury, pregnancy-related trauma and sudden family deaths). Extensive pre- trauma and post-trauma data on psychiatric diagnoses, treatment (medication and psychotherapy) and social variables will be included. We will use latent class analyses to characterize multidimensional post-trauma psychopathology outcomes (including the absence of psychopathology) and latent transition analyses to examine changes in class membership over time. Machine learning statistical methods will be applied to the expansive risk factor data to develop multivariate predictor sets for outcome classes and class transitions over time. Bias analyses will be used to assess the impact of various forms of systematic error on our results. Implications: This study fulfills NIMH’s strategic priorities of (1) charting mental illness trajectories to determine when, where, and how to intervene and (2) strengthening the public health impact of NIMH-supported research. Our approach will achieve robust and valid risk profiles of post-trauma psychopathology in the most efficient way possible by using pre- existing prospective data from a full and unselected population. A life course multidimensional approach to trauma research is a critical next step in this field. In future work, psychopathology classes and multivariate predictor sets discovered as part of this study can be replicated and expanded in other populations to examine variations of our findings, and used as the basis for a more detailed exploration of newly discovered pathways to psychopathology risk and resilience following trauma. Narrative This large general population-based trauma cohort study will elucidate risk profiles for multidimensional psychopathology and resilience following trauma. Use of registry-based data from an unselected population and rigorous epidemiologic methods allows us to efficiently examine predictor combinations (e.g., psychiatric diagnoses, treatments, social variables), while minimizing bias.

"Novel computational techniques to detect the relationship between sitting patterns and metabolic syndrome in existing cohort studies. Abstract Metabolic syndrome is a cluster of conditions (increased blood pressure, high blood sugar, excess body fat around the waist, and abnormal cholesterol or triglyceride levels) that occur together, increasing risk of heart disease, stroke and diabetes. Epidemiological studies have shown that prolonged sitting is deleterious to metabolic indicators, even after adjusting for physical activity (PA). Acute laboratory trials have shown that breaking up sitting time can improve metabolic factors. Sitting is a prevalent behavior in all population groups by age, gender and ethnicity. Associations with metabolic syndrome factors, such as obesity, have also been shown in all population groups. Epidemiological studies have mostly depended on reported sitting time, especially TV reviewing. More recently large cohort studies have collected data from hip worn accelerometers and applied a cut point (e.g., 100 counts per minute) on single axis data to estimate sedentary time. Such devices have been included in numerous studies, principally because of their accuracy to measure PA intensity. Primarily used in intervention trials to reduce sitting, the thigh worn ActivPAL has been shown to more accurately assess posture and provide valid measures of sitting, standing, and sit-stand transitions. To date, very few health outcome cohort studies have included the ActivPAL. Compared to the ActivPAL and free living observations of sitting time, the 100 count cut point has been shown to underestimate prolonged sitting by substantially overestimating sit-stand transitions. New studies are showing that how we accumulate sitting time (i.e. in long or short bouts) is associated with metabolic health outcomes, and may be independent of total sitting time and PA. Study results on prolonged sitting and metabolic risk factors from accelerometer data are inconsistent and may be due to measurement error in the cut points employed. In a small sample of older women, adults, and youth we have demonstrated that novel machine learned methods can greatly improve estimates of prolonged sitting and transitions. Further development and testing of these methods would support valid applications to existing large cohort studies with raw accelerometer data to improve estimates of associations between sitting patterns and metabolic health. There are also many large cohorts (e.g. NHANES 2003/6), with quality health outcomes, but non raw accelerometer count data, so calibration methods to adjust non raw estimates of sitting time are also needed and would be attractive to researchers not yet familiar with the machine learning process. We proposed to employ 7 existing data sets (N=20,000) matched for age and spanning youth, adults and older adults. We will scale up our training and test the performance of the refined algorithms to detect sit-stand frequencies, prolonged sitting, usual bout duration and Alpha (a combination of duration & frequency). We will test performance of the algorithms against ActivPAL (ground truth) and in new samples assess predictive validity with objective health outcomes. We will test differences between the existing and new techniques using R2 and mean-squared error of prediction (via bootstrapping) and GEE techniques. Narrative There are many large studies with existing data that could be better used to understand health behaviors. We will focus on improving measurement of sitting patterns from body worn devices. We will see how sitting is related to obesity and other metabolic risk factors for chronic disease across different age groups.",Novel computational techniques to detect the relationship between sitting patterns and metabolic syndrome in existing cohort studies.,9524533,R01DK114945,"['Accelerometer', 'Acute', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'American Heart Association', 'Behavior', 'Blood Glucose', 'Blood Pressure', 'Body Patterning', 'Body fat', 'Calibration', 'Cholesterol', 'Chronic Disease', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cohort Studies', 'Computational Technique', 'Data', 'Data Quality', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Elderly', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Frequencies', 'Gender', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health behavior', 'Hip region structure', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Trial', 'Laboratories', 'Longitudinal cohort study', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic syndrome', 'Methods', 'National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Physical activity', 'Population Group', 'Posture', 'Process', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Stroke', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thigh structure', 'Time', 'Training', 'Triglycerides', 'Use of New Techniques', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Youth', 'age group', 'cohort', 'epidemiology study', 'heart disease risk', 'improved', 'indexing', 'novel', 'older women', 'performance tests', 'response', 'scale up', 'sedentary', 'young adult']",NIDDK,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2018,712358,-0.02695599303702724
"Risk Assessment of Influenza A Viruses Title: Risk Assessment of Influenza A Viruses Project Summary  Influenza A viruses (IAVs) have caused large losses of life around the world and continue to present a great public health challenge. Risk assessment of influenza viruses is a key component in pandemic influenza preparedness (PIP), and it can help optimize resources for influenza surveillance, vaccine development and other control measurements to help minimize losses due to an emerging influenza virus. Risk assessment of influenza viruses includes emergence risk and public health impact of novel influenza viruses. Emergence risk assesses the probability for a novel influenza virus to infect and easily spread among humans; it is the first risk to be evaluated in risk assessment.  Although a number of individual mutations or structural/functional motifs have been reported to be associated with influenza infection and transmission, their effects on emergence risk are difficult to predict a priori. Thus, conventional methods for assessment of the emergence risk of a novel IAV often require laboratory generation of reassortants and subsequent measurement of their infectivity, pathogenesis, and transmission, which is often done in a mammalian system. However, this strategy can lead to laboratory mutants with gain of function (i.e., mutants with new or enhanced activity on pathogenesis and/or transmissibility in mammals). Thus, an ideal system for influenza risk assessment should be able to quantify emergence risk for a novel IAV solely by using genomic sequences.  Avian influenza A viruses facilitated the emergence of all four known pandemic human influenza A viruses: the hemagglutinin genes of 1918, 1957, and 1968 pandemic viruses are all of avian origin, and the polymerase PB2 and PA genes of the 2009 pandemic virus are of avian origin. Risk assessment of potential reassortants from contemporary endemic human influenza viruses and enzootic avian influenza viruses has been a key component of the pandemic influenza preparedness process.  The objectives of this study are to develop and validate a machine learning method to assess the emergence risk for a novel IAV using genomic sequences. The study will focus on emergence risk from contemporary endemic human influenza viruses and enzootic avian influenza viruses. We expect to identify genetic features within and across gene segments and ascertain their synergistic effects as emergence risk determinants. We also expect to develop a computational model for estimating the probability of a possible reassortant to emerge, given the genomic sequences of one human influenza virus and one avian influenza virus. The study results should help with understanding the fundamental mechanisms for genetic reassortment and with assessing emergence risk of influenza virus; thus, the results should facilitate pandemic influenza preparedness. Project Narrative This project will develop a computational model for influenza risk assessment, and it will help with understanding the fundamental mechanisms for genetic reassortment and for assessing the emergence risk of influenza viruses, and thus the project will facilitate pandemic influenza preparedness.",Risk Assessment of Influenza A Viruses,9599007,R21AI135820,"['Affect', 'Animals', 'Avian Influenza A Virus', 'Base Sequence', 'Biological Assay', 'Birds', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Funding', 'Gene Combinations', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Materials', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Government', 'Hemagglutinin', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Influenza', 'Influenza A Virus, H1N1 Subtype', 'Influenza A Virus, H7N9 Subtype', 'Influenza A virus', 'Information Theory', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Luciferases', 'Machine Learning', 'Mammals', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mutation', 'Pathogenesis', 'Phenotype', 'Polymerase', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Readiness', 'Reassortant Viruses', 'Reporter', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Ribonucleoproteins', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Trees', 'Validation', 'Viral', 'Virus', 'Virus Replication', 'base', 'cost', 'enzootic', 'flu transmission', 'gain of function', 'genetic variant', 'in vivo', 'influenza surveillance', 'influenzavirus', 'learning strategy', 'multitask', 'mutant', 'novel', 'novel virus', 'pandemic disease', 'pandemic influenza', 'transmission process', 'vaccine development', 'virus genetics']",NIAID,MISSISSIPPI STATE UNIVERSITY,R21,2018,181875,0.0017368252743150642
"Obesity Prevention in Early Life (OPEL): Risk Screening and Targeted Intervention Given the difficulty of reversing obesity once present, there has been increasing focus on the primary prevention of obesity early in the lifecourse. Few attempts have been made to prevent obesity during the first years of life. This proposal summarizes a 5-year program of mentored professional development tied to a multi-method research project intended to improve the identification and potential treatment of infants and toddlers with high risk for obesity. My long-term goal is to prevent obesity by identifying infants at greatest risk and providing for them an effective, family-centered intervention that targets modifiable, life course factors. My central hypothesis, based on my prior research, is that identifying infants at risk for obesity prior to the onset of unhealthy weight gain will enable early intervention. My research plan aims to: (1) create risk prediction models for obesity at age 24 months by linking three existing data systems that combine birth certificate, contextual- level, and health outcome data; (2) test the feasibility of linking these data prospectively to validate the Aim 1 obesity risk prediction models over a 24-month period within a contemporary, clinical cohort; and (3) identify best approaches for family-focused risk communication regarding the prevention of excessive weight gain and obesity in infants and toddlers using a human-centered design approach. Through my career development plan and guidance from my mentors, I will expand upon a foundation in epidemiology and pediatric health services research to develop expertise in machine learning, health informatics, data integration, qualitative methods, human-centered design, and behavior change. Together, the research and educational aims of this proposal will provide me with the necessary groundwork to compete for additional funding as an independent investigator. Specifically, I will seek R03-level grant funding from the NIDDK in year 4 of my K01 award to test the communication strategy developed in Aim 3 and to partner with families to modify an existing behavioral change intervention for use in infancy. By the end of this award, I will be well positioned to apply for funding from the NIDDK to conduct a robust R01-level study that combines the validated prediction models, family- focused communication strategy, and modified intervention to determine whether we can effectively prevent obesity in those infants and toddlers identified as being at the highest risk. This line of research will help ensure that prevention efforts are deployed in an efficient, cost-effective manner and accepted by those who need them. I will accomplish this work under the mentorship of Dr. Aaron E. Carroll, a child health services researcher, and a multidisciplinary team of faculty with expertise machine learning, health informatics, data integration and surveillance, qualitative research, human-centered design approaches, behavior change, and childhood obesity. I am ideally suited to complete this research due to my past research productivity, current mentorship team, open access to health care data, and the established clinical decision support infrastructure at the Indiana University School of Medicine. ! Project Narrative Increasing evidence suggests that the infancy and toddler periods represent the best opportunity for obesity prevention, but few attempts have been made to prevent obesity during the first years of life. The current proposal seeks to develop practical methods to assess the risk of future obesity in infants and toddlers in the clinical setting, and to partner with families to explore new ways to communicate early life obesity risk in ways that account for their perceptions, concerns and beliefs. This proposal has the promise to lead to targeted, tailored interventions for infants most at-risk for obesity, ensuring that prevention efforts are deployed in an efficient, cost-effective manner and accepted by those who need them.",Obesity Prevention in Early Life (OPEL): Risk Screening and Targeted Intervention,9526588,K01DK114383,"['Address', 'Age', 'Age-Months', 'Award', 'Behavioral', 'Belief', 'Birth Certificates', 'Child', 'Child Health Services', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Epidemic', 'Epidemiology', 'Faculty', 'Family', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Geographic Information Systems', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health Services Research', 'Health Status', 'Human', 'Indiana', 'Infant', 'Information Systems', 'Intervention', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mentored Research Scientist Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Child Health and Human Development', 'National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Perception', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Pregnancy Histories', 'Prevention', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Primary Prevention', 'Process', 'Productivity', 'Public Health Informatics', 'Publishing', 'Qualitative Methods', 'Qualitative Research', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Source', 'Testing', 'Toddler', 'Universities', 'Weight', 'Weight Gain', 'Work', 'approach behavior', 'base', 'behavior change', 'career development', 'clinical decision support', 'cohort', 'cost effective', 'data access', 'data integration', 'data warehouse', 'design', 'epidemiologic data', 'health care availability', 'health data', 'healthy weight', 'high risk', 'improved', 'infancy', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'medical schools', 'multidisciplinary', 'obesity in children', 'obesity prevention', 'obesity risk', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'programs', 'prospective', 'screening', 'tool']",NIDDK,INDIANA UNIV-PURDUE UNIV AT INDIANAPOLIS,K01,2018,141114,0.020271168376573185
"Magnetic Resonance Imaging Based Calf Muscle Perfusion To Assess Patients with Symptomatic Peripheral Artery Disease Abstract: Peripheral artery disease (PAD) is associated with impaired leg function, possible limb loss and an increased risk of cardiovascular events. Intermittent claudication (IC) is a classic PAD symptom occurring in 40% of symptomatic patients, and is associated with 5-, and 15-year mortality rates of 30% and 70%, respectively. PAD is a debilitating illness affecting more than 8.5 million Americans of age 40 and older and 202 million people globally. Despite the high prevalence, PAD patients are less likely to receive appropriate treatment for their atherosclerotic risk factors than patients with coronary artery disease. Advances in endovascular therapy have reduced risks associated with intervention, enabling revascularization as a routine procedure in patients with lower extremity ischemia. However, revascularization success rates vary substantially and numerous PAD patients do not improve at 1-year despite technically good revascularization. Previous findings suggest that alterations in the microcirculation due to a paucity of collateralization may contribute to functional impairment in PAD patients. We hypothesize that the change in microvascular perfusion can identify PAD patients who do not improve at 12-months after revascularization. We will utilize contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (CE-MRI) to assess skeletal muscle perfusion in PAD patients. The CE-MRI measures will be associated with hemodynamics and symptoms. The early identification of individuals with a likely poor prognosis post intervention could help to improve surgical treatment strategies. We will investigate the association of microvascular perfusion (Aim 1) and measures of arterial hemodynamics (Aim 2) with leg function and PAD symptoms. We will utilize machine learning methodologies to identify predictors of poor leg function and symptoms (Aim 3). Given the high incidence of PAD and the associated high risk of cardiovascular events, it is paramount to identify individuals who are less likely to improve following lower extremity revascularization. The data of this clinical imaging study will provide novel information on the etiology of microvascular blood flow in PAD. Relevance: The proposed research study is of considerable public health importance given that patients with peripheral artery disease (PAD) have an increased risk of atherothrombotic cardiovascular events and mortality. The development of improved non-invasive imaging techniques to assess PAD may enable optimized treatment for individuals who are at an increased risk of future cardiovascular events.",Magnetic Resonance Imaging Based Calf Muscle Perfusion To Assess Patients with Symptomatic Peripheral Artery Disease,9534732,R01HL137763,"['Affect', 'Age', 'American', 'Ankle', 'Arteries', 'Blood Vessels', 'Blood flow', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical assessments', 'Comorbidity', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Data', 'Data Reporting', 'Development', 'Disease Outcome', 'Early identification', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Exercise', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'High Prevalence', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Impairment', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Intermittent Claudication', 'Intervention', 'Ischemia', 'Leg', 'Legal patent', 'Limb structure', 'Literature', 'Lower Extremity', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical center', 'Methodist Church', 'Methodology', 'Microcirculation', 'Muscle', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Oxygen', 'Partial Pressure', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perfusion', 'Peripheral arterial disease', 'Phase', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Pilot Projects', 'Procedures', 'Public Health', 'Recovery', 'Reference Values', 'Resolution', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Signal Transduction', 'Skeletal Muscle', 'Standardization', 'Superficial Femoral Artery', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Toes', 'Treadmill Tests', 'Ultrasonography', 'Validation', 'Veterans', 'Walking', 'atherosclerosis risk', 'base', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'contrast enhanced', 'contrast imaging', 'functional disability', 'hemodynamics', 'high risk', 'imaging modality', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'mortality', 'non-invasive imaging', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'post intervention', 'recruit', 'regional difference', 'research study', 'skeletal', 'success', 'successful intervention', 'symptomatic improvement', 'treadmill', 'treatment optimization', 'treatment strategy', 'two-dimensional']",NHLBI,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R01,2018,550853,-0.0014615503808355357
"MyHealthyPregnancy mobile health app: Combining behavioral science and machine learning for risk communication during the peripartum period Project Summary/Abstract Background: Preterm births, those that occur prior to 37 weeks of gestation, are the leading direct cause of neonatal mortality and morbidity. More than 1 in 9 births in the U.S. are preterm, with rates that are disproportionately high among African-Americans and families living in poverty, regardless of race. Addressing the problem of preterm birth requires both accurate identification of the factors that put women at risk, and communication of that risk to women and their healthcare providers. The reduction in preterm births is a core mission of the NICHD Pregnancy and Perinatology Branch. Study aims: 1) Apply our novel machine learning algorithm, KCI-neighbors, to a large prospective cohort study to model adverse pregnancy outcomes among women with low income and English literacy, 2) use mixed-methods research, grounded in decision science techniques, to tailor the MyHealthyPregnancy (MHP) app to the specific needs of low income and low English literacy patients, and 3) conduct small- scale usability testing of the modified technology with a sample of peripartum low-income, low-literacy patients to determine the app's acceptability and interested in targeted intervention strategies. Innovation: MHP is the first mobile health app that combines machine learning, expert models, and behavioral decision research to provide pregnant women and their providers scientifically sound, highly personalized, and actionable feedback on individual-level risk. The machine learning algorithms are designed to learn from users as the app is more widely deployed, allowing for the identification of new causal pathways linking risk factors to adverse pregnancy outcomes. MHP targets specific engagement metrics (e.g. appointment attendance) to meet health system stakeholders' goals, enabling healthcare systems to meet performance targets, as well as decrease costs through reduced adverse outcomes. Methodology and expected results: We will employ statistical machine learning to model the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes, complemented by qualitative mixed-methods research to identify the most important measures to include in the MHP app. We anticipate that usability-testing will show an engaging app, capable of capturing and communicating risks in our target population. Potential impact: This work will advance scientific understanding of the risk factors, needs, and implementation science required to reach pregnant women who experience the most difficulty engaging in the healthcare system. Moreover, it will help improve clinical practice through development of a tool, MHP, that can detect and communicate preterm birth precursor risk to both patients and providers. Project Narrative Preterm birth affects millions of families in the United States, with severe health consequences for surviving infants and their families. Determining the factors that put individual women at greatest risk, and communicating those factors in a decision-relevant manner, requires a deep understanding of the patient population. The proposed research integrates individual-level interviews from women in a low income and low English literacy population, with novel statistical machine learning algorithms and a user-centered design approach, to deliver a personalized, engaging, and effective pregnancy risk communication mobile health application: MyHealthyPregnancy.",MyHealthyPregnancy mobile health app: Combining behavioral science and machine learning for risk communication during the peripartum period,9681309,R43DP006417,[' '],NCCDPHP,"NAIMA HEALTH, LLC",R43,2018,224843,0.024302670696650836
"Predicting In-hospital Cardiac Arrest Using Electronic Health Record Data DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In-hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA) is a significant public health problem, afflicting over 200,000 patients in the United States annually with a mortality rate of approximately 80%. The majority of these patients show signs of clinical deterioration in the hours before the event. This has led to the development of vital sign-based early warning scores designed to detect high-risk patients before IHCA to trigger life-saving interventions. However, the vast majority of these risk scores were created subjectively in individual hospitals and have shown limited accuracy for detecting adverse outcomes. Developing an accurate risk score to detect patients at highest risk of IHCA is essential to decreasing preventable in-hospital death. In my prior work, I completed several studies investigating the accuracy of vital signs for predicting IHCA. These studies, previous literature, and my preliminary data have resulted in the following conclusions: 1) statistically developed risk scores are more accurate than previously published risk scores, 2) multicenter data is needed to create the most accurate and generalizable risk score, 3) additional data, such as laboratory results, will likely improve the accuracy of risk scores, and 4) a cutting-edge method for developing prediction models, called machine learning, may result in more accurate risk scores. Importantly, significant improvement in accuracy leads to better identification of patients at highest risk of IHCA and decreased resource utilization. Therefore, in this grant proposal I aim to develop and validate IHCA prediction models using different statistical techniques in a multicenter database and then estimate the impact of the most accurate risk score using simulation studies. I will do this by firt developing prediction models using classic survival analysis methods (Aim 1a) and machine learning methods, such as neural networks and decision trees (Aim 1b). Then, I will compare the models I develop to the most accurate previously published risk scores in Aim 2. Finally, I will investigate the impact of the most accurate model from Aim 2 on patient outcomes using simulation modeling (Aim 3). Completion of this proposal will result in a validated IHCA risk score that can be implemented in the electronic health record to trigger life- saving interventions to decrease preventable in-hospital death. In addition, this career development award will provide critical data to inform future R01-level awards, including a clinical trial to investigate he impact of the developed prediction model on patient outcomes. I will complete this project under the direct supervision of my mentor (Dr. David Meltzer), co-mentor (Dr. Dana Edelson), and the rest of my advisory team (Drs. Jesse Hall, Robert Gibbons, and Michael Kattan). Together, this multidisciplinary team brings nationally renowned expertise in in-hospital cardiac arrest, outcomes research, critical care, and clinical prediction modeling. In addition, they serve as Chairs of the Section of Hospital Medicine (Dr. Meltzer), Section of Pulmonary and Critical Care (Dr. Hall), and Quantitative Health Sciences at the Cleveland Clinic (Dr. Kattan), and Directors of the Center for Health and the Social Sciences (Dr. Meltzer), Center for Health Statistics (Dr. Gibbons), and Clinical Research for the Emergency Resuscitation Center (Dr. Edelson). The mentorship, expertise, and resources that they provide will ensure my success as I grow into an independent physician-scientist. My career goal is to become an independent critical care outcomes researcher with a focus on developing prediction models for clinical deterioration that will improve patient outcomes. To accomplish this long-term goal, I have three short-term goals: (1) to gain expertise in the development and implementation of clinical prediction models, (2) to create an IHCA prediction model that will identify high-risk patients on the wards to trigger life-saving interventions, and (3) to gain expertise in simulation modeling in order to study the impact of the developed prediction model. To accomplish these goals, I will build upon the foundation I developed when earning my Master's Degree in Public Health and during my initial training in the PhD program in the Department of Health Studies. Although my training to date has provided me with a strong background in epidemiology and biostatistics, further advanced training in biostatistics is crucial for my development into a successful independent researcher. An integrated program of didactic coursework, seminars, research activities, and conference participation will span the duration of the award. By accomplishing my three short- term goals, I will develop unique skills that will allow me to become a successful independent researcher. Specifically, the expertise I will gain in prediction model development, implementation, and simulation modeling can be applied not only to IHCA research but also to other areas of critical care medicine. In addition, completion of these goals will result in a validated IHCA prediction model that I will study in future implementation and cost-effectiveness studies and will serve as a basis for future R01-level grant submissions. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Over 200,000 in-hospital cardiac arrests occur in the United States each year, and studies suggest that many of these events may be preventable if the clinical warning signs can be identified and acted upon quickly. However, the vast majority of tools used to identify patients at high risk of cardiac arrest were created subjectively and have limited accuracy. Development of a statistically derived risk tool is essential to detect at- risk patients accurately and early in order to provide the best opportunity to improve patient outcomes and reduce preventable in-hospital death.",Predicting In-hospital Cardiac Arrest Using Electronic Health Record Data,9393346,K08HL121080,"['Adult', 'Advisory Committees', 'Applications Grants', 'Area', 'Award', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Biometry', 'Brain', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Categories', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complex', 'Critical Care', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Trees', 'Deterioration', 'Development', 'Diastolic blood pressure', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emergency research', 'Ensure', 'Epidemiology', 'Event', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Health Sciences', 'Heart Arrest', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Hylobates Genus', 'Individual', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Laboratories', 'Life', 'Literature', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Master&apos', 's Degree', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Patient Discharge', 'Patient risk', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Procedures', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Resuscitation', 'Risk', 'Savings', 'Scientist', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Social Sciences', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Supervision', 'Survival Analysis', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Uncertainty', 'United States', 'Update', 'Validation', 'Work', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'care outcomes', 'career', 'clinical implementation', 'cost effectiveness', 'design', 'evidence base', 'high risk', 'implementation strategy', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'model development', 'models and simulation', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'simulation', 'skills', 'statistics', 'success', 'symposium', 'tool', 'ward']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,K08,2018,163944,-0.0007106302817135989
"Epidemiology and clinical outcomes of diabetic macular edema Approximately 25% of the millions of veterans (est. 8.92 million FY 2013) enrolled for care in Veterans Health Administration (VHA) have diabetes mellitus, and diabetic macular edema (DME) is the leading cause of vision loss in the adult diabetic population world-wide. Although diabetic retinopathy has been well-studied, comparatively little is known about the burden of DME. In fact, only two national prevalence studies and no national study on the incidence of DME in persons with type 2 diabetes have been conducted. Similarly many risk factors have been characterized for DR, but no large studies have established predictors for DME.  Beyond the Medicare claims database, the VHA National Patient Care Database (NPCD) contains standardized administrative data for several aspects of patient care including diagnoses, procedures, medications, lab test results, vital signs, clinical text notes, and mortality. Because the VA uses teleretinal screening as routine clinical care for all patients with diabetes with these results included in the NPCD, the NPCD is an ideal source for studying the epidemiology of and risk factors for DME.  This study proposes to determine the burden of diabetic macular edema, establish risk factors, and examine treatment outcomes in a previously extracted dataset on 1.98 million veterans who have undergone diabetic retinopathy screening at least once since 2004. Currently invaluable ophthalmic data are encoded in unstructured clinical encounter notes in the Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS), and no validated automated extraction method exists to capture these data elements. An automated extraction method using natural language processing will be created and validated to unlock key ophthalmic variables. These text extraction methods will be applicable to extracting ophthalmology data from not only notes of patients with DME but also any ophthalmology clinical note. This will enable future large scale studies in ophthalmology using NPCD and be immediately valuable to the research community at large.  The candidate, Dr. Aaron Lee, MD MSCI, is an ophthalmologist with subspecialty training in retina surgery with a strong background in computer science and epidemiology. His career goal is to become an independent clinician scientist studying diabetic eye disease with large-scale electronic medical record extracted data. While he possesses the foundational skills, he seeks to gain training in advanced statistics and natural language processing to unlock the data captured in unstructured clinical encounter notes. He has assembled an outstanding mentorship team under the primary mentor, Dr. Edward Boyko, MD MPH. This mentorship team includes renowned experts in clinical epidemiology, health informatics, ophthalmology, and natural language processing. This K23 will provide Dr. Lee the structured coursework, mentorship, and applied learning needed to acquire new research skills. He will leverage key local resources to carry out the proposed research at the University of Washington and the VA Seattle Epidemiologic Research and Information Center. Despite the significant visual loss associated with diabetic macular edema, little is known about the frequency of its occurrence, its risk factors, and the real-world effectiveness of existing treatments. The purpose of this proposed research is to utilize the VA National Patient Care Database to extract relevant data elements to examine these three clinical questions: 1) what is the incidence and prevalence of diabetic macular edema, 2) what are the risk factors associated with its development, and 3) what is the comparative real-world effectiveness of its treatments, including intravitreal anti-VEGF therapy, intravitreal corticosteroid therapy and macular laser. The methods developed in this research proposal will not only further our understanding of DME but also generalize and enable future large-scale ophthalmic studies.",Epidemiology and clinical outcomes of diabetic macular edema,9574973,K23EY029246,"['Adopted', 'Adrenal Cortex Hormones', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Anemia', 'Blindness', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Caring', 'Cataract Extraction', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Computerized Patient Records', 'Data', 'Data Element', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diabetic Retinopathy', 'Diagnosis', 'Dyslipidemias', 'Effectiveness', 'Enrollment', 'Epidemiology', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Exclusion Criteria', 'Expressed Sequence Tags', 'Eye', 'Eye diseases', 'Foundational Skills', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Handedness', 'Hypertension', 'Incidence', 'Information Centers', 'Injections', 'Intervention', 'Kidney', 'Lasers', 'Lead', 'Light Coagulation', 'Manuals', 'Masks', 'Measures', 'Medicare claim', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Ophthalmologist', 'Ophthalmology', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Prevalence', 'Prevalence Study', 'Procedures', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health Informatics', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Regimen', 'Research', 'Research Proposals', 'Resources', 'Retina', 'Retinal', 'Risk Factors', 'Scientist', 'Severities', 'Sleep Apnea Syndromes', 'Smoking Status', 'Source', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'System', 'Test Result', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Treatment outcome', 'Universities', 'Use Effectiveness', 'Validation', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factors', 'Veterans', 'Visual', 'Visual Acuity', 'Washington', 'bevacizumab', 'career', 'clinical care', 'clinical epidemiology', 'cohort', 'comparative', 'computer science', 'diabetes management', 'diabetic', 'epidemiology study', 'hands-on learning', 'health administration', 'intravitreal injection', 'laser photocoagulation', 'macula', 'macular edema', 'mortality', 'proliferative diabetic retinopathy', 'screening', 'skills', 'statistics', 'therapy outcome', 'traditional therapy', 'treatment optimization']",NEI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,K23,2018,237398,-0.008777366283109352
"A Novel Probabilistic Methodology for Prediction of Emerging Diseases in Patients with Multiple Chronic Conditions ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Treatment for people living with multiple chronic conditions (MCC) currently accounts for an estimated 66 percent of the Nation's health care costs and will continue to grow. This mounting challenge has become a major public health issue since MCC is linked to suboptimal health outcomes and rising health care costs. However, it now known how MCC emerge among individuals or in the general population. Traditional epidemiological approaches have led to important findings of disease links and comorbidity associations. However, they are limited in their ability to characterize how patients acquire new chronic conditions and predict/personalize the emergence of MCC for individual patients. Objectives: This study will develop approaches that can be used to identify the most likely combinations of comorbidity within a population. These approaches can be tailored to examine MCC patterns in specific sub- populations or at the level of the individual patient. We will also study the effect of a large set of risk factors on MCC combinations emergence. Furthermore, we will use data mining approaches to predict and monitor the development of MCC combinations in at the population and individual levels. Hypotheses: We hypothesize that the emergence and progression of comorbidities in MCC patients form patterns that can be predicted and which are associated with prior medical conditions, demographic, and socio-economic characteristics. We further hypothesize that these methods can predict the timing and emergence of new chronic diseases more accurately by personalizing the records for individual patients. Aims and methodology: in Aim1, we will characterize how MCC emerge and progress in distinct patterns and how these patterns transition between different combinations of diseases over time. We will then identify and group major MCC transitions using the Markov clustering (MCL) algorithm, which is a novel, efficient graphical approach to handle big data. In Aim 2, we will identify which risk factors are associated with MCC emergence using a machine learning approach that can handle the complex heterogeneity of comorbidity patterns. Risk factors include age, sex, race/ethnicity, education, economic status, marital status, and prior medical conditions. In Aim 3, we will use a similarity learning approach to develop models that can predict if MCC will emerge in individual patients or among populations and we will be able to use these models to monitor MCC emergence over time. Conclusion: Our findings will provide a foundation for future research that will evaluate specific treatment patterns associated with progression in MCC patterns and ultimately identify optimal time points of intervention for those with, or at risk for multiple chronic conditions. These findings will also provide information that can be used at the community level to manage healthcare resources to improve continuity and accessibility of care.

"Dynamic, real-time prediction of alcohol use lapse using mHealth technologies ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Available psychosocial and pharmacological treatments for alcohol use disorder are effective at establishing abstinence. However, the vast majority of patients relapse within a year and often within the first few months following treatment. Patients often fail to detect dynamic changes in their relapse risk. Furthermore, the majority of patients fail to adequately sustain use of skills developed during treatment and/or through continuing care. Well-established theoretical models indicate that alcohol and other drug use lapse risk is a dynamic, non-linear function of both distal, relatively static, patient characteristics and often moment-by- moment dynamic changes in proximal, precipitating risk factors. However, comprehensive, precise assessment of dynamic risk indicators in real-time has not been possible until very recently. Furthermore, innovative methods from predictive analytics have not been applied to the lapse risk prediction problem. The broad goals of this project are to develop, validate, preliminarily optimize, and deliver a dynamic, real-time lapse risk prediction model for forecasting alcohol use among abstinent alcoholics. To pursue these goals, we propose to follow 200 patients for three months during or following completion of standard of care treatment for alcohol use disorder. We will measure well-established distal, static relapse risk indicators on study intake. More importantly, we will use innovative mHealth technology to densely sample dynamic risk indicators including patient physiology, subjective experience, and behavior daily for three months using smartphones and wearable biometric sensors. Data obtained for these static and dynamic risk indicators will provide the foundation to accomplish the following Specific Aims: 1. Assess burden (feasibility, cost, and patient acceptability) to collect innovative, densely sampled risk indicators via smartphone and wearable sensors. 2. Use machine learning methods to develop, train, and validate a real-time quantitative lapse risk prediction signal based on static and dynamic risk indicators. 3. Use innovative Markov decision process models to optimize decisions about if, when, and how to provide additional treatment or support. 4. Integrate and deliver risk prediction and decision model within the Comprehensive Health Enhancement Support System for Addiction (A-CHESS) program. These project aims position A-CHESS to make relapse prevention and recovery support, information, and risk monitoring available to patients continuously. Compared to conventional continuing care, A-CHESS will provide personalized care and be available and implemented during moments of greatest need. Integrated real-time risk prediction holds substantial promise to encourage sustained recovery through adaptive use of these continuing care services. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goals of this project are to develop and deliver a dynamic, real-time model for forecasting alcohol use lapse among abstinent alcoholics. This lapse risk prediction model will be integrated into an existing validated mHealth platform to encourage sustained recovery through adaptive use of continuing care services.","Dynamic, real-time prediction of alcohol use lapse using mHealth technologies",9493347,R01AA024391,"['Abstinence', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Behavior', 'Biometry', 'Caring', 'Cellular Phone', 'Characteristics', 'Communities', 'Comorbidity', 'Competence', 'Data', 'Decision Modeling', 'Dependence', 'Distal', 'Drug Use Disorder', 'Drug usage', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Galvanic Skin Response', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Services', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Heart Rate', 'Intake', 'Intervention', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motivation', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmacological Treatment', 'Physiology', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predictive Analytics', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Psychopathology', 'Recovery', 'Relapse', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Services', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sleep', 'Support System', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Theoretical model', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'United States Department of Veterans Affairs', 'Validation', 'Voice', 'Withdrawal', 'addiction', 'alcohol abuse therapy', 'alcohol and other drug', 'alcohol involvement', 'alcohol use disorder', 'base', 'care systems', 'clinical application', 'coping', 'cost', 'craving', 'disorder later incidence prevention', 'experience', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'mHealth', 'model development', 'optimal treatments', 'personalized care', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'problem drinker', 'programs', 'psychosocial', 'public health relevance', 'real time model', 'relapse patients', 'relapse risk', 'relative cost', 'response', 'sensor', 'skills', 'standard of care', 'stressor', 'wearable device']",NIAAA,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R01,2018,381816,-0.035999116974761894
"Robust Predictors of Mania and Psychosis PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  The purpose of the new funding opportunity announcement, RFA-OD-17-004 for Intensive Longitudinal Analysis of Health Behaviors: Leveraging New Technologies To Understand Health Behaviors (U01), is to establish a cooperative agreement network to collaboratively study factors that influence key health behaviors in the dynamic environment of individuals, using intensive longitudinal data collection and analytic methods. Importantly, progress has been slow and frustrating in translating knowledge of the brain to new and more effective treatments for human brain diseases such as severe mental disorders. In fact, severe mental disorders, which include psychotic disorders, are brain diseases that are not only devastating because they result in severe disruptions that occur early in life, but, for many, the course of illness is progressive, leading to chronic debilitation and early mortality. Thus the need to accelerate knowledge about the factors that trigger (or increase or decrease the likelihood) of manic and psychotic episodes, and to translate this knowledge to more effective treatment interventions, is critical. The primary goal of the proposed “Robust Predictors of Mania and Psychosis” is to identify biological, environmental, and social factors that trigger dangerous mental states, particularly mania and psychosis, in individuals known to be at risk for these conditions. The eventual goal of this work is to provide quantifiable and predictable information that can be used to scaffold biological observations and tailor intervention strategies to maximize efficacy at the individual level. We first develop models to predict conventional clinical measures specific to psychosis and mania using (1) digital, low- to-minimal burden interactions through smartphones and wearables (Aim 1), and (2) measures extracted from face and voice during in-person clinical interactions (Aim 2), work which leverages existing data we have already collected. We will next collect one hundred person-years of pseudo-continuous multivariate behavioral data from one hundred individuals with a psychotic disorder, to further test and validate our early observations in a wider array of individuals with affective and non-affective psychotic disorders, who are likely to experience illness fluctuations within a one-year timeframe, employing several strategies to optimize participant engagement (Aim 3). We will also perform, as a representative example, a study comparing sleep, energy expenditure, and mania symptoms over time, using data obtained in the first three aims, to quantify how the relationship between energy expenditure and energy perception varies across our study population in ways that could have important consequences for health behaviors (Aim 4). The main goals of this project are thus to acquire high quality, temporally dense behavioral, cognitive, and clinical data on an important cohort of young adult patients, not only to facilitate future investigations linking these behavioral change points to neurobiological processes but also as a precursor to more effective, targeted therapeutics, such as real-time interventions that could be delivered based on dynamic factors in an individual's environment. 8. PROJECT NARRATIVE The main goal of the proposed “Robust predictors of mania and psychosis” is to identify biological, environmental, and social factors that trigger dangerous mental states, particularly mania and psychosis, in individuals known to be at risk for these conditions by acquiring high quality, temporally dense, longitudinal behavioral data, and using machine learning approaches to iteratively identify factors that increase or decrease the likelihood of these conditions. We focus on early psychosis (both affective and non-affective psychosis), which is a critical time period when there are fewer confounds such as prolonged medication exposure and chronicity, and when early intervention strategies will be most effective, prior to the progression that often leads to debilitating and chronic illnesses, to great suffering, and to an enormous public health problem and economic burden. By developing predictors for mania and psychosis from smartphone, wearable, and audio- video data and then testing these predictors over 100 person-years in individuals with active psychotic disorders, the data collected will make it possible to identify specific factors in the physical, social, and/or built environment that facilitate or hinder healthy behaviors in early psychosis and bipolar disorder and lay the groundwork for tailored intervention strategies that fully account for these factors to maximize efficacy at the individual level.",Robust Predictors of Mania and Psychosis,9577994,U01MH116925,"['Acoustics', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Categories', 'Cellular Phone', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Cognitive', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Dangerousness', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Collection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Early Intervention', 'Economic Burden', 'Energy Metabolism', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Face', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding Opportunities', 'Future', 'Gestures', 'Goals', 'Health behavior', 'Hospitalization', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Manic', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medical Records', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Neurobiology', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Perception', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physical environment', 'Process', 'Prospective Studies', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Risk', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sleep', 'Social Environment', 'Symptoms', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translating', 'U-Series Cooperative Agreements', 'Visual', 'Voice', 'Work', 'Wrist', 'actigraphy', 'analytical method', 'base', 'built environment', 'case control', 'cohort', 'design', 'digital', 'disability', 'early onset', 'effective therapy', 'energy balance', 'experience', 'gaze', 'individual patient', 'longitudinal analysis', 'longitudinal design', 'mental state', 'mortality', 'new technology', 'phenotypic data', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive test', 'prospective', 'psychotic symptoms', 'scaffold', 'sensor', 'severe mental illness', 'social', 'study population', 'targeted treatment', 'theories', 'time use', 'wearable device', 'young adult']",NIMH,MCLEAN HOSPITAL,U01,2018,755313,-0.012039586732984981
"Devaluing Energy-Dense Foods for Cancer Control: Translational Neuroscience 7. Abstract Obesity and intake of certain foods increases cancer risk, but the most common treatment (behavioral weight loss programs) rarely produces lasting weight loss and eating behavior change, apparently because caloric restriction increases the reward value of food and prompts energy-sparing adaptations. Interventions that reduce the implicit valuation of cancer-risk foods (e.g., red meats, refined sugar) may be more effective. Emerging data suggest that behavioral response training and cognitive reappraisal training reduce valuation of such foods, which leads to decrease intake of these foods and weight loss. Internalized incentive value is reflected in a ventromedial prefrontal/orbitofrontal cortex valuation system (“vmPFC”), which encodes the implicit reward value of food and is central to a reinforcement cycle that perpetuates unhealthy eating. Thus, the vmPFC valuation system is a promising target for intervention because changes to the system might disrupt the unhealthy reinforcement cycle. Interestingly, various interventions influence the vmPFC through distinct pathways. Behavioral training alters motor input to valuation regions, whereas cognitive training relies on lateral prefrontal “top-down” regions. The proposed translational neuroscience experiment will compare the efficacy with which two novel treatments cause lasting change in food valuation, and whether a composite of theory-based baseline individual differences in relevant processes (such as response tendencies and cognitive styles) moderate treatment effects. We will randomize 300 overweight/obese adults who are at risk for eating- and obesity-related cancers to behavioral response training toward healthy foods and away from cancer-risk foods, a cognitive reappraisal intervention focused on cancer-risk foods, or non–food inhibitory control training. Aim 1 compares the efficacy and mechanisms of action of these two interventions to reduce valuation of cancer-risk foods relative to the active control condition, using neural, behavioral, self-report, and physiological measures of the process and outcomes. Aim 2 is to establish the temporal pattern and durability of the effects across time ; food intake and habits , body fat, BMI, and waist-to-hip ratio will be measured pre, post, and at 3-, 6-, and 12-month follow-up. Aim 3 uses machine learning to build and validate a low-cost, easy-to-administer composite that predicts whether and for how long an individual is likely to respond to intervention, and to which treatment. We hypothesize that self-report measures specifically related to valuation (e.g., willingness-to-pay) and to intervention-specific pathways to valuation (e.g., behavioral response tendencies, cognitive style) will predict differential response. Discovering these individual differences will provide a practical, low-cost tool to help interventionists “match” a given person to an effective treatment for that person . This project is very innovative because no study has directly compared the distinct and common effects of these treatments on valuation, used brain imaging to study the mechanism of effects, tested whether these interventions produce a lasting change in food valuation and body fat, or built and validated a composite that moderates response . 8. Project Narrative Excessive eating of energy-dense and obesity are risk factors for a range of cancers. There are programs to reduce intake of these foods and weight loss, but the effects of the programs rarely last. This project tests whether altering the value of cancer-risk foods can create lasting change, and uses neuroimaging to compare the efficacy of two programs to engage the valuation system on a neural level. Results will establish the pathways through which the programs work and suggest specific treatments for individuals based on a personalized profile.",Devaluing Energy-Dense Foods for Cancer Control: Translational Neuroscience,9513489,R01CA211224,"['Adopted', 'Adult', 'Behavioral', 'Body Weight decreased', 'Body fat', 'Body mass index', 'Brain imaging', 'Caloric Restriction', 'Calories', 'Cancer Control', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive Therapy', 'Data', 'Dietary intake', 'Eating', 'Eating Behavior', 'Food', 'Food Habits', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Health Food', 'High-Risk Cancer', 'Incentives', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Informal Social Control', 'Intake', 'Intervention', 'Lateral', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Meat', 'Mediating', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Neurobiology', 'Obesity', 'Obesity associated cancer', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Overweight', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Physiological', 'Process', 'Process Measure', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Randomized', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Route', 'Stimulus', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Waist-Hip Ratio', 'Work', 'active control', 'adult obesity', 'arm', 'base', 'behavior change', 'behavioral economics', 'behavioral response', 'cancer risk', 'cognitive reappraisal', 'cognitive training', 'common treatment', 'comparative efficacy', 'cost', 'cost efficient', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'experimental arm', 'experimental study', 'follow-up', 'food consumption', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'intervention effect', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'obesity risk', 'personalized medicine', 'programs', 'recruit', 'reduced food intake', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sugar', 'theories', 'tool', 'translational neuroscience', 'treatment arm', 'treatment effect', 'weight loss program', 'willingness to pay']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF OREGON,R01,2018,705027,0.005006145873287825
"Diseases of Despair in Young Adulthood: Risk, Resilience, and Prevention ABSTRACT After decades of improvement, premature mortality is uniquely on the rise in the U.S. among White non- Hispanic adults with low education. Suicide, drug poisoning (particularly from opiates), and alcoholic liver disease appear to be the culprits and have been coined “deaths of despair.” Suicidal thoughts and behaviors, illicit drug use, and alcohol problems (or “diseases of despair,” DoD)—the conditions that likely precede these deaths—are the focus of this application, as are the pathways to these DoD. Despite many years of research and in the face of rising suicides and a nationwide opiates public health emergency, we lack accurate and appreciable predictions of who will succumb to DoD and who will be shielded from them. Speedy new insights on the development of DoD are needed to inform efforts to reverse the rising tide of DoD. These can only be generated with decades' worth of prospective-longitudinal data with rich coverage of multiple levels of risk and protective factors—from community contexts to molecular mechanisms—with clinically-relevant characterizations of DoD. Realistically, no single extant dataset can fulfill these requirements. Secondary data analysis of multiple long- term longitudinal studies of recent cohorts, with recent young adult assessments, can provide an unprecedented opportunity here. We capitalize on three complementary, long-standing, prospective- longitudinal data sets spanning childhood, adolescence, and young adulthood, with recent assessments in young adulthood. (1) The nationally representative National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (Add Health) allows for fine-grained socio-structural characterizations of individuals and communities affected by DoD. (2) The community-representative psychiatric-diagnostic Great Smoky Mountains Study (GSMS) was collected in mostly impoverished rural communities in Appalachia—one of the epicenters of the DoD epidemic. It features a quasi-experiment that allows testing for whether cash transfers—received by a subgroup of participants for over 15 years—are protective against DoD. (3) Fast Track is a comprehensive 10- year randomized clinical intervention trial with 15 years of follow-up data that targeted mechanisms that are key in recent models of pathways to DoD. The first aim is to look longitudinally at the developmental epidemiology of DoD across the early lifespan in the nationally-representative Add Health and in the rural- Appalachian GSMS with a large American Indian subsample. The second aim is to test a childhood/adolescent strain  young adult social/economic disengagement  despair  DoD pathways model and also to test protective factors that could intervene on each pathway. We will also use discovery-focused machine learning algorithms to uncover new pathways to DoD in Add Health and GSMS. The third aim is to assess the impact of childhood interventions on DoD in GSMS and Fast Track. PROJECT NARRATIVE This interlocking series of aims allows us to identify who is at risk for DoD in contemporary America, how they came to be, and whether DoD could be prevented by early intervention. Results will provide direct, actionable and fine-tuned knowledge for prevention science and public policy efforts to curb the troubling new premature mortality trends.","Diseases of Despair in Young Adulthood: Risk, Resilience, and Prevention",9593182,R01MH117559,"['Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Alcohol abuse', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Alcoholic Liver Diseases', 'Algorithms', 'American Indians', 'Americas', 'Appalachian Region', 'Behavior', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Biological Response Modifier Therapy', 'Censuses', 'Cessation of life', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Coin', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'County', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Economics', 'Education', 'Epidemic', 'Epidemiology', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Exposure to', 'Feeling suicidal', 'Generic Drugs', 'Grain', 'Health', 'Immune', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Trial', 'Knowledge', 'Life Expectancy', 'Longevity', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Mediation', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Neighborhoods', 'Not Hispanic or Latino', 'Opioid', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Poisoning', 'Premature Mortality', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Psychopathology', 'Public Policy', 'Quasi-experiment', 'Race', 'Randomized', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Rural', 'Rural Community', 'Science Policy', 'Series', 'Societies', 'Subgroup', 'Suicide', 'Testing', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'cost', 'deprivation', 'disorder risk', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'illicit drug use', 'insight', 'longitudinal dataset', 'multimodality', 'prevent', 'programs', 'prospective', 'protective factors', 'psychosocial', 'public health emergency', 'resilience', 'secondary analysis', 'sex', 'social', 'suicidal behavior', 'trend', 'young adult']",NIMH,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,466099,-0.06302934282097648
"Geometric Surrogates for Clinical Management of Abdominal Aortic Aneurysms ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal will investigate the following hypothesis: that the quantification of geometric surrogates, which predict the ensuing peak wall rupture risk index (PWRRI), will provide an improved estimate of aneurysm rupture risk compared to the clinical standard of maximum aneurysm diameter. We thus propose the highly innovative use of both radiological and non-radiological clinical imaging to develop a computational tool that can assess AAA risk of rupture with greater accuracy than the current clinical standard. Such a tool will allow the accurate quantification of individual AAA geometry to achieve the main goal of the study, which is to identify the patient-specific AAA geometry characteristics that are surrogates for patient-specific PWRRI. In the proposed approach, we will first compute a truly individualized PWRRI based on an innovative method called image-based Vascular Mechanical Characterization technology (iV-MeCh). The geometry characteristics highly correlated with PWRRI will be considered the surrogates of this biomechanics-based index. A second phase of the study will be the validation of the surrogates with actual clinical outcomes, which will yield the accurate predictors of rupture. This approach, devoid of complex finite element modeling and based on a fast, nearly automated computational tool for geometry quantification, would provide an exceptional rationale for the need for surgical intervention and be of major clinical significance. Therefore, the following specific aims are to be completed during the project period to address the aforementioned hypothesis: (1) Validate iV-MeCh for estimating patient-specific spatio-temporal AAA wall stress; (2) Calculate individual PWRRI using iV-MeCh for high and low risk of rupture AAA; (3) Identify the individual geometry characteristics that are surrogates of PWRRI; and (4) Assess the clinical significance of geometric surrogates for the prediction of AAA rupture risk. The primary outcome of this research will be the ability to disambiguate or demystify rupture risk in AAA for which the standard of care (maximum diameter) is not an accurate metric for assessing their at-risk condition. The geometric surrogates of PWRRI are hypothesized to reduce false positives and false negatives compared to the conventional maximum diameter cut-off for recommending elective repair. In addition, PWRRI is predicted by means of a new, novel technique (iV-MeCh), which estimates wall stress in aneurysms by means of non-radiological clinical imaging and without the use of constitutive soft tissue mechanics. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This award will enable the validation of computational tools for non-invasively predicting the at-risk condition of patients with abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) based on the assessment of aneurysm geometry.

"Infrared Eyes(iREyes) Infrared Eyes Abstract Eden Medical, Inc. is pleased to resubmit this Phase 2 SBIR proposal to develop the “Infrared Eyes” (iREyes) imager system, an affordable and powerful mobile health (mHealth) tool for healthcare. The hand-held iREyes system will acquire both thermal and visible spectrum imagery to quantify healing via thermal indexing methodology. The iREyes will offer a user-friendly product with automated categorization. Diabetic foot wounds are common, complex and costly. Foot areas that are likely to ulcerate are associated with increased local skin temperature due to inflammation and enzymatic autolysis of tissue. Inflammation is characterized by the cardinal signs including redness, swelling, and heat. In addition to identifying inflammation associated with healing, the iREyes will also identify hot spots associated with repetitive stress to reduce ulceration and re-ulceration risk for people in diabetic foot remission. The iREyes will directly quantify inflammation pathophysiology implementing a powerful revised two-part strategy: wound healing via regional foot index analysis and ulcer reoccurrence risk through temperature asymmetry threshold analysis. The combined thermal indexing for healing existing wounds and asymmetry predictive analysis represents a significant breakthrough over current practice.

"Multi-Parametric Spatial Assessment of Bone with HR-pQCT ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Osteoporosis is a skeletal disorder characterized by compromised bone strength predisposing a person to an increased risk of fracture. In the U.S. today, 10 million individuals are estimated to already have the disease and almost 34 million more are estimated to have low bone density, placing them at increased risk for osteoporosis and broken bones. Currently, determination of fracture risk, aging effects, and therapeutic efficacy is primarily based on bone mineral density (BMD) measured by areal or volumetric X-ray-based imaging techniques. BMD can predict bone strength and fracture risk to some extent, however, studies have shown that BMD only explains about 70%-75% of the variance in strength, while the remaining variance has been attributed to the cumulative and synergistic effect of other factors such as bone structure, topology, geometry, tissue composition, microdamage, and biomechanical factors. High-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography (HR-pQCT) is a noninvasive in-vivo imaging technique which depicts many of these features, including density, geometry, structure, topology, and mechanics of cortical and trabecular bone in the distal radius and distal tibia. To date HR-pQCT imagery has been analyzed using conventional quantitative approaches that average bone features over large regions of interest. The individual quantification of average bone features (uni-parametric) or their statistical combination (multi-parametric) disregard how these three-dimensional (3D) features synergistically contribute to bone strength. As a result the traditional methods fail to capture the spatial patterning of the effect being studied, which is key to understanding the underlying biology. Bone is a 3D organ experiencing constant adaptation through remodeling, and should therefore be analyzed with 3D techniques that reflect the complementary and interdependent nature of different bone features. Statistical parametric mapping (SPM) is a technique that enables 3D spatial comparisons of multi-parametric maps between groups of subjects. Instead of measuring summary properties for arbitrary or subjective volumes of interest, this data-driven process identifies regions significantly associated with a variable of interest through valid statistical tests, thus generating 3D statistical and P-value maps that facilitate the visualization and consequently the interpretation of comparisons between target populations. The ultimate goal of this proposal is to establish a framework to automatically identify relevant bone sub-regions and features in specific populations for the targeted quantitative assessment of the spatial distribution and prediction of bone strength using HR-pQCT. For this purpose, specialized SPM techniques have been developed for HR-pQCT. To evaluate the potential of SPM in clinical science, we propose to apply SPM to image data from three existing in-vivo HR-pQCT studies investigating: a) regional variations in bone structure related to gender and age; b) differences due to fracture of the forearm; and c) longitudinal effects of two osteoporosis treatments.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  We propose a population-based framework to automatically identify relevant bone sub-regions and features in specific populations for the targeted quantitative assessment of the spatial distribution and prediction of bone strength using HR-pQCT. To demonstrate the potential of this framework in clinical science, we apply it to existing HR-pQCT studies to identify bone sub-regions and features significantly associated with age, gender, fracture status and response to osteoporosis treatment in post menopausal women; identify spatial associations between the central and distal skeleton with respect to treatment response; and improve fracture discrimination, and the prediction and understanding of the effects of osteoporosis treatment. This framework could improve the development of innovative, more active and safer drugs and therapies, and directly benefit patients suffering osteoporosis and other bone disorders since based on HR-pQCT maps of parameters estimating bone density and quality, a treatment offering the most clinical benefits to them could be prescribed.            ",Multi-Parametric Spatial Assessment of Bone with HR-pQCT,9548457,R01AR068456,"['Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Biology', 'Biomechanics', 'Bone Density', 'Bone Diseases', 'Bone structure', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Distal', 'Elderly', 'Etiology', 'Exercise', 'Forearm Fracture', 'Fracture', 'Gender', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Hip region structure', 'Hormonal', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Information Distribution', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Nature', 'Organ', 'Osteoporosis', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Peripheral', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Population', 'Postmenopause', 'Process', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Radial', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Role', 'Screening procedure', 'Skeleton', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Target Populations', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Variant', 'Vertebral column', 'Woman', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'age effect', 'base', 'bone', 'bone quality', 'bone strength', 'cortical bone', 'cost', 'density', 'experience', 'fracture risk', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'in vivo imaging', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'population based', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'skeletal', 'skeletal disorder', 'spatial relationship', 'substantia spongiosa', 'tibia', 'treatment response']",NIAMS,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,R01,2018,273031,0.0016970178473665917

"Applying Novel Passive Sensing Technology to Target Adherence to Diet in Behavioral Obesity Treatment for Patients with Cardiovascular Disease Risk Project Summary This National Research Service Award (F32) is designed to promote the development of Stephanie Goldstein as an independent, clinical research scientist focused on developing and evaluating strategies for measuring and intervening on health behaviors that capitalize on digital health technology. Behavioral obesity treatment (BOT) produces clinically significant weight loss and health benefits for many individuals with overweight/obesity and cardiovascular disease (CVD). Yet, about half of patients fall short of expected outcomes and most experience gradual weight regain, thus negating the benefits over time. Lapses (i.e., self- reported eating instances that deviate from the BOT prescribed diet) could explain poor outcomes, but the behavior is understudied because it is difficult to assess in-lab and via self-report. We therefore propose to study lapses using a multimethod approach with the following tools: ecological momentary assessment (EMA; repeated sampling method via mobile device), a wrist-worn device that automatically detects eating behavior and various eating characteristics (frequency, rate, and duration of eating episodes), and 24-hour dietary recalls. We will recruit participants (n=40) with overweight/obesity and one additional CVD risk factor to enroll in a 12-week BOT program and follow them through an additional 12-week period of weight loss maintenance. Participants will complete a biweekly 7-day EMA protocol to self-report on eating behavior, including the occurrence of dietary lapse. Participants will continuously wear the wrist-worn ActiGraph Link to characterize eating behavior. Lastly, participants will complete 24-hour dietary recalls via structured interview (split between days with and without lapses) at 6-week intervals to measure the composition of all food and beverages consumed. The proposed study approach is consistent with priorities of NHLBI to optimize clinical research and diagnostic strategies to improve CVD and related risk factors. This project will be conducted in combination with an individualized training program including a curriculum designed to facilitate the acquisition of key skills and experience to move the applicant towards her career goals. This includes didactic and experiential training related to the use of passive sensing technology and related analytic strategies in research, factors that can impede weight maintenance and dietary adherence in BOT, and administration and interpretation of validated nutritional assessment. The applicant will work closely with her primary sponsor, Dr. J. Graham Thomas, her co-sponsors Dr. Rena Wing (renowned expert in weight maintenance), Dr. Adam Hoover (electrical and computer scientist), and Dr. Whitney Evans (nutritional epidemiologist and registered dietician). This mentorship team, in combination with the infrastructure and resources available through the Miriam Hospital Weight Control and Diabetes Research Center and Alpert Brown Medical School, represent the ideal environment to accomplish the applicant's training goals, foster professional development and increase the applicant's autonomy as an independent clinical obesity researcher. Project Narrative The current project is evaluating the utility of a wrist-worn passive sensing device for detecting dietary lapses (i.e., discrete eating instances that deviate from a prescribed diet) and evaluating the behavior's association with weight loss outcomes. Participants, with overweight/obesity and one additional CVD risk factor, will wear wrist-worn devices, complete ecological momentary assessment (EMA; repeated sampling method via mobile device) on dietary lapses, and provide information on dietary composition via semi-regular 24-hour food recalls throughout the duration of a 12-week behavioral weight loss program and 12-week weight maintenance period. This study aims to 1) identifying characteristics of lapse behavior by measuring passively-sensed timing, duration, frequency, and rate of eating amongst known lapse episodes, 2) test the association between dietary lapse frequency and weight change, and 3) estimate nutrition composition of dietary lapses.",Applying Novel Passive Sensing Technology to Target Adherence to Diet in Behavioral Obesity Treatment for Patients with Cardiovascular Disease Risk,9609565,F32HL143954,"['Adherence', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Awareness', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Medicine', 'Beverages', 'Body Weight Changes', 'Body Weight decreased', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diet', 'Diet Habits', 'Dietary Assessment', 'Dietary intake', 'Dietetics', 'Eating', 'Eating Behavior', 'Ecological momentary assessment', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Energy Intake', 'Engineering', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Epidemiologist', 'Food', 'Fostering', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Benefit', 'Health Technology', 'Health behavior', 'Healthy Eating', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Laboratories', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Moods', 'Motion', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'National Research Service Awards', 'Nutrition Assessment', 'Nutritional', 'Obesity', 'Oral cavity', 'Outcome', 'Overweight', 'Participant', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Periodicity', 'Phase', 'Physical activity', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Sleep', 'Specialist', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Weight', 'Weight maintenance regimen', 'Wing', 'Work', 'Wrist', 'base', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'career', 'clinical diagnostics', 'clinically significant', 'contextual factors', 'design', 'digital', 'experience', 'falls', 'handheld mobile device', 'improved', 'innovation', 'mHealth', 'medical schools', 'novel', 'nutrition', 'obesity treatment', 'prevent', 'real time monitoring', 'sensor', 'sensor technology', 'skills', 'tool', 'training opportunity', 'treatment program', 'weight loss program', 'weight maintenance', 'willingness']",NHLBI,MIRIAM HOSPITAL,F32,2018,58282,0.0006672794299058954
"Mammary and milk microbiomes and metabolomes - Understanding early variation and impacts on risk for mammary inflammation and mastitis PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Exclusive breastfeeding for at least 4 mo is considered the optimal form of nutrition for most newborns, yet many women experience substantial roadblocks in meeting this goal. One of the most common reason for  lactation cessation is mastitis (inflammation of the breast). Mastitis is also a significant concern for the US dairy industry because, not only does it represent a significant challenge to animal welfare, but it also decreases milk production and is the most common reason animals are treated with antibiotics. Despite decades of research, mastitis prevention and treatment are poorly understood in both species. One reason for this is that, although mastitis has historically been attributed to the presence of bacterial pathogens in the mammary gland, this dogma is now known to be incorrect. Modern advances in the use of DNA sequencing (rather than needing to grow bacteria in culture media) have resulted in a paradigm shift in this regard such that researchers now know that all milk produced by both healthy and mastitic cows and women contains a rich community of microbes. Experts now believe that a dysbiosis in these microbes or a shift in their metabolism causes mammary  inflammation. Consequently, we must now re-examine everything we thought we knew about the etiology and risk factors for this disease. Fundamental to filling this research gap is the rigorous characterization of the  microbiome in milk produced by healthy and mastitic women and cows; and identification of microbial community  “fingerprints” and metabolomic modifiers, thereof, that alter risk of mammary inflammation. In addition,  understanding the similarities and dissimilarities in mammary inflammation between cows and women will help  researchers understand whether the former can be used as a model for the latter (and vice versa). The overall objectives for this project are to 1) compare and contrast the milk microbiome, its functionality, immune  parameters, and inflammatory markers in healthy and mastitic women and cows, and 2) identify milk microbial  profiles and their functionality related to risk for mammary inflammation. Our central hypotheses are that  1) mammary inflammation in both species is associated with shifts in microbes and their function, concentrations of selected markers of immunity and mammary inflammation, and that 2) there exist detectable milk microbiome patterns (or functions) that predispose some women and cows to increased risk of inflammation, and these patterns are related to (and perhaps modified by) environmental and behavioral parameters, some of which are currently considered risk factors for mastitis. To test these hypotheses, we will compare healthy and mastitic cows and women (case-control design) during the first 6 wk postpartum (longitudinal, repeated-measures  design during a high-risk period in both species). Importantly, we will utilize a multi-omics approach and machine learning to understand complex relationships within and between species. The results of this work will lead to better understanding of how the microbiology of the lactating mammary gland is related to mammary  inflammation and will lay the groundwork for future studies to determine how this disease can be prevented and treated. PROJECT NARRATIVE Inflammation of the mammary gland (mastitis) is the leading cause for cessation of breastfeeding, considered the optimal form of nutrition for almost all newborns worldwide, and a major animal welfare and economic  burden for the dairy industry. Mastitis has been attributed to bacterial pathogens in the mammary gland, but new evidence demonstrates that all milk (healthy and mastitic) contains a community of microbes. Understanding the bacterial community in milk, and its function, with related host immune response will lead to a reduction in the risk of inflammation in dairy cows and women, support breastfeeding, and promote optimal health in  mothers and infants.",Mammary and milk microbiomes and metabolomes - Understanding early variation and impacts on risk for mammary inflammation and mastitis,9572627,R01HD092297,"['Address', 'Affect', 'American', 'Animal Welfare', 'Animals', 'Antibiotics', 'Bacteria', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Breast', 'Breast Feeding', 'Cattle', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Culture Media', 'DNA sequencing', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Economic Burden', 'Economics', 'Etiology', 'Exclusive Breastfeeding', 'Fingerprint', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Gland', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immunity', 'Industry', 'Infant', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Lactation', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Mammary gland', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Microbe', 'Microbiology', 'Milk', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Molecular', 'Mothers', 'Newborn Infant', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Partner in relationship', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Postpartum Period', 'Prevention', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Woman', 'Work', 'bacterial community', 'case control', 'cost', 'design', 'dysbiosis', 'experience', 'high risk', 'inflammatory marker', 'inflammatory milieu', 'macromolecule', 'mastitis', 'mathematical model', 'meetings', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'microbial', 'microbial community', 'microbiome', 'milk microbiome', 'milk production', 'multiple omics', 'nutrition', 'offspring', 'pathogen', 'prevent', 'protein metabolite', 'virtual']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF IDAHO,R01,2018,587097,0.008731928715271951
"Predicting the Risk of Severe Hypoglycemic and Hyperglycemic Events in Adults with Diabetes PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Dr. McCoy is an endocrinologist and primary care physician specializing in the care for patients with diabetes and other chronic health conditions. Her long-term goal is to become an independent researcher and leader in evaluating, improving, and individualizing diabetes care through effective use of big data completed by qualitative insights from patients and those involved in their care. The short-term training goals of this proposal are to acquire: 1) proficiency in statistics and data science; 2) experience in qualitative research; 3) skills in clinical trial design; and 4) communication and leadership skills to lead multi-disciplinary research. The proposal's research will be conducted at Mayo Clinic, which has a strong history of training physician scientists and a well-developed infrastructure for education and research. Dr. McCoy has access to an ideal set of data assets, the OptumLabs Data Warehouse and the Kaiser Permanente Northern California Diabetes Registry, and the support of an exceptional team of mentors and advisors who are national leaders in diabetes outcomes and health care delivery research, shared decision-making, qualitative research, and data science. Optimization of glycemic control, while avoiding severe hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia, is the cornerstone of diabetes management. Severe hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia are often preventable, yet continue to incur substantial morbidity, psychological distress, impaired quality of life, and economic burden. There are no validated tools to predict these events and as a result clinicians lack a practical and reliable means to identify high risk patients. The goal of Dr. McCoy's work is to address this critical gap in diabetes management. In Aim 1, she will use large database analysis and novel analytic methods to characterize the patterns of severe hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia among adults with diabetes in the U.S. In Aim 2, she will build on Aim 1 to develop and validate computationally efficient concurrent risk prediction models for severe hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia that could be used in clinical encounters. In Aim 3, she will directly engage patients and their clinicians in conversation about severe hypoglycemia /hyperglycemia risk in order to better understand how information about severe hypoglycemia/ hyperglycemia risk is perceived, interpreted, and used. These studies will serve as foundation for two R01 applications to be submitted during Years 4 and 5, and will advance the science and practice of personalized diabetes care through integration of data science and qualitative methods for the purpose of understanding, predicting, and ultimately preventing severe hypoglycemic/hyperglycemic events. Dr. McCoy has a proven track record of scientific productivity and innovation, and a strong foundation in using secondary data for health services and outcomes research in diabetes. In summary, the training, mentoring, and research proposed here are essential for Dr. McCoy's career development as she develops research independence and expertise in the crucial interface between patients and their clinical teams, evidence-based medicine, and big data. PROJECT NARRATIVE Severe hypoglycemic and hyperglycemic events in the management of diabetes mellitus continue to incur high morbidity, psychological distress, and economic costs; yet, these events may be prevented with individualization of treatment goals and regimens if high risk patients are identified prospectively. The proposed research will leverage big data analytics and qualitative research to 1) characterize the epidemiology of severe hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia in the U.S.; 2) develop and validate concurrent risk prediction models for severe hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia; and 3) enrich the understanding of severe hypoglycemia/ hyperglycemia risk and risk model utilization through qualitative patient and clinician engagement.",Predicting the Risk of Severe Hypoglycemic and Hyperglycemic Events in Adults with Diabetes,9535990,K23DK114497,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Big Data', 'Calibration', 'California', 'Caring', 'Chronic', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Communication', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Discrimination', 'Economic Burden', 'Endocrinologist', 'Epidemiology', 'Event', 'Evidence Based Medicine', 'Face', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hospitalization', 'Hyperglycemia', 'Hypoglycemia', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Interview', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Outcomes and Health Services Research', 'Patient Care', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physicians', 'Primary Care Physician', 'Productivity', 'Qualitative Methods', 'Qualitative Research', 'Quality of life', 'Recording of previous events', 'Regimen', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Proposals', 'Research Training', 'Risk', 'Risk Estimate', 'Risk Factors', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Self Care', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Protocols', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical care', 'clinical decision support', 'data integration', 'data registry', 'data warehouse', 'diabetes management', 'disease phenotype', 'economic cost', 'education research', 'experience', 'glycemic control', 'health care delivery', 'health data', 'high risk', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'individualized medicine', 'innovation', 'insight', 'member', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'patient oriented', 'point of care', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'psychologic', 'psychological distress', 'shared decision making', 'skills', 'social', 'statistics', 'support tools', 'tool']",NIDDK,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,K23,2018,169112,-0.007077362319150515
"Identifying phenomic patterns of dental anomalies in orofacial clefting Project Summary/Abstract Background and Candidate: Children with orofacial clefting present with increased rate of dental anomalies in shape, size, number, symmetry, abnormal eruption and malposition of teeth both inside and outside the cleft area, leading to dental problems and reduction of quality of life. Although the scientific community has recognized these findings for a long time, the specific etiological factors underlying such anomalies still remain elusive. An important step to understanding etiology is via careful phenotypic approaches that can detect the co-occurrence of such anomalies in discernable patterns that can simplify the identification of risk factors. Dr. Brian Howe is a Clinical Assistant Professor at the College of Dentistry of the University of Iowa. His primary research focus is on the identification and characterization of oral phenotypes in an effort to identify etiological factors underlying the oral phenotypic spectrum of nonsyndromic orofacial clefting. Career Goals: Dr. Howe's short term goals are to deepen is knowledge of complex craniofacial phenotypes and expand his current understanding of craniofacial development. His long term goals are to become a funded independent researcher and a leading clinician and educator in the field of craniofacial phenomics and dentistry as a tenure track faculty at a University of Iowa. His research plan is innovative in that it leverages unique bioinformatics algorithms to identify complex oral phenotypic patterns amenable for studies of risk factors and causality. Environment: The University of Iowa has an established reputation for the successful training of graduate and postdoctoral students in research and clinical areas. It offers learning and development seminars focused on career development and advancement with particular benefits from training opportunities from its Institute for Clinical and Translational Sciences (ICTS). Career Development Plan: Dr. Howe is committed to attend courses, tutorials, seminars and relevant conferences as well as meeting regularly with his mentors, collaborators, and advisory committee to fulfill is training aims and gain the knowledge necessary to achieve his future research goals and become an independent clinical researcher. Research Study: This research aims to identify oral phenotypic patterns in orofacial clefting using modern and traditional pattern mining methods in a diverse international population with existing environmental and genetic variables. This knowledge will have key implications in our understanding of the etiology of orofacial clefting as well as driving the implementation of innovative treatment approaches to improve dental outcomes and future preventive strategies. Project Narrative  Individuals with nonsyndromic orofacial clefting present with a wide range of dental anomalies leading to more intricate oral rehabilitation procedures which increases dental morbidity and reduces quality of life in those affected. In the largest international cohort of families with orofacial clefting and controls to date, this project will utilize pattern mining approaches to detect the co-occurrence of particular dental anomalies in discernable patterns that will likely simplify the search for the etiological factors underlying these anomalies. This research will aid in our understanding of the etiology of orofacial clefting by expanding and further defining oral phenotypes which will drive biologically meaningful strategies for the identification of genetic risk factors as well as helping to improve clinical care.",Identifying phenomic patterns of dental anomalies in orofacial clefting,9582428,K08DE028012,"['Advisory Committees', 'Affect', 'Age-Months', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Automobile Driving', 'Awareness', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Birth', 'Career Mobility', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Dental', 'Dental Enamel', 'Dental crowns', 'Dentistry', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Environment', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Faculty', 'Family', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Risk', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'High Prevalence', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'International', 'Iowa', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Maxilla', 'Mentors', 'Mesenchymal', 'Mesenchyme', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modernization', 'Molecular', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Nature', 'Odontogenesis', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Oral', 'Oral cavity', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevention strategy', 'Preventive', 'Primary Dentition', 'Procedures', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publications', 'Quality of life', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Robin bird', 'Severities', 'Shapes', 'Side', 'Signal Transduction', 'Students', 'Surgical Flaps', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Tooth Germ', 'Tooth structure', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Universities', 'Vascular blood supply', 'analytical tool', 'calcification', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical care', 'cohort', 'college', 'craniofacial', 'craniofacial complex', 'craniofacial development', 'design', 'genetic risk factor', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'meetings', 'novel', 'orofacial cleft', 'palatogenesis', 'permanent tooth', 'phenomics', 'professor', 'programs', 'repaired', 'research study', 'risk variant', 'symposium', 'tenure track', 'tool', 'training opportunity', 'trend']",NIDCR,UNIVERSITY OF IOWA,K08,2018,150636,0.001090757291574782
"Metabolomics and risk of Parkinson's Disease ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Parkinson disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease in the United States and affects over one million Americans; this number is growing due to population aging. Current treatments do not prevent the disease progression that ultimately results in severe disability. There is thus a compelling need to develop neuroprotective treatments. Because at the time of the clinical diagnosis of PD there is already substantial neuronal loss, such treatments should ideally be initiated earlier. Aims of the proposed investigation are to implement and validate a novel metabolomic approach for the identification of early changes in peripheral blood of individuals with preclinical or premotor PD. The metabolomic results will be integrated with detailed and validated information on risk factors for PD, which has been collected prospectively and periodically updated. We expect by this means to identify new clues to the etiology of PD and to identify a metabolomic signature of PD that could contribute to an early diagnosis. To achieve these goals, we will take advantage of data and blood samples collected from over 80,000 participants in three large ongoing cohorts, the Nurses' Health Study (NHS), the Health Professional Follow-up Study (HPFS), and the Cancer Prevention Study-II Nutrition, who have been followed for over 25 years for incident Parkinson disease. We expect to include a total of 805 incident cases of PD that will be matched to 805 controls, using a nested case-control design. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Parkinson disease is a chronic progressive disease for which there is no cure - the loss of brain cells that leads to disability develops insidiously over many years, and by the time the disease is diagnosed it is already extensive and irreversible. To identify Parkinson disease years before it becomes clinically manifest, we are proposing a novel approach that will take advantage of the peripheral blood and detailed lifestyle and medical information collected from over 80,000 individuals who were followed for up to 25 years. By comparing the blood levels of hundreds of compounds between the blood of individuals who developed Parkinson disease and the blood of individuals of the same age and sex who remained healthy, we expect to make novel discoveries on the etiology of Parkinson disease and to be able to develop a method for the early identification of Parkinson disease in other populations.",Metabolomics and risk of Parkinson's Disease,9536156,R01NS089619,"['Affect', 'Age', 'Alanine', 'American', 'Archives', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood specimen', 'Branched-Chain Amino Acids', 'Caffeine', 'Cancer Prevention Study II', 'Choline', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Coffee', 'Cohort Studies', 'Confounding Factors (Epidemiology)', 'Consumption', 'Creatine', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diet', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Failure', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Glutamates', 'Goals', 'Health Professional', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Insulin Resistance', 'Investigation', 'Life Style', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Medical History', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Pathway', 'Methods', 'Motor', 'National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke', 'Nature', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Nurses&apos', ' Health Study', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Physical activity', 'Plasma', 'Population', 'Progressive Disease', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Smoking', 'Specificity', 'Techniques', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Update', 'Urate', 'Validation', 'Women&apos', 's Health Nursing', 'Work', 'acylcarnitine', 'aging population', 'base', 'brain cell', 'cancer prevention', 'case control', 'cigarette smoking', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'cohort', 'design', 'diabetes risk', 'disability', 'disorder risk', 'follow-up', 'gender difference', 'insight', 'interest', 'men', 'metabolic profile', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'mitochondrial dysfunction', 'motor symptom', 'neuron loss', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'nutrition', 'peripheral blood', 'pre-clinical', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'sex', 'specific biomarkers', 'tool']",NINDS,HARVARD SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH,R01,2018,563079,0.004862548472770854
"Biological Mechanisms of Mindfulness Training for Health PROJECT SUMMARY Nearly 10% of Americans practice meditation to improve health. Randomized controlled trials support this practice and show that mindfulness training is effective in improving a broad range of health outcomes. In particular, mindfulness training has been shown to reduce biomarkers of systemic inflammation that contribute to the pathophysiology of disease and predict risk for all-cause mortality. Still, little is known about the biological processes linking mindfulness training with inflammation. This proposal tests the hypothesis that mindfulness training aids the regulation of inflammation by mitigating glucocorticoid resistance (GCR). GCR is a leading candidate mechanism linking psychosocial threat with systemic inflammation. Whereas cortisol released in response to threat normally binds to glucocorticoid receptors and down-regulates inflammation, chronic perceptions of threat lead to a state of GCR, in which glucocorticoid receptors become insensitive to the anti-inflammatory effects of circulating cortisol. Mindfulness training is proposed to diminish perceptions of threat in ways that restore glucocorticoid receptor sensitivity. To test this biological pathway, this study assesses functional GCR and biomarkers of inflammation before and after a Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) or control Health Enhancement Program (HEP) in a sample of lonely older adults (N=188). Loneliness is a form of chronic psychosocial threat, and is consistently associated with GCR and systemic inflammation, yet MBSR is one of very few interventions successful in reducing loneliness. MBSR is expected to decrease GCR (and restore glucocorticoid receptor sensitivity) compared to HEP from pre- to post- intervention. Moreover, these decreases in GCR are expected to mediate the effects of MBSR (vs. HEP) on lowering systemic inflammation (CRP and IL-6) from pre-intervention to 3-month follow-up. In sum, this proposal investigates decreased GCR as a biological mechanism through which mindfulness training reduces inflammatory disease risk. It addresses NCCIH's call for research on understanding the biological mechanisms of action underlying mind-body intervention approaches and complements NCCIH's special interest in alleviating inflammatory processes. The knowledge gained from this research will contribute to a better understanding of the basic biological pathways underlying mindfulness practices, which may help to identify and target populations likely to benefit from mindfulness training. The research and training plan described in this application provide opportunities for the applicant to develop a knowledge base and methodology in psychoneuroimmunology, learn statistical techniques for analyzing complex mechanistic pathways, and develop the professional skills necessary for a successful career testing biological and psychological mechanisms underlying mind-body interventions. PROJECT NARRATIVE Mindfulness meditation practices are widely used to alleviate physical symptoms, and growing evidence suggests that mindfulness training may reduce systemic inflammation, but less is known about the biological pathways linking mindfulness training with inflammatory processes. The proposed project investigates a biological mechanism, glucocorticoid sensitivity, to explain how mindfulness training lowers inflammation among lonely older adults who are at risk for multiple inflammatory diseases. From a public health perspective, clarifying this mechanistic pathway will help to identify who is likely to show health benefits from mindfulness training.",Biological Mechanisms of Mindfulness Training for Health,9561883,F32AT009508,"['Address', 'Adult', 'American', 'Antiinflammatory Effect', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Process', 'Biological Testing', 'Blood Circulation', 'Breast Cancer survivor', 'Cells', 'Chronic', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Dexamethasone', 'Disease', 'Distress', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Elderly', 'Feeling', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Glucocorticoid Receptor', 'Glucocorticoids', 'Health', 'Health Benefit', 'Hydrocortisone', 'Immune', 'Immunology procedure', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Interleukin-6', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Loneliness', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Meditation', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Methodology', 'Mind-Body Intervention', 'Mindfulness Training', 'National Research Service Awards', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Perception', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Process', 'Psychoneuroimmunology', 'Public Health', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Receptor Gene', 'Receptor Signaling', 'Regulation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Training', 'Resistance', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Standardization', 'Stress', 'Sum', 'Symptoms', 'Target Populations', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Work', 'cardiometabolism', 'career', 'cost', 'disorder risk', 'efficacy trial', 'epidemiology study', 'experience', 'falls', 'feasibility trial', 'follow-up', 'health training', 'hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis', 'improved', 'inflammatory marker', 'interest', 'knowledge base', 'mindfulness', 'mindfulness intervention', 'mindfulness meditation', 'mindfulness-based stress reduction', 'mortality', 'physical conditioning', 'physical symptom', 'post intervention', 'programs', 'psychologic', 'psychosocial', 'receptor function', 'receptor sensitivity', 'recruit', 'response', 'skills', 'social', 'successful intervention', 'training aid', 'training opportunity']",NCCIH,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,F32,2018,63154,-0.022369377048745337
"Phamarcogenomics of Statin Therapy (SUPPLEMENT) PARENT ABSTRACT The overall objective of the Center ""Pharmacogenomics of Statin Therapy"" (POST) is to apply genomic, transcriptomic, and metabolomic analyses, together with studies in cellular and animal models, and innovative informatic tools, to identify and validate biomarkers for efficacy of statin drugs in reducing risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD), and for adverse effects of statins, specifically myopathy and type 2 diabetes. This multidisciplinary approach is enabled by a team of investigators with expertise in genomics (human, mouse, and molecular), statistics and informatics, and clinical medicine and pharmacology. The Center is comprised of three Projects, two Research Cores, and an Administrative Core. A major aim of Project 1 is the identification of cellular transcriptomic and metabolomic markers for clinical efficacy and adverse effects of statins. This will be accomplished by analyses in statin-exposed lymphoblast cell lines derived from patients with major adverse coronary events, or onset of myopathy or type 2 diabetes on statin treatment, compared with unaffected statin-treated controls. In addition, using genome wide genotypes from these patients, DNA variants will be identified that are associated with statin-induced changes in the transcripts and metabolites that most strongly discriminate affected patients and controls. Project 2 will use a unique, well- characterized panel of 100 inbred mouse strains to discover genetic variation associated with statin- induced myopathy and dysglycemia. Mechanisms underlying these effects will be investigated, with emphasis on the role of dysregulation of autophagy by statin treatment. Projects 1 and 2 will also use relevant cellular and mouse models, respectively, to perform functional studies to validate effects of genes identified in all POST projects as strong candidates for modulating statin efficacy or adverse effects. In Project 3, information derived from genome-wide genotypes, electronic health records, and pharmacy data in a very large and diverse population-based patient cohort will be leveraged to identify and replicate genetic associations with statin efficacy (lipid lowering and CVD event reduction) and adverse effects (myopathy and type 2 diabetes), as well as to assess the overall heritability of these responses. The Clinical Core, based in Kaiser Permanente of Northern California, will provide the clinical information and biologic materials for both Projects 1 and 3. Investigators in the Informatics Core will optimize data analysis and integration of results across all projects. The Administrative Core will provide scientific leadership and management of the Center, and foster scientific interactions and training opportunities. Overall, the research program of this Center provides an innovative model for a ""systems"" approach to pharmacogenomics that incorporates complementary investigative tools to discover and validate genetically influenced determinants of drug response. Moreover, the findings have the potential for guiding more effective use of statins for reducing CVD risk and minimizing adverse effects, and identifying biomarkers of pathways that modulate the multiple actions of this widely used class of drugs. ADMINISTRATIVE SUPPLEMENT ABSTRACT In response to NOT-AG-18-008, our goal is to extend the validation and application of our data integration methodologies into Alzheimer’s disease research. This administrative supplement is designed to extend the work of the existing subaward to the University of Pennsylvania subcontract for the POST Informatics Core. The PGRN POST Informatics Core serves as the central hub for data sharing and coordination across the three POST projects in the PGRN P50 award. One of our jobs is annotating the extensive information that will be collected and providing analysis expertise to the projects as needed. However, to make great strides in scientific progress and ensure that the collective whole of the Center is greater than the sum of the parts, a key function of the Informatics Core is to serve as ‘The Integrator’ to combine these data and information. We and others have shown that integration of complementary omics-based data can provide emergent insights into biological processes compared to what can be learned through any single approach alone. The methods that we are developing to integrate data for statin pharmacogenomic phenotypes will be equally applicable in the area of Alzheimer’s disease. Additionally, recent emphasis on open data science by Alzheimer’s disease researchers provides ample data for us to interrogate our method. We have developed novel statistical analysis tools such as the Analysis Tool for Heritable and Environmental Network Associations (ATHENA), and data visualization tools, such as PhenoGram, both of which are designed to collect and combine information from diverse data sources. With these tools, we will leverage publicly available Alzheimer’s disease datasets to maximize the knowledge gleaned about disease risk for Alzheimer’s diseases. The methodologies that we have been developing as part of the PGRN POST award for the past 2.5 years are clearly applicable to the study of Alzheimer’s disease risk. An important validation step of the application of our methodologies is to apply them to different types of datasets and in different phenotypic areas. This administrative supplement focused on extended research into having an Alzheimer’s disease focus is a great mechanism to simultaneously allow us to validate our methodologies with different types of data and potentially identify important risk factors and pathways toward a better understanding of the etiology of Alzheimer’s disease. Finally, we may have the opportunity to identify cross biological implications due to the known pleiotropic relationships between Alzheimer’s disease and cardiovascular disease.

"Impact of Cognition on Balance and Gait Markers for FXTAS Abstract:  The primary objective of this K01 application is to provide research training and mentorship to the candidate to enable her to become an independent medical rehabilitation researcher. The candidate has clinical experience in Physical Therapy and doctoral training in basic neurobiology and is transitioning to a new clinical research area investigating balance and gait in a neurodegenerative disorder called Fragile X Tremor and Ataxia Syndrome (FXTAS) which occurs in some premutation (PM) carriers of the Fragile X (FMR1) gene. The short term goals are to develop an early detection model for FXTAS and identify additional molecular risk factors for developing this disorder. The plan has 3 aims: 1) To identify quantitative markers of balance and gait impairments in PM carriers with and without FXTAS, 2) To determine the impact of executive function and cognitive interference on balance and gait function in PM carriers with and without FXTAS, and 3) to determine the relationship between age, sex, executive function, and FMR1 molecular variables and the presence and severity of balance and gait impairment in PM carriers with and without FXTAS. The candidate’s long term scientific goal is to become a leading independent research scientist in movement neuroscience and neurological disorders and in the precise identification of balance and gait dysfunction in FXTAS from the earliest stage. In order to reach these goals the candidate needs to develop expertise in patient outcomes and neuroepidemiology research. The candidate’s short term goals which form the basis for this five year K development plan include training in 1) large scale subject recruitment, data management and advanced biostatistics, 2) balance and gait analysis and application to clinical trials in movement disorders, 3) design, implementation and analysis of large scale epidemiological studies and 4) introduction to rehabilitation intervention and clinical trial research methodology. Results of this research will help clarify neurological mechanisms underlying balance and gait deficits in FXTAS, establish reliable and quantitative outcomes measures of motor impairment, and provide data for future clinical rehabilitation trials. This research will be the first step in characterizing the longitudinal history of motor dysfunction in FXTAS from its earliest stages, thus paving the way for establishing disease monitoring and modifying strategies in premutation carriers. This proposal is relevant to the NIH Research Plan on FXS and Associated Disorders which includes the following goals: 2.2 validation of quantitative instruments to detect early clinical signs of FXTAS and its progression, 2.3 identification of molecular and clinical risk factors in individuals associated with penetrance of FXTAS, and 2.5 defining genotype, including FMR1 molecular factors, and clinical phenotype relationships in FXTAS. Over one million people in the US carry a premutation expansion in the Fragile X gene. A significant portion of these individuals will experience debilitating symptoms of a neurodegenerative disorder known as fragile X- associated tremor ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) including balance deficits, falls and progressive disability. This proposal addresses a critical need to identify early indicators of FXTAS onset in order to provide earlier intervention, including preventative and rehabilitative treatments, to delay disease progression, reduce the morbidity associated with falls and functional disability, and improve quality of life.

"Development of Mucosal and Systemic Immunity and Risk of Food Allergy The microbiome plays a critical role in the development of the immune system and alterations in the microbiome diversity almost certainly play an important role in the surge of allergic and autoimmune diseases in developed nations that began in the 1950's and continues today. Living on farms, avoiding antibiotics, vaginal delivery, and other environmental factors leading to greater diversity in the microbiome have been associated with a major reduction in the risk of atopic diseases. Understanding the development of the immune system in populations at low risk for allergy compared to high-risk populations, developing biomarkers for “protective” immune development, and assessing immune responses to the microbiome are fundamental for designing and assessing future interventions. In this proposal, we will compare the Old Order Mennonites (OOM) with a very low risk for food allergies (<1%), other allergic diseases and asthma and a lifestyle associated with a diverse microbiome (e.g. growing up on a farm, consumption of raw milk, large families, home deliveries, low rate of antibiotic use), and neonates born to families with food-allergic children with a very high risk for developing atopic diseases, e.g. a 15-20% risk of food allergy in the first year of life. We hypothesize that accelerated development of IgA mucosal immunity will be a biomarker for “protective” immune development. Abundant IgA-coated fecal bacteria are seen in early life and data from animal models indicate the importance of microbial diversity in the induction of this secretory IgA. Early studies suggest that the predisposition to the development of IgE antibodies (“atopy”) is associated with a slow development of IgA responses, e.g. our own data shows a delay in development of specific IgA in cow's milk-allergic infants. Exciting new discoveries further support the role for specific IgA come from trials of orally induced tolerance in established food allergy. Because there is an intimate reciprocal development of gut microbial communities with the IgA repertoire, we hypothesize that mucosal exposure to a diverse and immunogenic microbiome accelerates the development of IgA secretory immunity, counteracts development of IgE responses, and protects from allergic diseases.  We will assess how B cell subsets, immunoglobulin repertoire and somatic mutation rates (Aim 1), and gut microbiome and IgA antibody responses to microbiome develop in cohorts of high- and low-risk for allergy (Aim 2), and how these B cell biomarkers and gut microbiome relate to the development of food and other allergic diseases and humoral responses to allergens (Aim 3). In summary, this proposal will determine whether accelerated development of IgA responses is a biomarker for “protective” immune development, identify fecal bacteria inducing IgA responses, and assess the association of specific IgA immune responses with clinical tolerance, i.e. protection from early-onset food allergy and eczema. NARRATIVE The microbiome plays a critical role in the development of the immune system, and alterations in the microbiome diversity almost certainly play an important role in the surge of allergic and autoimmune diseases in developed nations. A major gap is our understanding of how the microbiome prevents allergic diseases. In this proposal, we will evaluate the development of infant immune system in populations at high risk and those at low risk for food allergy and other allergic diseases. The Old Order Mennonites (OOM) have a very low risk for allergic diseases and asthma and a lifestyle associated with a diverse microbiome; high-risk population includes families with food allergic children. These studies of immune system development in a population “protected” from allergic diseases will provide critical new knowledge about the development of the mucosal and systemic immunity, and lay the groundwork for future studies of prevention of allergic diseases in childhood.",Development of Mucosal and Systemic Immunity and Risk of Food Allergy,9463650,U01AI131344,"['16S ribosomal RNA sequencing', 'Age-Months', 'Allergens', 'Allergic', 'Allergic Disease', 'Allergy to peanuts', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Antibiotics', 'Antibodies', 'Antibody Response', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'B-Cell Development', 'B-Lymphocyte Subsets', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Bacteria', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth', 'Cattle', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Childhood Asthma', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cohort Studies', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Defect', 'Developed Countries', 'Developing Countries', 'Development', 'Diet', 'Disease', 'Eczema', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Exhibits', 'Exposure to', 'Extrinsic asthma', 'Family', 'Farming environment', 'Feces', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Food', 'Food Hypersensitivity', 'Future', 'Genomics', 'Germ-Free', 'Home environment', 'Hypersensitivity', 'IgE', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immune system', 'Immunity', 'Immunoglobulin A', 'Immunoglobulin Class Switching', 'Immunoglobulin G', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region', 'Immunoglobulins', 'Immunology', 'Infant', 'Infant Development', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Life Style', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Memory B-Lymphocyte', 'Mennonite', 'Milk', 'Mucosal Immunity', 'Mucous Membrane', 'Neonatal', 'Oral', 'Outcome', 'Plasma Cells', 'Play', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Prevention', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Saliva', 'Secretory Immunoglobulin A', 'Serum', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Sorting - Cell Movement', 'Systems Development', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Training', 'Transcript', 'Umbilical Cord Blood', 'Vaginal delivery procedure', 'animal data', 'atopy', 'base', 'cohort', 'design', 'early onset', 'food allergen', 'gut microbiome', 'gut microbiota', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'immunogenic', 'immunogenicity', 'infancy', 'microbial', 'microbiome', 'microorganism antigen', 'mucosal site', 'neonate', 'peripheral blood', 'postnatal', 'prevent', 'response']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF ROCHESTER,U01,2018,460833,-0.016838160468538928
"Digital Phenotyping for Computational Models of Relapse Prediction in Early Course Psychosis Project Summary  The candidate requests support for a four-year program of training and research to better understand how smartphone based digital phenotyping and computational methods can predict relapse and create digital phenotypes of symptoms and clinical outcomes in early course psychosis.  In the proposed training plan, the candidate will build upon his previous experiences in engineering, clinical informatics, and clinical psychiatry to perform a multidisciplinary project at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. His training plan includes training in: 1) statistical methods for multivariate longitudinal analysis and predictive inference 2) the neuropsychiatric assessment of schizophrenia 3) longitudinal clinical research methodology with a focus on mobile technologies, and 4) the responsible conduct of research.  Even with appropriate care, relapse is common in early course psychosis and each episode is associated higher costs of care, poorer lifetime outcomes, and chronicity of the disease. There is a need to learn more about the personal factors associated with relapse for individual patients in order to improve risk predictions, ensure appropriate early interventions, and support coordinated specialty care services for schizophrenia. This study proposes that smartphones sensors eg (GPS, accelerometer), wearable devices like smartwatches collecting physiology, and smartphone based surveys and cognitive tests, when combined with appropriate statistical methods, can capture digital biomarkers, refereed to here as digital phenotypes, of early course psychosis that can offer personalized relapse prediction and augment population level risk factors.  This candidate's research plan seeks to: 1) propose digital phenotypes and relapse models of early course psychosis captured in an affordable and scalable manner from subject's personal smartphones as well as a wearable sensor in order to automatically collect self-report of symptoms, behaviors, cognition, and physiology 2) and evaluate the accuracy of digital phenotypes and the relapse prediction models.  This study proposes to address this hypothesis by utilizing smartphone based digital phenotyping methods, primarily through running the Beiwe app on subjects' own smartphones, to capture longitudinal data on symptoms, behaviors, cognition, and physiology across subjects' natural environments. These studies will be performed across 3.5 years in subjects with early course psychosis and range between 6 to 12 months.  The broader aim of this research is to understand the systems and processes, both personal and environmental, which contribute to relapse in early course psychosis. An understanding of the computational basis of relapse will inform better nosology, allow development of biomarkers of illness that may offer better targets for biological research, inform development of personalized interventions for psychotic illnesses, and help support early interventions for schizophrenia. Schizophrenia is a chronic and disabling disorder that is characterized by episodes of relapse, and  is thought to impact ~1.5% of the population.  Our current treatments and ability to predict  relapse early are limited by our understanding of the longitudinal course, environmental factors,  and variability of clinical presentation. This study seeks to model this complexity using  computational methods and digital phenotyping so that we may design more effective early  interventions for this disease.",Digital Phenotyping for Computational Models of Relapse Prediction in Early Course Psychosis,9505230,K23MH116130,"['Accelerometer', 'Address', 'Anxiety', 'Award', 'Awareness', 'Back', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Caregiver Burden', 'Caring', 'Cellular Phone', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Effectiveness', 'Emergency department visit', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Event', 'Feedback', 'Goals', 'Health Sciences', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Hospitalization', 'Human', 'Impaired cognition', 'In Situ', 'Individual', 'Interview', 'Israel', 'Learning', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical center', 'Medicine', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Moods', 'Nature', 'Outcome', 'Ownership', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Physical activity', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Process', 'Productivity', 'Prospective Studies', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Quality of life', 'Relapse', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Running', 'Schizophrenia', 'Science', 'Severity of illness', 'Sleep', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Treatment Cost', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'biological research', 'biomarker development', 'care costs', 'care systems', 'clinical heterogeneity', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinically relevant', 'cognitive testing', 'cost effective', 'data modeling', 'design', 'digital', 'disease classification', 'economic cost', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'fitbit', 'functional disability', 'functional outcomes', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'individual patient', 'learning strategy', 'longitudinal analysis', 'longitudinal course', 'mHealth', 'medical specialties', 'mobile computing', 'multidisciplinary', 'neural circuit', 'neuropsychiatry', 'neurotoxic', 'open source', 'personalized intervention', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'primary outcome', 'relapse prediction', 'relapse risk', 'responsible research conduct', 'secondary outcome', 'sensor', 'severe mental illness', 'social', 'tool', 'wearable device']",NIMH,BETH ISRAEL DEACONESS MEDICAL CENTER,K23,2018,191000,0.015842669544742317
"The initial care of younger adults with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes PROJECT SUMMARY Dr. Anjali Gopalan, MD, MSHP is a board-certified Internist at the Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC) Oakland Medical Center and a Research Scientist I (equivalent to Assistant Professor) at the KPNC Division of Research (DOR). With the proposed K23 mentored career development award, Dr. Gopalan will gain the advanced training and expertise necessary to become an independent investigator who can develop and implement tailored interventions for patients with early-onset type 2 diabetes (EOT2D). By focusing on adults with EOT2D, she seeks to address the comparatively poor micro- and macrovascular outcomes in this population that may result partly from inadequate management of hyperglycemia and other cardiovascular disease risk factors. Dr. Gopalan’s research premise posits that it is particularly critical for newly diagnosed patients with EOT2D to achieve early disease control, since tighter glycemic control during the year following diagnosis confers long-lasting micro- and macrovascular benefits. In support of the premise, the Research Aims of this K23 are to: 1) use electronic health record [EHR] data to identify EOT2D patient subgroups at highest risk of inadequate early disease control, 2) identify barriers to and facilitators of initial EOT2D management, and 3) examine prospective associations between patient-reported factors (e.g., disease-related distress, health literacy) and inadequate early disease control. The proposed research will be supported by experienced mentors and advisors, as well as advanced training in the following areas: 1) the use of advanced statistical modeling, 2) qualitative data analysis to inform intervention development, 3) the role of social determinants in health, and 4) implementation science. KPNC and DOR are ideal environments for the proposed work. KPNC is an integrated learning healthcare delivery system with a diverse membership of 4.2 million people (>350,000 with diabetes). DOR has a long track record of effectively training early stage investigators and has well-established internal research programs and collaborative relationships with nearby institutions that provide the infrastructure needed for career development. This environment, along with the proposed Research and Training Plans and an outstanding mentorship team, will enable Dr. Gopalan to continue to build the skills and generate the foundational data needed to submit an R01-level proposal during the final years of the proposed award period. In this planned R01, Dr. Gopalan will refine and implement an intervention (with a design based on the results of the three K23 Research Aims) to improve early care for newly diagnosed EOT2D patients and evaluate its impact on early outcomes in this growing, high-risk population. In summary, the proposed K23 award will support the career development of Dr. Gopalan and is vital to her acquiring the skill set and expertise required to become a successful, independent investigator. PROJECT NARRATIVE Adults diagnosed with type 2 diabetes at a younger age have higher rates of complications than those diagnosed later in life. Given the lasting benefit conferred by early disease control, the initial care provided to this growing, high-risk population is particularly crucial. With this proposed career development award, Dr. Gopalan will acquire the research skills necessary to identify patients at highest risk for inadequate early disease control, define barriers to initial disease management, and develop an intervention designed to improve the care of adults (ages 21-44) with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes.",The initial care of younger adults with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes,9666625,K23DK116968,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Area', 'Award', 'California', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Complications of Diabetes Mellitus', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Reporting', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Distress', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Face', 'Familiarity', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Sciences', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hyperglycemia', 'Hyperlipidemia', 'Hypertension', 'Institution', 'Integrated Health Care Systems', 'Internist', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Latino', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical center', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Pharmacy facility', 'Population', 'Population Characteristics', 'Provider', 'Qualitative Research', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Resources', 'Retrospective cohort', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk Management', 'Risk Reduction', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Smoke', 'Statistical Models', 'Stress', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Trees', 'United Kingdom', 'Work', 'barrier to care', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'career', 'career development', 'cohort', 'comparative', 'design', 'diabetes education', 'diabetes management', 'disorder control', 'eHealth', 'early onset', 'ethnic diversity', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'glycemic control', 'health care delivery', 'health literacy', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'implementation science', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'individual patient', 'insight', 'literacy', 'macrovascular disease', 'member', 'older patient', 'patient population', 'patient subsets', 'professor', 'programs', 'prospective', 'protective effect', 'racial and ethnic', 'skills', 'social stigma', 'therapy design', 'therapy development', 'young adult']",NIDDK,KAISER FOUNDATION RESEARCH INSTITUTE,K23,2018,194005,-0.0052235697346386814
"The Gut Microbiome in Parkinson Disease Project Summary/Abstract This is a first R01 application from an early stage, new investigator and current NIEHS K01 awardee. Parkinson disease (PD) is a disabling neurodegenerative disease for which there is no cure. Years before the diagnosis of PD and the onset of motor symptoms, PD patients develop non-motor symptoms, including, importantly, constipation and gastrointestinal dysfunction. Constipation affects over 80% of PD patients and is one of the strongest risk factors for PD. Recent research shows that the enteric nervous system in the gut and the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus nerve which anatomically links the GI system to the brain, are among the first and most severely affected by alpha-synuclein pathology characteristic of PD5 leading to the hypothesis that the gastrointestinal tract might be the site of initiation of PD. We propose to conduct a comprehensive investigation of the relation between human gut microbiome and PD, focusing on the pre- onset microbiome. We will do this by building on an ongoing Department of Defense funded project that has identified participants with pre-parkinson syndrome (PPS - defined as the co- occurrence of constipation, pRBD (probable rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder) and hyposmia) that in a pilot study has been associated with a ~200 fold increase in PD risk. Studying the microbiome among this group, who are highly likely to develop PD or are already in the premotor state, will give us a unique look at the microbiome in PD patients prior to any potential disease-associated effects of changes in diet and lifestyle that may have confounded prior case-control studies. The proposed study will take advantage of 25 years of prospectively collected data on environmental and dietary exposures and disease outcomes in two prospective cohorts of men and women. Project Narrative Our appreciation of the impact of the gut microbiome on brain health, and especially PD, is in the early stages. This study will be the first to examine the gut microbiome in participants with premotor PD and compare it to healthy controls, controls with constipation and to recently onset PD cases. This project will thus advance our understanding of how the human gut microbiome contributes to the pathophysiology of PD and will contribute to the development of tools needed for a preclinical diagnosis and/or treatment.",The Gut Microbiome in Parkinson Disease,9343057,R01NS097723,"['Affect', 'Anatomy', 'Anti-inflammatory', 'Bacteria', 'Biometry', 'Blood - brain barrier anatomy', 'Brain', 'Butyrates', 'Caffeine', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic Disease', 'Confounding Factors (Epidemiology)', 'Constipation', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Department of Defense', 'Diagnosis', 'Diet', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Enteric Nervous System', 'Enterobacteriaceae', 'Epidemiology', 'Exhibits', 'Feces', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Gait', 'Gastrointestinal tract structure', 'Genes', 'Health Professional', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Inflammatory', 'Inflammatory disease of the intestine', 'Intestines', 'Investigation', 'Life Style', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Metabolic', 'Mucous Membrane', 'National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences', 'Nature', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Nurses&apos', ' Health Study', 'Onset of illness', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Parkinsonian Disorders', 'Participant', 'Pathology', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Permeability', 'Pilot Projects', 'Production', 'Prospective cohort', 'Prospective cohort study', 'Proteobacteria', 'REM Sleep Behavior Disorder', 'Ralstonia', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Site', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Update', 'Vagus nerve structure', 'Volatile Fatty Acids', 'Woman', 'alpha synuclein', 'brain health', 'cigarette smoking', 'cohort', 'disorder risk', 'dorsal motor nucleus', 'dysbiosis', 'follow-up', 'gastrointestinal', 'gut bacteria', 'gut microbiome', 'gut microbiota', 'hyposmia', 'illness length', 'men', 'microbiome', 'microbiome analysis', 'microbiome composition', 'microbiome research', 'microbiota profiles', 'motor symptom', 'non-motor symptom', 'posture instability', 'pre-clinical', 'predictive signature', 'prospective', 'stool sample', 'tool development']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF MASSACHUSETTS LOWELL,R01,2018,418825,-0.003318669100775583
"Effects of Functional Food Diets on Cardiometabolic and Metabolomics Profiles in Minority Youth PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT This proposal outlines a career development plan to help Dr. Jaapna Dhillon complete her postdoctoral training and establish an independent research program focused on personalized dietary interventions to reduce cardiometabolic risk in minority populations. Her training will be conducted in a multidisciplinary group of scientists with research expertise in nutrition science, health disparities, molecular cell biology, metabolomics and computational biology. Her advisory team will provide an outstanding training environment that will allow her to fill critical gaps in her toolkit needed to use an integrative and personalized approach to nutrition. This award will enhance her knowledge in developing culturally sensitive nutrition interventions and cardiovascular physiology, and provide advanced training in metabolomics and computational biology. During the training phase of this award, she will strengthen her scholarly activities, establish important collaborations, and acquire critical data that will ensure her successful transition to independence. Rational: The incidence of diet-related cardiometabolic disorders is increasing at an alarming rate in racial/ethnic minority groups such as Asians and Hispanics, and are much higher than Non-Hispanic Whites in the United States. [8]. However, whether improvements in diet quality will influence minority groups at high risk of cardiometabolic diseases differentially than Whites at high risk is not well understood. Functional foods such as nuts, whole grains and vegetables can help ameliorate cardiovascular disease and reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes. However, most studies on functional foods and health have been overwhelmingly performed in middle-aged to older non-Hispanic White adults, with young minority populations being greatly neglected. Adapting a functional food diet at earlier life stages may prevent or ameliorate metabolic disorders later in life in minority populations that are at greater risk for developing chronic metabolic diseases. Our central hypothesis is that adapting a personalized functional food diet at earlier life stages will have greater beneficial effects on carbohydrate and lipid regulation pathways in minority youth at risk for developing cardiometabolic disorders compared to White youth at risk. Design: The mentored phase study will 1) examine the effects of almonds on blood glucose regulation pathways using metabolomics techniques and 2) provide preliminary data for the development and testing of a model that can predict effects of almonds on metabolic consequences in minority youth. The independent phase study will evaluate the long term effects of a personalized diet rich in functional foods on pathways of carbohydrate and lipid regulation in relation to the gut microbiome and cardiovascular outcomes in minority youth at high risk for cardiometabolic disorders. Relevance: The proposed studies will provide an initial evidence base for the health benefits of personalized functional food interventions in minority youth. This innovative dietary strategy may be more effective at reducing risk and ameliorating diet-related cardiometabolic disorders than conventional dietary advice in this population.

"Machine learning-based profiles of atherosclerosis to predict disease outcomes in older HIV-infected women and men No abstract available 8. PROJECT NARRATIVE People living with HIV have evidence of accelerated aging; prior studies have typically evaluated isolated outcomes despite the fact that aging is inherently a multifactorial and complex process. We propose to use machine learning methods to develop novel phenotypes of atherosclerosis among HIV-infected women and men, and then determine the utility of these phenotypes by assessing their associations with cardiovascular disease mortality and other age-related clinical and functional outcomes, including traditional “geriatric” outcomes. Our work has the potential to lead to new insights into the role of aging in cardiovascular pathogenesis among HIV-infected adults.",Machine learning-based profiles of atherosclerosis to predict disease outcomes in older HIV-infected women and men,9856243,R21AG060860,[' '],NIA,ALBERT EINSTEIN COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R21,2018,175781,-0.04608007101381911
"Validation of Survey Questions to Distinguish Type 1 and Type 2 Diabetes Among Adults With Diabetes PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes are distinct clinical conditions with different etiologies, ages of onset, management strategies, risk factors, and outcomes. Currently, the data sources that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) relies upon to monitor trends in diabetes prevalence and incidence are unable to reliably distinguish between types of diabetes. Most of the large federal surveys used for diabetes surveillance have not included questions on diabetes type, and few studies have reported survey-based algorithms for identifying diabetes type. None have compared survey-based identification algorithms with a gold standard case ascertainment in order to validate survey-based assignment of diabetes type. Methods for distinguishing between diabetes types in electronic health records (EHR) data have been tested for children and adults, but additional validation work is needed. Our approach to improving diabetes surveillance in these two areas is based on an integrated study design whereby survey data for diabetes patients are linked with data from their EHR and a gold standard case ascertainment derived from chart review. We will select a diverse sample of diabetes patients that is designed and powered to assess algorithm validity for subpopulations defined by age, sex, and race/ethnicity. We will use rigorous questionnaire development methods to build on items used in previous surveys, cognitively test the new survey module to optimize wording and question order, field the survey using data collection methods similar to established CDC surveys, and analyze the responses relative to a gold standard classification of diabetes type. In addition, we will develop and validate against the gold standard EHR-based algorithms, including a modeling approach that produces a parsimonious rule-based algorithm for determining diabetes type based on the most important clinical variables, and a machine learning approach that uses the gold standard dataset as a starting point to identify implicit patterns that distinguish T1DM and T2DM. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed project will result in a set of validated survey questions for distinguishing Type 1 diabetes (T1DM) and Type 2 diabetes (T2DM). It will also produce validated survey-based and EHR-based algorithms for identifying diabetes type. T1DM and T2DM are distinct clinical conditions with different etiologies, ages of onset, management strategies, risk factors, and outcomes. Currently, the data sources that CDC relies upon to monitor trends in diabetes prevalence and incidence are unable to reliably distinguish between types of diabetes. It is important for surveillance systems to be able to distinguish diabetes type to support type-specific analyses of morbidity, mortality, medical care costs, and health-related quality of life. Improved surveillance data by diabetes type can help guide and monitor federal, state, and local diabetes programs, enrich diabetes research, and support people with diabetes.",Validation of Survey Questions to Distinguish Type 1 and Type 2 Diabetes Among Adults With Diabetes,9542094,U01DP006327,[' '],NCCDPHP,"WESTAT, INC.",U01,2018,499828,-0.026994091473628076
"Advanced Risk Adjusters and Predictive Formulas for ICD-10 Based Risk Adjustment Diagnosis-based risk adjustment is widely used in the US and abroad for health plan payment, notably for Medicare Parts C and D, for commercial contracting and quality assessment, and in numerous state Medicaid programs. Yet the risk adjustment technology used for payments has not kept up with improved classification systems, larger patient datasets, improved estimation algorithms or recent theoretical and clinical developments. Our work will take advantage of the richer ICD-10-CM classification system, in use since October 2015, with over 5 times as many diagnoses as ICD-9-CM Codes. ICD-10 codes now recognize: left vs. right side for thousands of conditions, distinguish between initial, subsequent and sequela diagnoses, and incorporate hundreds of new clinical, demographic and biometric variables. Based on the ICD-10, more exact models can leverage increased diagnostic coding accuracy to reduce opportunities for gaming or discriminating against patients with conditions who are predicted to be unprofitable. Led by two of the three developers of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Hierarchical Condition Category (CMS-HCC) existing classification system, our team of physicians, public policy experts, statisticians and economists will comprehensively improve the accuracy of risk adjustment and predictive models using larger sample sizes, clinical judgment and state-of-art economic and statistical modeling. We will also expand the conventional regression methods explored, to include machine learning algorithms, constrained regression, and LASSO estimation. We will calculate a new “appropriateness to include” (ATI) score that captures diagnostic vagueness, discretion and suitability for use in risk adjustment models, and use this score to inform which variables are included in plan payment formulas. Selection incentives remain of concern in public US health plan payments formulas and may be costing Medicare over $5 billion per year (NBER 2017). Prediction and payment models from this project can reduce overpayment and offset plan incentives to skimp on services that attract sick people. To ensure that these models and formulas are useful for enrollees of all ages, they will initially be calibrated and tested on large commercially-insured claims data, covering ages 0 to 64. They will then be validated and refined for Medicare, Medicaid, and state employees using data from All-Payer Claims Data from five states and a second large commercial dataset. We will make development steps, statistical programs, and full details of the classification system and prediction formulas publicly available for comment, refinement, and use by health care delivery system researchers, payers and providers. Project Narrative This project will develop new classification systems and new prediction and payment models that take advantage of the fivefold increase in diagnostic codes available with the October 2015 change from ICD- 9-CM to ICD-10-CM. Using data from two national claims datasets and five state all-payer claims datasets that collectively cover over 75 million enrollees, we will identify new, underutilized ICD-10 capabilities, create new clusters of diagnoses useful for prediction, develop new algorithms for using these clusters, and estimate formulas that predict spending, utilization and diverse health care outcomes for all ages. Methods and results will be publicly described and software posted on the web for use in risk adjustment and diverse clinical, financial, policy evaluation, and quality assessment outcomes by health care delivery system researchers, payers and providers.",Advanced Risk Adjusters and Predictive Formulas for ICD-10 Based Risk Adjustment,9644117,R01HS026485,[' '],AHRQ,BOSTON UNIVERSITY (CHARLES RIVER CAMPUS),R01,2018,397399,0.0041279807256919005
"Optical Body Composition and Health Assessment ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):1 Of all markers of human health, the most intuitive is body shape but based on quantitative evidence.  2 Anthropometry and regional composition measures such as waist circumference (WC), waist to hip ratio  3 (WHR), and visceral adipose tissue area (VAT) are better predictors of obesity-related diseases and mortality  4 risk than body mass index (BMI). Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) can quantify regional adiposity in  5 more detail than the above measures but is underutilized for many reasons including potential harm from  6 ionizing radiation, cost, and training. A study is needed to take advantage of rapid technological developments  7 in the ""quantified self movement"" to better describe phenotypes of body shape and its relation to metabolic  8 risks. The candidate developed in this proposal is 3D optical whole body scanning. If successful, sophisticated  9 obesity phenotype profiles could be constructed to clarify the underlying associations of body composition with 10 disease, genetics, lifestyle exposures, metabolomics, and be highly assessable using self-assessment 11 technology. Whole body 3D imaging technology is already so accessible that it can be done with video games 12 such as the Microsoft Xbox Kinect, and consumer cameras. 13 The long term goal of the Optical Body Shape and Health Assessment Study is 1) to provide phenotype 14 descriptors of health using body shape, and 2) to provide the tools to visualize and quantify body shape in 15 research, clinical practice, and personal health assessment. Our overall approach is to first derive predictive 16 models of how body shape relates to regional and total body composition (subcutaneous fat, visceral fat, 17 muscle mass, lean mass, and percent fat), and then show how our 3DO body composition estimates are 18 associated to important metabolic risk factors. Our central hypothesis is that 3DO measures of body 19 composition with shape classification better predict metabolic risk factors than anthropometry or DXA body 20 composition alone. Our specific aims are: 1. Identify the unique associations of body shape to body 21 composition indices in a population that represents the variance of sex, age, BMI, and ethnicity found 22 in the US population; 2. Describe the precision and accuracy of 3DO scans to monitor change in body 23 composition and metabolic health interventions; and 3. Estimate the level of association of 3DO to 24 common health indicators including metabolic risk factors by gender, race, age, and BMI. In an 25 exploratory aim, we investigate holistic, high-resolution descriptors of 3D body shape as direct 26 predictors of body composition and metabolic risk using statistical shape models and Latent Class 27 Analysis. By the end of this study, we expect to have models of the shape and composition suitable for self- 28 assessment technologies that are capable of representing over 95% of the shape variance in the US 29 population, and how these models relate to important metabolic status and body composition. The positive 30 impact will be the immediate applicability to clinicians and individuals for personalized risk assessment. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research is relevant to public health because they have the potential to provide a better understanding of who is at high risk of metabolic diseases because of a poor metabolic profile. Thus, the advances proposed are expected to have a high impact to the health and wellbeing of all US citizens because metabolic diseases, such as obesity and its complications, are currently the number one killers of adults.

"Shape up! Kids Project Summary/Abstract Of all markers of pediatric health, the most intuitive is body shape. Human and animal studies indicate that weight loss/gain correlates closely with increasing/decreasing insulin sensitivity, respectively. Anthropometry and regional composition measures such as waist circumference, waist to hip ratio (WHR), and visceral adipose tissue area are better predictors of obesity-related diseases and mortality risk than pediatric body mass index Z-score. Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry can quantify regional adiposity in more detail than these measures but is underutilized for many reasons including the sensitivity to children to ionizing radiation, cost, and training. A study is needed to take advantage of rapid technological developments in optical technology to better describe phenotypes of pediatric body shape and its relation to metabolic risks (obesity, “failure to thrive”) and bone density and size. If successful, sophisticated obesity phenotype profiles could be constructed to clarify the underlying associations of body composition with disease, genetics, lifestyle exposures, metabolomics, and be highly assessable using self-assessment technology. The long term goal of the Shape Up! Kids Study is 1) to provide pediatric phenotype descriptors of health using body shape, and 2) to provide the tools to visualize and quantify body shape in research, clinical practice, and personal health assessment. Our overall approach is to first derive predictive models of how body shape relates to regional and total body composition (subcutaneous fat, visceral fat, muscle mass, lean mass, and percent fat) and bone mineral density (BMD) over a wide range of ages (5 to 18 years), weights and heights, stratified by sex, and ethnicity. Our central hypothesis is that optical estimates with shape classification of soft tissue composition and bone density better predict fracture and metabolic risk factors than anthropometry (WC, WHR, and BM) alone. The Investigators will highly leverage existing data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey and Bone Mineral Density in Children Study. Our specific aims are: 1) Identify the unique associations of body shape to body composition and bone density indices in a pediatric population that represents the variance found in the US population, 2) Describe the precision and accuracy of optical scans to monitor change in body composition, bone density, 3) Estimate the level of association of optical scans to common health indicators including metabolic risk factors. Our exploratory aim is to investigate holistic, high-resolution descriptors of 3D body shape as direct predictors of body composition and metabolic risk using statistical shape models and Latent Class Analysis. By the end of this study, we expect to have models of the shape and composition suitable for self-assessment technologies that are capable of representing over 95% of the shape variance in the US pediatric population, and to define how these models relate to important metabolic status indicators. The positive impact of these outcomes will be the immediate applicability to other researcher studies and clinicians using the automated tools and models developed here for 3D optical images.

"Using Machine Learning to Predict Problematic Prescription Opioid Use and Opioid Overdose Problematic prescription opioid use, defined as nonmedical use, misuse, or abuse of opioid medications, is epidemic in the US. Prescription opioid overdose deaths more than quadrupled from 1999 to 2015. Efforts by health care systems and payers to combat the opioid epidemic are impeded by a lack of accurate and efficient methods to identify individuals most at risk for problematic opioid use and overdose, leading to broad interventions that are burdensome to patients and expensive for payers. Payers are currently defining high risk and targeting interventions (e.g. pharmacy lock-in programs) based on individual risk factors, such as high opioid dosage, identified in prior studies using traditional statistical approaches. However, these traditional approaches have significant limitations, especially when handling large datasets with numerous variables, multi-level interactions, and missing data. Moreover, the prior studies focused on identifying risk factors rather than predicting actual risk. Alternatively, machine learning is an advanced technique that handles complex interactions in large data, uncovers hidden patterns, and yields precise prediction algorithms that, in many cases, are superior to those developed using traditional methods. Machine learning is widely used in activities from fraud detection to cancer genomics, but has not yet been applied to address the opioid epidemic. Accordingly, the proposed study will apply machine learning to develop prediction algorithms that can more accurately identify patients at high risk of problematic opioid use and overdose using data sources that are readily available to payers and health care systems. The project will build on existing academic-state partnerships to apply novel machine learning approaches to administrative claims data for all Medicaid beneficiaries in Pennsylvania (PA) and Arizona (AZ). The project will also link Medicaid data in AZ to electronic health records to capture clinical information (e.g., lab results, pain severity) not available in administrative data, along with death certificate data on lethal overdose. These data, covering 2007-2016, will be used to achieve two specific aims: (1) to develop and validate two separate prediction algorithms to identify patients at risk of problematic opioid use and opioid overdose; (2) to compare the accuracy of a prediction algorithm that integrates clinical data with Medicaid claims versus a claims-based approach alone to identify patients at risk of problematic opioid use and opioid overdose. The machine learning approaches will include random forests and TreeNet with representative classification trees, and the predictive ability (e.g., misclassification rates) of these algorithms will be compared to traditional statistical models. Given the high prevalence of mental health/substance use disorders (~50%) and opioid utilization (>20%) among Medicaid enrollees and the lack of adequate prediction algorithms, Medicaid is an ideal setting for the proposed project. These analyses will provide the partnering Medicaid programs with valuable information and tools that they can apply to more precisely target interventions to prevent problematic opioid use and overdose. Prescription opioid overdose deaths quadrupled from 1999 to 2015, and drug overdose is now the leading cause of injury deaths among adults in the United States. This project will use innovative machine learning methods and readily available data for Medicaid beneficiaries in two states hard hit by the epidemic – Pennsylvania and Arizona – to develop algorithms to accurately predict who is at risk of problematic prescription opioid use and overdose. This information will empower health systems, payers, and policymakers to more effectively target interventions to prevent prescription opioid misuse and its consequences.",Using Machine Learning to Predict Problematic Prescription Opioid Use and Opioid Overdose,9421755,R01DA044985,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Arizona', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Death Certificates', 'Detection', 'Dose', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emergency department visit', 'Ensure', 'Epidemic', 'Fee-for-Service Plans', 'Fraud', 'Genomics', 'Health system', 'Healthcare Systems', 'High Prevalence', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Inpatients', 'Intervention', 'Letters', 'Link', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Managed Care', 'Medicaid', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphine', 'Opioid', 'Outcome', 'Overdose', 'Pain', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pennsylvania', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacy facility', 'Preclinical Drug Evaluation', 'Prevalence', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Severities', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Subgroup', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Trees', 'United States', 'United States Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services', 'Urine', 'Work', 'base', 'beneficiary', 'cancer genomics', 'clinical predictors', 'combat', 'design', 'dosage', 'forest', 'high risk', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'milligram', 'model building', 'nonmedical use', 'novel', 'opioid abuse', 'opioid use', 'overdose death', 'prediction algorithm', 'prescription opioid', 'prescription opioid misuse', 'prevent', 'programs', 'service utilization', 'tool']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2017,601139,0.011223532091865317
"Improving cancer family history collection through social networking and artificial intelligence PROJECT SUMMARY  The  activities  proposed  in  this  NCI  K07  application  are  designed  to  advance  the  career  development  and  research  independence  of  Dr.  Brandon  M.  Welch.  Family  health  history  (FHx)  is  one  of  the most important  resources available to help clinicians identify disease risks. By knowing a patient's FHx, clinicians can quickly  identify  disease risks and initiate risk-reducing strategies such as increased screening, prophylactic surgery,  risk-reducing  therapeutics,  and  lifestyle  changes.  FHx  is  also  the  foundation  of  genomic  medicine.  Unfortunately,  the  collection  and  use  of  FHx  by  patients  and  clinicians  is  suboptimal.  To  improve  the  collection and use of FHx among the general population, a better FHx tool that is easier and more convenient  to  use  than  current  FHx  tools  is  needed.  A  new  FHx  web  tool,  called  ​ItRunsInMyFamily.com,​  incorporates  artificial intelligence and social networking to improve user engagement with FHx collection.Utilizing artificial  intelligence  based  chat  entity  can  improve  the  collection  of  FHx  information  by  making  it  easier  and  more  engaging to record FHx information, likewise social networking allows users to tap into the collective wisdom  and  knowledge  of  the  family  to  correct  inaccuracies  and  overcome  gaps  in  FHx  knowledge.  This research  study  will  first  identify  enhancements  to  ​ItRunsInMyFamily.com  ​that  will  further  promote  user  engagement,  with  particular  focus  on  rural and underserved patients (Aim 1). We will then evaluate whether this new FHx  tool can improve collection of cancer FHx in comparison with current FHx tools (Aim 2). Finally, we will assess  the impact of ​ItRunsInMyFamily.com ​on the clinical settings (Aim 3). To implement the research plan, it will be  critical  to  apply,  skills  obtained  through  K  award  learning  objectives,  namely  clinical  oncology  (learning  objective  1),  iterative  patient-centered  design  (learning  objective  2),  and  health  technology  assessment  (learning  objective  3).  To  fulfill  these  learning  objectives,  an  interdisciplinary  group  of  mentors  will  direct  a  comprehensive training plan. The training plan includes coursework, seminars, workshops, journal clubs, and  conferences,  covering clinical oncology, patient engagement, health disparities, user-centered development,  human-computer  interaction,  clinical  research  methodologies,  health  technology  assessment,  and  ethical  conduct  of  research.  The  strong  support  of  an  excellent  team  of  mentors,  and  the  vast  resources  of  the  Medical  University  of  South  Carolina,  create  an  optimal  training  environment.  Collectively,  the  integrated  learning  objectives  and  research  plan  are  critical  to  establishing  a  successful,  innovative,  and  meaningful  academic career focused on developing patient-centric informatics tools for oncology.   PROJECT NARRATIVE Family health history (FHx) is one of the most important risk factors for cancer and the foundation of genomic medicine, but is under-utilized by patients and clinicians.

"Developing Risk Algorithms of Internalizing Disorder Etiology and Course ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Anxiety and mood disorders (internalizing disorders [IDs]) are common and debilitating conditions. The proposed Career Development Award will provide the candidate with the necessary skills to develop an independent research program focused on identifying how psychological/personality, environmental, and biomarker vulnerabilities predict the development and course of IDs using prospective observational survey designs. The applicant's prior research training involved studying the influence of psychological/personality vulnerabilities on ID severity and course in patient samples. In order to expand his research program, the applicant is seeking advanced training in two key areas (psychiatric epidemiology; machine learning methods) and supplemental training in two additional areas (self-assessed biomarkers; environmental vulnerabilities). Collectively, this training will provide the applicant with the skills (1) to study ID onset and course using prospective survey designs, and (2) to use machine learning methods to develop clinically-useful risk algorithms of ID onset and course using multiple vulnerability domains (psychological/ personality; environmental; biomarker). These skills will be developed through a combination of didactic training, guided readings, and mentored research projects. Training will occur in the Department of Health Care Policy at Harvard Medical School under the mentoring of Dr. Ronald Kessler (an expert in psychiatric epidemiology) and Dr. Sherri Rose (an expert in machine learning). The proposed research plan involves two phases. In Phase 1, machine learning methods will be used to analyze cross-sectional ID data from the World Mental Health (WMH) Surveys in order to develop risk algorithms that predict the onset of major depression, bipolar disorder, and generalized anxiety disorder (Specific Aim 1). Machine learning methods will also be applied to WMH Survey data to develop subtypes of bipolar disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, and posttraumatic stress disorder that maximize the prediction of their long-term course (Specific Aim 2). The proposed Phase 1 studies are highly innovative; in contrast to other areas of medicine, virtually no studies have attempted to develop ID risk algorithms or subtypes using machine learning methods. However, Phase 1 studies are also preliminary; replication and expansion of the algorithms is needed in prospective samples. Accordingly, Phase 2 of the research plan (Specific Aim 3) aims to test the feasibility of conducting a large prospective web-based survey study of psychological/personality (assessed via self-report and behavior), environmental (assessed via self-report), and biomarker (assessed via self-administered salivary assays) vulnerabilities of ID onset and course. Participants will be recruited online to complete a baseline survey and those determined to have an ID or be at high-risk of developing an ID will be asked to complete bimonthly follow-ups over the course of one year. The Phase 2 study is also innovative. Despite being called ""the future"" of epidemiological research, web-based survey studies of the IDs are rare. In addition, existing prospective epidemiological studies coarsely (i.e., dichotomously) assess IDs and their vulnerabilities, and have long gaps (1-4 years) between follow-ups. The use of bimonthly online surveys of the severity of IDs and their vulnerabilities will address these limitations. Phase 2 exploratory analyses will also be conduct in which latent ID trajectories are predicted using machine learning methods. Overall, the outlined training activities and mentored research projects will be used to develop an R01 application for a prospective epidemiological study that uses machine learning methods to develop clinically useful algorithms of ID onset and course using a broad range of psychological/personality, environmental, and biomarker vulnerabilities factors. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research aims to use cutting-edge statistical methods to develop clinically-useful (1) risk algorithms to identify who is at greatest risk of developing different internalizing disorders, and (2) subtypes of internalizing disorders that identify who is most likely to experience a persistence and chronic long-term disorder course. This research has important clinical and public health implications. With this research, individuals at risk of developing internalizing disorders can be targeted using early detection and prevention efforts, while those at risk of experiencing a persistent and chronic long-term course can be targeted using tailored/intensive internalizing disorder interventions.",Developing Risk Algorithms of Internalizing Disorder Etiology and Course,9335456,K01MH106710,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Appointment', 'Area', 'Baseline Surveys', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Childhood', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'DSM-IV', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Dropout', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemiology', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Generalized Anxiety Disorder', 'Growth', 'Health Policy', 'Health Surveys', 'Healthcare', 'Individual', 'International', 'Intervention', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Life', 'Literature', 'Logistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Medicine', 'Mental Health', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Mood Disorders', 'Online Systems', 'Onset of illness', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Personality', 'Personality Traits', 'Phase', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Predictive Factor', 'Prevention', 'Prospective Studies', 'Psychiatric epidemiology', 'Public Health', 'Questionnaires', 'Rare Diseases', 'Reading', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Research Training', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Rosa', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Studies', 'Self-Administered', 'Severities', 'Societies', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stressful Event', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Validation', 'clinical decision-making', 'college', 'cost', 'design', 'disorder risk', 'disorder subtype', 'epidemiology study', 'experience', 'follow up assessment', 'follow-up', 'forest', 'high risk', 'innovation', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'longitudinal course', 'medical schools', 'phase 1 study', 'phase 2 study', 'population based', 'prediction algorithm', 'programs', 'prospective', 'psychologic', 'public health relevance', 'salivary assay', 'secondary analysis', 'self reported behavior', 'skills', 'theories', 'virtual']",NIMH,BOSTON UNIVERSITY (CHARLES RIVER CAMPUS),K01,2017,166910,-0.004193899756086163
"Using existing data to understand and ameliorate risk in opioid agonist therapy PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The United States is in the midst of an opioid epidemic, leading to unprecedented levels of overdose deaths and other harms. Effective treatment for opioid use disorders is available, in the form of opioid agonist therapy (OAT) with methadone or buprenorphine. However, there are significant questions about the risk of adverse clinical outcomes, including mortality and hospitalization during and after treatment, and unplanned treatment cessation. What is the magnitude of these risks, and what patient, treatment setting, and provider factors may contribute to or protect against risk? Additionally, it is increasingly clear that more sophisticated approaches to patient assessment and treatment planning than are currently used are needed to minimise risk. We aim to: 1. Determine the magnitude of risk for specific adverse clinical outcomes (e.g. mortality, hospitalization and ED presentation, and unplanned treatment cessation) during and after OAT with methadone and buprenorphine; 2. Identify patient, treatment setting, and provider risk factors associated with adverse clinical outcomes during and after OAT with methadone and buprenorphine; and 3. Develop a risk prediction model to identify patients at greatest risk of adverse clinical outcomes during and after OAT. To achieve these aims, this project will use existing population-based Australian data on OAT, linked to several health and criminal justice datasets to provide a rich understanding of treatment exposures and outcomes. These data will be used to inform strategies to guide the delivery of high-quality treatment for opioid use disorder in the United States. Specifically, the project will provide data about the magnitude of risk of adverse clinical outcomes during specific treatment and post-treatment periods, and identify patient, treatment setting and provider factors that influence risk. Additionally, it will use innovative machine learning techniques to demonstrate the potential for routinely collected data to be used to assess patient risk at point-of-care, allowing for the development of tailored treatment plans that minimize risk and maximize treatment retention. PROJECT NARRATIVE Opioid agonist therapy is an effective treatment for opioid use disorder, including prescription opioid use disorder. However, important questions about safety and risks during treatment remain unanswered.

"Understanding Severe Maternal Morbidity: Predictors, Trends, and Disparities PROJECT SUMMARY Severe maternal morbidity (SMM) includes serious threats to maternal health and survival that occur at delivery or postpartum.

Over the past 15 years, the prevalence of SMM has doubled in the U.S., currently affecting more than 65,000 women each year. Additionally, the prevalence of SMM is highest in women of minority races and ethnicities, particularly women who are non-Hispanic black or Hispanic. However, the most important risk factors for SMM are not established and it is unknown what is contributing to racial/ethnic disparities and increasing trends in SMM. Our goal is to improve the understanding of SMM and its risk factors to provide evidence that supports efforts to reduce the prevalence of SMM and racial/ethnic disparities in SMM. The proposed project will use linked vital statistics, patient discharge, and U.S. Census data for over 4 million births in California from 2007 to 2014. We will test trends in SMM prevalence and calculate the population attributable risks for three key potential risk factors—advanced maternal age, prepregnancy obesity, and cesarean delivery—and their combination across the years of study (Aim 1). Additionally, we will examine a wide range of potential risk factors to identify those that are most important using a machine-learning/data-adaptive approach (Aim 2). Both study aims will be done in the overall sample and separately in racial/ethnic groups. Understanding SMM trends and determining the strongest predictors of SMM are critical steps to launch forward research of this pressing and understudied public health problem. Many factors may present crucial opportunities to prevent the development severe maternal morbidity—saving the lives of mothers and helping ensure a healthy future for their children. PROJECT NARRATIVE Each year, more and more new mothers are diagnosed with serious pregnancy-related medical conditions, particularly mothers who identify as racial/ethnic minorities. Research is urgently needed to understand what is driving this alarming problem and what puts women most at risk so future research can be conducted to guide interventions and clinical care for childbearing women.","Understanding Severe Maternal Morbidity: Predictors, Trends, and Disparities",9327774,F32HD091945,"['Affect', 'Automobile Driving', 'Birth', 'Birth Certificates', 'California', 'Censuses', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Cesarean section', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Child Care', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disadvantaged', 'Discipline of obstetrics', 'Disease', 'Ensure', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Ethnic group', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hispanics', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'ICD-9', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Infant Health', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Life', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Link', 'Long-Term Effects', 'Machine Learning', 'Maternal Age', 'Maternal Health', 'Maternal Mortality', 'Maternal Physiology', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Minority Groups', 'Modeling', 'Mothers', 'Neighborhoods', 'Not Hispanic or Latino', 'Outcome', 'Patient Discharge', 'Population', 'Population Attributable Risks', 'Population Study', 'Postpartum Hemorrhage', 'Postpartum Period', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Outcome', 'Prevalence', 'Procedures', 'Public Health', 'Race', 'Records', 'Research', 'Retrospective cohort study', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Savings', 'Sepsis', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Time trend', 'Vital Statistics', 'Woman', 'Women&apos', 's Health', 'advanced maternal age', 'base', 'child bearing', 'clinical care', 'design', 'effective intervention', 'ethnic minority population', 'improved', 'indexing', 'maternal morbidity', 'outcome prediction', 'prepregnancy obesity', 'prevent', 'racial and ethnic', 'racial and ethnic disparities', 'social', 'trend']",NICHD,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,F32,2017,56334,0.028221862121502767
"Characterizing Trauma Outcomes: From Pre-trauma Risk to Post-trauma Sequelae Abstract Background: Trauma is common, but we have little ability to predict who will develop post-trauma psychopathology. Consistent challenges to our understanding of the etiology of post-trauma psychopathology include: (1) obtaining unbiased prospective data on risk factors preceding or concurrent with trauma; (2) the inability to model large comprehensive risk structures with traditional null hypothesis testing methods, despite the knowledge that risk factors do not operate in isolation; and (3) the almost universal focus on PTSD outcomes to date, while post-trauma psychopathology likely involves various symptoms spanning multiple disorder categories. The aims of this study are to (1) use data from a large, prospective population trauma cohort to establish multidimensional classes of post-trauma psychopathology which include diagnoses from various theoretically derived categories (e.g., stress diagnoses, mood disorders, personality disorders) and (2) to discover multivariate predictor sets and novel interactions which predict post- trauma psychopathology class membership and class transitions over time. Given the projected sample size we will also be able to examine gender differences in psychopathology and resilience, as well as differences by trauma type. Study Design: This study will make use of national prospective data previously assembled as part of an R21 project (and augmented with additional trauma data and more years of follow-up) to establish a trauma cohort from 1995 – 2015. Trauma cohort members will have experienced at least one of 10 traumatic events (i.e., fires/explosions, accidents and assaults, poisoning, life-threatening illness/injury, pregnancy-related trauma and sudden family deaths). Extensive pre- trauma and post-trauma data on psychiatric diagnoses, treatment (medication and psychotherapy) and social variables will be included. We will use latent class analyses to characterize multidimensional post-trauma psychopathology outcomes (including the absence of psychopathology) and latent transition analyses to examine changes in class membership over time. Machine learning statistical methods will be applied to the expansive risk factor data to develop multivariate predictor sets for outcome classes and class transitions over time. Bias analyses will be used to assess the impact of various forms of systematic error on our results. Implications: This study fulfills NIMH’s strategic priorities of (1) charting mental illness trajectories to determine when, where, and how to intervene and (2) strengthening the public health impact of NIMH-supported research. Our approach will achieve robust and valid risk profiles of post-trauma psychopathology in the most efficient way possible by using pre- existing prospective data from a full and unselected population. A life course multidimensional approach to trauma research is a critical next step in this field. In future work, psychopathology classes and multivariate predictor sets discovered as part of this study can be replicated and expanded in other populations to examine variations of our findings, and used as the basis for a more detailed exploration of newly discovered pathways to psychopathology risk and resilience following trauma. Narrative This large general population-based trauma cohort study will elucidate risk profiles for multidimensional psychopathology and resilience following trauma. Use of registry-based data from an unselected population and rigorous epidemiologic methods allows us to efficiently examine predictor combinations (e.g., psychiatric diagnoses, treatments, social variables), while minimizing bias. Results from this study can be replicated and expanded in other populations.",Characterizing Trauma Outcomes: From Pre-trauma Risk to Post-trauma Sequelae,9309288,R01MH110453,"['Accidents', 'Address', 'Attention', 'Categories', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Cohort Studies', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Sources', 'Denmark', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness', 'Ensure', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Etiology', 'Explosion', 'Family', 'Fire - disasters', 'Future', 'Gender', 'General Population', 'Heterogeneity', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision (ICD-10)', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Marital Status', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Opiates', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Personality Disorders', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Poisoning', 'Population', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Pregnancy', 'Prospective cohort', 'Psychiatric Diagnosis', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychopathology', 'Psychotherapy', 'Public Health', 'Reaction', 'Registries', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Support', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Source', 'Statistical Methods', 'Steroids', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Trauma', 'Trauma Research', 'Variant', 'Work', 'assault', 'base', 'cohort', 'epidemiology study', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'gender difference', 'member', 'novel', 'population based', 'prospective', 'resilience', 'sexual assault', 'social', 'time use', 'tool', 'traumatic event']",NIMH,BOSTON UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CAMPUS,R01,2017,319091,0.0029686624991255763
"Magnetic Resonance Imaging Based Calf Muscle Perfusion To Assess Patients with Symptomatic Peripheral Artery Disease Abstract: Peripheral artery disease (PAD) is associated with impaired leg function, possible limb loss and an increased risk of cardiovascular events. Intermittent claudication (IC) is a classic PAD symptom occurring in 40% of symptomatic patients, and is associated with 5-, and 15-year mortality rates of 30% and 70%, respectively. PAD is a debilitating illness affecting more than 8.5 million Americans of age 40 and older and 202 million people globally. Despite the high prevalence, PAD patients are less likely to receive appropriate treatment for their atherosclerotic risk factors than patients with coronary artery disease. Advances in endovascular therapy have reduced risks associated with intervention, enabling revascularization as a routine procedure in patients with lower extremity ischemia. However, revascularization success rates vary substantially and numerous PAD patients do not improve at 1-year despite technically good revascularization. Previous findings suggest that alterations in the microcirculation due to a paucity of collateralization may contribute to functional impairment in PAD patients. We hypothesize that the change in microvascular perfusion can identify PAD patients who do not improve at 12-months after revascularization. We will utilize contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (CE-MRI) to assess skeletal muscle perfusion in PAD patients. The CE-MRI measures will be associated with hemodynamics and symptoms. The early identification of individuals with a likely poor prognosis post intervention could help to improve surgical treatment strategies. We will investigate the association of microvascular perfusion (Aim 1) and measures of arterial hemodynamics (Aim 2) with leg function and PAD symptoms. We will utilize machine learning methodologies to identify predictors of poor leg function and symptoms (Aim 3). Given the high incidence of PAD and the associated high risk of cardiovascular events, it is paramount to identify individuals who are less likely to improve following lower extremity revascularization. The data of this clinical imaging study will provide novel information on the etiology of microvascular blood flow in PAD. Relevance: The proposed research study is of considerable public health importance given that patients with peripheral artery disease (PAD) have an increased risk of atherothrombotic cardiovascular events and mortality. The development of improved non-invasive imaging techniques to assess PAD may enable optimized treatment for individuals who are at an increased risk of future cardiovascular events.",Magnetic Resonance Imaging Based Calf Muscle Perfusion To Assess Patients with Symptomatic Peripheral Artery Disease,9363302,R01HL137763,"['Affect', 'Age', 'American', 'Ankle', 'Arteries', 'Blood Vessels', 'Blood flow', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical assessments', 'Comorbidity', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Data', 'Data Reporting', 'Development', 'Disease Outcome', 'Early identification', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Exercise', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'High Prevalence', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Impairment', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Intermittent Claudication', 'Intervention', 'Ischemia', 'Leg', 'Legal patent', 'Limb structure', 'Literature', 'Lower Extremity', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical center', 'Methodist Church', 'Methodology', 'Microcirculation', 'Muscle', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Oxygen', 'Partial Pressure', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perfusion', 'Peripheral arterial disease', 'Phase', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Pilot Projects', 'Procedures', 'Public Health', 'Recovery', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Reference Values', 'Resolution', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Signal Transduction', 'Skeletal Muscle', 'Standardization', 'Superficial Femoral Artery', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Toes', 'Treadmill Tests', 'Validation', 'Veterans', 'Walking', 'base', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'contrast enhanced', 'contrast imaging', 'functional disability', 'hemodynamics', 'high risk', 'imaging modality', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'mortality', 'non-invasive imaging', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'post intervention', 'regional difference', 'research study', 'skeletal', 'success', 'successful intervention', 'symptomatic improvement', 'treadmill', 'treatment strategy', 'two-dimensional', 'vascular sonography']",NHLBI,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R01,2017,518262,-0.0014615503808355357
"Predicting In-hospital Cardiac Arrest Using Electronic Health Record Data DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In-hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA) is a significant public health problem, afflicting over 200,000 patients in the United States annually with a mortality rate of approximately 80%. The majority of these patients show signs of clinical deterioration in the hours before the event. This has led to the development of vital sign-based early warning scores designed to detect high-risk patients before IHCA to trigger life-saving interventions. However, the vast majority of these risk scores were created subjectively in individual hospitals and have shown limited accuracy for detecting adverse outcomes. Developing an accurate risk score to detect patients at highest risk of IHCA is essential to decreasing preventable in-hospital death. In my prior work, I completed several studies investigating the accuracy of vital signs for predicting IHCA. These studies, previous literature, and my preliminary data have resulted in the following conclusions: 1) statistically developed risk scores are more accurate than previously published risk scores, 2) multicenter data is needed to create the most accurate and generalizable risk score, 3) additional data, such as laboratory results, will likely improve the accuracy of risk scores, and 4) a cutting-edge method for developing prediction models, called machine learning, may result in more accurate risk scores. Importantly, significant improvement in accuracy leads to better identification of patients at highest risk of IHCA and decreased resource utilization. Therefore, in this grant proposal I aim to develop and validate IHCA prediction models using different statistical techniques in a multicenter database and then estimate the impact of the most accurate risk score using simulation studies. I will do this by firt developing prediction models using classic survival analysis methods (Aim 1a) and machine learning methods, such as neural networks and decision trees (Aim 1b). Then, I will compare the models I develop to the most accurate previously published risk scores in Aim 2. Finally, I will investigate the impact of the most accurate model from Aim 2 on patient outcomes using simulation modeling (Aim 3). Completion of this proposal will result in a validated IHCA risk score that can be implemented in the electronic health record to trigger life- saving interventions to decrease preventable in-hospital death. In addition, this career development award will provide critical data to inform future R01-level awards, including a clinical trial to investigate he impact of the developed prediction model on patient outcomes. I will complete this project under the direct supervision of my mentor (Dr. David Meltzer), co-mentor (Dr. Dana Edelson), and the rest of my advisory team (Drs. Jesse Hall, Robert Gibbons, and Michael Kattan). Together, this multidisciplinary team brings nationally renowned expertise in in-hospital cardiac arrest, outcomes research, critical care, and clinical prediction modeling. In addition, they serve as Chairs of the Section of Hospital Medicine (Dr. Meltzer), Section of Pulmonary and Critical Care (Dr. Hall), and Quantitative Health Sciences at the Cleveland Clinic (Dr. Kattan), and Directors of the Center for Health and the Social Sciences (Dr. Meltzer), Center for Health Statistics (Dr. Gibbons), and Clinical Research for the Emergency Resuscitation Center (Dr. Edelson). The mentorship, expertise, and resources that they provide will ensure my success as I grow into an independent physician-scientist. My career goal is to become an independent critical care outcomes researcher with a focus on developing prediction models for clinical deterioration that will improve patient outcomes. To accomplish this long-term goal, I have three short-term goals: (1) to gain expertise in the development and implementation of clinical prediction models, (2) to create an IHCA prediction model that will identify high-risk patients on the wards to trigger life-saving interventions, and (3) to gain expertise in simulation modeling in order to study the impact of the developed prediction model. To accomplish these goals, I will build upon the foundation I developed when earning my Master's Degree in Public Health and during my initial training in the PhD program in the Department of Health Studies. Although my training to date has provided me with a strong background in epidemiology and biostatistics, further advanced training in biostatistics is crucial for my development into a successful independent researcher. An integrated program of didactic coursework, seminars, research activities, and conference participation will span the duration of the award. By accomplishing my three short- term goals, I will develop unique skills that will allow me to become a successful independent researcher. Specifically, the expertise I will gain in prediction model development, implementation, and simulation modeling can be applied not only to IHCA research but also to other areas of critical care medicine. In addition, completion of these goals will result in a validated IHCA prediction model that I will study in future implementation and cost-effectiveness studies and will serve as a basis for future R01-level grant submissions. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Over 200,000 in-hospital cardiac arrests occur in the United States each year, and studies suggest that many of these events may be preventable if the clinical warning signs can be identified and acted upon quickly. However, the vast majority of tools used to identify patients at high risk of cardiac arrest were created subjectively and have limited accuracy. Development of a statistically derived risk tool is essential to detect at- risk patients accurately and early in order to provide the best opportunity to improve patient outcomes and reduce preventable in-hospital death.",Predicting In-hospital Cardiac Arrest Using Electronic Health Record Data,9198041,K08HL121080,"['Adult', 'Advisory Committees', 'Applications Grants', 'Area', 'Award', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Biometry', 'Brain', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Categories', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complex', 'Critical Care', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Trees', 'Deterioration', 'Development', 'Diastolic blood pressure', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emergency research', 'Ensure', 'Epidemiology', 'Event', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Health Sciences', 'Heart Arrest', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Hylobates Genus', 'Individual', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Laboratories', 'Life', 'Literature', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Master&apos', 's Degree', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Patient Discharge', 'Patient risk', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Procedures', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Resuscitation', 'Risk', 'Savings', 'Scientist', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Social Sciences', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Supervision', 'Survival Analysis', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Uncertainty', 'United States', 'Update', 'Validation', 'Work', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'career', 'cost effectiveness', 'design', 'evidence base', 'high risk', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'model development', 'models and simulation', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'simulation', 'skills', 'statistics', 'success', 'symposium', 'tool', 'ward']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,K08,2017,163944,-0.0007106302817135989
"A Novel Probabilistic Methodology for Prediction of Emerging Diseases in Patients with Multiple Chronic Conditions ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Treatment for people living with multiple chronic conditions (MCC) currently accounts for an estimated 66 percent of the Nation's health care costs and will continue to grow. This mounting challenge has become a major public health issue since MCC is linked to suboptimal health outcomes and rising health care costs. However, it now known how MCC emerge among individuals or in the general population. Traditional epidemiological approaches have led to important findings of disease links and comorbidity associations. However, they are limited in their ability to characterize how patients acquire new chronic conditions and predict/personalize the emergence of MCC for individual patients. Objectives: This study will develop approaches that can be used to identify the most likely combinations of comorbidity within a population. These approaches can be tailored to examine MCC patterns in specific sub- populations or at the level of the individual patient. We will also study the effect of a large set of risk factors on MCC combinations emergence. Furthermore, we will use data mining approaches to predict and monitor the development of MCC combinations in at the population and individual levels. Hypotheses: We hypothesize that the emergence and progression of comorbidities in MCC patients form patterns that can be predicted and which are associated with prior medical conditions, demographic, and socio-economic characteristics. We further hypothesize that these methods can predict the timing and emergence of new chronic diseases more accurately by personalizing the records for individual patients. Aims and methodology: in Aim1, we will characterize how MCC emerge and progress in distinct patterns and how these patterns transition between different combinations of diseases over time. We will then identify and group major MCC transitions using the Markov clustering (MCL) algorithm, which is a novel, efficient graphical approach to handle big data. In Aim 2, we will identify which risk factors are associated with MCC emergence using a machine learning approach that can handle the complex heterogeneity of comorbidity patterns. Risk factors include age, sex, race/ethnicity, education, economic status, marital status, and prior medical conditions. In Aim 3, we will use a similarity learning approach to develop models that can predict if MCC will emerge in individual patients or among populations and we will be able to use these models to monitor MCC emergence over time. Conclusion: Our findings will provide a foundation for future research that will evaluate specific treatment patterns associated with progression in MCC patterns and ultimately identify optimal time points of intervention for those with, or at risk for multiple chronic conditions. These findings will also provide information that can be used at the community level to manage healthcare resources to improve continuity and accessibility of care.

"Dynamic, real-time prediction of alcohol use lapse using mHealth technologies ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Available psychosocial and pharmacological treatments for alcohol use disorder are effective at establishing abstinence. However, the vast majority of patients relapse within a year and often within the first few months following treatment. Patients often fail to detect dynamic changes in their relapse risk. Furthermore, the majority of patients fail to adequately sustain use of skills developed during treatment and/or through continuing care. Well-established theoretical models indicate that alcohol and other drug use lapse risk is a dynamic, non-linear function of both distal, relatively static, patient characteristics and often moment-by- moment dynamic changes in proximal, precipitating risk factors. However, comprehensive, precise assessment of dynamic risk indicators in real-time has not been possible until very recently. Furthermore, innovative methods from predictive analytics have not been applied to the lapse risk prediction problem. The broad goals of this project are to develop, validate, preliminarily optimize, and deliver a dynamic, real-time lapse risk prediction model for forecasting alcohol use among abstinent alcoholics. To pursue these goals, we propose to follow 200 patients for three months during or following completion of standard of care treatment for alcohol use disorder. We will measure well-established distal, static relapse risk indicators on study intake. More importantly, we will use innovative mHealth technology to densely sample dynamic risk indicators including patient physiology, subjective experience, and behavior daily for three months using smartphones and wearable biometric sensors. Data obtained for these static and dynamic risk indicators will provide the foundation to accomplish the following Specific Aims: 1. Assess burden (feasibility, cost, and patient acceptability) to collect innovative, densely sampled risk indicators via smartphone and wearable sensors. 2. Use machine learning methods to develop, train, and validate a real-time quantitative lapse risk prediction signal based on static and dynamic risk indicators. 3. Use innovative Markov decision process models to optimize decisions about if, when, and how to provide additional treatment or support. 4. Integrate and deliver risk prediction and decision model within the Comprehensive Health Enhancement Support System for Addiction (A-CHESS) program. These project aims position A-CHESS to make relapse prevention and recovery support, information, and risk monitoring available to patients continuously. Compared to conventional continuing care, A-CHESS will provide personalized care and be available and implemented during moments of greatest need. Integrated real-time risk prediction holds substantial promise to encourage sustained recovery through adaptive use of these continuing care services. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goals of this project are to develop and deliver a dynamic, real-time model for forecasting alcohol use lapse among abstinent alcoholics. This lapse risk prediction model will be integrated into an existing validated mHealth platform to encourage sustained recovery through adaptive use of continuing care services.","Dynamic, real-time prediction of alcohol use lapse using mHealth technologies",9275293,R01AA024391,"['Abstinence', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Behavior', 'Biometry', 'Caring', 'Cellular Phone', 'Characteristics', 'Communities', 'Comorbidity', 'Competence', 'Data', 'Decision Modeling', 'Dependence', 'Distal', 'Drug Use Disorder', 'Drug usage', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Galvanic Skin Response', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Services', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Heart Rate', 'Intake', 'Intervention', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motivation', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmacological Treatment', 'Physiology', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predictive Analytics', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Psychopathology', 'Recovery', 'Relapse', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Services', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sleep', 'Support System', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Theoretical model', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'United States Department of Veterans Affairs', 'Validation', 'Voice', 'Withdrawal', 'addiction', 'alcohol abuse therapy', 'alcohol and other drug', 'alcohol involvement', 'alcohol services', 'alcohol use disorder', 'base', 'clinical application', 'coping', 'cost', 'craving', 'disorder later incidence prevention', 'experience', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'mHealth', 'model development', 'personalized care', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'problem drinker', 'programs', 'psychosocial', 'public health relevance', 'real time model', 'relapse patients', 'relapse risk', 'relative cost', 'response', 'sensor', 'skills', 'standard of care', 'stressor']",NIAAA,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R01,2017,381816,-0.035999116974761894
"Reducing Non-Medical Opioid Use: An automatically adaptive mHealth Intervention ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In recent years in the U.S., problems associated with opioid prescriptions, including non-medical use and overdose, increased to historically unprecedented levels and represent a public health crisis. Emergency departments (EDs) play an important role in opioid prescribing, particularly to individuals at high risk for adverse opioi-related outcomes. Half of all ED visits are for a painful condition, and one third of all ED visits result in an opioid being prescribed. Moreover, in our pilot work, a quarter of patients surveyed at the ED study site reported non-medical opioid use in the prior three months. Despite the importance of this problem, strategies to reduce non-medical opioid use after an ED visit have not been well-studied. Our recent trial of a motivational intervention delivered to patients in the ED by a therapist resulted in modest reductions in non- medical use after the ED visit compared to a control condition. However, the intervention was unable to address the implications of opioids prescribed as a result of the ED encounter on post-ED opioid use behavior. This project will adapt the intervention for delivery after the ED visit through mobile technology in order to directly address the use of ED-provided opioids. Patients (n=600) will be recruited during an ED visit for a randomized controlled trial of the adapted intervention based on having used opioids non-medically in the prior three months and being given an opioid by an ED prescriber. In the intervention condition, interactive voice response calls will repeatedly assess non-medical opioid use and pain level and deliver intervention content. The intervention will include several potential actions that vary in intensity: assessment only, a brief message, extended messaging, or connection to a therapist by phone. Because the most helpful intensity of intervention is unknown and likely to vary between patients, the project will use an artificial intelligence stratey called reinforcement learning (RL). The RL system will continuously ""learn"" from the success of prior actions in similar situations with similar patients in order to select the action most likelyto reduce non-medical opioid use for each participant during each call. The RCT will be complemented by qualitative interviews to inform later implementation. The specific aims are to: (1) Adapt and enhance an existing motivational intervention to decrease non-medical opioid use after an ED visit by optimizing intervention intensity and duration through RL; (2) Examine the impact of the intervention on non-medical opioid use level during the six months post-ED visit; (3) Examine the impact of the intervention on driving after opioid use, overdose risk behaviors, and subsequent opioid-related ED visits. Secondary Aims are: (1) to examine differences in intervention effects between participants with high and low baseline levels of non-medical opioid use; and (2) to understand barriers and facilitators of implementation. This project will use a highly innovative strategy, artificial intelligence, to address a highly significant problem, non-medical opioid use. Ultimately, this study can lead to reductions in opioid- related harms and move forward the field of mobile health. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Non-medical use of opioid pain medications has increased substantially over the last decade, and ensuring the safe use of opioids prescribed as part of medical care has become a critical public health priority. Emergency Departments (EDs) are on the front lines of this emerging public health problem. This randomized controlled trial will test the impact of a mobile health intervention, which incorporates an innovative artificial intelligenc component to determine intervention duration and intensity, on non-medical opioid use and related harms for adult ED patients treated with opioids and who have a history of non-medical opioid use.",Reducing Non-Medical Opioid Use: An automatically adaptive mHealth Intervention,9266749,R01DA039159,"['Abnormal coordination', 'Accident and Emergency department', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Automobile Driving', 'Behavior', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Complement', 'Emergency Care', 'Emergency Department patient', 'Emergency department visit', 'Ensure', 'Future', 'Guidelines', 'Health Technology', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Medical', 'Methodology', 'Monitor', 'Opioid', 'Opioid Analgesics', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Overdose', 'Pain', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Phonation', 'Play', 'Process', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Psychotherapy', 'Public Health', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Resources', 'Risk Behaviors', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Severities', 'Site', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Voice', 'Work', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'behavioral outcome', 'brief motivational intervention', 'clinical practice', 'drugged driving', 'experience', 'high risk', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'innovation', 'intervention effect', 'learning progression', 'mHealth', 'mobile computing', 'motivational intervention', 'multidisciplinary', 'new technology', 'opioid use', 'post intervention', 'prescription opioid', 'public health priorities', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'screening', 'skills', 'success', 'treatment as usual']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2017,600547,-0.009160542172244797
"Devaluing Energy-Dense Foods for Cancer Control: Translational Neuroscience 7. Abstract Obesity and intake of certain foods increases cancer risk, but the most common treatment (behavioral weight loss programs) rarely produces lasting weight loss and eating behavior change, apparently because caloric restriction increases the reward value of food and prompts energy-sparing adaptations. Interventions that reduce the implicit valuation of cancer-risk foods (e.g., red meats, refined sugar) may be more effective. Emerging data suggest that behavioral response training and cognitive reappraisal training reduce valuation of such foods, which leads to decrease intake of these foods and weight loss. Internalized incentive value is reflected in a ventromedial prefrontal/orbitofrontal cortex valuation system (“vmPFC”), which encodes the implicit reward value of food and is central to a reinforcement cycle that perpetuates unhealthy eating. Thus, the vmPFC valuation system is a promising target for intervention because changes to the system might disrupt the unhealthy reinforcement cycle. Interestingly, various interventions influence the vmPFC through distinct pathways. Behavioral training alters motor input to valuation regions, whereas cognitive training relies on lateral prefrontal “top-down” regions. The proposed translational neuroscience experiment will compare the efficacy with which two novel treatments cause lasting change in food valuation, and whether a composite of theory-based baseline individual differences in relevant processes (such as response tendencies and cognitive styles) moderate treatment effects. We will randomize 300 overweight/obese adults who are at risk for eating- and obesity-related cancers to behavioral response training toward healthy foods and away from cancer-risk foods, a cognitive reappraisal intervention focused on cancer-risk foods, or non–food inhibitory control training. Aim 1 compares the efficacy and mechanisms of action of these two interventions to reduce valuation of cancer-risk foods relative to the active control condition, using neural, behavioral, self-report, and physiological measures of the process and outcomes. Aim 2 is to establish the temporal pattern and durability of the effects across time ; food intake and habits , body fat, BMI, and waist-to-hip ratio will be measured pre, post, and at 3-, 6-, and 12-month follow-up. Aim 3 uses machine learning to build and validate a low-cost, easy-to-administer composite that predicts whether and for how long an individual is likely to respond to intervention, and to which treatment. We hypothesize that self-report measures specifically related to valuation (e.g., willingness-to-pay) and to intervention-specific pathways to valuation (e.g., behavioral response tendencies, cognitive style) will predict differential response. Discovering these individual differences will provide a practical, low-cost tool to help interventionists “match” a given person to an effective treatment for that person . This project is very innovative because no study has directly compared the distinct and common effects of these treatments on valuation, used brain imaging to study the mechanism of effects, tested whether these interventions produce a lasting change in food valuation and body fat, or built and validated a composite that moderates response . 8. Project Narrative Excessive eating of energy-dense and obesity are risk factors for a range of cancers. There are programs to reduce intake of these foods and weight loss, but the effects of the programs rarely last. This project tests whether altering the value of cancer-risk foods can create lasting change, and uses neuroimaging to compare the efficacy of two programs to engage the valuation system on a neural level. Results will establish the pathways through which the programs work and suggest specific treatments for individuals based on a personalized profile.",Devaluing Energy-Dense Foods for Cancer Control: Translational Neuroscience,9341673,R01CA211224,"['Adopted', 'Adult', 'Behavioral', 'Body Weight decreased', 'Body fat', 'Body mass index', 'Brain imaging', 'Caloric Restriction', 'Calories', 'Cancer Control', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive Therapy', 'Data', 'Dietary intake', 'Eating', 'Eating Behavior', 'Food', 'Food Habits', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Health Food', 'High-Risk Cancer', 'Incentives', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Informal Social Control', 'Intake', 'Intervention', 'Lateral', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Meat', 'Mediating', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Neurobiology', 'Obesity', 'Obesity associated cancer', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Overweight', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Physiological', 'Process', 'Process Measure', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Randomized', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Route', 'Stimulus', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Waist-Hip Ratio', 'Work', 'active control', 'arm', 'base', 'behavior change', 'behavioral economics', 'behavioral response', 'cancer risk', 'cognitive reappraisal', 'cognitive training', 'common treatment', 'comparative efficacy', 'cost', 'cost efficient', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'experimental study', 'follow-up', 'food consumption', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'intervention effect', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'obesity risk', 'personalized medicine', 'programs', 'reduced food intake', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sugar', 'theories', 'tool', 'translational neuroscience', 'treatment effect', 'willingness to pay']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF OREGON,R01,2017,589358,0.005006145873287825
"Enabling value-based healthcare through automating risk assessment for episode-based care Project Summary Value-based healthcare implementation relies on understanding risk. 1 Early models, such as Medicare Advantage, use annual measures of risk under a risk adjustment factor (RAF) to offer financial incentive to payers and hospitals to work together. 2 More advanced models, such as bundled payments, target the periods of greatest quality variability, specifically episodes of care such as joint replacement, oncology diagnosis, and cardiac procedures. In these episodes, many types of providers, from hospitals to outpatient physical therapists, need to work together to reduce rates of complication and readmission. Risk levels are used to adjust payment for payer and providers and to determine which patients require additional resources in the hospital, clinic, or home. Unfortunately, existing risk models lack key features needed for episode-based care, which requires both financial alignment and accurate and immediate information to adjust clinical resources for a given case. 3 4 A better model would include all conditions relevant to an episode rather than just chronic conditions, addition of social determinants, and an automated approach to retrieve the information in hours rather than months. Thus, this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I program includes the following Specific Aims: 1. Create the phenotyping components required to define an accurate and comprehensive model  of episode-based risk, including: (i) extract clinical and social features from clinical data using  natural language processing (NLP), (ii) map concepts including social features to an ontology  that will support normalized data use, (iii) build a feature vector for each record that can be  used to feed a risk model that accounts for relevant clinical and social risk 2. Validate the phenotyping components using de-identified longitudinal clinical data for 10,000 patients In this research program, Phase I will tackle the most difficult challenges, including leveraging narrative text to recognize time-labeled social and clinical features influencing an episode of care. Success criteria will be accurate recognition of key underlying features that have not been available in risk models to date. Phase II will build upon the validated technology to create an episode-based risk model run on narrative and discrete clinical data and tested against actual patient outcomes. Success criteria will be a validated episode-based risk model to support value-based contracting and value-based clinical care. Project Narrative Advanced payment models in United States healthcare rely on accurate assessment of risk and quality. While quality has gained broad attention, risk models remain outdated and poorly suited to advanced payment models. CapsicoHealth proposes an effort to redefine risk models used for episode-based payments, using data sets across the continuum of care and clinical and social determinants of care that have previously been unavailable in computable form. If successful, this effort will impact financial and clinical approaches to value-based healthcare and significantly increase the chance that national efforts to improve cost and quality will be effective.",Enabling value-based healthcare through automating risk assessment for episode-based care,9464424,R43LM012798,"['Attention', 'Cardiac', 'Caring', 'Chronic', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Complication', 'Continuity of Patient Care', 'Contracts', 'Cost Control', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Quality', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Health Care Reform', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Home environment', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Insurance', 'Label', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medicare', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Ontology', 'Outpatients', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Procedures', 'Provider', 'Replacement Arthroplasty', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Adjustment', 'Risk Assessment', 'Running', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'United States', 'Work', 'base', 'care episode', 'clinical care', 'clinically relevant', 'concept mapping', 'cost', 'feeding', 'financial incentive', 'improved', 'interest', 'oncology', 'payment', 'physical therapist', 'programs', 'social', 'success', 'vector']",NLM,"CAPSICOHEALTH, INC.",R43,2017,222588,-0.0015319835269006208
"Preventable Hospitalization in Dementia: The Impact of Neuropsychiatric Symptoms DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Older adults with dementia are at increased risk of hospitalization when compared to adults without dementia of similar age and medical comorbidity. The increased risk of hospitalization extends to potentially preventable hospitalization (PPH) for conditions such as a urinary tract infection or asthma exacerbation, suggesting difficulty in outpatient management of patients with dementia. Neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) of dementia such as agitation or delusions likely account for a significant amount of this risk, given their prevalence and potential to cause caregiver distress. While there are effective interventions for patients and caregivers to reduce NPS, the profile of patients that could benefit the most from intervention, therefore reducing their hospitalization risk, is unknown. Through the coordinated program of mentorship, didactics, and research that I propose, I will develop the advanced skills to derive and apply administrative, claims, and clinical encounter data to prospectively identify those patients with dementia at highest risk for hospitalization. Development of this patient-level risk phenotype means that future interventions to reduce hospitalization can then be prospectively matched to the patients most likely to benefit, a development of critical public health importance given both financial and geriatric work force constraints.  Over the next four years, my short-term training goals include: (1) address gaps in my formal research training, specifically: (a) to conduct observational analyses using large-scale claims and administrative data; (b) to derive clinical data from the electronic health record using natural language processing; and (c) to apply advanced methods of data analysis for risk prediction; (2) train in presentations, manuscript writing, and grantsmanship that culminate with a R01 proposal; (3) establish further connections with potential collaborators in the University of Michigan (UM) Pepper Center and broader community of aging researchers, national geriatrics and geriatric psychiatry communities, and the Beeson Scholar community; and (4) engage in leadership development with an emphasis on skills to lead a research team, mentor junior investigators, and communicate findings in research and clinical care settings.  These short-term goals will be paired with research aims that focus on elaborating the PPH risk profile for patients with dementia. Such research objectives can only be achieved when: (1) full clinical characteristics are available for the at-risk (i.e., non-hospitalized) population, includig (2) NPS data, which are rarely captured in standard administrative claims data. These criteria are uniquely met in the Veterans Affairs healthcare system, which has one of the nation's most advanced electronic health records (EHR). Using a national dementia case repository (N=269,565) from which I will draw matched cases (patients with dementia + PPH) and controls (non-hospitalized patients with dementia). Aim 1 will use claims and administrative data to explore patient, treatment, and facility risk factors associated with PPH. Aim 2 will use natural language processing to derive NPS from EHR clinical encounter notes and then characterize the association of NPS with PPH. Using the risk phenotype described in Aims 1 and 2, Aim 3 will develop logistic risk-prediction models to prospectively identify patients with dementia at highest risk for PPH. In subsequent grant proposals I will validate this risk- prediction model in other healthcare systems and prospectively pair the assessment tool with an evidence- based dementia intervention to reduce hospitalization.  My long-term career goals are to: (1) establish myself as independent investigator and national leader in geriatric mental health services research; (2) develop a programmatic line of funded health services research that develops risk-stratification models for late-life mental health and cognitive disorders; (3) translate knowledge from these research endeavors to improve the targeting and impact of future interventions research and health system delivery strategies; and (4) contribute broadly to the care of older adults by training and mentoring future clinical researchers in late-life mental health disorders. I am an Assistant Professor and geriatric psychiatrist at the University of Michigan, where I am also currently completing a MSc in Health and Healthcare Research, which provides an excellent background in health services research for clinicians. With this combination of clinical expertise and foundational training in health services research, I am uniquely qualified to undertake the advanced training activities outlined in this proposal, while UM affords the ideal environment in which to pursue this work. My primary mentor (Helen Kales, MD) and co-mentor (Frederic Blow, PhD) are national leaders in geriatric mental health who have used observational data to answer questions of national significance. My Advisory Panel includes Constantine Lyketsos, MD, MHS, an internationally-recognized expert in NPS and dementia care, and Kenneth Langa, MD, PhD, an internist, former Beeson Scholar, and renowned expert in using survey and secondary data to inform our understanding of dementia. Consultants include David Hanauer, MD, MS, an expert in bioinformatics and natural language processing, and Rodney Hayward, MD, a leader in risk assessment and intervention- targeting. My advisory team paired with resources of Michigan's Pepper Center, CTSA, and multi-disciplinary Institute for Healthcare Policy and Innovation make this the ideal environment in which to complete the proposed training activities. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Although hospitalization can negatively impact patients with dementia, we know very little about the specific risk factors associated with the chance of being hospitalized. It is important to understand what contributes to this risk, such as the behavior changes that accompany dementia, in order to identify those patients and caregivers that could benefit most from an intervention to avoid or reduce hospitalization. Given the rapidly rising numbers of patients with dementia, reducing potentially preventable hospitalization could have an enormous impact on public health.",Preventable Hospitalization in Dementia: The Impact of Neuropsychiatric Symptoms,9291398,K08AG048321,"['Address', 'Admission activity', 'Adult', 'Advisory Committees', 'Age', 'Aggressive behavior', 'Aging', 'Agitation', 'Antipsychotic Agents', 'Applications Grants', 'Assessment tool', 'Asthma', 'Attention', 'Benzodiazepines', 'Bioinformatics', 'Capsicum', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Code', 'Cognition Disorders', 'Communities', 'Community Psychiatry', 'Comorbidity', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Delusions', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Distress', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Elderly', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emergency Care', 'Environment', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Geriatric Psychiatry', 'Geriatrics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Care Research', 'Health Policy', 'Health Services Research', 'Health system', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hospitalization', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Institutionalization', 'International', 'Internist', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Intervention Trial', 'Kale - dietary', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Light', 'Literature', 'Location', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Logistics', 'Manuscripts', 'Medical', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outpatients', 'Patient Care', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Primary Health Care', 'Provider', 'Psychiatrist', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk stratification', 'Rural', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sleeplessness', 'Source', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Translating', 'Universities', 'Urinary tract infection', 'Validation', 'Veterans', 'Visit', 'Work', 'Writing', 'behavior change', 'career', 'case control', 'clinical care', 'cost', 'dementia care', 'design', 'effective intervention', 'evidence base', 'geriatric mental health', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'leadership development', 'medication compliance', 'multidisciplinary', 'neuropsychiatric symptom', 'patient population', 'predictive modeling', 'professor', 'profiles in patients', 'programs', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'repository', 'skills', 'statistics', 'tool']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,K08,2017,175103,-0.014382103376942358
"An Evaluation of Novel Domains for Predicting 30-Day Readmission DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services has proposed to financially penalize hospitals that have 30-day readmission rates above the national mean. As a result hospitals caring for disadvantaged populations with more needs might be penalized by current 30-day readmission models that do not include measures of social risk and functional status of the patients served. These are two important variable domains that directly impact a patient's ability to manage their disease. Social risk factors (e.g. living alone, social support, marginal housing, and alcohol abuse) and functional status (e.g. mobility, fall risk) are rarely present in administrative data, which is why so few readmission models include this data. Yet many of these variables are available in electronic health records (EHR) and the advancement of the field of informatics has made the extraction of these data feasible. These variables may improve the discriminative ability of 30-day readmission models which currently explain little of the variation in readmission rates among patients.  We propose to improve 30-day readmission models by extracting measures of social risk and functional status from the EHR using the novel method of Natural Language Processing (NLP). We will combine administrative data (VA and Medicare) and data extracted from the national EHR in the VA for 6000 patients 65 and older in 2011 to improve upon currently available 30-day hospital readmission risk prediction models for congestive heart failure (CHF), acute myocardial infarction (AMI), pneumonia and stroke. We have chosen these conditions because hospital-level 30-day readmission rates for these conditions (CHF, AMI and pneumonia) are currently or will soon be (stroke) publicly reported. Our proposal has two goals: 1) to develop, test and evaluate automated NLP algorithms designed to extract measures of social risk and functional status from the EHR and 2) to understand the impact of these two novel domains on 30-day readmission across four conditions with fundamentally different post-discharge hospital course and disease trajectories.  We propose a paradigm shift in the understanding and obtainment of factors predictive of 30-day readmission. Our overarching hypothesis is that social risk factors and functional status which directly influence a patient's self-management ability are critical factors predictive of 30-day readmission, can be extracted from the EHR, and should be included in risk prediction models. The development of better risk prediction models will allow the identification of patients at highest risk of readmission and facilitate post-discharge interventions in their care. In addition, if social risk factors and functional status are criticalin explaining variation in 30-day readmission rates, then hospitals that care for patients with a higher burden of social risk and functional needs may be inappropriately penalized by current risk predictions models that lack these measures. Also, as more hospitals adopt EHRs, we need to study more advanced technologies such as automated NLP as tools to efficiently extract information and to inform health systems about the characteristics of the patients they serve. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: About a fifth of all Medicare patients are readmitted within 30 days of hospital discharge, potentially exposing the patients and their families to distress and unnecessary costs. An improved understanding of who is at highest risk of readmission will allow hospitals to efficiently intervene in the care of patients who may benefit the most from post-discharge interventions.",An Evaluation of Novel Domains for Predicting 30-Day Readmission,9288224,R01HL116522,"['Acute myocardial infarction', 'Adopted', 'Affect', 'Affordable Care Act', 'Alcohol abuse', 'Algorithm Design', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical Data', 'Congestive Heart Failure', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Distress', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Evaluation', 'Family', 'Goals', 'Health Status', 'Health system', 'Hospitals', 'Housing', 'Human', 'Incentives', 'Informatics', 'Intervention', 'Length of Stay', 'Measures', 'Medicare', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Patient Care', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pneumonia', 'Population', 'Predictive Factor', 'Publishing', 'Reporting', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Self Management', 'Severity of illness', 'Social support', 'Stroke', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'United States Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services', 'Variant', 'Veterans', 'cost', 'demographics', 'design', 'disadvantaged population', 'fall risk', 'functional status', 'health administration', 'high risk', 'high risk behavior', 'hospital patient care', 'hospital readmission', 'improved', 'marginally housed', 'mortality', 'novel', 'payment', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'social', 'tool']",NHLBI,NORTHERN CALIFORNIA INSTITUTE/RES/EDU,R01,2017,585633,0.005947095173688992
"Geometric Surrogates for Clinical Management of Abdominal Aortic Aneurysms ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal will investigate the following hypothesis: that the quantification of geometric surrogates, which predict the ensuing peak wall rupture risk index (PWRRI), will provide an improved estimate of aneurysm rupture risk compared to the clinical standard of maximum aneurysm diameter. We thus propose the highly innovative use of both radiological and non-radiological clinical imaging to develop a computational tool that can assess AAA risk of rupture with greater accuracy than the current clinical standard. Such a tool will allow the accurate quantification of individual AAA geometry to achieve the main goal of the study, which is to identify the patient-specific AAA geometry characteristics that are surrogates for patient-specific PWRRI. In the proposed approach, we will first compute a truly individualized PWRRI based on an innovative method called image-based Vascular Mechanical Characterization technology (iV-MeCh). The geometry characteristics highly correlated with PWRRI will be considered the surrogates of this biomechanics-based index. A second phase of the study will be the validation of the surrogates with actual clinical outcomes, which will yield the accurate predictors of rupture. This approach, devoid of complex finite element modeling and based on a fast, nearly automated computational tool for geometry quantification, would provide an exceptional rationale for the need for surgical intervention and be of major clinical significance. Therefore, the following specific aims are to be completed during the project period to address the aforementioned hypothesis: (1) Validate iV-MeCh for estimating patient-specific spatio-temporal AAA wall stress; (2) Calculate individual PWRRI using iV-MeCh for high and low risk of rupture AAA; (3) Identify the individual geometry characteristics that are surrogates of PWRRI; and (4) Assess the clinical significance of geometric surrogates for the prediction of AAA rupture risk. The primary outcome of this research will be the ability to disambiguate or demystify rupture risk in AAA for which the standard of care (maximum diameter) is not an accurate metric for assessing their at-risk condition. The geometric surrogates of PWRRI are hypothesized to reduce false positives and false negatives compared to the conventional maximum diameter cut-off for recommending elective repair. In addition, PWRRI is predicted by means of a new, novel technique (iV-MeCh), which estimates wall stress in aneurysms by means of non-radiological clinical imaging and without the use of constitutive soft tissue mechanics. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This award will enable the validation of computational tools for non-invasively predicting the at-risk condition of patients with abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) based on the assessment of aneurysm geometry.

"Multi-Parametric Spatial Assessment of Bone with HR-pQCT ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Osteoporosis is a skeletal disorder characterized by compromised bone strength predisposing a person to an increased risk of fracture. In the U.S. today, 10 million individuals are estimated to already have the disease and almost 34 million more are estimated to have low bone density, placing them at increased risk for osteoporosis and broken bones. Currently, determination of fracture risk, aging effects, and therapeutic efficacy is primarily based on bone mineral density (BMD) measured by areal or volumetric X-ray-based imaging techniques. BMD can predict bone strength and fracture risk to some extent, however, studies have shown that BMD only explains about 70%-75% of the variance in strength, while the remaining variance has been attributed to the cumulative and synergistic effect of other factors such as bone structure, topology, geometry, tissue composition, microdamage, and biomechanical factors. High-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography (HR-pQCT) is a noninvasive in-vivo imaging technique which depicts many of these features, including density, geometry, structure, topology, and mechanics of cortical and trabecular bone in the distal radius and distal tibia. To date HR-pQCT imagery has been analyzed using conventional quantitative approaches that average bone features over large regions of interest. The individual quantification of average bone features (uni-parametric) or their statistical combination (multi-parametric) disregard how these three-dimensional (3D) features synergistically contribute to bone strength. As a result the traditional methods fail to capture the spatial patterning of the effect being studied, which is key to understanding the underlying biology. Bone is a 3D organ experiencing constant adaptation through remodeling, and should therefore be analyzed with 3D techniques that reflect the complementary and interdependent nature of different bone features. Statistical parametric mapping (SPM) is a technique that enables 3D spatial comparisons of multi-parametric maps between groups of subjects. Instead of measuring summary properties for arbitrary or subjective volumes of interest, this data-driven process identifies regions significantly associated with a variable of interest through valid statistical tests, thus generating 3D statistical and P-value maps that facilitate the visualization and consequently the interpretation of comparisons between target populations. The ultimate goal of this proposal is to establish a framework to automatically identify relevant bone sub-regions and features in specific populations for the targeted quantitative assessment of the spatial distribution and prediction of bone strength using HR-pQCT. For this purpose, specialized SPM techniques have been developed for HR-pQCT. To evaluate the potential of SPM in clinical science, we propose to apply SPM to image data from three existing in-vivo HR-pQCT studies investigating: a) regional variations in bone structure related to gender and age; b) differences due to fracture of the forearm; and c) longitudinal effects of two osteoporosis treatments.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  We propose a population-based framework to automatically identify relevant bone sub-regions and features in specific populations for the targeted quantitative assessment of the spatial distribution and prediction of bone strength using HR-pQCT. To demonstrate the potential of this framework in clinical science, we apply it to existing HR-pQCT studies to identify bone sub-regions and features significantly associated with age, gender, fracture status and response to osteoporosis treatment in post menopausal women; identify spatial associations between the central and distal skeleton with respect to treatment response; and improve fracture discrimination, and the prediction and understanding of the effects of osteoporosis treatment. This framework could improve the development of innovative, more active and safer drugs and therapies, and directly benefit patients suffering osteoporosis and other bone disorders since based on HR-pQCT maps of parameters estimating bone density and quality, a treatment offering the most clinical benefits to them could be prescribed.            ",Multi-Parametric Spatial Assessment of Bone with HR-pQCT,9274155,R01AR068456,"['Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Biology', 'Biomechanics', 'Bone Density', 'Bone Diseases', 'Bone structure', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Distal', 'Elderly', 'Etiology', 'Exercise', 'Forearm Fracture', 'Fracture', 'Gender', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Hip region structure', 'Hormonal', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Information Distribution', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Nature', 'Organ', 'Osteoporosis', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Peripheral', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Population', 'Postmenopause', 'Process', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Radial', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Role', 'Skeleton', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Target Populations', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Variant', 'Vertebral column', 'Woman', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'age effect', 'base', 'bone', 'bone quality', 'bone strength', 'cortical bone', 'cost', 'density', 'experience', 'fracture risk', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'in vivo imaging', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'population based', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'screening', 'skeletal', 'skeletal disorder', 'spatial relationship', 'substantia spongiosa', 'tibia', 'tool', 'treatment response']",NIAMS,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,R01,2017,269514,0.0016970178473665917

The proposal's research will be conducted at Mayo Clinic, which has a strong history of training physician scientists and a well-developed infrastructure for education and research. Dr. McCoy has access to an ideal set of data assets, the OptumLabs Data Warehouse and the Kaiser Permanente Northern California Diabetes Registry, and the support of an exceptional team of mentors and advisors who are national leaders in diabetes outcomes and health care delivery research, shared decision-making, qualitative research, and data science. Optimization of glycemic control, while avoiding severe hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia, is the cornerstone of diabetes management. Severe hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia are often preventable, yet continue to incur substantial morbidity, psychological distress, impaired quality of life, and economic burden. There are no validated tools to predict these events and as a result clinicians lack a practical and reliable means to identify high risk patients. The goal of Dr. McCoy's work is to address this critical gap in diabetes management. In Aim 1, she will use large database analysis and novel analytic methods to characterize the patterns of severe hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia among adults with diabetes in the U.S. In Aim 2, she will build on Aim 1 to develop and validate computationally efficient concurrent risk prediction models for severe hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia that could be used in clinical encounters. In Aim 3, she will directly engage patients and their clinicians in conversation about severe hypoglycemia /hyperglycemia risk in order to better understand how information about severe hypoglycemia/ hyperglycemia risk is perceived, interpreted, and used. These studies will serve as foundation for two R01 applications to be submitted during Years 4 and 5, and will advance the science and practice of personalized diabetes care through integration of data science and qualitative methods for the purpose of understanding, predicting, and ultimately preventing severe hypoglycemic/hyperglycemic events. Dr. McCoy has a proven track record of scientific productivity and innovation, and a strong foundation in using secondary data for health services and outcomes research in diabetes. In summary, the training, mentoring, and research proposed here are essential for Dr. McCoy's career development as she develops research independence and expertise in the crucial interface between patients and their clinical teams, evidence-based medicine, and big data. PROJECT NARRATIVE Severe hypoglycemic and hyperglycemic events in the management of diabetes mellitus continue to incur high morbidity, psychological distress, and economic costs; yet, these events may be prevented with individualization of treatment goals and regimens if high risk patients are identified prospectively. The proposed research will leverage big data analytics and qualitative research to 1) characterize the epidemiology of severe hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia in the U.S.; 2) develop and validate concurrent risk prediction models for severe hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia; and 3) enrich the understanding of severe hypoglycemia/ hyperglycemia risk and risk model utilization through qualitative patient and clinician engagement.",Predicting the Risk of Severe Hypoglycemic and Hyperglycemic Events in Adults with Diabetes,9369218,K23DK114497,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Big Data', 'Calibration', 'California', 'Caring', 'Chronic', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Communication', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Discrimination', 'Economic Burden', 'Endocrinologist', 'Epidemiology', 'Event', 'Evidence Based Medicine', 'Face', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Services Research', 'Healthcare', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hospitalization', 'Hyperglycemia', 'Hypoglycemia', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Interview', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Patient Care', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physicians', 'Primary Care Physician', 'Productivity', 'Qualitative Methods', 'Qualitative Research', 'Quality of life', 'Recording of previous events', 'Regimen', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Proposals', 'Research Training', 'Risk', 'Risk Estimate', 'Risk Factors', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Self Care', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Protocols', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical care', 'data integration', 'data registry', 'diabetes management', 'disease phenotype', 'economic cost', 'education research', 'experience', 'glycemic control', 'health care delivery', 'health data', 'high risk', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'individualized medicine', 'innovation', 'insight', 'member', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'patient oriented', 'point of care', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'psychologic', 'psychological distress', 'shared decision making', 'skills', 'social', 'statistics', 'support tools', 'tool']",NIDDK,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,K23,2017,170466,-0.007077362319150515
"Metabolomics and risk of Parkinson's Disease ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Parkinson disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease in the United States and affects over one million Americans; this number is growing due to population aging. Current treatments do not prevent the disease progression that ultimately results in severe disability. There is thus a compelling need to develop neuroprotective treatments. Because at the time of the clinical diagnosis of PD there is already substantial neuronal loss, such treatments should ideally be initiated earlier. Aims of the proposed investigation are to implement and validate a novel metabolomic approach for the identification of early changes in peripheral blood of individuals with preclinical or premotor PD. The metabolomic results will be integrated with detailed and validated information on risk factors for PD, which has been collected prospectively and periodically updated. We expect by this means to identify new clues to the etiology of PD and to identify a metabolomic signature of PD that could contribute to an early diagnosis. To achieve these goals, we will take advantage of data and blood samples collected from over 80,000 participants in three large ongoing cohorts, the Nurses' Health Study (NHS), the Health Professional Follow-up Study (HPFS), and the Cancer Prevention Study-II Nutrition, who have been followed for over 25 years for incident Parkinson disease. We expect to include a total of 805 incident cases of PD that will be matched to 805 controls, using a nested case-control design. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Parkinson disease is a chronic progressive disease for which there is no cure - the loss of brain cells that leads to disability develops insidiously over many years, and by the time the disease is diagnosed it is already extensive and irreversible. To identify Parkinson disease years before it becomes clinically manifest, we are proposing a novel approach that will take advantage of the peripheral blood and detailed lifestyle and medical information collected from over 80,000 individuals who were followed for up to 25 years. By comparing the blood levels of hundreds of compounds between the blood of individuals who developed Parkinson disease and the blood of individuals of the same age and sex who remained healthy, we expect to make novel discoveries on the etiology of Parkinson disease and to be able to develop a method for the early identification of Parkinson disease in other populations.",Metabolomics and risk of Parkinson's Disease,9313961,R01NS089619,"['Affect', 'Age', 'Alanine', 'American', 'Archives', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood specimen', 'Branched-Chain Amino Acids', 'Caffeine', 'Cancer Prevention Study II', 'Choline', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Coffee', 'Cohort Studies', 'Confounding Factors (Epidemiology)', 'Consumption', 'Controlled Study', 'Creatine', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diet', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Failure', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Glutamates', 'Goals', 'Health Professional', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Insulin Resistance', 'Investigation', 'Life Style', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Medical History', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Pathway', 'Methods', 'Motor', 'National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke', 'Nature', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Nurses&apos', ' Health Study', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Physical activity', 'Plasma', 'Population', 'Progressive Disease', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Smoking', 'Specificity', 'Techniques', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Update', 'Urate', 'Validation', 'Women&apos', 's Health Nursing', 'Work', 'acylcarnitine', 'aging population', 'base', 'brain cell', 'cancer prevention', 'case control', 'cigarette smoking', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'cohort', 'design', 'diabetes risk', 'disability', 'disorder risk', 'follow-up', 'gender difference', 'insight', 'interest', 'men', 'metabolic profile', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'mitochondrial dysfunction', 'motor symptom', 'neuron loss', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'nutrition', 'peripheral blood', 'pre-clinical', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'sex', 'specific biomarkers', 'tool']",NINDS,HARVARD SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH,R01,2017,563079,0.004862548472770854
"Opioid Use and Safety in US Nursing Homes PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT  Nationwide use of prescription opioids quadrupled to more than 240 million prescriptions per year between 1999 to 2010. This increase has been accompanied by an alarming rise in opioid misuse and abuse, addiction, and fatal and nonfatal overdoses. In response to this growing national epidemic, the Department of Health and Human Services has called for the creation of clear opioid prescribing guidelines and further developing the evidence base to guide opioid prescribing for the management of pain. To date, guidelines have largely focused on opioid use in younger adults despite the unique issues facing older adults (≥65 years old) including a large burden of pain, extensive analgesics use, and recent increase in drug overdose-related deaths in the elderly population. Prior guidelines have provided no direction regarding appropriate opioid use to treat pain in nursing home residents. This is problematic due to the high prevalence of chronic pain in nursing home residents as well as age-related vulnerability to adverse drug events due to changes in pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics and higher prevalence of multiple comorbidities and polypharmacy in this population as compared to noninstitutionalized older adults.  Using an in-house national repository of Minimum Data Set 3.0 – a federally required clinical assessment of all residents in Medicare or Medicaid certified nursing homes – merged to Medicare Part A and D and facility-level characteristics in CASPER (Certification and Survey Provider and Enhanced Reporting) from 2011-2013, this proposal addresses the evidence gap in safe opioid use in US nursing home residents with three specific aims: 1) to identify sociodemographic, clinical, and facility-level correlates of opioid use in terms of duration of use (acute vs. chronic), duration of action (short- vs. long-acting), and dose in “morphine equivalents”; 2) to estimate the incidence of opioid-related drug overdoses and identify resident- and drug regimen-related risk factors for opioid overdose; and 3) to evaluate the comparative safety of specific commonly-initiated opioids in terms of serious adverse health outcomes (all-cause mortality, hospitalization for cardiovascular disease, fractures, and bowel obstruction). Methodological innovations include the use of multilevel modeling and targeted maximum likelihood estimation approaches. This proposal is directly relevant to the approximately 1.4 million older adults living in US nursing homes on any given day – many of whom will receive opioids while institutionalized. The knowledge generated will inform stakeholders on how opioids are used in this population, the risk of overdose when using opioids, and the comparative safety of short- and long- term use of commonly initiated opioids in the nursing home setting. PROJECT NARRATIVE Approximately 1.4 million US adults live in nursing homes on any given day; many experience acute and chronic pain often treated with opioid analgesics despite the potential risks associated with these medications. This study will describe the resident and facility risk factors associated with receiving opioids, risk factors for opioid overdose, and the comparative safety of commonly-initiated opioids. The results will inform stakeholders on the use and safety of opioids in nursing homes.",Opioid Use and Safety in US Nursing Homes,9328950,F31AG056078,"['Acetaminophen', 'Activities of Daily Living', 'Acute', 'Acute Pain', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Adverse drug event', 'Aggressive behavior', 'Analgesics', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents', 'Anti-inflammatory', 'Anxiety', 'Big Data', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Certification', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical assessments', 'Communities', 'Comorbidity', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dependence', 'Distress', 'Dose', 'Drug Kinetics', 'Drug effect disorder', 'Effectiveness', 'Elderly', 'Epidemic', 'Evaluation', 'Fracture', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'High Prevalence', 'Hospitalization', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Intestinal Obstruction', 'Kidney Failure', 'Knowledge', 'Left', 'Length', 'Machine Learning', 'Medicaid', 'Medical', 'Medicare', 'Medicare Part A', 'Medication Management', 'Mental Depression', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Morphine', 'Non-Malignant', 'Nursing Homes', 'Nursing Research', 'Opioid', 'Opioid Analgesics', 'Outcome', 'Overdose', 'Pain', 'Pain management', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacodynamics', 'Pharmacology', 'Polypharmacy', 'Population', 'Property', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Regimen', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Residual state', 'Risk', 'Risk Estimate', 'Risk Factors', 'Safety', 'Sedation procedure', 'Statistical Methods', 'Supervision', 'Surveys', 'Therapeutic', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'United States', 'United States Dept. of Health and Human Services', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'addiction', 'adverse outcome', 'age related', 'base', 'beneficiary', 'chronic pain', 'comparative', 'dosage', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'human old age (65+)', 'improved', 'innovation', 'mortality', 'multilevel analysis', 'neglect', 'opioid abuse', 'opioid misuse', 'opioid use', 'prescription opioid', 'repository', 'response', 'safety study', 'young adult']",NIA,UNIV OF MASSACHUSETTS MED SCH WORCESTER,F31,2017,23642,-0.06896473763506375
"Biological Mechanisms of Mindfulness Training for Health PROJECT SUMMARY Nearly 10% of Americans practice meditation to improve health. Randomized controlled trials support this practice and show that mindfulness training is effective in improving a broad range of health outcomes. In particular, mindfulness training has been shown to reduce biomarkers of systemic inflammation that contribute to the pathophysiology of disease and predict risk for all-cause mortality. Still, little is known about the biological processes linking mindfulness training with inflammation. This proposal tests the hypothesis that mindfulness training aids the regulation of inflammation by mitigating glucocorticoid resistance (GCR). GCR is a leading candidate mechanism linking psychosocial threat with systemic inflammation. Whereas cortisol released in response to threat normally binds to glucocorticoid receptors and down-regulates inflammation, chronic perceptions of threat lead to a state of GCR, in which glucocorticoid receptors become insensitive to the anti-inflammatory effects of circulating cortisol. Mindfulness training is proposed to diminish perceptions of threat in ways that restore glucocorticoid receptor sensitivity. To test this biological pathway, this study assesses functional GCR and biomarkers of inflammation before and after a Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) or control Health Enhancement Program (HEP) in a sample of lonely older adults (N=188). Loneliness is a form of chronic psychosocial threat, and is consistently associated with GCR and systemic inflammation, yet MBSR is one of very few interventions successful in reducing loneliness. MBSR is expected to decrease GCR (and restore glucocorticoid receptor sensitivity) compared to HEP from pre- to post- intervention. Moreover, these decreases in GCR are expected to mediate the effects of MBSR (vs. HEP) on lowering systemic inflammation (CRP and IL-6) from pre-intervention to 3-month follow-up. In sum, this proposal investigates decreased GCR as a biological mechanism through which mindfulness training reduces inflammatory disease risk. It addresses NCCIH's call for research on understanding the biological mechanisms of action underlying mind-body intervention approaches and complements NCCIH's special interest in alleviating inflammatory processes. The knowledge gained from this research will contribute to a better understanding of the basic biological pathways underlying mindfulness practices, which may help to identify and target populations likely to benefit from mindfulness training. The research and training plan described in this application provide opportunities for the applicant to develop a knowledge base and methodology in psychoneuroimmunology, learn statistical techniques for analyzing complex mechanistic pathways, and develop the professional skills necessary for a successful career testing biological and psychological mechanisms underlying mind-body interventions. PROJECT NARRATIVE Mindfulness meditation practices are widely used to alleviate physical symptoms, and growing evidence suggests that mindfulness training may reduce systemic inflammation, but less is known about the biological pathways linking mindfulness training with inflammatory processes. The proposed project investigates a biological mechanism, glucocorticoid sensitivity, to explain how mindfulness training lowers inflammation among lonely older adults who are at risk for multiple inflammatory diseases. From a public health perspective, clarifying this mechanistic pathway will help to identify who is likely to show health benefits from mindfulness training.",Biological Mechanisms of Mindfulness Training for Health,9327105,F32AT009508,"['Address', 'Adult', 'American', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents', 'Anti-inflammatory', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Process', 'Biological Testing', 'Blood Circulation', 'Breast Cancer survivor', 'Cells', 'Chronic', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Dexamethasone', 'Disease', 'Distress', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Elderly', 'Feeling', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Glucocorticoid Receptor', 'Glucocorticoids', 'Health', 'Health Benefit', 'Hydrocortisone', 'Immune', 'Immunology procedure', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Interleukin-6', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Loneliness', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Meditation', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Methodology', 'Mind-Body Intervention', 'National Research Service Awards', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Perception', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Process', 'Psychoneuroimmunology', 'Public Health', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Receptor Gene', 'Receptor Signaling', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Regulation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Training', 'Resistance', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Standardization', 'Stress', 'Sum', 'Symptoms', 'Target Populations', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Work', 'career', 'cost', 'disorder risk', 'efficacy trial', 'epidemiology study', 'experience', 'falls', 'follow-up', 'health training', 'hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis', 'improved', 'inflammatory marker', 'interest', 'knowledge base', 'mindfulness', 'mindfulness intervention', 'mindfulness meditation', 'mindfulness-based stress reduction', 'mortality', 'physical conditioning', 'physical symptom', 'post intervention', 'programs', 'psychologic', 'psychosocial', 'receptor function', 'receptor sensitivity', 'response', 'skills', 'social', 'successful intervention', 'training aid', 'training opportunity']",NCCIH,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,F32,2017,60834,-0.022369377048745337
"Development of Mucosal and Systemic Immunity and Risk of Food Allergy The microbiome plays a critical role in the development of the immune system and alterations in the microbiome diversity almost certainly play an important role in the surge of allergic and autoimmune diseases in developed nations that began in the 1950's and continues today. Living on farms, avoiding antibiotics, vaginal delivery, and other environmental factors leading to greater diversity in the microbiome have been associated with a major reduction in the risk of atopic diseases. Understanding the development of the immune system in populations at low risk for allergy compared to high-risk populations, developing biomarkers for “protective” immune development, and assessing immune responses to the microbiome are fundamental for designing and assessing future interventions. In this proposal, we will compare the Old Order Mennonites (OOM) with a very low risk for food allergies (<1%), other allergic diseases and asthma and a lifestyle associated with a diverse microbiome (e.g. growing up on a farm, consumption of raw milk, large families, home deliveries, low rate of antibiotic use), and neonates born to families with food-allergic children with a very high risk for developing atopic diseases, e.g. a 15-20% risk of food allergy in the first year of life. We hypothesize that accelerated development of IgA mucosal immunity will be a biomarker for “protective” immune development. Abundant IgA-coated fecal bacteria are seen in early life and data from animal models indicate the importance of microbial diversity in the induction of this secretory IgA. Early studies suggest that the predisposition to the development of IgE antibodies (“atopy”) is associated with a slow development of IgA responses, e.g. our own data shows a delay in development of specific IgA in cow's milk-allergic infants. Exciting new discoveries further support the role for specific IgA come from trials of orally induced tolerance in established food allergy. Because there is an intimate reciprocal development of gut microbial communities with the IgA repertoire, we hypothesize that mucosal exposure to a diverse and immunogenic microbiome accelerates the development of IgA secretory immunity, counteracts development of IgE responses, and protects from allergic diseases.  We will assess how B cell subsets, immunoglobulin repertoire and somatic mutation rates (Aim 1), and gut microbiome and IgA antibody responses to microbiome develop in cohorts of high- and low-risk for allergy (Aim 2), and how these B cell biomarkers and gut microbiome relate to the development of food and other allergic diseases and humoral responses to allergens (Aim 3). In summary, this proposal will determine whether accelerated development of IgA responses is a biomarker for “protective” immune development, identify fecal bacteria inducing IgA responses, and assess the association of specific IgA immune responses with clinical tolerance, i.e. protection from early-onset food allergy and eczema. NARRATIVE The microbiome plays a critical role in the development of the immune system, and alterations in the microbiome diversity almost certainly play an important role in the surge of allergic and autoimmune diseases in developed nations. A major gap is our understanding of how the microbiome prevents allergic diseases. In this proposal, we will evaluate the development of infant immune system in populations at high risk and those at low risk for food allergy and other allergic diseases. The Old Order Mennonites (OOM) have a very low risk for allergic diseases and asthma and a lifestyle associated with a diverse microbiome; high-risk population includes families with food allergic children. These studies of immune system development in a population “protected” from allergic diseases will provide critical new knowledge about the development of the mucosal and systemic immunity, and lay the groundwork for future studies of prevention of allergic diseases in childhood.",Development of Mucosal and Systemic Immunity and Risk of Food Allergy,9323657,U01AI131344,"['Age-Months', 'Allergens', 'Allergic', 'Allergic Disease', 'Allergy to peanuts', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Antibiotics', 'Antibodies', 'Antibody Response', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'B-Cell Development', 'B-Lymphocyte Subsets', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Bacteria', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth', 'Cattle', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Childhood Asthma', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cohort Studies', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Defect', 'Developed Countries', 'Developing Countries', 'Development', 'Diet', 'Disease', 'Eczema', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Exhibits', 'Exposure to', 'Extrinsic asthma', 'Family', 'Farming environment', 'Feces', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Food', 'Food Hypersensitivity', 'Future', 'Genomics', 'Germ-Free', 'Home environment', 'Hypersensitivity', 'IgE', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immune system', 'Immunity', 'Immunoglobulin A', 'Immunoglobulin Class Switching', 'Immunoglobulin G', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region', 'Immunoglobulins', 'Immunology', 'Infant', 'Infant Development', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Life Style', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Memory B-Lymphocyte', 'Mennonite', 'Milk', 'Mucosal Immunity', 'Neonatal', 'Oral', 'Outcome', 'Plasma Cells', 'Play', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Prevention', 'Research', 'Ribosomal RNA', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Saliva', 'Secretory Immunoglobulin A', 'Serum', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Sorting - Cell Movement', 'Systems Development', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Training', 'Transcript', 'Umbilical Cord Blood', 'Vaginal delivery procedure', 'animal data', 'atopy', 'base', 'cohort', 'design', 'early onset', 'food allergen', 'gut microbiome', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'immunogenic', 'immunogenicity', 'infancy', 'microbial', 'microbial community', 'microbiome', 'microorganism antigen', 'mucosal site', 'neonate', 'peripheral blood', 'postnatal', 'prevent', 'response']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF ROCHESTER,U01,2017,490338,-0.016838160468538928
"Impact of Cognition on Balance and Gait Markers for FXTAS Abstract:  The primary objective of this K01 application is to provide research training and mentorship to the candidate to enable her to become an independent medical rehabilitation researcher. The candidate has clinical experience in Physical Therapy and doctoral training in basic neurobiology and is transitioning to a new clinical research area investigating balance and gait in a neurodegenerative disorder called Fragile X Tremor and Ataxia Syndrome (FXTAS) which occurs in some premutation (PM) carriers of the Fragile X (FMR1) gene. The short term goals are to develop an early detection model for FXTAS and identify additional molecular risk factors for developing this disorder. The plan has 3 aims: 1) To identify quantitative markers of balance and gait impairments in PM carriers with and without FXTAS, 2) To determine the impact of executive function and cognitive interference on balance and gait function in PM carriers with and without FXTAS, and 3) to determine the relationship between age, sex, executive function, and FMR1 molecular variables and the presence and severity of balance and gait impairment in PM carriers with and without FXTAS. The candidate’s long term scientific goal is to become a leading independent research scientist in movement neuroscience and neurological disorders and in the precise identification of balance and gait dysfunction in FXTAS from the earliest stage. In order to reach these goals the candidate needs to develop expertise in patient outcomes and neuroepidemiology research. The candidate’s short term goals which form the basis for this five year K development plan include training in 1) large scale subject recruitment, data management and advanced biostatistics, 2) balance and gait analysis and application to clinical trials in movement disorders, 3) design, implementation and analysis of large scale epidemiological studies and 4) introduction to rehabilitation intervention and clinical trial research methodology. Results of this research will help clarify neurological mechanisms underlying balance and gait deficits in FXTAS, establish reliable and quantitative outcomes measures of motor impairment, and provide data for future clinical rehabilitation trials. This research will be the first step in characterizing the longitudinal history of motor dysfunction in FXTAS from its earliest stages, thus paving the way for establishing disease monitoring and modifying strategies in premutation carriers. This proposal is relevant to the NIH Research Plan on FXS and Associated Disorders which includes the following goals: 2.2 validation of quantitative instruments to detect early clinical signs of FXTAS and its progression, 2.3 identification of molecular and clinical risk factors in individuals associated with penetrance of FXTAS, and 2.5 defining genotype, including FMR1 molecular factors, and clinical phenotype relationships in FXTAS. Over one million people in the US carry a premutation expansion in the Fragile X gene. A significant portion of these individuals will experience debilitating symptoms of a neurodegenerative disorder known as fragile X- associated tremor ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) including balance deficits, falls and progressive disability. This proposal addresses a critical need to identify early indicators of FXTAS onset in order to provide earlier intervention, including preventative and rehabilitative treatments, to delay disease progression, reduce the morbidity associated with falls and functional disability, and improve quality of life.

"Validation of Survey Questions to Distinguish Type 1 and Type 2 Diabetes Among Adults With Diabetes PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes are distinct clinical conditions with different etiologies, ages of onset, management strategies, risk factors, and outcomes. Currently, the data sources that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) relies upon to monitor trends in diabetes prevalence and incidence are unable to reliably distinguish between types of diabetes. Most of the large federal surveys used for diabetes surveillance have not included questions on diabetes type, and few studies have reported survey-based algorithms for identifying diabetes type. None have compared survey-based identification algorithms with a gold standard case ascertainment in order to validate survey-based assignment of diabetes type. Methods for distinguishing between diabetes types in electronic health records (EHR) data have been tested for children and adults, but additional validation work is needed. Our approach to improving diabetes surveillance in these two areas is based on an integrated study design whereby survey data for diabetes patients are linked with data from their EHR and a gold standard case ascertainment derived from chart review. We will select a diverse sample of diabetes patients that is designed and powered to assess algorithm validity for subpopulations defined by age, sex, and race/ethnicity. We will use rigorous questionnaire development methods to build on items used in previous surveys, cognitively test the new survey module to optimize wording and question order, field the survey using data collection methods similar to established CDC surveys, and analyze the responses relative to a gold standard classification of diabetes type. In addition, we will develop and validate against the gold standard EHR-based algorithms, including a modeling approach that produces a parsimonious rule-based algorithm for determining diabetes type based on the most important clinical variables, and a machine learning approach that uses the gold standard dataset as a starting point to identify implicit patterns that distinguish T1DM and T2DM. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed project will result in a set of validated survey questions for distinguishing Type 1 diabetes (T1DM) and Type 2 diabetes (T2DM). It will also produce validated survey-based and EHR-based algorithms for identifying diabetes type. T1DM and T2DM are distinct clinical conditions with different etiologies, ages of onset, management strategies, risk factors, and outcomes. Currently, the data sources that CDC relies upon to monitor trends in diabetes prevalence and incidence are unable to reliably distinguish between types of diabetes. It is important for surveillance systems to be able to distinguish diabetes type to support type-specific analyses of morbidity, mortality, medical care costs, and health-related quality of life. Improved surveillance data by diabetes type can help guide and monitor federal, state, and local diabetes programs, enrich diabetes research, and support people with diabetes.",Validation of Survey Questions to Distinguish Type 1 and Type 2 Diabetes Among Adults With Diabetes,9438672,U01DP006327,[' '],NCCDPHP,"WESTAT, INC.",U01,2017,498977,-0.026994091473628076
"Optical Body Composition and Health Assessment ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):1 Of all markers of human health, the most intuitive is body shape but based on quantitative evidence.  2 Anthropometry and regional composition measures such as waist circumference (WC), waist to hip ratio  3 (WHR), and visceral adipose tissue area (VAT) are better predictors of obesity-related diseases and mortality  4 risk than body mass index (BMI). Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) can quantify regional adiposity in  5 more detail than the above measures but is underutilized for many reasons including potential harm from  6 ionizing radiation, cost, and training. A study is needed to take advantage of rapid technological developments  7 in the ""quantified self movement"" to better describe phenotypes of body shape and its relation to metabolic  8 risks. The candidate developed in this proposal is 3D optical whole body scanning. If successful, sophisticated  9 obesity phenotype profiles could be constructed to clarify the underlying associations of body composition with 10 disease, genetics, lifestyle exposures, metabolomics, and be highly assessable using self-assessment 11 technology. Whole body 3D imaging technology is already so accessible that it can be done with video games 12 such as the Microsoft Xbox Kinect, and consumer cameras. 13 The long term goal of the Optical Body Shape and Health Assessment Study is 1) to provide phenotype 14 descriptors of health using body shape, and 2) to provide the tools to visualize and quantify body shape in 15 research, clinical practice, and personal health assessment. Our overall approach is to first derive predictive 16 models of how body shape relates to regional and total body composition (subcutaneous fat, visceral fat, 17 muscle mass, lean mass, and percent fat), and then show how our 3DO body composition estimates are 18 associated to important metabolic risk factors. Our central hypothesis is that 3DO measures of body 19 composition with shape classification better predict metabolic risk factors than anthropometry or DXA body 20 composition alone. Our specific aims are: 1. Identify the unique associations of body shape to body 21 composition indices in a population that represents the variance of sex, age, BMI, and ethnicity found 22 in the US population; 2. Describe the precision and accuracy of 3DO scans to monitor change in body 23 composition and metabolic health interventions; and 3. Estimate the level of association of 3DO to 24 common health indicators including metabolic risk factors by gender, race, age, and BMI. In an 25 exploratory aim, we investigate holistic, high-resolution descriptors of 3D body shape as direct 26 predictors of body composition and metabolic risk using statistical shape models and Latent Class 27 Analysis. By the end of this study, we expect to have models of the shape and composition suitable for self- 28 assessment technologies that are capable of representing over 95% of the shape variance in the US 29 population, and how these models relate to important metabolic status and body composition. The positive 30 impact will be the immediate applicability to clinicians and individuals for personalized risk assessment. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research is relevant to public health because they have the potential to provide a better understanding of who is at high risk of metabolic diseases because of a poor metabolic profile. Thus, the advances proposed are expected to have a high impact to the health and wellbeing of all US citizens because metabolic diseases, such as obesity and its complications, are currently the number one killers of adults.

"Shape up! Kids Project Summary/Abstract Of all markers of pediatric health, the most intuitive is body shape. Human and animal studies indicate that weight loss/gain correlates closely with increasing/decreasing insulin sensitivity, respectively. Anthropometry and regional composition measures such as waist circumference, waist to hip ratio (WHR), and visceral adipose tissue area are better predictors of obesity-related diseases and mortality risk than pediatric body mass index Z-score. Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry can quantify regional adiposity in more detail than these measures but is underutilized for many reasons including the sensitivity to children to ionizing radiation, cost, and training. A study is needed to take advantage of rapid technological developments in optical technology to better describe phenotypes of pediatric body shape and its relation to metabolic risks (obesity, “failure to thrive”) and bone density and size. If successful, sophisticated obesity phenotype profiles could be constructed to clarify the underlying associations of body composition with disease, genetics, lifestyle exposures, metabolomics, and be highly assessable using self-assessment technology. The long term goal of the Shape Up! Kids Study is 1) to provide pediatric phenotype descriptors of health using body shape, and 2) to provide the tools to visualize and quantify body shape in research, clinical practice, and personal health assessment. Our overall approach is to first derive predictive models of how body shape relates to regional and total body composition (subcutaneous fat, visceral fat, muscle mass, lean mass, and percent fat) and bone mineral density (BMD) over a wide range of ages (5 to 18 years), weights and heights, stratified by sex, and ethnicity. Our central hypothesis is that optical estimates with shape classification of soft tissue composition and bone density better predict fracture and metabolic risk factors than anthropometry (WC, WHR, and BM) alone. The Investigators will highly leverage existing data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey and Bone Mineral Density in Children Study. Our specific aims are: 1) Identify the unique associations of body shape to body composition and bone density indices in a pediatric population that represents the variance found in the US population, 2) Describe the precision and accuracy of optical scans to monitor change in body composition, bone density, 3) Estimate the level of association of optical scans to common health indicators including metabolic risk factors. Our exploratory aim is to investigate holistic, high-resolution descriptors of 3D body shape as direct predictors of body composition and metabolic risk using statistical shape models and Latent Class Analysis. By the end of this study, we expect to have models of the shape and composition suitable for self-assessment technologies that are capable of representing over 95% of the shape variance in the US pediatric population, and to define how these models relate to important metabolic status indicators. The positive impact of these outcomes will be the immediate applicability to other researcher studies and clinicians using the automated tools and models developed here for 3D optical images. PROJECT NARRATIVE  The proposed research is relevant to public health because they have the potential to provide a better understanding of what children are at high risk of metabolic consequences of obesity. Thus, the advances proposed are expected to have a high impact to the health and wellbeing of all US citizens because metabolic diseases, such as obesity and its complications, are currently the number one killers of adults, and are becoming epidemic in children as well.

"Fracture Prediction by Machine Learning and 3D Finite Element Models from DXA ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Osteoporosis is a disease characterized by loss of bone mass and structural deterioration leading to increased risk of fracture. Currently, osteoporosis is diagnosed by measurement of areal bone mineral density by dual- energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA). However, the majority of fractures occur in both women and men who are not classified as osteoporotic by current DXA criteria (T-score = -2.5). As a 2-dimensional (2D) technology, DXA does not provide information about 3-dimensional (3D) bone structure, shape and geometry, which substantially contribute to bone strength and resistance to fracture. Finite element (FE) analysis of quantitative computed tomography (QCT) images can provide 3D structure and strength measurements but QCT is impractical for widespread clinical use because of high radiation exposure and expense. In contrast, DXA is widely available, inexpensive and has low radiation exposure. What is needed is a method by which DXA images can be used to generate 3D shape models that incorporate bone structure and geometry. However, fractures are complex events influenced by other factors including age, race, body mass index, risk of falls, and prior medical and fracture history. Even sophisticated measurements of bone density, structure, and strength may not be able to predict fractures accurately. Machine learning is an emerging field in which models are created by ""learning"" from previous data. These models can incorporate various factors and be used to classify or predict outcomes for new data. The overall hypothesis of this proposal is that advanced analyses of widely available DXA images that incorporate structural and strength information and statistical modeling using machine learning to incorporate additional risk factors will better identify patient at high risk of osteoporotic fracture. This hypothesis will be tested using QCT and DXA data from previous studies to generate 3D statistical shape models that describe variability in proximal femur morphology. By aligning 2D DXA images to the models, patient-specific 3D models will be reconstructed for quantitative analyses and combined with FE analysis to estimate bone strength. Machine learning models will be used to incorporate these novel measurements, demographics, and various risk factors for fracture to predict incident fractures in two very large, prospective studies. The ultimate goal of this proposal is to increase the diagnostic utility of DXA, a safe, non-invasive, and widely available technology, by applying novel image processing and statistical techniques to predict fractures more accurately. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Approximately 50% of women and 25% of men over age 50 are destined to suffer an osteoporotic fracture during their remaining lifetime. Unfortunately, the current standard for the diagnosis of osteoporosis, DXA, does not predict most fractures. This research will develop advanced analyses of DXA images and use machine learning to improve individualized fracture risk assessment.",Fracture Prediction by Machine Learning and 3D Finite Element Models from DXA,9068774,K99AR067883,"['3-Dimensional', 'Age', 'American', 'Body mass index', 'Bone Density', 'Cadaver', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Deterioration', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Epidemiology', 'Event', 'Femur', 'Finite Element Analysis', 'Fracture', 'Future', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Height', 'Hip Fractures', 'Image', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Osteopenia', 'Osteoporosis', 'Osteoporotic', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Peripheral', 'Postmenopause', 'Prospective Studies', 'Race', 'Radiation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Scanning', 'Shapes', 'Specimen', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Weight', 'Woman', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'bone', 'bone geometry', 'bone mass', 'bone strength', 'cohort', 'demographics', 'density', 'diagnosis standard', 'fall risk', 'high risk', 'image processing', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'information model', 'learning strategy', 'men', 'novel', 'osteoporosis with pathological fracture', 'prospective', 'three dimensional structure', 'tool', 'two-dimensional']",NIAMS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,K99,2016,91800,0.0008271848362272693
"Improving cancer family history collection through social networking and artificial intelligence PROJECT SUMMARY  The  activities  proposed  in  this  NCI  K07  application  are  designed  to  advance  the  career  development  and  research  independence  of  Dr.  Brandon  M.  Welch.  Family  health  history  (FHx)  is  one  of  the most important  resources available to help clinicians identify disease risks. By knowing a patient's FHx, clinicians can quickly  identify  disease risks and initiate risk-reducing strategies such as increased screening, prophylactic surgery,  risk-reducing  therapeutics,  and  lifestyle  changes.  FHx  is  also  the  foundation  of  genomic  medicine.  Unfortunately,  the  collection  and  use  of  FHx  by  patients  and  clinicians  is  suboptimal.  To  improve  the  collection and use of FHx among the general population, a better FHx tool that is easier and more convenient  to  use  than  current  FHx  tools  is  needed.  A  new  FHx  web  tool,  called  ​ItRunsInMyFamily.com,​  incorporates  artificial intelligence and social networking to improve user engagement with FHx collection.Utilizing artificial  intelligence  based  chat  entity  can  improve  the  collection  of  FHx  information  by  making  it  easier  and  more  engaging to record FHx information, likewise social networking allows users to tap into the collective wisdom  and  knowledge  of  the  family  to  correct  inaccuracies  and  overcome  gaps  in  FHx  knowledge.  This research  study  will  first  identify  enhancements  to  ​ItRunsInMyFamily.com  ​that  will  further  promote  user  engagement,  with  particular  focus  on  rural and underserved patients (Aim 1). We will then evaluate whether this new FHx  tool can improve collection of cancer FHx in comparison with current FHx tools (Aim 2). Finally, we will assess  the impact of ​ItRunsInMyFamily.com ​on the clinical settings (Aim 3). To implement the research plan, it will be  critical  to  apply,  skills  obtained  through  K  award  learning  objectives,  namely  clinical  oncology  (learning  objective  1),  iterative  patient-centered  design  (learning  objective  2),  and  health  technology  assessment  (learning  objective  3).  To  fulfill  these  learning  objectives,  an  interdisciplinary  group  of  mentors  will  direct  a  comprehensive training plan. The training plan includes coursework, seminars, workshops, journal clubs, and  conferences,  covering clinical oncology, patient engagement, health disparities, user-centered development,  human-computer  interaction,  clinical  research  methodologies,  health  technology  assessment,  and  ethical  conduct  of  research.  The  strong  support  of  an  excellent  team  of  mentors,  and  the  vast  resources  of  the  Medical  University  of  South  Carolina,  create  an  optimal  training  environment.  Collectively,  the  integrated  learning  objectives  and  research  plan  are  critical  to  establishing  a  successful,  innovative,  and  meaningful  academic career focused on developing patient-centric informatics tools for oncology.   PROJECT NARRATIVE Family health history (FHx) is one of the most important risk factors for cancer and the foundation of genomic medicine, but is under-utilized by patients and clinicians.

"Identifying Huntington's disease markers by modern statistical learning methods. DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Designing an efficient Huntington's disease (HD) early intervention clinical trial for individuals who have an expanded CAG repeats in the huntingtin gene requires identifying and combining clinical, biological, cognitive, and brain imaging markers to accurately distinguish among subjects who will have a diagnosis during a given intervention period and those who will not, and to track early changes in the disease course. The goal of this project is to identify sensitive biomarkers for HD risk stratification, indexing disease progression, and developing clinical trial endpoints. The proposal directly adheres to ""2P's"" of the NIH New Strategic Vision of the ""4P's"" of Medicine: they will offer promising ways to predict when the disease will develop; and increase the capacity to personalize early intervention based on the informative patient-specific markers our models identify. Combining biomarkers to predict HD onset and progression is an essential step in a continuum of research for development of disease-modifying therapies. Composite markers and their risk profiles created from our model will offer quantitative way to monitor and compare potential interventions. Evidence collected from these comparisons will advance the development of efficacy studies in premanifest HD, where neuroprotective treatments would be most beneficial. We develop and apply a series of cutting-edge statistical learning methods based on support vector machine (SVM), variable selection, and dimension reduction to achieve these goals. These modern statistical methods designed for correlated big data have quickly emerged as among the most successful tools for hypothesis generation, classification and prediction in biomedical studies. However, they have not been introduced to HD biomarker research. In aim 1, using counting process, we propose SVM to handle time-to-event outcomes (e.g., time-to-HD-diagnosis) to combine markers into risk scores to discriminate subjects who will experience HD onset in the immediate future from those who will not,  based on their personalized features. Although SVM is well studied for binary outcomes, it is far less explored for time-to-event outcomes. We fill this gap in knowledge. In aim 2, we propose new learning methods for longitudinal outcomes to combine markers that modify the course of HD signs to monitor disease process and distinguish subjects with rapid progression from those with slower progression. In aim 3, we propose to use novel and robust performance measures to compare derived combined markers with existing disease indices and key markers. These aims will fundamentally advance our understanding of markers linked to HD onset and progression. The creation of statistical models for composite markers and risk profiles is especially useful in: (1) offering quantitative ways to monitor and compare potential interventions, and (2) improving power of efficacy studies targeted at premanifest individuals by narrowing the predictive interval which leads to future clinical trials that can be made shorter with fewer subjects. Finally, our improved predictions of HD onset and progression will provide more informative genetic counseling sessions for pre-symptomatic subjects at risk of HD. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The goal of Huntington's disease (HD) research is to develop experimental therapeutics to delay onset or slow disease progression, and to provide different treatment regimens at each disease stage. To meet this goal, this proposal develops and applies a series of advanced statistical approaches to rank and combine clinical, behavioral, and brain imaging markers to predict HD diagnosis in premanifest subjects during a given time period and to measure disease progression. The creation of model for composite markers and risk profiles is useful in offering quantitative ways to monitor and compare interventions and powering clinical trials for premanifest HD individuals.",Identifying Huntington's disease markers by modern statistical learning methods.,9119862,U01NS082062,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Advanced Development', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain imaging', 'CAG repeat', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease Marker', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Intervention', 'Early intervention trials', 'Event', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic Counseling', 'Genetic screening method', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Huntington Disease', 'Huntington gene', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Investigational Therapies', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motor', 'Motor Manifestations', 'Mutation', 'Odds Ratio', 'Onset of illness', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Penetrance', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'ROC Curve', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Marker', 'Series', 'Staging', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Stratification', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Treatment Protocols', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vision', 'Work', 'affection', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'cognitive testing', 'design', 'disease diagnosis', 'disorder risk', 'experience', 'functional outcomes', 'hazard', 'high risk', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'indexing', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'meetings', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'research and development', 'tool']",NINDS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,U01,2016,356244,-0.002541221479707385
"Predictive Model of Chronic Kidney Disease in a Hispanic Population DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This career transition award will provide the applicant with protected research time to develop an independent research career in biomedical informatics. Dr. Starkey received his M.D. in 2003 from UT Southwestern, completed the NLM Biomedical Informatics Training Program post-doctoral fellowship in 2011 and earned a Ph.D. focusing on clinical informatics from the Clinical Sciences Degree Program at the University of Texas Medical Branch (UTMB) at Galveston in 2012. Dr. Starkey accepted a faculty position at the Institute for Translational Sciences at UTMB that is currently supporting his transition to independent investigator. Dr. Starkey will utilize the career transition award for novel applications of advanced machine learning methods to create predictive models of disease. Predictive models of disease allow for the stratification of risk and prevention of disease and have been successfully implemented in the assessment of cardiovascular disease risk. Predictive models of chronic kidney disease (CKD) are an active area of research since CKD is a risk factor for all-cause mortality, cardiovascular death and end-stage renal disease. However, there is not a single predictive model of CKD created for application to Hispanics and the external validity of existing models is poor. The objective of this project is to create predictive models of chronic kidney disease in a Hispanic population and quantify biomarkers of chronic kidney disease using multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) proteomics in this minority population. MRM proteomics will utilize the UTMB Novel Methodologies core and its array of resources to create an inter-institutional collaboration. Heterogeneous ensemble machine learning methods will be used to create the predictive model of chronic kidney disease in the Cameron County Hispanic Cohort (CCHC). Established in 2004, the CCHC is a random population sample in Brownsville, Texas created to evaluate the determinants of health in a US/Mexico border population that is primarily of Hispanic ethnicity. The CCHC has an extremely high prevalence of obesity and diabetes at 49.7% and 30.3%, respectively. Both obesity and diabetes are independent risk factors for the development of CKD and represent significant health disparities in the Hispanic population. Archived serum samples of CCHC participants and the CCHC database will be utilized to complete the following aims: 1) Create predictive models of CKD in a Hispanic population 2) Refine the predictive models by including clinical laboratory data and a selective reaction monitoring mass spectrometry panel of biomarkers. At the completion of this project, predictive models of CKD applicable to a Hispanic population will be created and MRM proteomics will demonstrate utility of biomarkers identified in other populations. The application of the results will be used to create clinical tools for CKD risk and guide future studies in this Hispanic population with health disparities. Importantly, it will provide a career transition for D. Starkey to demonstrate the knowledge gained during his training that results in impactful research and publications. PROJECT NARRATIVE:  The proposed research is relevant to public health because it allows stratification of chronic kidney disease risk and quantifies biomarkers of chronic kidney disease in the Hispanic minority whom has significant health disparities with regard to kidney disease. The translation of selective reaction monitoring of biomarkers and development of heterogeneous ensemble machine learning methods for application to the prediction of chronic kidney disease in a minority population supports the NLM mission.",Predictive Model of Chronic Kidney Disease in a Hispanic Population,9121614,K22LM011869,"['Age', 'Albumins', 'Archives', 'Area', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Biological Markers', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Career Mobility', 'Career Transition Award', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'County', 'Creatinine', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Degree program', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Dialysis procedure', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Doctor of Medicine', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'End stage renal failure', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Faculty', 'Fellowship', 'Funding', 'Future', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Health', 'High Prevalence', 'Hispanics', 'Hospitalization', 'Household', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Investigation', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Medical', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mexican', 'Mexico', 'Minority', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Obesity', 'Participant', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Prevalence', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Proteomics', 'Public Health', 'Publications', 'Reaction', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Renal function', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Serum', 'Specimen', 'Stratification', 'Texas', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Translational Research', 'Translations', 'Transplantation', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Visit', 'Weight', 'Work', 'biomarker development', 'biomarker panel', 'biomedical informatics', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'career', 'cohort', 'cost effective', 'design', 'disorder prevention', 'disorder risk', 'follow-up', 'forest', 'health disparity', 'improved', 'informatics training', 'innovation', 'inter-institutional', 'learning strategy', 'medically underserved', 'mortality', 'multiple reaction monitoring', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'prospective', 'screening', 'skills', 'tool', 'urinary']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS MED BR GALVESTON,K22,2016,135270,0.013740789293165476
"Predicting In-hospital Cardiac Arrest Using Electronic Health Record Data DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In-hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA) is a significant public health problem, afflicting over 200,000 patients in the United States annually with a mortality rate of approximately 80%. The majority of these patients show signs of clinical deterioration in the hours before the event. This has led to the development of vital sign-based early warning scores designed to detect high-risk patients before IHCA to trigger life-saving interventions. However, the vast majority of these risk scores were created subjectively in individual hospitals and have shown limited accuracy for detecting adverse outcomes. Developing an accurate risk score to detect patients at highest risk of IHCA is essential to decreasing preventable in-hospital death. In my prior work, I completed several studies investigating the accuracy of vital signs for predicting IHCA. These studies, previous literature, and my preliminary data have resulted in the following conclusions: 1) statistically developed risk scores are more accurate than previously published risk scores, 2) multicenter data is needed to create the most accurate and generalizable risk score, 3) additional data, such as laboratory results, will likely improve the accuracy of risk scores, and 4) a cutting-edge method for developing prediction models, called machine learning, may result in more accurate risk scores. Importantly, significant improvement in accuracy leads to better identification of patients at highest risk of IHCA and decreased resource utilization. Therefore, in this grant proposal I aim to develop and validate IHCA prediction models using different statistical techniques in a multicenter database and then estimate the impact of the most accurate risk score using simulation studies. I will do this by firt developing prediction models using classic survival analysis methods (Aim 1a) and machine learning methods, such as neural networks and decision trees (Aim 1b). Then, I will compare the models I develop to the most accurate previously published risk scores in Aim 2. Finally, I will investigate the impact of the most accurate model from Aim 2 on patient outcomes using simulation modeling (Aim 3). Completion of this proposal will result in a validated IHCA risk score that can be implemented in the electronic health record to trigger life- saving interventions to decrease preventable in-hospital death. In addition, this career development award will provide critical data to inform future R01-level awards, including a clinical trial to investigate he impact of the developed prediction model on patient outcomes. I will complete this project under the direct supervision of my mentor (Dr. David Meltzer), co-mentor (Dr. Dana Edelson), and the rest of my advisory team (Drs. Jesse Hall, Robert Gibbons, and Michael Kattan). Together, this multidisciplinary team brings nationally renowned expertise in in-hospital cardiac arrest, outcomes research, critical care, and clinical prediction modeling. In addition, they serve as Chairs of the Section of Hospital Medicine (Dr. Meltzer), Section of Pulmonary and Critical Care (Dr. Hall), and Quantitative Health Sciences at the Cleveland Clinic (Dr. Kattan), and Directors of the Center for Health and the Social Sciences (Dr. Meltzer), Center for Health Statistics (Dr. Gibbons), and Clinical Research for the Emergency Resuscitation Center (Dr. Edelson). The mentorship, expertise, and resources that they provide will ensure my success as I grow into an independent physician-scientist. My career goal is to become an independent critical care outcomes researcher with a focus on developing prediction models for clinical deterioration that will improve patient outcomes. To accomplish this long-term goal, I have three short-term goals: (1) to gain expertise in the development and implementation of clinical prediction models, (2) to create an IHCA prediction model that will identify high-risk patients on the wards to trigger life-saving interventions, and (3) to gain expertise in simulation modeling in order to study the impact of the developed prediction model. To accomplish these goals, I will build upon the foundation I developed when earning my Master's Degree in Public Health and during my initial training in the PhD program in the Department of Health Studies. Although my training to date has provided me with a strong background in epidemiology and biostatistics, further advanced training in biostatistics is crucial for my development into a successful independent researcher. An integrated program of didactic coursework, seminars, research activities, and conference participation will span the duration of the award. By accomplishing my three short- term goals, I will develop unique skills that will allow me to become a successful independent researcher. Specifically, the expertise I will gain in prediction model development, implementation, and simulation modeling can be applied not only to IHCA research but also to other areas of critical care medicine. In addition, completion of these goals will result in a validated IHCA prediction model that I will study in future implementation and cost-effectiveness studies and will serve as a basis for future R01-level grant submissions. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Over 200,000 in-hospital cardiac arrests occur in the United States each year, and studies suggest that many of these events may be preventable if the clinical warning signs can be identified and acted upon quickly. However, the vast majority of tools used to identify patients at high risk of cardiac arrest were created subjectively and have limited accuracy. Development of a statistically derived risk tool is essential to detect at- risk patients accurately and early in order to provide the best opportunity to improve patient outcomes and reduce preventable in-hospital death.",Predicting In-hospital Cardiac Arrest Using Electronic Health Record Data,8984911,K08HL121080,"['Adult', 'Advisory Committees', 'Applications Grants', 'Area', 'Award', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Biometry', 'Brain', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Categories', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complex', 'Critical Care', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Trees', 'Deterioration', 'Development', 'Diastolic blood pressure', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emergency Situation', 'Ensure', 'Epidemiology', 'Event', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Health Sciences', 'Heart Arrest', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Hylobates Genus', 'Individual', 'Intensive Care', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Laboratories', 'Life', 'Literature', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Master&apos', 's Degree', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Patient Discharge', 'Patient risk', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Procedures', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Resuscitation', 'Risk', 'Scientist', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Social Sciences', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Supervision', 'Survival Analysis', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Uncertainty', 'United States', 'Update', 'Validation', 'Work', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'career', 'cost effectiveness', 'design', 'evidence base', 'high risk', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'model development', 'models and simulation', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'programs', 'simulation', 'skills', 'statistics', 'success', 'symposium', 'tool', 'ward']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,K08,2016,163944,-0.0007106302817135989
"Dynamic, real-time prediction of alcohol use lapse using mHealth technologies ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Available psychosocial and pharmacological treatments for alcohol use disorder are effective at establishing abstinence. However, the vast majority of patients relapse within a year and often within the first few months following treatment. Patients often fail to detect dynamic changes in their relapse risk. Furthermore, the majority of patients fail to adequately sustain use of skills developed during treatment and/or through continuing care. Well-established theoretical models indicate that alcohol and other drug use lapse risk is a dynamic, non-linear function of both distal, relatively static, patient characteristics and often moment-by- moment dynamic changes in proximal, precipitating risk factors. However, comprehensive, precise assessment of dynamic risk indicators in real-time has not been possible until very recently. Furthermore, innovative methods from predictive analytics have not been applied to the lapse risk prediction problem. The broad goals of this project are to develop, validate, preliminarily optimize, and deliver a dynamic, real-time lapse risk prediction model for forecasting alcohol use among abstinent alcoholics. To pursue these goals, we propose to follow 200 patients for three months during or following completion of standard of care treatment for alcohol use disorder. We will measure well-established distal, static relapse risk indicators on study intake. More importantly, we will use innovative mHealth technology to densely sample dynamic risk indicators including patient physiology, subjective experience, and behavior daily for three months using smartphones and wearable biometric sensors. Data obtained for these static and dynamic risk indicators will provide the foundation to accomplish the following Specific Aims: 1. Assess burden (feasibility, cost, and patient acceptability) to collect innovative, densely sampled risk indicators via smartphone and wearable sensors. 2. Use machine learning methods to develop, train, and validate a real-time quantitative lapse risk prediction signal based on static and dynamic risk indicators. 3. Use innovative Markov decision process models to optimize decisions about if, when, and how to provide additional treatment or support. 4. Integrate and deliver risk prediction and decision model within the Comprehensive Health Enhancement Support System for Addiction (A-CHESS) program. These project aims position A-CHESS to make relapse prevention and recovery support, information, and risk monitoring available to patients continuously. Compared to conventional continuing care, A-CHESS will provide personalized care and be available and implemented during moments of greatest need. Integrated real-time risk prediction holds substantial promise to encourage sustained recovery through adaptive use of these continuing care services. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goals of this project are to develop and deliver a dynamic, real-time model for forecasting alcohol use lapse among abstinent alcoholics. This lapse risk prediction model will be integrated into an existing validated mHealth platform to encourage sustained recovery through adaptive use of continuing care services.","Dynamic, real-time prediction of alcohol use lapse using mHealth technologies",9121449,R01AA024391,"['Abstinence', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Behavior', 'Biometry', 'Caring', 'Cellular Phone', 'Characteristics', 'Communities', 'Competence', 'Data', 'Decision Modeling', 'Dependence', 'Distal', 'Drug Use Disorder', 'Drug usage', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Galvanic Skin Response', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Services', 'Heart Rate', 'Intake', 'Intervention', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motivation', 'Nonlinear Dynamics', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmacological Treatment', 'Physiology', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predictive Analytics', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Psychopathology', 'Recovery', 'Relapse', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Services', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sleep', 'Support System', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Theoretical model', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'United States Department of Veterans Affairs', 'Validation', 'Voice', 'Withdrawal', 'addiction', 'alcohol and other drug', 'alcohol use disorder', 'base', 'clinical application', 'coping', 'cost', 'craving', 'disorder later incidence prevention', 'experience', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'mHealth', 'model development', 'personalized care', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'problem drinker', 'programs', 'psychosocial', 'real time model', 'relapse patients', 'relapse risk', 'response', 'sensor', 'skills', 'standard of care', 'stressor']",NIAAA,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R01,2016,381816,-0.035999116974761894
"Using Meta-level Smartphone Data to Promote Early Intervention inSchizophrenia Project Summary ""Using Meta-level Smartphone Data to Promote Early Intervention in Schizophrenia”  Schizophrenia is one of the most debilitating disorders in the world today. It affects over 2.4 million adult Americans each year. NIMH director Dr. Thomas Insel has declared “The best chance for preventing serious functional disability among people with schizophrenia may be to intervene at the earliest stages of the disorder, at the first episode of psychosis or even before symptoms appear. However, to act before symptoms appear requires improved predictive capacity” (NIMH 2011 Budget). Creating tools to identify high-risk, `prodromal' individuals may be the single most important step towards developing effective interventions to reduce the duration of untreated psychosis (DUP), and thereby also reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with schizophrenia. Recent studies have shown that over 54% of individuals with schizophrenia are re-hospitalized within the first 12 months following their initial hospitalization. Even after the first hospitalization, preventing relapse and re-hospitalization may lessen the long-term severity of the illness. In this SBIR Phase I study, we propose to determine the feasibility of screening for prodromal individuals and individuals at high risk of relapse by applying interpretive algorithms to Passively Gathered Meta-level Smartphone Data (PGMSD). We hypothesize that PGMSD can effectively assist in screening for prodromal individuals who are progressing toward psychosis as well as for remotely assessing individuals at risk for relapse during the critical 12-month period following their first episode of psychosis (FEP).  In Phase I, we plan to recruit 70 individuals who have been or are being evaluated at the Prodromal clinics at Columbia, UCSD, and UCLA, where an estimated 70 to 90% of clients already own Smartphones. Data gathered may include: the frequency of telephone calls, emails, and texts, to assess within person changes in social connectedness; GPS, accelerometer data, to assess physical activity, isolation, and sleep patterns. In the past, several IRB-approved studies have used smartphones for gathering similar data from patients. Algorithms will be developed using several techniques including machine learning to convert the meta-level data into measures of social functioning, physical isolation, physical activity, and sleep/wake reversals. In addition to achieving technological success, our goal in Phase I is to provide evidence of our ability to use PGMSD algorithms to differentiating group means of participants who are controls, prodromal, or experiencing their FEP (SIPS 1 or 2; 3, 4, or 5; or 6).  In Phase II, we will further develop and validate these algorithms. If successful, the Phase II project will have a large and sustained impact as our algorithms will help (1) identify at-risk individuals who `are' or `are not' progressing toward conversion, (2) serve as an objective measure of treatment effectiveness; (3) give rise to clinical reports delivered to EHR systems that hold promise for preventing relapse during the critical 12 months after initial diagnosis, potentially reducing hospitalization and re-hospitalization rates. Project Narrative The proposed research protocol seeks to determine the feasibility of identifying individuals progressing toward a first psychotic episode or re-hospitalization by applying interpretive algorithms developed in part using machine learning to Passively Gathered Meta-level Smartphone Data (PGMSD) collected from the smartphones of 70 participants ages 18-30. If successful, the PGMSD-derived algorithms will assist in screening for prodromal individuals progressing toward psychosis as well as with remotely assessing individuals at risk for relapse during the critical 12-month period following their first episode of psychosis (FEP), potentially decrease hospitalization and re-hospitalization rates. This passive data gathering approach will augment existing active data collection approaches, aid clinicians in focusing on interpreting rather than gathering data from their clients, and could modify clinical paradigms by shifting treatment from individuals suffering from Schizophrenia to individuals who are at risk of developing psychosis with the goal of achieving `secondary' and eventually `primary' prevention.",Using Meta-level Smartphone Data to Promote Early Intervention inSchizophrenia,9201713,R43MH107097,"['Accelerometer', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Aphasia', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Budgets', 'Cellular Phone', 'Client', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Databases', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Electronic Mail', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Hospitalization', 'Impairment', 'Incipient Schizophrenia', 'Individual', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'Interview', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Occupational', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Physical activity', 'Poverty', 'Primary Prevention', 'Privacy', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Relapse', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Secondary Prevention', 'Series', 'Severity of illness', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Sleep', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Social Functioning', 'Speech', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Telephone', 'Text', 'Therapeutic', 'Thinking', 'Treatment Effectiveness', 'Universities', 'Work', 'effective intervention', 'experience', 'first episode psychosis', 'functional disability', 'functional status', 'high risk', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'information gathering', 'insight', 'mortality', 'outcome forecast', 'personalized medicine', 'phase 1 study', 'phase 2 study', 'prevent', 'programs', 'real world application', 'relapse risk', 'screening', 'social', 'success', 'tool', 'treatment strategy']",NIMH,"TELESAGE, INC.",R43,2016,366201,0.007797217156230569
"A Novel Probabilistic Methodology for Prediction of Emerging Diseases in Patients with Multiple Chronic Conditions ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Treatment for people living with multiple chronic conditions (MCC) currently accounts for an estimated 66 percent of the Nation's health care costs and will continue to grow. This mounting challenge has become a major public health issue since MCC is linked to suboptimal health outcomes and rising health care costs. However, it now known how MCC emerge among individuals or in the general population. Traditional epidemiological approaches have led to important findings of disease links and comorbidity associations. However, they are limited in their ability to characterize how patients acquire new chronic conditions and predict/personalize the emergence of MCC for individual patients. Objectives: This study will develop approaches that can be used to identify the most likely combinations of comorbidity within a population. These approaches can be tailored to examine MCC patterns in specific sub- populations or at the level of the individual patient. We will also study the effect of a large set of risk factors on MCC combinations emergence. Furthermore, we will use data mining approaches to predict and monitor the development of MCC combinations in at the population and individual levels. Hypotheses: We hypothesize that the emergence and progression of comorbidities in MCC patients form patterns that can be predicted and which are associated with prior medical conditions, demographic, and socio-economic characteristics. We further hypothesize that these methods can predict the timing and emergence of new chronic diseases more accurately by personalizing the records for individual patients. Aims and methodology: in Aim1, we will characterize how MCC emerge and progress in distinct patterns and how these patterns transition between different combinations of diseases over time. We will then identify and group major MCC transitions using the Markov clustering (MCL) algorithm, which is a novel, efficient graphical approach to handle big data. In Aim 2, we will identify which risk factors are associated with MCC emergence using a machine learning approach that can handle the complex heterogeneity of comorbidity patterns. Risk factors include age, sex, race/ethnicity, education, economic status, marital status, and prior medical conditions. In Aim 3, we will use a similarity learning approach to develop models that can predict if MCC will emerge in individual patients or among populations and we will be able to use these models to monitor MCC emergence over time. Conclusion: Our findings will provide a foundation for future research that will evaluate specific treatment patterns associated with progression in MCC patterns and ultimately identify optimal time points of intervention for those with, or at risk for multiple chronic conditions. These findings will also provide information that can be used at the community level to manage healthcare resources to improve continuity and accessibility of care.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Project Narrative This research proposal aims to better understand the emergence of multiple chronic conditions by identifying and predicting emerging diseases in young adults and discovering the patient characteristics associated with comorbidity emergence and progression.            ",A Novel Probabilistic Methodology for Prediction of Emerging Diseases in Patients with Multiple Chronic Conditions,9074366,SC2GM118266,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Big Data', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Comorbidity', 'Complex', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Economics', 'Education', 'Epidemiology', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Foundations', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Status', 'Healthcare', 'Heterogeneity', 'High Performance Computing', 'Hypertension', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Marital Status', 'Medical', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Population', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Race', 'Records', 'Research Proposals', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Scheme', 'Statistical Models', 'Stroke', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Weight', 'Work', 'base', 'behavioral health', 'data mining', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'learning strategy', 'multiple chronic conditions', 'multitask', 'novel', 'physical conditioning', 'population based', 'public health relevance', 'sex', 'socioeconomics', 'young adult']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS SAN ANTONIO,SC2,2016,147000,0.0055332966561345565
"Reducing Non-Medical Opioid Use: An automatically adaptive mHealth Intervention ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In recent years in the U.S., problems associated with opioid prescriptions, including non-medical use and overdose, increased to historically unprecedented levels and represent a public health crisis. Emergency departments (EDs) play an important role in opioid prescribing, particularly to individuals at high risk for adverse opioi-related outcomes. Half of all ED visits are for a painful condition, and one third of all ED visits result in an opioid being prescribed. Moreover, in our pilot work, a quarter of patients surveyed at the ED study site reported non-medical opioid use in the prior three months. Despite the importance of this problem, strategies to reduce non-medical opioid use after an ED visit have not been well-studied. Our recent trial of a motivational intervention delivered to patients in the ED by a therapist resulted in modest reductions in non- medical use after the ED visit compared to a control condition. However, the intervention was unable to address the implications of opioids prescribed as a result of the ED encounter on post-ED opioid use behavior. This project will adapt the intervention for delivery after the ED visit through mobile technology in order to directly address the use of ED-provided opioids. Patients (n=600) will be recruited during an ED visit for a randomized controlled trial of the adapted intervention based on having used opioids non-medically in the prior three months and being given an opioid by an ED prescriber. In the intervention condition, interactive voice response calls will repeatedly assess non-medical opioid use and pain level and deliver intervention content. The intervention will include several potential actions that vary in intensity: assessment only, a brief message, extended messaging, or connection to a therapist by phone. Because the most helpful intensity of intervention is unknown and likely to vary between patients, the project will use an artificial intelligence stratey called reinforcement learning (RL). The RL system will continuously ""learn"" from the success of prior actions in similar situations with similar patients in order to select the action most likelyto reduce non-medical opioid use for each participant during each call. The RCT will be complemented by qualitative interviews to inform later implementation. The specific aims are to: (1) Adapt and enhance an existing motivational intervention to decrease non-medical opioid use after an ED visit by optimizing intervention intensity and duration through RL; (2) Examine the impact of the intervention on non-medical opioid use level during the six months post-ED visit; (3) Examine the impact of the intervention on driving after opioid use, overdose risk behaviors, and subsequent opioid-related ED visits. Secondary Aims are: (1) to examine differences in intervention effects between participants with high and low baseline levels of non-medical opioid use; and (2) to understand barriers and facilitators of implementation. This project will use a highly innovative strategy, artificial intelligence, to address a highly significant problem, non-medical opioid use. Ultimately, this study can lead to reductions in opioid- related harms and move forward the field of mobile health.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Non-medical use of opioid pain medications has increased substantially over the last decade, and ensuring the safe use of opioids prescribed as part of medical care has become a critical public health priority. Emergency Departments (EDs) are on the front lines of this emerging public health problem. This randomized controlled trial will test the impact of a mobile health intervention, which incorporates an innovative artificial intelligenc component to determine intervention duration and intensity, on non-medical opioid use and related harms for adult ED patients treated with opioids and who have a history of non-medical opioid use.            ",Reducing Non-Medical Opioid Use: An automatically adaptive mHealth Intervention,9026192,R01DA039159,"['Abnormal coordination', 'Accident and Emergency department', 'Accounting', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Analgesics', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Automobile Driving', 'Behavior', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Complement', 'Emergency Care', 'Emergency Department patient', 'Emergency department visit', 'Ensure', 'Future', 'Guidelines', 'Health Technology', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Left', 'Medical', 'Methodology', 'Monitor', 'Opioid', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Overdose', 'Pain', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Play', 'Process', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Psychotherapy', 'Public Health', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Resources', 'Risk Behaviors', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Severities', 'Site', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Voice', 'Work', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'brief motivational intervention', 'clinical practice', 'experience', 'high risk', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'innovation', 'intervention effect', 'mHealth', 'mobile computing', 'motivational intervention', 'multidisciplinary', 'new technology', 'opioid use', 'post intervention', 'prescription opioid', 'public health priorities', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'screening', 'skills', 'success', 'treatment as usual']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2016,578991,-0.009160542172244797
"Preventable Hospitalization in Dementia: The Impact of Neuropsychiatric Symptoms DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Older adults with dementia are at increased risk of hospitalization when compared to adults without dementia of similar age and medical comorbidity. The increased risk of hospitalization extends to potentially preventable hospitalization (PPH) for conditions such as a urinary tract infection or asthma exacerbation, suggesting difficulty in outpatient management of patients with dementia. Neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) of dementia such as agitation or delusions likely account for a significant amount of this risk, given their prevalence and potential to cause caregiver distress. While there are effective interventions for patients and caregivers to reduce NPS, the profile of patients that could benefit the most from intervention, therefore reducing their hospitalization risk, is unknown. Through the coordinated program of mentorship, didactics, and research that I propose, I will develop the advanced skills to derive and apply administrative, claims, and clinical encounter data to prospectively identify those patients with dementia at highest risk for hospitalization. Development of this patient-level risk phenotype means that future interventions to reduce hospitalization can then be prospectively matched to the patients most likely to benefit, a development of critical public health importance given both financial and geriatric work force constraints.  Over the next four years, my short-term training goals include: (1) address gaps in my formal research training, specifically: (a) to conduct observational analyses using large-scale claims and administrative data; (b) to derive clinical data from the electronic health record using natural language processing; and (c) to apply advanced methods of data analysis for risk prediction; (2) train in presentations, manuscript writing, and grantsmanship that culminate with a R01 proposal; (3) establish further connections with potential collaborators in the University of Michigan (UM) Pepper Center and broader community of aging researchers, national geriatrics and geriatric psychiatry communities, and the Beeson Scholar community; and (4) engage in leadership development with an emphasis on skills to lead a research team, mentor junior investigators, and communicate findings in research and clinical care settings.  These short-term goals will be paired with research aims that focus on elaborating the PPH risk profile for patients with dementia. Such research objectives can only be achieved when: (1) full clinical characteristics are available for the at-risk (i.e., non-hospitalized) population, includig (2) NPS data, which are rarely captured in standard administrative claims data. These criteria are uniquely met in the Veterans Affairs healthcare system, which has one of the nation's most advanced electronic health records (EHR). Using a national dementia case repository (N=269,565) from which I will draw matched cases (patients with dementia + PPH) and controls (non-hospitalized patients with dementia). Aim 1 will use claims and administrative data to explore patient, treatment, and facility risk factors associated with PPH. Aim 2 will use natural language processing to derive NPS from EHR clinical encounter notes and then characterize the association of NPS with PPH. Using the risk phenotype described in Aims 1 and 2, Aim 3 will develop logistic risk-prediction models to prospectively identify patients with dementia at highest risk for PPH. In subsequent grant proposals I will validate this risk- prediction model in other healthcare systems and prospectively pair the assessment tool with an evidence- based dementia intervention to reduce hospitalization.  My long-term career goals are to: (1) establish myself as independent investigator and national leader in geriatric mental health services research; (2) develop a programmatic line of funded health services research that develops risk-stratification models for late-life mental health and cognitive disorders; (3) translate knowledge from these research endeavors to improve the targeting and impact of future interventions research and health system delivery strategies; and (4) contribute broadly to the care of older adults by training and mentoring future clinical researchers in late-life mental health disorders. I am an Assistant Professor and geriatric psychiatrist at the University of Michigan, where I am also currently completing a MSc in Health and Healthcare Research, which provides an excellent background in health services research for clinicians. With this combination of clinical expertise and foundational training in health services research, I am uniquely qualified to undertake the advanced training activities outlined in this proposal, while UM affords the ideal environment in which to pursue this work. My primary mentor (Helen Kales, MD) and co-mentor (Frederic Blow, PhD) are national leaders in geriatric mental health who have used observational data to answer questions of national significance. My Advisory Panel includes Constantine Lyketsos, MD, MHS, an internationally-recognized expert in NPS and dementia care, and Kenneth Langa, MD, PhD, an internist, former Beeson Scholar, and renowned expert in using survey and secondary data to inform our understanding of dementia. Consultants include David Hanauer, MD, MS, an expert in bioinformatics and natural language processing, and Rodney Hayward, MD, a leader in risk assessment and intervention- targeting. My advisory team paired with resources of Michigan's Pepper Center, CTSA, and multi-disciplinary Institute for Healthcare Policy and Innovation make this the ideal environment in which to complete the proposed training activities. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Although hospitalization can negatively impact patients with dementia, we know very little about the specific risk factors associated with the chance of being hospitalized. It is important to understand what contributes to this risk, such as the behavior changes that accompany dementia, in order to identify those patients and caregivers that could benefit most from an intervention to avoid or reduce hospitalization. Given the rapidly rising numbers of patients with dementia, reducing potentially preventable hospitalization could have an enormous impact on public health.",Preventable Hospitalization in Dementia: The Impact of Neuropsychiatric Symptoms,9084484,K08AG048321,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Advisory Committees', 'Age', 'Aggressive behavior', 'Aging', 'Agitation', 'Antipsychotic Agents', 'Applications Grants', 'Assessment tool', 'Asthma', 'Attention', 'Benzodiazepines', 'Bioinformatics', 'Capsicum', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Code', 'Cognition Disorders', 'Communities', 'Comorbidity', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Delusions', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Distress', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Elderly', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emergency Care', 'Environment', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Geriatric Psychiatry', 'Geriatrics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Care Research', 'Health Policy', 'Health Services Research', 'Health system', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hospitalization', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Institutionalization', 'Internist', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Intervention Trial', 'Kale - dietary', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Light', 'Literature', 'Location', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Logistics', 'Manuscripts', 'Medical', 'Mental Health', 'Mental Health Services', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outpatients', 'Patient Care', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Primary Health Care', 'Provider', 'Psychiatrist', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Public Health', 'Qualifying', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Rural', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sleeplessness', 'Source', 'Stratification', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Translating', 'Universities', 'Urinary tract infection', 'Validation', 'Veterans', 'Visit', 'Work', 'Writing', 'abstracting', 'behavior change', 'career', 'case control', 'clinical care', 'dementia care', 'design', 'effective intervention', 'evidence base', 'geriatric mental health', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'leadership development', 'medication compliance', 'meetings', 'neuropsychiatric symptom', 'patient population', 'predictive modeling', 'professor', 'profiles in patients', 'programs', 'repository', 'skills', 'statistics', 'tool']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,K08,2016,175103,-0.014382103376942358
"An Evaluation of Novel Domains for Predicting 30-Day Readmission DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services has proposed to financially penalize hospitals that have 30-day readmission rates above the national mean. As a result hospitals caring for disadvantaged populations with more needs might be penalized by current 30-day readmission models that do not include measures of social risk and functional status of the patients served. These are two important variable domains that directly impact a patient's ability to manage their disease. Social risk factors (e.g. living alone, social support, marginal housing, and alcohol abuse) and functional status (e.g. mobility, fall risk) are rarely present in administrative data, which is why so few readmission models include this data. Yet many of these variables are available in electronic health records (EHR) and the advancement of the field of informatics has made the extraction of these data feasible. These variables may improve the discriminative ability of 30-day readmission models which currently explain little of the variation in readmission rates among patients.  We propose to improve 30-day readmission models by extracting measures of social risk and functional status from the EHR using the novel method of Natural Language Processing (NLP). We will combine administrative data (VA and Medicare) and data extracted from the national EHR in the VA for 6000 patients 65 and older in 2011 to improve upon currently available 30-day hospital readmission risk prediction models for congestive heart failure (CHF), acute myocardial infarction (AMI), pneumonia and stroke. We have chosen these conditions because hospital-level 30-day readmission rates for these conditions (CHF, AMI and pneumonia) are currently or will soon be (stroke) publicly reported. Our proposal has two goals: 1) to develop, test and evaluate automated NLP algorithms designed to extract measures of social risk and functional status from the EHR and 2) to understand the impact of these two novel domains on 30-day readmission across four conditions with fundamentally different post-discharge hospital course and disease trajectories.  We propose a paradigm shift in the understanding and obtainment of factors predictive of 30-day readmission. Our overarching hypothesis is that social risk factors and functional status which directly influence a patient's self-management ability are critical factors predictive of 30-day readmission, can be extracted from the EHR, and should be included in risk prediction models. The development of better risk prediction models will allow the identification of patients at highest risk of readmission and facilitate post-discharge interventions in their care. In addition, if social risk factors and functional status are criticalin explaining variation in 30-day readmission rates, then hospitals that care for patients with a higher burden of social risk and functional needs may be inappropriately penalized by current risk predictions models that lack these measures. Also, as more hospitals adopt EHRs, we need to study more advanced technologies such as automated NLP as tools to efficiently extract information and to inform health systems about the characteristics of the patients they serve. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: About a fifth of all Medicare patients are readmitted within 30 days of hospital discharge, potentially exposing the patients and their families to distress and unnecessary costs. An improved understanding of who is at highest risk of readmission will allow hospitals to efficiently intervene in the care of patients who may benefit the most from post-discharge interventions.",An Evaluation of Novel Domains for Predicting 30-Day Readmission,9065737,R01HL116522,"['Accounting', 'Acute myocardial infarction', 'Adopted', 'Affect', 'Affordable Care Act', 'Alcohol abuse', 'Algorithm Design', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical Data', 'Congestive Heart Failure', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Distress', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Evaluation', 'Family', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Status', 'Health system', 'Hospitals', 'Housing', 'Human', 'Incentives', 'Informatics', 'Intervention', 'Length of Stay', 'Life', 'Measures', 'Medicare', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pneumonia', 'Population', 'Predictive Factor', 'Publishing', 'Reporting', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Self Management', 'Severity of illness', 'Social support', 'Stroke', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'United States Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services', 'Variant', 'Veterans', 'cost', 'demographics', 'design', 'disadvantaged population', 'fall risk', 'falls', 'functional status', 'health administration', 'high risk', 'high risk behavior', 'hospital patient care', 'hospital readmission', 'improved', 'marginally housed', 'mortality', 'novel', 'payment', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'social', 'tool']",NHLBI,NORTHERN CALIFORNIA INSTITUTE/RES/EDU,R01,2016,520282,0.005947095173688992
"Geometric Surrogates for Clinical Management of Abdominal Aortic Aneurysms ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal will investigate the following hypothesis: that the quantification of geometric surrogates, which predict the ensuing peak wall rupture risk index (PWRRI), will provide an improved estimate of aneurysm rupture risk compared to the clinical standard of maximum aneurysm diameter. We thus propose the highly innovative use of both radiological and non-radiological clinical imaging to develop a computational tool that can assess AAA risk of rupture with greater accuracy than the current clinical standard. Such a tool will allow the accurate quantification of individual AAA geometry to achieve the main goal of the study, which is to identify the patient-specific AAA geometry characteristics that are surrogates for patient-specific PWRRI. In the proposed approach, we will first compute a truly individualized PWRRI based on an innovative method called image-based Vascular Mechanical Characterization technology (iV-MeCh). The geometry characteristics highly correlated with PWRRI will be considered the surrogates of this biomechanics-based index. A second phase of the study will be the validation of the surrogates with actual clinical outcomes, which will yield the accurate predictors of rupture. This approach, devoid of complex finite element modeling and based on a fast, nearly automated computational tool for geometry quantification, would provide an exceptional rationale for the need for surgical intervention and be of major clinical significance. Therefore, the following specific aims are to be completed during the project period to address the aforementioned hypothesis: (1) Validate iV-MeCh for estimating patient-specific spatio-temporal AAA wall stress; (2) Calculate individual PWRRI using iV-MeCh for high and low risk of rupture AAA; (3) Identify the individual geometry characteristics that are surrogates of PWRRI; and (4) Assess the clinical significance of geometric surrogates for the prediction of AAA rupture risk. The primary outcome of this research will be the ability to disambiguate or demystify rupture risk in AAA for which the standard of care (maximum diameter) is not an accurate metric for assessing their at-risk condition. The geometric surrogates of PWRRI are hypothesized to reduce false positives and false negatives compared to the conventional maximum diameter cut-off for recommending elective repair. In addition, PWRRI is predicted by means of a new, novel technique (iV-MeCh), which estimates wall stress in aneurysms by means of non-radiological clinical imaging and without the use of constitutive soft tissue mechanics. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This award will enable the validation of computational tools for non-invasively predicting the at-risk condition of patients with abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) based on the assessment of aneurysm geometry. This research is expected to impact the clinical management of AAA disease, as well as the pre-surgical planning capabilities of vascular and endovascular aneurysm repair.",Geometric Surrogates for Clinical Management of Abdominal Aortic Aneurysms,9041015,R01HL121293,"['Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm', 'Address', 'Aneurysm', 'Award', 'Biomechanics', 'Blood Vessels', 'Caliber', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Research', 'Complex', 'Consent', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Elements', 'Foundations', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Property', 'Records', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Rupture', 'Ruptured Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm', 'Ruptured Aneurysm', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Staging', 'Stress', 'Surgeon', 'Surveillance Program', 'Survival Rate', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Validation', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'clinically significant', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'high risk', 'improved', 'indexing', 'individual patient', 'innovation', 'novel', 'pressure', 'primary outcome', 'prospective', 'radiologist', 'repaired', 'soft tissue', 'standard of care', 'tool']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS SAN ANTONIO,R01,2016,474831,0.018771960872271686
"Multi-Parametric Spatial Assessment of Bone with HR-pQCT ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Osteoporosis is a skeletal disorder characterized by compromised bone strength predisposing a person to an increased risk of fracture. In the U.S. today, 10 million individuals are estimated to already have the disease and almost 34 million more are estimated to have low bone density, placing them at increased risk for osteoporosis and broken bones. Currently, determination of fracture risk, aging effects, and therapeutic efficacy is primarily based on bone mineral density (BMD) measured by areal or volumetric X-ray-based imaging techniques. BMD can predict bone strength and fracture risk to some extent, however, studies have shown that BMD only explains about 70%-75% of the variance in strength, while the remaining variance has been attributed to the cumulative and synergistic effect of other factors such as bone structure, topology, geometry, tissue composition, microdamage, and biomechanical factors. High-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography (HR-pQCT) is a noninvasive in-vivo imaging technique which depicts many of these features, including density, geometry, structure, topology, and mechanics of cortical and trabecular bone in the distal radius and distal tibia. To date HR-pQCT imagery has been analyzed using conventional quantitative approaches that average bone features over large regions of interest. The individual quantification of average bone features (uni-parametric) or their statistical combination (multi-parametric) disregard how these three-dimensional (3D) features synergistically contribute to bone strength. As a result the traditional methods fail to capture the spatial patterning of the effect being studied, which is key to understanding the underlying biology. Bone is a 3D organ experiencing constant adaptation through remodeling, and should therefore be analyzed with 3D techniques that reflect the complementary and interdependent nature of different bone features. Statistical parametric mapping (SPM) is a technique that enables 3D spatial comparisons of multi-parametric maps between groups of subjects. Instead of measuring summary properties for arbitrary or subjective volumes of interest, this data-driven process identifies regions significantly associated with a variable of interest through valid statistical tests, thus generating 3D statistical and P-value maps that facilitate the visualization and consequently the interpretation of comparisons between target populations. The ultimate goal of this proposal is to establish a framework to automatically identify relevant bone sub-regions and features in specific populations for the targeted quantitative assessment of the spatial distribution and prediction of bone strength using HR-pQCT. For this purpose, specialized SPM techniques have been developed for HR-pQCT. To evaluate the potential of SPM in clinical science, we propose to apply SPM to image data from three existing in-vivo HR-pQCT studies investigating: a) regional variations in bone structure related to gender and age; b) differences due to fracture of the forearm; and c) longitudinal effects of two osteoporosis treatments.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  We propose a population-based framework to automatically identify relevant bone sub-regions and features in specific populations for the targeted quantitative assessment of the spatial distribution and prediction of bone strength using HR-pQCT. To demonstrate the potential of this framework in clinical science, we apply it to existing HR-pQCT studies to identify bone sub-regions and features significantly associated with age, gender, fracture status and response to osteoporosis treatment in post menopausal women; identify spatial associations between the central and distal skeleton with respect to treatment response; and improve fracture discrimination, and the prediction and understanding of the effects of osteoporosis treatment. This framework could improve the development of innovative, more active and safer drugs and therapies, and directly benefit patients suffering osteoporosis and other bone disorders since based on HR-pQCT maps of parameters estimating bone density and quality, a treatment offering the most clinical benefits to them could be prescribed.            ",Multi-Parametric Spatial Assessment of Bone with HR-pQCT,9106828,R01AR068456,"['Accounting', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Biology', 'Biomechanics', 'Bone Density', 'Bone Diseases', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Distal', 'Elderly', 'Etiology', 'Exercise', 'Forearm Fracture', 'Fracture', 'Gender', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Hip region structure', 'Hormonal', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Information Distribution', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Nature', 'Organ', 'Osteoporosis', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Peripheral', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Population', 'Postmenopause', 'Process', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Radial', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Role', 'Skeleton', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Target Populations', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Variant', 'Vertebral column', 'Woman', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'age effect', 'base', 'bone', 'bone quality', 'bone strength', 'cost', 'density', 'experience', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'in vivo imaging', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'population based', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'screening', 'skeletal', 'skeletal disorder', 'spatial relationship', 'substantia spongiosa', 'tibia', 'tool', 'treatment response']",NIAMS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2016,31678,0.0016970178473665917
"Genetic Susceptibility and Risk Model for Pancreatic Cancer DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Pancreatic cancer (PanC) is the fourth leading cause of cancer-related death for both men and women in the U.S. Better understanding of the etiology and developing risk prediction models for early detection and prevention are urgently needed for this rapidly fatal disease. The majority of PanC are caused by the interplay of both genetic and environmental factors. Known risk factors for PanC include cigarette smoking, obesity, long-term type II diabetes, and family history. In addition, our previous case-control study has shown that excess body mass index (BMI) in young adulthood confers a higher risk of PanC than weight gain at later age. Recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified several chromosomal regions and genes in association with risk of PanC (PanScan). Our pathway analyses of the PanScan GWAS data have uncovered several novel biological pathways associated with the risk for PanC. However, it remains unknown how environmental or host risk factors modify the association between genetic factors and the PanC risk, which knowledge is critical to better understanding of the etiology and developing a risk prediction model and early intervention strategies for PanC. The goal of this project is to identify gene-environment interactions and develop and validate a risk prediction model including both common and rare genetic variants using the PanScan GWAS data and the exposure information of over 2,200 case-control pairs and an ongoing ExomeChip-based study of PanC genotyping both common SNPs and >240,000 rare functional exonic variants in over 4,100 cases and 4,700 controls from six case-control studies in the Pancreatic Cancer Case Control Consortium (PanC4) and a nested case-control study from Europe (EPIC). We will validate the absolute risk prediction model in two large prospective cohorts: the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) cohort of 15,000 individuals and the Kaiser Permanente cohort of 100,000 individuals. We will also develop novel statistical methods to identify genes modifying the association between changing BMI at different age periods and PanC risk using the unique dataset from a case-control study of PanC conducted at MD Anderson Cancer Center. Our proposed project hinges on novel integration of GWAS, ExomeChip, exposure data of a large number of PanC cases and controls, recently developed powerful statistical methods and analysis strategies for detecting genome-wide gene/pathway-environment interactions and polygenic approaches to genetic risk prediction. The work proposed here is expected not only to advance our understanding of the etiology of PanC and delineate how genes and lifestyle or host factors modify the risk of PanC, but also to greatly facilitate identification of high-risk individuals, and thus, contribute to early detection, improved survival and prevention of PanC. The novel statistical methods developed here are also applicable to other cancers and complex disease, and we will develop user-friendly software packages for public use. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Over 43,900 new cases of pancreatic cancer are expected to occur in the US in 2012, almost all rapidly fatal. This project will not only advance our understanding of the etiology of pancreatic cancer and delineate how genes and lifestyle or host factors modify the risk of pancreatic cancer, but also will facilitate identification of high-risk individuals, and thus, contribute to early detection, prevention, and improved survival of pancreatic cancer.

"Metabolomics and risk of Parkinson's Disease ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Parkinson disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease in the United States and affects over one million Americans; this number is growing due to population aging. Current treatments do not prevent the disease progression that ultimately results in severe disability. There is thus a compelling need to develop neuroprotective treatments. Because at the time of the clinical diagnosis of PD there is already substantial neuronal loss, such treatments should ideally be initiated earlier. Aims of the proposed investigation are to implement and validate a novel metabolomic approach for the identification of early changes in peripheral blood of individuals with preclinical or premotor PD. The metabolomic results will be integrated with detailed and validated information on risk factors for PD, which has been collected prospectively and periodically updated. We expect by this means to identify new clues to the etiology of PD and to identify a metabolomic signature of PD that could contribute to an early diagnosis. To achieve these goals, we will take advantage of data and blood samples collected from over 80,000 participants in three large ongoing cohorts, the Nurses' Health Study (NHS), the Health Professional Follow-up Study (HPFS), and the Cancer Prevention Study-II Nutrition, who have been followed for over 25 years for incident Parkinson disease. We expect to include a total of 805 incident cases of PD that will be matched to 805 controls, using a nested case-control design. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Parkinson disease is a chronic progressive disease for which there is no cure - the loss of brain cells that leads to disability develops insidiously over many years, and by the time the disease is diagnosed it is already extensive and irreversible. To identify Parkinson disease years before it becomes clinically manifest, we are proposing a novel approach that will take advantage of the peripheral blood and detailed lifestyle and medical information collected from over 80,000 individuals who were followed for up to 25 years. By comparing the blood levels of hundreds of compounds between the blood of individuals who developed Parkinson disease and the blood of individuals of the same age and sex who remained healthy, we expect to make novel discoveries on the etiology of Parkinson disease and to be able to develop a method for the early identification of Parkinson disease in other populations.",Metabolomics and risk of Parkinson's Disease,9134892,R01NS089619,"['Affect', 'Age', 'Alanine', 'American', 'Archives', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood specimen', 'Branched-Chain Amino Acids', 'Caffeine', 'Cancer Prevention Study II', 'Choline', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Coffee', 'Cohort Studies', 'Confounding Factors (Epidemiology)', 'Consumption', 'Controlled Study', 'Creatine', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diet', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Failure', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Glutamates', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Professional', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Insulin Resistance', 'Investigation', 'Life Style', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Medical History', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Pathway', 'Methods', 'Motor', 'National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke', 'Nature', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Nurses&apos', ' Health Study', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Physical activity', 'Plasma', 'Population', 'Progressive Disease', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Smoking', 'Specificity', 'Techniques', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Update', 'Urate', 'Validation', 'Woman', 'Work', 'acylcarnitine', 'aging population', 'base', 'brain cell', 'cancer prevention', 'case control', 'cigarette smoking', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'cohort', 'design', 'diabetes risk', 'disability', 'disorder risk', 'follow-up', 'gender difference', 'insight', 'interest', 'men', 'metabolic profile', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'mitochondrial dysfunction', 'motor symptom', 'neuron loss', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'nutrition', 'peripheral blood', 'pre-clinical', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'sex', 'specific biomarkers', 'tool']",NINDS,HARVARD SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH,R01,2016,563079,0.004862548472770854
"Impact of Cognition on Balance and Gait Markers for FXTAS Abstract:  The primary objective of this K01 application is to provide research training and mentorship to the candidate to enable her to become an independent medical rehabilitation researcher. The candidate has clinical experience in Physical Therapy and doctoral training in basic neurobiology and is transitioning to a new clinical research area investigating balance and gait in a neurodegenerative disorder called Fragile X Tremor and Ataxia Syndrome (FXTAS) which occurs in some premutation (PM) carriers of the Fragile X (FMR1) gene. The short term goals are to develop an early detection model for FXTAS and identify additional molecular risk factors for developing this disorder. The plan has 3 aims: 1) To identify quantitative markers of balance and gait impairments in PM carriers with and without FXTAS, 2) To determine the impact of executive function and cognitive interference on balance and gait function in PM carriers with and without FXTAS, and 3) to determine the relationship between age, sex, executive function, and FMR1 molecular variables and the presence and severity of balance and gait impairment in PM carriers with and without FXTAS. The candidate’s long term scientific goal is to become a leading independent research scientist in movement neuroscience and neurological disorders and in the precise identification of balance and gait dysfunction in FXTAS from the earliest stage. In order to reach these goals the candidate needs to develop expertise in patient outcomes and neuroepidemiology research. The candidate’s short term goals which form the basis for this five year K development plan include training in 1) large scale subject recruitment, data management and advanced biostatistics, 2) balance and gait analysis and application to clinical trials in movement disorders, 3) design, implementation and analysis of large scale epidemiological studies and 4) introduction to rehabilitation intervention and clinical trial research methodology. Results of this research will help clarify neurological mechanisms underlying balance and gait deficits in FXTAS, establish reliable and quantitative outcomes measures of motor impairment, and provide data for future clinical rehabilitation trials. This research will be the first step in characterizing the longitudinal history of motor dysfunction in FXTAS from its earliest stages, thus paving the way for establishing disease monitoring and modifying strategies in premutation carriers. This proposal is relevant to the NIH Research Plan on FXS and Associated Disorders which includes the following goals: 2.2 validation of quantitative instruments to detect early clinical signs of FXTAS and its progression, 2.3 identification of molecular and clinical risk factors in individuals associated with penetrance of FXTAS, and 2.5 defining genotype, including FMR1 molecular factors, and clinical phenotype relationships in FXTAS. Over one million people in the US carry a premutation expansion in the Fragile X gene. A significant portion of these individuals will experience debilitating symptoms of a neurodegenerative disorder known as fragile X- associated tremor ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) including balance deficits, falls and progressive disability. This proposal addresses a critical need to identify early indicators of FXTAS onset in order to provide earlier intervention, including preventative and rehabilitative treatments, to delay disease progression, reduce the morbidity associated with falls and functional disability, and improve quality of life. This research will also provide quantitative outcome measures that may be used in future clinical trials.",Impact of Cognition on Balance and Gait Markers for FXTAS,9164916,K01HD088762,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alleles', 'Area', 'Biometry', 'CGG repeat', 'CGG repeat expansion', 'Cerebellar Ataxia', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Counseling', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Defect', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Elderly', 'Epidemiologic Studies', 'Equilibrium', 'Executive Dysfunction', 'FMR1', 'FMR1 Premutation', 'FXTAS', 'Family', 'Fragile X Gene', 'Fragile X Syndrome', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Gait', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Trial', 'Length', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Mental Retardation', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Movement Disorders', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurologic', 'Neurosciences', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Penetrance', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Physical therapy', 'Quality of life', 'Recording of previous events', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk Marker', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Severities', 'Staging', 'Statistical Models', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Tremor', 'Tremor/Ataxia Syndrome', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Walking', 'Woman', 'X Chromosome', 'abstracting', 'base', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinical risk', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive task', 'computerized', 'data management', 'design', 'disability', 'disabling symptom', 'executive function', 'experience', 'falls', 'functional disability', 'gait examination', 'improved', 'instrument', 'male', 'men', 'motor disorder', 'motor impairment', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'programs', 'sensor', 'sex']",NICHD,RUSH UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,K01,2016,131004,0.010003034491225846
"Elective Induction of Labor and Pregnancy Outcomes DESCRIPTION (provided by investigator): Background and goals: Each year in the US, up to 490,000 pregnant women undergo elective induction, an intervention to bring on labor without a medical reason. Whether this causes risks to the woman or fetus is unclear. Only one recent clinical trial studied elective induction before 41 weeks of fetal gestation, and it found no difference in outcomes compared to letting the pregnancy continue (expectant management). Observational studies have found more cesarean delivery after induction, but most compared induction to spontaneous labor at the same gestational age, which is not the genuine clinical alternative. Instead, elective induction should be compared to the true alternative, expectant management. Most studies were too small to study uncommon but important outcomes, and none looked at whether risks differ by the mother's race/ethnicity or obesity. Our goal is to compare outcomes for elective induction at 38, 39 or 40 weeks' gestation versus expectant management, to help pregnant women and their providers make more informed decisions. Methods: A multiphase retrospective study of births from 2001 to 2011 will be conducted in two integrated health care systems. In Phase 1, the eligible population (206,000 singleton births) will be identified and classified by their apparent induction and outcome status based on electronic health plan and birth certificate data. In Phase 2, we will conduct 8000 brief medical record reviews to determine true exposure status (elective induction vs. expectant management). In Phase 3, we will review 3500 records in depth for true outcome status and risk factors. Phases 2 and 3 will oversample women with elective induction or rare outcomes, improving our power to address these specific aims: Aim 1: Compare the risk of the following outcomes after elective induction at 38, 39 or 40 weeks' gestation versus expectant management: cesarean delivery, postpartum hemorrhage, chorioamnionitis, neonatal intensive care unit stay, shoulder dystocia, low Apgar score, stillbirth, and neonatal death; and Aim 2: Examine how risks vary by the mother's race/ethnicity, parity, and pre-pregnancy obesity. Secondary analyses will develop an algorithm to more accurately identify elective inductions from electronic data. Impact: This research will compare elective labor induction at 38, 39 or 40 weeks' gestation to expectant management to provide new information about its risks or benefits for the mother and fetus. Our results could immediately affect clinical practice by helping women and providers make more informed choices together. They will also provide a solid foundation for practice guidelines and policy making. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Many pregnant women undergo elective induction (bringing on labor without a medical reason), but there is little good information about whether this is risk for the mother or fetus. Few studies have compared elective induction to the true alternative, letting the pregnancy continue, with birth at a later date; and it is not known whether risks diffe by the mother's race/ethnicity or obesity. The study would fill these critical knowledge gaps, and findings could immediately shape clinical practice.",Elective Induction of Labor and Pregnancy Outcomes,9069491,R01HD071986,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Apgar Score', 'Birth', 'Birth Certificates', 'California', 'Cesarean section', 'Childbirth', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Discipline of obstetrics', 'Dystocia', 'Electronics', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Event', 'Fetus', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Gestational Age', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Planning', 'Health Services Research', 'Infant Health', 'Integrated Health Care Systems', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Medical', 'Medical Records', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Mothers', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neonatal Intensive Care Units', 'Obesity', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Phase', 'Physician&apos', 's Practice Patterns', 'Policy Making', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Postpartum Hemorrhage', 'Practice Guidelines', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Outcome', 'Pregnant Women', 'Provider', 'Race', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk', 'Risk Estimate', 'Risk Factors', 'Shapes', 'Shoulder', 'Solid', 'System', 'Uncertainty', 'Washington', 'Wing', 'Woman', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'clinically relevant', 'design', 'electronic data', 'fetal', 'health care delivery', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'intraamniotic infection', 'neonatal death', 'neonatal outcome', 'parity', 'pregnant', 'stillbirth', 'tool', 'trend']",NICHD,KAISER FOUNDATION HEALTH PLAN OF WASHINGTON,R01,2016,654513,0.009292373611592492
"Forecasting pulmonary inflammation from in vitro assay results for nanoparticles ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The rapidly developing field of nanotechnology shows promise by allowing designers to specifically select unique combinations of material properties as needed increasing the effectiveness of applications in medicine, coatings, lubrication, semiconductors, composites, and many others. These materials with their unique combinations of properties on exposure to humans may result in unanticipated hazards, however, putting workers in nanotechnology-related industries at risk. Traditional animal testing is expensive and too slow to evaluate potential risks for the current pace of new nanomaterial development. Both technology developers and regulators need more rapid methods to evaluate new nanomaterial configurations for their risk potential. Much hope is placed in high-throughput in vitro screening assays, but the relevance of these results to the potential for human disease or even the observed toxic effects in animal exposures is unclear. Some research has proposed Quantitative Structure Activity Relationships (QSARs) to predict in vitro nanomaterial toxicity in a few specific assays, but the applicability of these models to a wider group of materials, alternative in vitro assays, or in vivo toxicity has not been explored. If the primary exposure pathway for workers in the near term is inhalation, which in vitro assays will provide the most reliable risk information for that scenario? Two recently available data sources will permit this study to investigate this question: the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) ToxCast data for nanomaterials and the Nanomaterial Pulmonary Toxicity Database (NTDB), a collection of published peer reviewed studies observing pulmonary inflammation in rodents upon exposures to nanomaterials. This study will pursue the following specific aims: (1.) identify combinations of in vitro assay results that can reliably forecast the results of pulmonary inflammation results in rodents; (2.) evaluate whether existing proposed QSARs for nanomaterial toxicity apply to a wider array of in vitro toxicity assays; and (3.) evaluate whether existing proposed QSARs for nanomaterial toxicity apply to in vivo pulmonary inflammation results. This study will employ machine learning methods to cluster similar nanomaterials between the various in vitro and in vivo results, and to identify combinations of in vitro assays that rank order the toxicity of nanomaterials most similarly to pulmonary inflammation results in rodents considering also how changes in specific chemical and physical particle properties exacerbate or mitigate observed toxicity. This study addresses documented research needs in the National Occupational Research Agenda (NORA) cross- sector Nanotechnology program including specific goals in the Human Health and Informatics categories. Implementation complies with the Research to Practice (r2p) Initiative in its formulation, design, and implementation plan including industry an public outreach. The insight generated by this study will improve nanomaterial risk screening capabilities and focus attention and effort on those measurements and techniques proven to be most effective and reliable enabling better management and control of the risks faced by workers. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Although toxicity risk information for nanoparticles is accumulating rapidly, the development of new nanomaterial configurations is proceeding too fast for our best risk assessment tools (i.e. animal testing) to keep up. The new availability of two large databases of in vitro assay results and pulmonary inflammation results in rodents will permit this study to investigate which in vitro assays provide the most predictive information about the results from in vivo exposures, and thus speed up the risk screening process for nanomaterials. The results of this study will have important implications for more quickly identifying new nanomaterial-related risks to workers.",Forecasting pulmonary inflammation from in vitro assay results for nanoparticles,9144793,R03OH010956,[' '],NIOSH,PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIVERSITY-UNIV PARK,R03,2016,66564,-0.001872217429227542
"Optical Body Composition and Health Assessment ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):1 Of all markers of human health, the most intuitive is body shape but based on quantitative evidence.  2 Anthropometry and regional composition measures such as waist circumference (WC), waist to hip ratio  3 (WHR), and visceral adipose tissue area (VAT) are better predictors of obesity-related diseases and mortality  4 risk than body mass index (BMI). Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) can quantify regional adiposity in  5 more detail than the above measures but is underutilized for many reasons including potential harm from  6 ionizing radiation, cost, and training. A study is needed to take advantage of rapid technological developments  7 in the ""quantified self movement"" to better describe phenotypes of body shape and its relation to metabolic  8 risks. The candidate developed in this proposal is 3D optical whole body scanning. If successful, sophisticated  9 obesity phenotype profiles could be constructed to clarify the underlying associations of body composition with 10 disease, genetics, lifestyle exposures, metabolomics, and be highly assessable using self-assessment 11 technology. Whole body 3D imaging technology is already so accessible that it can be done with video games 12 such as the Microsoft Xbox Kinect, and consumer cameras. 13 The long term goal of the Optical Body Shape and Health Assessment Study is 1) to provide phenotype 14 descriptors of health using body shape, and 2) to provide the tools to visualize and quantify body shape in 15 research, clinical practice, and personal health assessment. Our overall approach is to first derive predictive 16 models of how body shape relates to regional and total body composition (subcutaneous fat, visceral fat, 17 muscle mass, lean mass, and percent fat), and then show how our 3DO body composition estimates are 18 associated to important metabolic risk factors. Our central hypothesis is that 3DO measures of body 19 composition with shape classification better predict metabolic risk factors than anthropometry or DXA body 20 composition alone. Our specific aims are: 1. Identify the unique associations of body shape to body 21 composition indices in a population that represents the variance of sex, age, BMI, and ethnicity found 22 in the US population; 2. Describe the precision and accuracy of 3DO scans to monitor change in body 23 composition and metabolic health interventions; and 3. Estimate the level of association of 3DO to 24 common health indicators including metabolic risk factors by gender, race, age, and BMI. In an 25 exploratory aim, we investigate holistic, high-resolution descriptors of 3D body shape as direct 26 predictors of body composition and metabolic risk using statistical shape models and Latent Class 27 Analysis. By the end of this study, we expect to have models of the shape and composition suitable for self- 28 assessment technologies that are capable of representing over 95% of the shape variance in the US 29 population, and how these models relate to important metabolic status and body composition. The positive 30 impact will be the immediate applicability to clinicians and individuals for personalized risk assessment.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research is relevant to public health because they have the potential to provide a better understanding of who is at high risk of metabolic diseases because of a poor metabolic profile. Thus, the advances proposed are expected to have a high impact to the health and wellbeing of all US citizens because metabolic diseases, such as obesity and its complications, are currently the number one killers of adults. This is relevant to the part of NIH's mission which focuses on the prevention of disease by supporting research in the diagnosis of human diseases.            ",Optical Body Composition and Health Assessment,9082891,R01DK109008,"['Adipose tissue', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Animals', 'Anorexia Nervosa', 'Anthropometry', 'Area', 'Blood Pressure', 'Body Composition', 'Body Weight decreased', 'Body mass index', 'Body measure procedure', 'Classification', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Data', 'Descriptor', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Dual-Energy X-Ray Absorptiometry', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Gender', 'Glucose', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hereditary Disease', 'High Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Insulin Resistance', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Ionizing radiation', 'Life Style', 'Measures', 'Medical Imaging', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Diseases', 'Methodology', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Movement', 'National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey', 'Obesity', 'Obesity associated disease', 'Optics', 'Outcome', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Public Health', 'Race', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Support', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Self Assessment', 'Shapes', 'Technology', 'Technology Assessment', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Training', 'Triglycerides', 'Video Games', 'Visceral', 'Waist-Hip Ratio', 'bariatric surgery', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'cost', 'disorder prevention', 'high risk', 'human disease', 'indexing', 'insulin sensitivity', 'metabolic profile', 'metabolomics', 'mortality', 'muscle form', 'optical imaging', 'predictive modeling', 'public health relevance', 'sensor', 'sex', 'subcutaneous', 'tool', 'waist circumference', 'whole body imaging']",NIDDK,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2016,706716,0.028525661972354486

"Fracture Prediction by Machine Learning and 3D Finite Element Models from DXA ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Osteoporosis is a disease characterized by loss of bone mass and structural deterioration leading to increased risk of fracture. Currently, osteoporosis is diagnosed by measurement of areal bone mineral density by dual- energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA). However, the majority of fractures occur in both women and men who are not classified as osteoporotic by current DXA criteria (T-score = -2.5). As a 2-dimensional (2D) technology, DXA does not provide information about 3-dimensional (3D) bone structure, shape and geometry, which substantially contribute to bone strength and resistance to fracture. Finite element (FE) analysis of quantitative computed tomography (QCT) images can provide 3D structure and strength measurements but QCT is impractical for widespread clinical use because of high radiation exposure and expense. In contrast, DXA is widely available, inexpensive and has low radiation exposure. What is needed is a method by which DXA images can be used to generate 3D shape models that incorporate bone structure and geometry. However, fractures are complex events influenced by other factors including age, race, body mass index, risk of falls, and prior medical and fracture history. Even sophisticated measurements of bone density, structure, and strength may not be able to predict fractures accurately. Machine learning is an emerging field in which models are created by ""learning"" from previous data. These models can incorporate various factors and be used to classify or predict outcomes for new data. The overall hypothesis of this proposal is that advanced analyses of widely available DXA images that incorporate structural and strength information and statistical modeling using machine learning to incorporate additional risk factors will better identify patient at high risk of osteoporotic fracture. This hypothesis will be tested using QCT and DXA data from previous studies to generate 3D statistical shape models that describe variability in proximal femur morphology. By aligning 2D DXA images to the models, patient-specific 3D models will be reconstructed for quantitative analyses and combined with FE analysis to estimate bone strength. Machine learning models will be used to incorporate these novel measurements, demographics, and various risk factors for fracture to predict incident fractures in two very large, prospective studies. The ultimate goal of this proposal is to increase the diagnostic utility of DXA, a safe, non-invasive, and widely available technology, by applying novel image processing and statistical techniques to predict fractures more accurately.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Approximately 50% of women and 25% of men over age 50 are destined to suffer an osteoporotic fracture during their remaining lifetime. Unfortunately, the current standard for the diagnosis of osteoporosis, DXA, does not predict most fractures. This research will develop advanced analyses of DXA images and use machine learning to improve individualized fracture risk assessment.            ",Fracture Prediction by Machine Learning and 3D Finite Element Models from DXA,8869145,K99AR067883,"['3-Dimensional', 'Age', 'American', 'Body mass index', 'Bone Density', 'Cadaver', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Deterioration', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Epidemiology', 'Event', 'Femur', 'Finite Element Analysis', 'Fracture', 'Future', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Height', 'Hip Fractures', 'Image', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Osteopenia', 'Osteoporosis', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Peripheral', 'Postmenopause', 'Prospective Studies', 'Race', 'Radiation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Scanning', 'Shapes', 'Specimen', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Weight', 'Woman', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'bone', 'bone geometry', 'bone mass', 'bone strength', 'cohort', 'demographics', 'density', 'diagnosis standard', 'fall risk', 'high risk', 'image processing', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'information model', 'men', 'novel', 'osteoporosis with pathological fracture', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'three dimensional structure', 'tool', 'two-dimensional']",NIAMS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,K99,2015,91800,0.0008271848362272693
"Novel whole-genome analysis methods for Alzheimer's risk prediction ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Late-onset Alzheimer's Disease (LOAD) affects millions of elderly people in the United States, yet there are no well-established clinical guidelines for assessing a person's relative risk. Accurate assessment of lifetime risk for LOAD would give high-risk individuals the opportunity to undergo regular biomarker screening for signs of disease and to modify environmental risk factors or participate in prospective clinical trials. This Phase I SBIR project aims to develop a risk prediction model for LOAD that meets or exceeds the accuracy standards established in 1998 by the Working Group for Biochemical and Molecular Markers of Alzheimer's Disease. The recent release of whole-genome sequence data from an extensively phenotyped cohort of the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative creates a unique opportunity to develop the methodology needed to successfully construct such a risk prediction model. The Parabon team will undertake three specific aims in pursuit of the final goal of producing a risk prediction model that can be used in the clinic. First, a novel methodology will be created for analyzing whole-genome sequence data to discover common SNPs, rare variants, and epistatic interactions that significantly associate with LOAD endophenotypes, the specific physiological changes that underlie disease. This will require innovative algorithm and software development, particularly the implementation of multi-objective optimization in our existing evolutionary search algorithm for detecting epistasis. Second, the discovered significant variants will be built into risk prediction models for each endophenotype using state-of-the-art machine learning methods. These models will then be combined into a single predictive model for lifetime risk, which will be validated in an independent cohort from the Alzheimer's Disease Sequencing Project. Finally, to quantify the confidence associated with each prediction made by the model, algorithms and software for calculating confidence intervals will be developed and implemented. Each new prediction will be presented with a measure of confidence to enable clinicians to determine what, if any, intervention is necessary. When these aims have been completed, Parabon will have produced the first clinically relevant genetic risk prediction model for late-onset Alzheimer's Disease, as well as a suite of software that can be used in the development of other diagnostics. In Phase II, we will move beyond the ADNI-supplied endophenotypes, using image processing and deep learning to infer neuroimaging features most relevant to AD diagnoses, as well as work to validate the predictive models in a larger, more diverse cohort across multiple sites.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  This Phase I SBIR aims to develop a highly accurate predictive model for lifetime risk of late-onset Alzheimer's Disease to enable early identification of high-risk individuals for participation in clinical trials and regular screening for signs of disease. In pursuit of this goal, the Parabon team will develop algorithms and software to build a novel methodology for the analysis of whole-genome sequence data and endophenotype measures from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative.

"Developing Risk Algorithms of Internalizing Disorder Etiology and Course ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Anxiety and mood disorders (internalizing disorders [IDs]) are common and debilitating conditions. The proposed Career Development Award will provide the candidate with the necessary skills to develop an independent research program focused on identifying how psychological/personality, environmental, and biomarker vulnerabilities predict the development and course of IDs using prospective observational survey designs. The applicant's prior research training involved studying the influence of psychological/personality vulnerabilities on ID severity and course in patient samples. In order to expand his research program, the applicant is seeking advanced training in two key areas (psychiatric epidemiology; machine learning methods) and supplemental training in two additional areas (self-assessed biomarkers; environmental vulnerabilities). Collectively, this training will provide the applicant with the skills (1) to study ID onset and course using prospective survey designs, and (2) to use machine learning methods to develop clinically-useful risk algorithms of ID onset and course using multiple vulnerability domains (psychological/ personality; environmental; biomarker). These skills will be developed through a combination of didactic training, guided readings, and mentored research projects. Training will occur in the Department of Health Care Policy at Harvard Medical School under the mentoring of Dr. Ronald Kessler (an expert in psychiatric epidemiology) and Dr. Sherri Rose (an expert in machine learning). The proposed research plan involves two phases. In Phase 1, machine learning methods will be used to analyze cross-sectional ID data from the World Mental Health (WMH) Surveys in order to develop risk algorithms that predict the onset of major depression, bipolar disorder, and generalized anxiety disorder (Specific Aim 1). Machine learning methods will also be applied to WMH Survey data to develop subtypes of bipolar disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, and posttraumatic stress disorder that maximize the prediction of their long-term course (Specific Aim 2). The proposed Phase 1 studies are highly innovative; in contrast to other areas of medicine, virtually no studies have attempted to develop ID risk algorithms or subtypes using machine learning methods. However, Phase 1 studies are also preliminary; replication and expansion of the algorithms is needed in prospective samples. Accordingly, Phase 2 of the research plan (Specific Aim 3) aims to test the feasibility of conducting a large prospective web-based survey study of psychological/personality (assessed via self-report and behavior), environmental (assessed via self-report), and biomarker (assessed via self-administered salivary assays) vulnerabilities of ID onset and course. Participants will be recruited online to complete a baseline survey and those determined to have an ID or be at high-risk of developing an ID will be asked to complete bimonthly follow-ups over the course of one year. The Phase 2 study is also innovative. Despite being called ""the future"" of epidemiological research, web-based survey studies of the IDs are rare. In addition, existing prospective epidemiological studies coarsely (i.e., dichotomously) assess IDs and their vulnerabilities, and have long gaps (1-4 years) between follow-ups. The use of bimonthly online surveys of the severity of IDs and their vulnerabilities will address these limitations. Phase 2 exploratory analyses will also be conduct in which latent ID trajectories are predicted using machine learning methods. Overall, the outlined training activities and mentored research projects will be used to develop an R01 application for a prospective epidemiological study that uses machine learning methods to develop clinically useful algorithms of ID onset and course using a broad range of psychological/personality, environmental, and biomarker vulnerabilities factors.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research aims to use cutting-edge statistical methods to develop clinically-useful (1) risk algorithms to identify who is at greatest risk of developing different internalizing disorders, and (2) subtypes of internalizing disorders that identify who is most likely to experience a persistence and chronic long-term disorder course. This research has important clinical and public health implications.

"Identifying Huntington's disease markers by modern statistical learning methods. DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Designing an efficient Huntington's disease (HD) early intervention clinical trial for individuals who have an expanded CAG repeats in the huntingtin gene requires identifying and combining clinical, biological, cognitive, and brain imaging markers to accurately distinguish among subjects who will have a diagnosis during a given intervention period and those who will not, and to track early changes in the disease course. The goal of this project is to identify sensitive biomarkers for HD risk stratification, indexing disease progression, and developing clinical trial endpoints. The proposal directly adheres to ""2P's"" of the NIH New Strategic Vision of the ""4P's"" of Medicine: they will offer promising ways to predict when the disease will develop; and increase the capacity to personalize early intervention based on the informative patient-specific markers our models identify. Combining biomarkers to predict HD onset and progression is an essential step in a continuum of research for development of disease-modifying therapies. Composite markers and their risk profiles created from our model will offer quantitative way to monitor and compare potential interventions. Evidence collected from these comparisons will advance the development of efficacy studies in premanifest HD, where neuroprotective treatments would be most beneficial. We develop and apply a series of cutting-edge statistical learning methods based on support vector machine (SVM), variable selection, and dimension reduction to achieve these goals. These modern statistical methods designed for correlated big data have quickly emerged as among the most successful tools for hypothesis generation, classification and prediction in biomedical studies. However, they have not been introduced to HD biomarker research. In aim 1, using counting process, we propose SVM to handle time-to-event outcomes (e.g., time-to-HD-diagnosis) to combine markers into risk scores to discriminate subjects who will experience HD onset in the immediate future from those who will not,  based on their personalized features. Although SVM is well studied for binary outcomes, it is far less explored for time-to-event outcomes. We fill this gap in knowledge. In aim 2, we propose new learning methods for longitudinal outcomes to combine markers that modify the course of HD signs to monitor disease process and distinguish subjects with rapid progression from those with slower progression. In aim 3, we propose to use novel and robust performance measures to compare derived combined markers with existing disease indices and key markers. These aims will fundamentally advance our understanding of markers linked to HD onset and progression. The creation of statistical models for composite markers and risk profiles is especially useful in: (1) offering quantitative ways to monitor and compare potential interventions, and (2) improving power of efficacy studies targeted at premanifest individuals by narrowing the predictive interval which leads to future clinical trials that can be made shorter with fewer subjects. Finally, our improved predictions of HD onset and progression will provide more informative genetic counseling sessions for pre-symptomatic subjects at risk of HD. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The goal of Huntington's disease (HD) research is to develop experimental therapeutics to delay onset or slow disease progression, and to provide different treatment regimens at each disease stage. To meet this goal, this proposal develops and applies a series of advanced statistical approaches to rank and combine clinical, behavioral, and brain imaging markers to predict HD diagnosis in premanifest subjects during a given time period and to measure disease progression. The creation of model for composite markers and risk profiles is useful in offering quantitative ways to monitor and compare interventions and powering clinical trials for premanifest HD individuals.",Identifying Huntington's disease markers by modern statistical learning methods.,8896079,U01NS082062,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Advanced Development', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain imaging', 'CAG repeat', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease Marker', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Intervention', 'Early intervention trials', 'Event', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic Counseling', 'Genetic screening method', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Huntington Disease', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motor', 'Motor Manifestations', 'Mutation', 'Odds Ratio', 'Onset of illness', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Penetrance', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'ROC Curve', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Marker', 'Series', 'Staging', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Stratification', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Treatment Protocols', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vision', 'Work', 'affection', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'cognitive testing', 'design', 'disease diagnosis', 'disorder risk', 'experience', 'functional outcomes', 'hazard', 'high risk', 'human Huntingtin protein', 'improved', 'indexing', 'interest', 'meetings', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'research and development', 'tool']",NINDS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,U01,2015,339691,-0.002541221479707385
"Predicting In-hospital Cardiac Arrest Using Electronic Health Record Data DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In-hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA) is a significant public health problem, afflicting over 200,000 patients in the United States annually with a mortality rate of approximately 80%. The majority of these patients show signs of clinical deterioration in the hours before the event. This has led to the development of vital sign-based early warning scores designed to detect high-risk patients before IHCA to trigger life-saving interventions. However, the vast majority of these risk scores were created subjectively in individual hospitals and have shown limited accuracy for detecting adverse outcomes. Developing an accurate risk score to detect patients at highest risk of IHCA is essential to decreasing preventable in-hospital death. In my prior work, I completed several studies investigating the accuracy of vital signs for predicting IHCA. These studies, previous literature, and my preliminary data have resulted in the following conclusions: 1) statistically developed risk scores are more accurate than previously published risk scores, 2) multicenter data is needed to create the most accurate and generalizable risk score, 3) additional data, such as laboratory results, will likely improve the accuracy of risk scores, and 4) a cutting-edge method for developing prediction models, called machine learning, may result in more accurate risk scores. Importantly, significant improvement in accuracy leads to better identification of patients at highest risk of IHCA and decreased resource utilization. Therefore, in this grant proposal I aim to develop and validate IHCA prediction models using different statistical techniques in a multicenter database and then estimate the impact of the most accurate risk score using simulation studies. I will do this by firt developing prediction models using classic survival analysis methods (Aim 1a) and machine learning methods, such as neural networks and decision trees (Aim 1b). Then, I will compare the models I develop to the most accurate previously published risk scores in Aim 2. Finally, I will investigate the impact of the most accurate model from Aim 2 on patient outcomes using simulation modeling (Aim 3). Completion of this proposal will result in a validated IHCA risk score that can be implemented in the electronic health record to trigger life- saving interventions to decrease preventable in-hospital death. In addition, this career development award will provide critical data to inform future R01-level awards, including a clinical trial to investigate he impact of the developed prediction model on patient outcomes. I will complete this project under the direct supervision of my mentor (Dr. David Meltzer), co-mentor (Dr. Dana Edelson), and the rest of my advisory team (Drs. Jesse Hall, Robert Gibbons, and Michael Kattan). Together, this multidisciplinary team brings nationally renowned expertise in in-hospital cardiac arrest, outcomes research, critical care, and clinical prediction modeling. In addition, they serve as Chairs of the Section of Hospital Medicine (Dr. Meltzer), Section of Pulmonary and Critical Care (Dr. Hall), and Quantitative Health Sciences at the Cleveland Clinic (Dr. Kattan), and Directors of the Center for Health and the Social Sciences (Dr. Meltzer), Center for Health Statistics (Dr. Gibbons), and Clinical Research for the Emergency Resuscitation Center (Dr. Edelson). The mentorship, expertise, and resources that they provide will ensure my success as I grow into an independent physician-scientist. My career goal is to become an independent critical care outcomes researcher with a focus on developing prediction models for clinical deterioration that will improve patient outcomes. To accomplish this long-term goal, I have three short-term goals: (1) to gain expertise in the development and implementation of clinical prediction models, (2) to create an IHCA prediction model that will identify high-risk patients on the wards to trigger life-saving interventions, and (3) to gain expertise in simulation modeling in order to study the impact of the developed prediction model. To accomplish these goals, I will build upon the foundation I developed when earning my Master's Degree in Public Health and during my initial training in the PhD program in the Department of Health Studies. Although my training to date has provided me with a strong background in epidemiology and biostatistics, further advanced training in biostatistics is crucial for my development into a successful independent researcher. An integrated program of didactic coursework, seminars, research activities, and conference participation will span the duration of the award. By accomplishing my three short- term goals, I will develop unique skills that will allow me to become a successful independent researcher. Specifically, the expertise I will gain in prediction model development, implementation, and simulation modeling can be applied not only to IHCA research but also to other areas of critical care medicine. In addition, completion of these goals will result in a validated IHCA prediction model that I will study in future implementation and cost-effectiveness studies and will serve as a basis for future R01-level grant submissions. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Over 200,000 in-hospital cardiac arrests occur in the United States each year, and studies suggest that many of these events may be preventable if the clinical warning signs can be identified and acted upon quickly. However, the vast majority of tools used to identify patients at high risk of cardiac arrest were created subjectively and have limited accuracy. Development of a statistically derived risk tool is essential to detect at- risk patients accurately and early in order to provide the best opportunity to improve patient outcomes and reduce preventable in-hospital death.",Predicting In-hospital Cardiac Arrest Using Electronic Health Record Data,8788442,K08HL121080,"['Adult', 'Applications Grants', 'Area', 'Award', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Biometry', 'Brain', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Categories', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complex', 'Critical Care', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Trees', 'Deterioration', 'Development', 'Diastolic blood pressure', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emergency Situation', 'Ensure', 'Epidemiology', 'Event', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Health Sciences', 'Heart Arrest', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Hylobates Genus', 'Individual', 'Intensive Care', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Laboratories', 'Life', 'Literature', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Master&apos', 's Degree', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Patient Discharge', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Procedures', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Resuscitation', 'Risk', 'Scientist', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Social Sciences', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Supervision', 'Survival Analysis', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Uncertainty', 'United States', 'Update', 'Validation', 'Work', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'career', 'cost effectiveness', 'design', 'evidence base', 'high risk', 'improved', 'model development', 'models and simulation', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'programs', 'simulation', 'skills', 'statistics', 'success', 'symposium', 'tool', 'ward']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,K08,2015,129546,-0.0007106302817135989
"Predictive Model of Chronic Kidney Disease in a Hispanic Population DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This career transition award will provide the applicant with protected research time to develop an independent research career in biomedical informatics. Dr. Starkey received his M.D. in 2003 from UT Southwestern, completed the NLM Biomedical Informatics Training Program post-doctoral fellowship in 2011 and earned a Ph.D. focusing on clinical informatics from the Clinical Sciences Degree Program at the University of Texas Medical Branch (UTMB) at Galveston in 2012. Dr. Starkey accepted a faculty position at the Institute for Translational Sciences at UTMB that is currently supporting his transition to independent investigator. Dr. Starkey will utilize the career transition award for novel applications of advanced machine learning methods to create predictive models of disease. Predictive models of disease allow for the stratification of risk and prevention of disease and have been successfully implemented in the assessment of cardiovascular disease risk. Predictive models of chronic kidney disease (CKD) are an active area of research since CKD is a risk factor for all-cause mortality, cardiovascular death and end-stage renal disease. However, there is not a single predictive model of CKD created for application to Hispanics and the external validity of existing models is poor. The objective of this project is to create predictive models of chronic kidney disease in a Hispanic population and quantify biomarkers of chronic kidney disease using multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) proteomics in this minority population. MRM proteomics will utilize the UTMB Novel Methodologies core and its array of resources to create an inter-institutional collaboration. Heterogeneous ensemble machine learning methods will be used to create the predictive model of chronic kidney disease in the Cameron County Hispanic Cohort (CCHC). Established in 2004, the CCHC is a random population sample in Brownsville, Texas created to evaluate the determinants of health in a US/Mexico border population that is primarily of Hispanic ethnicity. The CCHC has an extremely high prevalence of obesity and diabetes at 49.7% and 30.3%, respectively. Both obesity and diabetes are independent risk factors for the development of CKD and represent significant health disparities in the Hispanic population. Archived serum samples of CCHC participants and the CCHC database will be utilized to complete the following aims: 1) Create predictive models of CKD in a Hispanic population 2) Refine the predictive models by including clinical laboratory data and a selective reaction monitoring mass spectrometry panel of biomarkers. At the completion of this project, predictive models of CKD applicable to a Hispanic population will be created and MRM proteomics will demonstrate utility of biomarkers identified in other populations. The application of the results will be used to create clinical tools for CKD risk and guide future studies in this Hispanic population with health disparities. Importantly, it will provide a career transition for D. Starkey to demonstrate the knowledge gained during his training that results in impactful research and publications. PROJECT NARRATIVE:  The proposed research is relevant to public health because it allows stratification of chronic kidney disease risk and quantifies biomarkers of chronic kidney disease in the Hispanic minority whom has significant health disparities with regard to kidney disease. The translation of selective reaction monitoring of biomarkers and development of heterogeneous ensemble machine learning methods for application to the prediction of chronic kidney disease in a minority population supports the NLM mission.",Predictive Model of Chronic Kidney Disease in a Hispanic Population,8929292,K22LM011869,"['Age', 'Albumins', 'Archives', 'Area', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Biological Markers', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Career Transition Award', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'County', 'Creatinine', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Dialysis procedure', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Doctor of Medicine', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'End stage renal failure', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Faculty', 'Fellowship', 'Funding', 'Future', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Health', 'High Prevalence', 'Hispanics', 'Hospitalization', 'Household', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Investigation', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Medical', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mexican', 'Mexico', 'Minority', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Obesity', 'Participant', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Prevalence', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Proteomics', 'Public Health', 'Publications', 'Reaction', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Renal function', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Serum', 'Specimen', 'Stratification', 'Texas', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Translational Research', 'Translations', 'Transplantation', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Visit', 'Weight', 'Work', 'biomedical informatics', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'career', 'cohort', 'cost effective', 'design', 'disorder prevention', 'disorder risk', 'follow-up', 'forest', 'health disparity', 'improved', 'informatics training', 'innovation', 'medically underserved', 'mortality', 'multiple reaction monitoring', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'prospective', 'screening', 'skills', 'tool', 'urinary']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS MED BR GALVESTON,K22,2015,132348,0.013740789293165476
"Dynamic, real-time prediction of alcohol use lapse using mHealth technologies ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Available psychosocial and pharmacological treatments for alcohol use disorder are effective at establishing abstinence. However, the vast majority of patients relapse within a year and often within the first few months following treatment. Patients often fail to detect dynamic changes in their relapse risk. Furthermore, the majority of patients fail to adequately sustain use of skills developed during treatment and/or through continuing care. Well-established theoretical models indicate that alcohol and other drug use lapse risk is a dynamic, non-linear function of both distal, relatively static, patient characteristics and often moment-by- moment dynamic changes in proximal, precipitating risk factors. However, comprehensive, precise assessment of dynamic risk indicators in real-time has not been possible until very recently. Furthermore, innovative methods from predictive analytics have not been applied to the lapse risk prediction problem. The broad goals of this project are to develop, validate, preliminarily optimize, and deliver a dynamic, real-time lapse risk prediction model for forecasting alcohol use among abstinent alcoholics. To pursue these goals, we propose to follow 200 patients for three months during or following completion of standard of care treatment for alcohol use disorder. We will measure well-established distal, static relapse risk indicators on study intake. More importantly, we will use innovative mHealth technology to densely sample dynamic risk indicators including patient physiology, subjective experience, and behavior daily for three months using smartphones and wearable biometric sensors. Data obtained for these static and dynamic risk indicators will provide the foundation to accomplish the following Specific Aims: 1. Assess burden (feasibility, cost, and patient acceptability) to collect innovative, densely sampled risk indicators via smartphone and wearable sensors. 2. Use machine learning methods to develop, train, and validate a real-time quantitative lapse risk prediction signal based on static and dynamic risk indicators. 3. Use innovative Markov decision process models to optimize decisions about if, when, and how to provide additional treatment or support. 4. Integrate and deliver risk prediction and decision model within the Comprehensive Health Enhancement Support System for Addiction (A-CHESS) program. These project aims position A-CHESS to make relapse prevention and recovery support, information, and risk monitoring available to patients continuously. Compared to conventional continuing care, A-CHESS will provide personalized care and be available and implemented during moments of greatest need. Integrated real-time risk prediction holds substantial promise to encourage sustained recovery through adaptive use of these continuing care services.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goals of this project are to develop and deliver a dynamic, real-time model for forecasting alcohol use lapse among abstinent alcoholics. This lapse risk prediction model will be integrated into an existing validated mHealth platform to encourage sustained recovery through adaptive use of continuing care services.            ","Dynamic, real-time prediction of alcohol use lapse using mHealth technologies",8986398,R01AA024391,"['Abstinence', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Behavior', 'Biometry', 'Caring', 'Cellular Phone', 'Characteristics', 'Communities', 'Competence', 'Data', 'Decision Modeling', 'Dependence', 'Distal', 'Drug Use Disorder', 'Drug usage', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Galvanic Skin Response', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Services', 'Heart Rate', 'Intake', 'Intervention', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motivation', 'Nonlinear Dynamics', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmacological Treatment', 'Physiology', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Psychopathology', 'Recovery', 'Relapse', 'Relative (related person)', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Services', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sleep', 'Support System', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Theoretical model', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'United States Department of Veterans Affairs', 'Validation', 'Voice', 'Withdrawal', 'addiction', 'alcohol and other drug', 'alcohol use disorder', 'base', 'clinical application', 'coping', 'cost', 'craving', 'disorder later incidence prevention', 'experience', 'innovation', 'mHealth', 'model development', 'personalized care', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'problem drinker', 'programs', 'psychosocial', 'public health relevance', 'real time model', 'response', 'sensor', 'skills', 'standard of care', 'stressor']",NIAAA,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R01,2015,381818,-0.035999116974761894
"Preventable Hospitalization in Dementia: The Impact of Neuropsychiatric Symptoms DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Older adults with dementia are at increased risk of hospitalization when compared to adults without dementia of similar age and medical comorbidity. The increased risk of hospitalization extends to potentially preventable hospitalization (PPH) for conditions such as a urinary tract infection or asthma exacerbation, suggesting difficulty in outpatient management of patients with dementia. Neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) of dementia such as agitation or delusions likely account for a significant amount of this risk, given their prevalence and potential to cause caregiver distress. While there are effective interventions for patients and caregivers to reduce NPS, the profile of patients that could benefit the most from intervention, therefore reducing their hospitalization risk, is unknown. Through the coordinated program of mentorship, didactics, and research that I propose, I will develop the advanced skills to derive and apply administrative, claims, and clinical encounter data to prospectively identify those patients with dementia at highest risk for hospitalization. Development of this patient-level risk phenotype means that future interventions to reduce hospitalization can then be prospectively matched to the patients most likely to benefit, a development of critical public health importance given both financial and geriatric work force constraints.  Over the next four years, my short-term training goals include: (1) address gaps in my formal research training, specifically: (a) to conduct observational analyses using large-scale claims and administrative data; (b) to derive clinical data from the electronic health record using natural language processing; and (c) to apply advanced methods of data analysis for risk prediction; (2) train in presentations, manuscript writing, and grantsmanship that culminate with a R01 proposal; (3) establish further connections with potential collaborators in the University of Michigan (UM) Pepper Center and broader community of aging researchers, national geriatrics and geriatric psychiatry communities, and the Beeson Scholar community; and (4) engage in leadership development with an emphasis on skills to lead a research team, mentor junior investigators, and communicate findings in research and clinical care settings.  These short-term goals will be paired with research aims that focus on elaborating the PPH risk profile for patients with dementia. Such research objectives can only be achieved when: (1) full clinical characteristics are available for the at-risk (i.e., non-hospitalized) population, includig (2) NPS data, which are rarely captured in standard administrative claims data. These criteria are uniquely met in the Veterans Affairs healthcare system, which has one of the nation's most advanced electronic health records (EHR). Using a national dementia case repository (N=269,565) from which I will draw matched cases (patients with dementia + PPH) and controls (non-hospitalized patients with dementia). Aim 1 will use claims and administrative data to explore patient, treatment, and facility risk factors associated with PPH. Aim 2 will use natural language processing to derive NPS from EHR clinical encounter notes and then characterize the association of NPS with PPH. Using the risk phenotype described in Aims 1 and 2, Aim 3 will develop logistic risk-prediction models to prospectively identify patients with dementia at highest risk for PPH. In subsequent grant proposals I will validate this risk- prediction model in other healthcare systems and prospectively pair the assessment tool with an evidence- based dementia intervention to reduce hospitalization.  My long-term career goals are to: (1) establish myself as independent investigator and national leader in geriatric mental health services research; (2) develop a programmatic line of funded health services research that develops risk-stratification models for late-life mental health and cognitive disorders; (3) translate knowledge from these research endeavors to improve the targeting and impact of future interventions research and health system delivery strategies; and (4) contribute broadly to the care of older adults by training and mentoring future clinical researchers in late-life mental health disorders. I am an Assistant Professor and geriatric psychiatrist at the University of Michigan, where I am also currently completing a MSc in Health and Healthcare Research, which provides an excellent background in health services research for clinicians. With this combination of clinical expertise and foundational training in health services research, I am uniquely qualified to undertake the advanced training activities outlined in this proposal, while UM affords the ideal environment in which to pursue this work. My primary mentor (Helen Kales, MD) and co-mentor (Frederic Blow, PhD) are national leaders in geriatric mental health who have used observational data to answer questions of national significance. My Advisory Panel includes Constantine Lyketsos, MD, MHS, an internationally-recognized expert in NPS and dementia care, and Kenneth Langa, MD, PhD, an internist, former Beeson Scholar, and renowned expert in using survey and secondary data to inform our understanding of dementia. Consultants include David Hanauer, MD, MS, an expert in bioinformatics and natural language processing, and Rodney Hayward, MD, a leader in risk assessment and intervention- targeting. My advisory team paired with resources of Michigan's Pepper Center, CTSA, and multi-disciplinary Institute for Healthcare Policy and Innovation make this the ideal environment in which to complete the proposed training activities. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Although hospitalization can negatively impact patients with dementia, we know very little about the specific risk factors associated with the chance of being hospitalized. It is important to understand what contributes to this risk, such as the behavior changes that accompany dementia, in order to identify those patients and caregivers that could benefit most from an intervention to avoid or reduce hospitalization. Given the rapidly rising numbers of patients with dementia, reducing potentially preventable hospitalization could have an enormous impact on public health.",Preventable Hospitalization in Dementia: The Impact of Neuropsychiatric Symptoms,8911756,K08AG048321,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Aggressive behavior', 'Aging', 'Agitation', 'Antipsychotic Agents', 'Applications Grants', 'Asthma', 'Attention', 'Benzodiazepines', 'Bioinformatics', 'Capsicum', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Code', 'Cognition Disorders', 'Communities', 'Comorbidity', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Delusions', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Distress', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Elderly', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emergency Care', 'Environment', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Geriatric Psychiatry', 'Geriatrics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Policy', 'Health Services Research', 'Health system', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hospitalization', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Institutionalization', 'Internist', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Intervention Trial', 'Kale - dietary', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Light', 'Literature', 'Location', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Logistics', 'Manuscripts', 'Medical', 'Mental Health', 'Mental Health Services', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outpatients', 'Patient Care', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Primary Health Care', 'Provider', 'Psychiatrist', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Public Health', 'Qualifying', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Rural', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sleeplessness', 'Source', 'Stratification', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Translating', 'Universities', 'Urinary tract infection', 'Validation', 'Veterans', 'Visit', 'Work', 'Writing', 'abstracting', 'behavior change', 'career', 'case control', 'clinical care', 'design', 'effective intervention', 'evidence base', 'geriatric mental health', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'medication compliance', 'meetings', 'neuropsychiatry', 'patient population', 'predictive modeling', 'professor', 'programs', 'repository', 'skills', 'statistics', 'tool']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,K08,2015,175103,-0.014382103376942358
"An Evaluation of Novel Domains for Predicting 30-Day Readmission DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services has proposed to financially penalize hospitals that have 30-day readmission rates above the national mean. As a result hospitals caring for disadvantaged populations with more needs might be penalized by current 30-day readmission models that do not include measures of social risk and functional status of the patients served. These are two important variable domains that directly impact a patient's ability to manage their disease. Social risk factors (e.g. living alone, social support, marginal housing, and alcohol abuse) and functional status (e.g. mobility, fall risk) are rarely present in administrative data, which is why so few readmission models include this data. Yet many of these variables are available in electronic health records (EHR) and the advancement of the field of informatics has made the extraction of these data feasible. These variables may improve the discriminative ability of 30-day readmission models which currently explain little of the variation in readmission rates among patients.  We propose to improve 30-day readmission models by extracting measures of social risk and functional status from the EHR using the novel method of Natural Language Processing (NLP). We will combine administrative data (VA and Medicare) and data extracted from the national EHR in the VA for 6000 patients 65 and older in 2011 to improve upon currently available 30-day hospital readmission risk prediction models for congestive heart failure (CHF), acute myocardial infarction (AMI), pneumonia and stroke. We have chosen these conditions because hospital-level 30-day readmission rates for these conditions (CHF, AMI and pneumonia) are currently or will soon be (stroke) publicly reported. Our proposal has two goals: 1) to develop, test and evaluate automated NLP algorithms designed to extract measures of social risk and functional status from the EHR and 2) to understand the impact of these two novel domains on 30-day readmission across four conditions with fundamentally different post-discharge hospital course and disease trajectories.  We propose a paradigm shift in the understanding and obtainment of factors predictive of 30-day readmission. Our overarching hypothesis is that social risk factors and functional status which directly influence a patient's self-management ability are critical factors predictive of 30-day readmission, can be extracted from the EHR, and should be included in risk prediction models. The development of better risk prediction models will allow the identification of patients at highest risk of readmission and facilitate post-discharge interventions in their care. In addition, if social risk factors and functional status are criticalin explaining variation in 30-day readmission rates, then hospitals that care for patients with a higher burden of social risk and functional needs may be inappropriately penalized by current risk predictions models that lack these measures. Also, as more hospitals adopt EHRs, we need to study more advanced technologies such as automated NLP as tools to efficiently extract information and to inform health systems about the characteristics of the patients they serve. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: About a fifth of all Medicare patients are readmitted within 30 days of hospital discharge, potentially exposing the patients and their families to distress and unnecessary costs. An improved understanding of who is at highest risk of readmission will allow hospitals to efficiently intervene in the care of patients who may benefit the most from post-discharge interventions.",An Evaluation of Novel Domains for Predicting 30-Day Readmission,8854133,R01HL116522,"['Accounting', 'Acute myocardial infarction', 'Adopted', 'Affect', 'Alcohol abuse', 'Algorithm Design', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical Data', 'Congestive Heart Failure', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disadvantaged', 'Disease', 'Distress', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Evaluation', 'Family', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Status', 'Health system', 'Hospitals', 'Housing', 'Human', 'Incentives', 'Informatics', 'Intervention', 'Length of Stay', 'Life', 'Measures', 'Medicare', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pneumonia', 'Population', 'Predictive Factor', 'Publishing', 'Reporting', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Self Management', 'Severity of illness', 'Social support', 'Stroke', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'United States Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services', 'Variant', 'Veterans', 'cost', 'demographics', 'design', 'fall risk', 'falls', 'functional status', 'health administration', 'high risk', 'high risk behavior', 'hospital patient care', 'hospital readmission', 'improved', 'marginally housed', 'mortality', 'novel', 'payment', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'social', 'tool']",NHLBI,NORTHERN CALIFORNIA INSTITUTE/RES/EDU,R01,2015,706251,0.005947095173688992
"Geometric Surrogates for Clinical Management of Abdominal Aortic Aneurysms ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal will investigate the following hypothesis: that the quantification of geometric surrogates, which predict the ensuing peak wall rupture risk index (PWRRI), will provide an improved estimate of aneurysm rupture risk compared to the clinical standard of maximum aneurysm diameter. We thus propose the highly innovative use of both radiological and non-radiological clinical imaging to develop a computational tool that can assess AAA risk of rupture with greater accuracy than the current clinical standard. Such a tool will allow the accurate quantification of individual AAA geometry to achieve the main goal of the study, which is to identify the patient-specific AAA geometry characteristics that are surrogates for patient-specific PWRRI. In the proposed approach, we will first compute a truly individualized PWRRI based on an innovative method called image-based Vascular Mechanical Characterization technology (iV-MeCh). The geometry characteristics highly correlated with PWRRI will be considered the surrogates of this biomechanics-based index. A second phase of the study will be the validation of the surrogates with actual clinical outcomes, which will yield the accurate predictors of rupture. This approach, devoid of complex finite element modeling and based on a fast, nearly automated computational tool for geometry quantification, would provide an exceptional rationale for the need for surgical intervention and be of major clinical significance. Therefore, the following specific aims are to be completed during the project period to address the aforementioned hypothesis: (1) Validate iV-MeCh for estimating patient-specific spatio-temporal AAA wall stress; (2) Calculate individual PWRRI using iV-MeCh for high and low risk of rupture AAA; (3) Identify the individual geometry characteristics that are surrogates of PWRRI; and (4) Assess the clinical significance of geometric surrogates for the prediction of AAA rupture risk. The primary outcome of this research will be the ability to disambiguate or demystify rupture risk in AAA for which the standard of care (maximum diameter) is not an accurate metric for assessing their at-risk condition. The geometric surrogates of PWRRI are hypothesized to reduce false positives and false negatives compared to the conventional maximum diameter cut-off for recommending elective repair. In addition, PWRRI is predicted by means of a new, novel technique (iV-MeCh), which estimates wall stress in aneurysms by means of non-radiological clinical imaging and without the use of constitutive soft tissue mechanics.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This award will enable the validation of computational tools for non-invasively predicting the at-risk condition of patients with abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) based on the assessment of aneurysm geometry. This research is expected to impact the clinical management of AAA disease, as well as the pre-surgical planning capabilities of vascular and endovascular aneurysm repair.            ",Geometric Surrogates for Clinical Management of Abdominal Aortic Aneurysms,8888896,R01HL121293,"['Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm', 'Address', 'Aneurysm', 'Award', 'Biomechanics', 'Blood Vessels', 'Caliber', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Research', 'Complex', 'Consent', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Elements', 'Foundations', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Property', 'Records', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Rupture', 'Ruptured Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm', 'Ruptured Aneurysm', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Staging', 'Stress', 'Surgeon', 'Surveillance Program', 'Survival Rate', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Validation', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'clinically significant', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'high risk', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'novel', 'pressure', 'primary outcome', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'radiologist', 'repaired', 'soft tissue', 'standard of care', 'tool']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS SAN ANTONIO,R01,2015,514370,0.018771960872271686
"Novel Tree-based Statistical Methods for Cancer Risk Prediction     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The contradiction of early cancer detection is that while some benefit others receive a detrimental diagnosis. A definitive example is mammography and ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), a noninvasive breast cancer. DCIS, which most frequently presents as a non-palpable lesion, was rarely detected before the advent of modern mammography. Since 1983 there has been a 290% increase in DCIS incidence in women under 50 and 500% in those over 50. Given that only 5-10% of DCIS cases progress to invasive cancer with a 10-year mortality rate of 1-2%, DCIS experts suggest breast conservation for the majority of patients. However, these women continue to be overtreated with mastectomy and radiation, at rates comparable to those with invasive cancer. The inability to discern those at low vs. high risk is due in part to non-reproducible study results as well as inadequate statistical methods for risk prediction and validation.  We have collected a population-based DCIS cohort with the goal of delineating those women least likely to recur with invasive cancer and, hence, appropriate candidates for less aggressive treatments. Recently we established risk indices and published the corresponding absolute risk estimates for type of recurrence. However, two features of the study design, namely the presence of competing risks and the use of a stratified case-cohort design, constrained us to using crude empirical methods for analysis and left us unable to validate the clinical utility of our models. The overarching goal of this proposal is to develop a unified, principled statistical framework for building, selecting, and evaluating clinically relevant risk indices, permitting refinement and validation of existing risk prediction models in our DCIS study as well as beyond.  We face multiple challenges including how to objectively build risk indices with relevant variables; how to estimate the corresponding risks (competing or not) in various subsample study designs; and, how to validate the resulting risk prediction models. Recently, we developed partDSA, a tree-based method which affords tremendous flexibility in building predictive models and provides an ideal foundation for developing a clinician- friendly tool for accurate stratification and risk prediction. In its curret form, partDSA is unable to estimate absolute risk in the presence of competing risks accounting for subsample study designs. Here we extend partDSA for such clinically relevant scenarios (Aim 1). We also propose aggregate learning for risk prediction to increase prediction accuracy and subsequently to build more stable but easily interpretable risk models (Aim 2). Finally, we propose the necessary methods for validating the resulting models (Aim 3).  Our proposal has two immediate public health benefits: first, these novel statistical methods will result in a clinician-friendly, publicly available tool for accurate risk prediction, stratification and validaion in numerous clinical settings; second, current DCIS risk models will be refined and validated with the expectation of better delineating those at low risk, hence strong candidates for conservative treatments including active surveillance.          Our proposal has two public health components: first, our novel statistical methods will provide a clinician- friendly, publicly available tool for accurate isk prediction, stratification and validation in numerous clinical settings; second, current ductal carcinoma in situ risk models will be refined and validated, helping facilitate the decision-making process faced by patients and their clinicians.

"Genetic Susceptibility and Risk Model for Pancreatic Cancer DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Pancreatic cancer (PanC) is the fourth leading cause of cancer-related death for both men and women in the U.S. Better understanding of the etiology and developing risk prediction models for early detection and prevention are urgently needed for this rapidly fatal disease. The majority of PanC are caused by the interplay of both genetic and environmental factors. Known risk factors for PanC include cigarette smoking, obesity, long-term type II diabetes, and family history. In addition, our previous case-control study has shown that excess body mass index (BMI) in young adulthood confers a higher risk of PanC than weight gain at later age. Recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified several chromosomal regions and genes in association with risk of PanC (PanScan). Our pathway analyses of the PanScan GWAS data have uncovered several novel biological pathways associated with the risk for PanC. However, it remains unknown how environmental or host risk factors modify the association between genetic factors and the PanC risk, which knowledge is critical to better understanding of the etiology and developing a risk prediction model and early intervention strategies for PanC. The goal of this project is to identify gene-environment interactions and develop and validate a risk prediction model including both common and rare genetic variants using the PanScan GWAS data and the exposure information of over 2,200 case-control pairs and an ongoing ExomeChip-based study of PanC genotyping both common SNPs and >240,000 rare functional exonic variants in over 4,100 cases and 4,700 controls from six case-control studies in the Pancreatic Cancer Case Control Consortium (PanC4) and a nested case-control study from Europe (EPIC). We will validate the absolute risk prediction model in two large prospective cohorts: the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) cohort of 15,000 individuals and the Kaiser Permanente cohort of 100,000 individuals. We will also develop novel statistical methods to identify genes modifying the association between changing BMI at different age periods and PanC risk using the unique dataset from a case-control study of PanC conducted at MD Anderson Cancer Center. Our proposed project hinges on novel integration of GWAS, ExomeChip, exposure data of a large number of PanC cases and controls, recently developed powerful statistical methods and analysis strategies for detecting genome-wide gene/pathway-environment interactions and polygenic approaches to genetic risk prediction. The work proposed here is expected not only to advance our understanding of the etiology of PanC and delineate how genes and lifestyle or host factors modify the risk of PanC, but also to greatly facilitate identification of high-risk individuals, and thus, contribute to early detection, improved survival and prevention of PanC. The novel statistical methods developed here are also applicable to other cancers and complex disease, and we will develop user-friendly software packages for public use. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Over 43,900 new cases of pancreatic cancer are expected to occur in the US in 2012, almost all rapidly fatal. This project will not only advance our understanding of the etiology of pancreatic cancer and delineate how genes and lifestyle or host factors modify the risk of pancreatic cancer, but also will facilitate identification of high-risk individuals, and thus, contribute to early detection, prevention, and improved survival of pancreatic cancer.

"Metabolomics and risk of Parkinson's Disease ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Parkinson disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease in the United States and affects over one million Americans; this number is growing due to population aging. Current treatments do not prevent the disease progression that ultimately results in severe disability. There is thus a compelling need to develop neuroprotective treatments. Because at the time of the clinical diagnosis of PD there is already substantial neuronal loss, such treatments should ideally be initiated earlier. Aims of the proposed investigation are to implement and validate a novel metabolomic approach for the identification of early changes in peripheral blood of individuals with preclinical or premotor PD. The metabolomic results will be integrated with detailed and validated information on risk factors for PD, which has been collected prospectively and periodically updated. We expect by this means to identify new clues to the etiology of PD and to identify a metabolomic signature of PD that could contribute to an early diagnosis. To achieve these goals, we will take advantage of data and blood samples collected from over 80,000 participants in three large ongoing cohorts, the Nurses' Health Study (NHS), the Health Professional Follow-up Study (HPFS), and the Cancer Prevention Study-II Nutrition, who have been followed for over 25 years for incident Parkinson disease. We expect to include a total of 805 incident cases of PD that will be matched to 805 controls, using a nested case-control design.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Parkinson disease is a chronic progressive disease for which there is no cure - the loss of brain cells that leads to disability develops insidiously over many years, and by the time the disease is diagnosed it is already extensive and irreversible. To identify Parkinson disease years before it becomes clinically manifest, we are proposing a novel approach that will take advantage of the peripheral blood and detailed lifestyle and medical information collected from over 80,000 individuals who were followed for up to 25 years. By comparing the blood levels of hundreds of compounds between the blood of individuals who developed Parkinson disease and the blood of individuals of the same age and sex who remained healthy, we expect to make novel discoveries on the etiology of Parkinson disease and to be able to develop a method for the early identification of Parkinson disease in other populations.            ",Metabolomics and risk of Parkinson's Disease,8963132,R01NS089619,"['Affect', 'Age', 'Alanine', 'American', 'Archives', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood specimen', 'Branched-Chain Amino Acids', 'Caffeine', 'Cancer Prevention Study II', 'Choline', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Coffee', 'Cohort Studies', 'Confounding Factors (Epidemiology)', 'Consumption', 'Controlled Study', 'Creatine', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diet', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Failure', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Glutamates', 'Goals', 'Health Professional', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Insulin Resistance', 'Investigation', 'Life Style', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Medical History', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Pathway', 'Methods', 'Motor', 'National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke', 'Nature', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Nurses&apos', ' Health Study', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Physical activity', 'Plasma', 'Population', 'Progressive Disease', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Sex Characteristics', 'Smoking', 'Specificity', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Update', 'Urate', 'Validation', 'Woman', 'Work', 'acylcarnitine', 'aging population', 'base', 'brain cell', 'cancer prevention', 'case control', 'cigarette smoking', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'cohort', 'design', 'diabetes risk', 'disability', 'disorder risk', 'follow-up', 'insight', 'interest', 'men', 'metabolomics', 'mitochondrial dysfunction', 'neuron loss', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'nutrition', 'peripheral blood', 'pre-clinical', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'sex', 'tool']",NINDS,HARVARD SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH,R01,2015,593802,0.004862548472770854
"Elective Induction of Labor and Pregnancy Outcomes DESCRIPTION (provided by investigator): Background and goals: Each year in the US, up to 490,000 pregnant women undergo elective induction, an intervention to bring on labor without a medical reason. Whether this causes risks to the woman or fetus is unclear. Only one recent clinical trial studied elective induction before 41 weeks of fetal gestation, and it found no difference in outcomes compared to letting the pregnancy continue (expectant management). Observational studies have found more cesarean delivery after induction, but most compared induction to spontaneous labor at the same gestational age, which is not the genuine clinical alternative. Instead, elective induction should be compared to the true alternative, expectant management. Most studies were too small to study uncommon but important outcomes, and none looked at whether risks differ by the mother's race/ethnicity or obesity. Our goal is to compare outcomes for elective induction at 38, 39 or 40 weeks' gestation versus expectant management, to help pregnant women and their providers make more informed decisions. Methods: A multiphase retrospective study of births from 2001 to 2011 will be conducted in two integrated health care systems. In Phase 1, the eligible population (206,000 singleton births) will be identified and classified by their apparent induction and outcome status based on electronic health plan and birth certificate data. In Phase 2, we will conduct 8000 brief medical record reviews to determine true exposure status (elective induction vs. expectant management). In Phase 3, we will review 3500 records in depth for true outcome status and risk factors. Phases 2 and 3 will oversample women with elective induction or rare outcomes, improving our power to address these specific aims: Aim 1: Compare the risk of the following outcomes after elective induction at 38, 39 or 40 weeks' gestation versus expectant management: cesarean delivery, postpartum hemorrhage, chorioamnionitis, neonatal intensive care unit stay, shoulder dystocia, low Apgar score, stillbirth, and neonatal death; and Aim 2: Examine how risks vary by the mother's race/ethnicity, parity, and pre-pregnancy obesity. Secondary analyses will develop an algorithm to more accurately identify elective inductions from electronic data. Impact: This research will compare elective labor induction at 38, 39 or 40 weeks' gestation to expectant management to provide new information about its risks or benefits for the mother and fetus. Our results could immediately affect clinical practice by helping women and providers make more informed choices together. They will also provide a solid foundation for practice guidelines and policy making. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Many pregnant women undergo elective induction (bringing on labor without a medical reason), but there is little good information about whether this is risk for the mother or fetus. Few studies have compared elective induction to the true alternative, letting the pregnancy continue, with birth at a later date; and it is not known whether risks diffe by the mother's race/ethnicity or obesity. The study would fill these critical knowledge gaps, and findings could immediately shape clinical practice.",Elective Induction of Labor and Pregnancy Outcomes,8887237,R01HD071986,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Apgar Score', 'Birth', 'Birth Certificates', 'California', 'Childbirth', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Discipline of obstetrics', 'Dystocia', 'Electronics', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Event', 'Fetus', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Gestational Age', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Planning', 'Health Services Research', 'Infant Health', 'Integrated Health Care Systems', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Medical', 'Medical Records', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Mothers', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neonatal', 'Neonatal Intensive Care Units', 'Obesity', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Phase', 'Physician&apos', 's Practice Patterns', 'Policy Making', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Postpartum Hemorrhage', 'Practice Guidelines', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Outcome', 'Pregnant Women', 'Provider', 'Race', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk', 'Risk Estimate', 'Risk Factors', 'Shapes', 'Shoulder', 'Solid', 'System', 'Uncertainty', 'Washington', 'Wing', 'Woman', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'clinically relevant', 'design', 'electronic data', 'fetal', 'health care delivery', 'improved', 'intraamniotic infection', 'neonatal death', 'parity', 'pregnant', 'stillbirth', 'tool', 'trend']",NICHD,KAISER FOUNDATION HEALTH PLAN OF WASHINGTON,R01,2015,769163,0.009292373611592492
"Forecasting pulmonary inflammation from in vitro assay results for nanoparticles ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The rapidly developing field of nanotechnology shows promise by allowing designers to specifically select unique combinations of material properties as needed increasing the effectiveness of applications in medicine, coatings, lubrication, semiconductors, composites, and many others. These materials with their unique combinations of properties on exposure to humans may result in unanticipated hazards, however, putting workers in nanotechnology-related industries at risk. Traditional animal testing is expensive and too slow to evaluate potential risks for the current pace of new nanomaterial development. Both technology developers and regulators need more rapid methods to evaluate new nanomaterial configurations for their risk potential. Much hope is placed in high-throughput in vitro screening assays, but the relevance of these results to the potential for human disease or even the observed toxic effects in animal exposures is unclear. Some research has proposed Quantitative Structure Activity Relationships (QSARs) to predict in vitro nanomaterial toxicity in a few specific assays, but the applicability of these models to a wider group of materials, alternative in vitro assays, or in vivo toxicity has not been explored. If the primary exposure pathway for workers in the near term is inhalation, which in vitro assays will provide the most reliable risk information for that scenario? Two recently available data sources will permit this study to investigate this question: the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) ToxCast data for nanomaterials and the Nanomaterial Pulmonary Toxicity Database (NTDB), a collection of published peer reviewed studies observing pulmonary inflammation in rodents upon exposures to nanomaterials. This study will pursue the following specific aims: (1.) identify combinations of in vitro assay results that can reliably forecast the results of pulmonary inflammation results in rodents; (2.) evaluate whether existing proposed QSARs for nanomaterial toxicity apply to a wider array of in vitro toxicity assays; and (3.) evaluate whether existing proposed QSARs for nanomaterial toxicity apply to in vivo pulmonary inflammation results. This study will employ machine learning methods to cluster similar nanomaterials between the various in vitro and in vivo results, and to identify combinations of in vitro assays that rank order the toxicity of nanomaterials most similarly to pulmonary inflammation results in rodents considering also how changes in specific chemical and physical particle properties exacerbate or mitigate observed toxicity. This study addresses documented research needs in the National Occupational Research Agenda (NORA) cross- sector Nanotechnology program including specific goals in the Human Health and Informatics categories. Implementation complies with the Research to Practice (r2p) Initiative in its formulation, design, and implementation plan including industry an public outreach. The insight generated by this study will improve nanomaterial risk screening capabilities and focus attention and effort on those measurements and techniques proven to be most effective and reliable enabling better management and control of the risks faced by workers.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Although toxicity risk information for nanoparticles is accumulating rapidly, the development of new nanomaterial configurations is proceeding too fast for our best risk assessment tools (i.e. animal testing) to keep up. The new availability of two large databases of in vitro assay results and pulmonary inflammation results in rodents will permit this study to investigate which in vitro assays provide the most predictive information about the results from in vivo exposures, and thus speed up the risk screening process for nanomaterials. The results of this study will have important implications for more quickly identifying new nanomaterial-related risks to workers.            ",Forecasting pulmonary inflammation from in vitro assay results for nanoparticles,8953935,R03OH010956,[' '],NIOSH,PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIVERSITY-UNIV PARK,R03,2015,66904,-0.001872217429227542
"Identifying Huntington's disease markers by modern statistical learning methods.     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Designing an efficient Huntington's disease (HD) early intervention clinical trial for individuals who have an expanded CAG repeats in the huntingtin gene requires identifying and combining clinical, biological, cognitive, and brain imaging markers to accurately distinguish among subjects who will have a diagnosis during a given intervention period and those who will not, and to track early changes in the disease course. The goal of this project is to identify sensitive biomarkers for HD risk stratification, indexing disease progression, and developing clinical trial endpoints. The proposal directly adheres to ""2P's"" of the NIH New Strategic Vision of the ""4P's"" of Medicine: they will offer promising ways to predict when the disease will develop; and increase the capacity to personalize early intervention based on the informative patient-specific markers our models identify. Combining biomarkers to predict HD onset and progression is an essential step in a continuum of research for development of disease-modifying therapies. Composite markers and their risk profiles created from our model will offer quantitative way to monitor and compare potential interventions. Evidence collected from these comparisons will advance the development of efficacy studies in premanifest HD, where neuroprotective treatments would be most beneficial. We develop and apply a series of cutting-edge statistical learning methods based on support vector machine (SVM), variable selection, and dimension reduction to achieve these goals. These modern statistical methods designed for correlated big data have quickly emerged as among the most successful tools for hypothesis generation, classification and prediction in biomedical studies. However, they have not been introduced to HD biomarker research. In aim 1, using counting process, we propose SVM to handle time-to-event outcomes (e.g., time-to-HD-diagnosis) to combine markers into risk scores to discriminate subjects who will experience HD onset in the immediate future from those who will not,  based on their personalized features. Although SVM is well studied for binary outcomes, it is far less explored for time-to-event outcomes. We fill this gap in knowledge. In aim 2, we propose new learning methods for longitudinal outcomes to combine markers that modify the course of HD signs to monitor disease process and distinguish subjects with rapid progression from those with slower progression. In aim 3, we propose to use novel and robust performance measures to compare derived combined markers with existing disease indices and key markers. These aims will fundamentally advance our understanding of markers linked to HD onset and progression. The creation of statistical models for composite markers and risk profiles is especially useful in: (1) offering quantitative ways to monitor and compare potential interventions, and (2) improving power of efficacy studies targeted at premanifest individuals by narrowing the predictive interval which leads to future clinical trials that can be made shorter with fewer subjects. Finally, our improved predictions of HD onset and progression will provide more informative genetic counseling sessions for pre-symptomatic subjects at risk of HD.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The goal of Huntington's disease (HD) research is to develop experimental therapeutics to delay onset or slow disease progression, and to provide different treatment regimens at each disease stage. To meet this goal, this proposal develops and applies a series of advanced statistical approaches to rank and combine clinical, behavioral, and brain imaging markers to predict HD diagnosis in premanifest subjects during a given time period and to measure disease progression. The creation of model for composite markers and risk profiles is useful in offering quantitative ways to monitor and compare interventions and powering clinical trials for premanifest HD individuals.            ",Identifying Huntington's disease markers by modern statistical learning methods.,8721037,U01NS082062,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Advanced Development', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain imaging', 'CAG repeat', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease Marker', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Intervention', 'Early intervention trials', 'Event', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic Counseling', 'Genetic screening method', 'Goals', 'Huntington Disease', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motor', 'Motor Manifestations', 'Mutation', 'Odds Ratio', 'Onset of illness', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Penetrance', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'ROC Curve', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Marker', 'Series', 'Staging', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Stratification', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Treatment Protocols', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vision', 'Work', 'affection', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'design', 'disease diagnosis', 'disorder risk', 'experience', 'functional outcomes', 'hazard', 'high risk', 'human Huntingtin protein', 'improved', 'indexing', 'interest', 'meetings', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'research and development', 'tool']",NINDS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,U01,2014,359539,-0.002541221479707385
"Predictive Model of Chronic Kidney Disease in a Hispanic Population     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This career transition award will provide the applicant with protected research time to develop an independent research career in biomedical informatics. Dr. Starkey received his M.D. in 2003 from UT Southwestern, completed the NLM Biomedical Informatics Training Program post-doctoral fellowship in 2011 and earned a Ph.D. focusing on clinical informatics from the Clinical Sciences Degree Program at the University of Texas Medical Branch (UTMB) at Galveston in 2012. Dr. Starkey accepted a faculty position at the Institute for Translational Sciences at UTMB that is currently supporting his transition to independent investigator. Dr. Starkey will utilize the career transition award for novel applications of advanced machine learning methods to create predictive models of disease. Predictive models of disease allow for the stratification of risk and prevention of disease and have been successfully implemented in the assessment of cardiovascular disease risk. Predictive models of chronic kidney disease (CKD) are an active area of research since CKD is a risk factor for all-cause mortality, cardiovascular death and end-stage renal disease. However, there is not a single predictive model of CKD created for application to Hispanics and the external validity of existing models is poor. The objective of this project is to create predictive models of chronic kidney disease in a Hispanic population and quantify biomarkers of chronic kidney disease using multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) proteomics in this minority population. MRM proteomics will utilize the UTMB Novel Methodologies core and its array of resources to create an inter-institutional collaboration. Heterogeneous ensemble machine learning methods will be used to create the predictive model of chronic kidney disease in the Cameron County Hispanic Cohort (CCHC). Established in 2004, the CCHC is a random population sample in Brownsville, Texas created to evaluate the determinants of health in a US/Mexico border population that is primarily of Hispanic ethnicity. The CCHC has an extremely high prevalence of obesity and diabetes at 49.7% and 30.3%, respectively. Both obesity and diabetes are independent risk factors for the development of CKD and represent significant health disparities in the Hispanic population. Archived serum samples of CCHC participants and the CCHC database will be utilized to complete the following aims: 1) Create predictive models of CKD in a Hispanic population 2) Refine the predictive models by including clinical laboratory data and a selective reaction monitoring mass spectrometry panel of biomarkers. At the completion of this project, predictive models of CKD applicable to a Hispanic population will be created and MRM proteomics will demonstrate utility of biomarkers identified in other populations. The application of the results will be used to create clinical tools for CKD risk and guide future studies in this Hispanic population with health disparities. Importantly, it will provide a career transition for D. Starkey to demonstrate the knowledge gained during his training that results in impactful research and publications.              PROJECT NARRATIVE:  The proposed research is relevant to public health because it allows stratification of chronic kidney disease risk and quantifies biomarkers of chronic kidney disease in the Hispanic minority whom has significant health disparities with regard to kidney disease. The translation of selective reaction monitoring of biomarkers and development of heterogeneous ensemble machine learning methods for application to the prediction of chronic kidney disease in a minority population supports the NLM mission.",Predictive Model of Chronic Kidney Disease in a Hispanic Population,8700987,K22LM011869,"['Age', 'Albumins', 'Archives', 'Area', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Biological Markers', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Career Transition Award', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'County', 'Creatinine', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Dialysis procedure', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Doctor of Medicine', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'End stage renal failure', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Faculty', 'Fellowship', 'Funding', 'Future', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Health', 'High Prevalence', 'Hispanics', 'Hospitalization', 'Household', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Investigation', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Medical', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mexican', 'Mexico', 'Minority', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Obesity', 'Participant', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Prevalence', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Proteomics', 'Public Health', 'Publications', 'Reaction', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Renal function', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Serum', 'Specimen', 'Stratification', 'Texas', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Translational Research', 'Translations', 'Transplantation', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Visit', 'Weight', 'Work', 'biomedical informatics', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'career', 'cohort', 'cost effective', 'design', 'disorder prevention', 'disorder risk', 'follow-up', 'forest', 'health disparity', 'improved', 'informatics training', 'innovation', 'medically underserved', 'mortality', 'multiple reaction monitoring', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'prospective', 'screening', 'skills', 'tool', 'urinary']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS MED BR GALVESTON,K22,2014,132121,0.013740789293165476
"Predicting In-hospital Cardiac Arrest Using Electronic Health Record Data     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In-hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA) is a significant public health problem, afflicting over 200,000 patients in the United States annually with a mortality rate of approximately 80%. The majority of these patients show signs of clinical deterioration in the hours before the event. This has led to the development of vital sign-based early warning scores designed to detect high-risk patients before IHCA to trigger life-saving interventions. However, the vast majority of these risk scores were created subjectively in individual hospitals and have shown limited accuracy for detecting adverse outcomes. Developing an accurate risk score to detect patients at highest risk of IHCA is essential to decreasing preventable in-hospital death. In my prior work, I completed several studies investigating the accuracy of vital signs for predicting IHCA. These studies, previous literature, and my preliminary data have resulted in the following conclusions: 1) statistically developed risk scores are more accurate than previously published risk scores, 2) multicenter data is needed to create the most accurate and generalizable risk score, 3) additional data, such as laboratory results, will likely improve the accuracy of risk scores, and 4) a cutting-edge method for developing prediction models, called machine learning, may result in more accurate risk scores. Importantly, significant improvement in accuracy leads to better identification of patients at highest risk of IHCA and decreased resource utilization. Therefore, in this grant proposal I aim to develop and validate IHCA prediction models using different statistical techniques in a multicenter database and then estimate the impact of the most accurate risk score using simulation studies. I will do this by firt developing prediction models using classic survival analysis methods (Aim 1a) and machine learning methods, such as neural networks and decision trees (Aim 1b). Then, I will compare the models I develop to the most accurate previously published risk scores in Aim 2. Finally, I will investigate the impact of the most accurate model from Aim 2 on patient outcomes using simulation modeling (Aim 3). Completion of this proposal will result in a validated IHCA risk score that can be implemented in the electronic health record to trigger life- saving interventions to decrease preventable in-hospital death. In addition, this career development award will provide critical data to inform future R01-level awards, including a clinical trial to investigate he impact of the developed prediction model on patient outcomes. I will complete this project under the direct supervision of my mentor (Dr. David Meltzer), co-mentor (Dr. Dana Edelson), and the rest of my advisory team (Drs. Jesse Hall, Robert Gibbons, and Michael Kattan). Together, this multidisciplinary team brings nationally renowned expertise in in-hospital cardiac arrest, outcomes research, critical care, and clinical prediction modeling. In addition, they serve as Chairs of the Section of Hospital Medicine (Dr. Meltzer), Section of Pulmonary and Critical Care (Dr. Hall), and Quantitative Health Sciences at the Cleveland Clinic (Dr. Kattan), and Directors of the Center for Health and the Social Sciences (Dr. Meltzer), Center for Health Statistics (Dr. Gibbons), and Clinical Research for the Emergency Resuscitation Center (Dr. Edelson). The mentorship, expertise, and resources that they provide will ensure my success as I grow into an independent physician-scientist. My career goal is to become an independent critical care outcomes researcher with a focus on developing prediction models for clinical deterioration that will improve patient outcomes. To accomplish this long-term goal, I have three short-term goals: (1) to gain expertise in the development and implementation of clinical prediction models, (2) to create an IHCA prediction model that will identify high-risk patients on the wards to trigger life-saving interventions, and (3) to gain expertise in simulation modeling in order to study the impact of the developed prediction model. To accomplish these goals, I will build upon the foundation I developed when earning my Master's Degree in Public Health and during my initial training in the PhD program in the Department of Health Studies. Although my training to date has provided me with a strong background in epidemiology and biostatistics, further advanced training in biostatistics is crucial for my development into a successful independent researcher. An integrated program of didactic coursework, seminars, research activities, and conference participation will span the duration of the award. By accomplishing my three short- term goals, I will develop unique skills that will allow me to become a successful independent researcher. Specifically, the expertise I will gain in prediction model development, implementation, and simulation modeling can be applied not only to IHCA research but also to other areas of critical care medicine. In addition, completion of these goals will result in a validated IHCA prediction model that I will study in future implementation and cost-effectiveness studies and will serve as a basis for future R01-level grant submissions.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Over 200,000 in-hospital cardiac arrests occur in the United States each year, and studies suggest that many of these events may be preventable if the clinical warning signs can be identified and acted upon quickly. However, the vast majority of tools used to identify patients at high risk of cardiac arrest were created subjectively and have limited accuracy. Development of a statistically derived risk tool is essential to detect at- risk patients accurately and early in order to provide the best opportunity to improve patient outcomes and reduce preventable in-hospital death.            ",Predicting In-hospital Cardiac Arrest Using Electronic Health Record Data,8617518,K08HL121080,"['Adult', 'Applications Grants', 'Area', 'Award', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Biometry', 'Brain', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Categories', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complex', 'Critical Care', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Trees', 'Deterioration', 'Development', 'Diastolic blood pressure', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emergency Situation', 'Ensure', 'Epidemiology', 'Event', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Health Sciences', 'Heart Arrest', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Hylobates Genus', 'Individual', 'Intensive Care', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Laboratories', 'Life', 'Literature', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Master&apos', 's Degree', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Patient Discharge', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Procedures', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Resuscitation', 'Risk', 'Scientist', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Social Sciences', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Supervision', 'Survival Analysis', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Uncertainty', 'United States', 'Update', 'Validation', 'Work', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'career', 'cost effectiveness', 'design', 'evidence base', 'high risk', 'improved', 'model development', 'models and simulation', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'simulation', 'skills', 'statistics', 'success', 'symposium', 'tool', 'ward']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,K08,2014,129546,-0.0007106302817135989
"Preventable Hospitalization in Dementia: The Impact of Neuropsychiatric Symptoms     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Older adults with dementia are at increased risk of hospitalization when compared to adults without dementia of similar age and medical comorbidity. The increased risk of hospitalization extends to potentially preventable hospitalization (PPH) for conditions such as a urinary tract infection or asthma exacerbation, suggesting difficulty in outpatient management of patients with dementia. Neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) of dementia such as agitation or delusions likely account for a significant amount of this risk, given their prevalence and potential to cause caregiver distress. While there are effective interventions for patients and caregivers to reduce NPS, the profile of patients that could benefit the most from intervention, therefore reducing their hospitalization risk, is unknown. Through the coordinated program of mentorship, didactics, and research that I propose, I will develop the advanced skills to derive and apply administrative, claims, and clinical encounter data to prospectively identify those patients with dementia at highest risk for hospitalization. Development of this patient-level risk phenotype means that future interventions to reduce hospitalization can then be prospectively matched to the patients most likely to benefit, a development of critical public health importance given both financial and geriatric work force constraints.  Over the next four years, my short-term training goals include: (1) address gaps in my formal research training, specifically: (a) to conduct observational analyses using large-scale claims and administrative data; (b) to derive clinical data from the electronic health record using natural language processing; and (c) to apply advanced methods of data analysis for risk prediction; (2) train in presentations, manuscript writing, and grantsmanship that culminate with a R01 proposal; (3) establish further connections with potential collaborators in the University of Michigan (UM) Pepper Center and broader community of aging researchers, national geriatrics and geriatric psychiatry communities, and the Beeson Scholar community; and (4) engage in leadership development with an emphasis on skills to lead a research team, mentor junior investigators, and communicate findings in research and clinical care settings.  These short-term goals will be paired with research aims that focus on elaborating the PPH risk profile for patients with dementia. Such research objectives can only be achieved when: (1) full clinical characteristics are available for the at-risk (i.e., non-hospitalized) population, includig (2) NPS data, which are rarely captured in standard administrative claims data. These criteria are uniquely met in the Veterans Affairs healthcare system, which has one of the nation's most advanced electronic health records (EHR). Using a national dementia case repository (N=269,565) from which I will draw matched cases (patients with dementia + PPH) and controls (non-hospitalized patients with dementia). Aim 1 will use claims and administrative data to explore patient, treatment, and facility risk factors associated with PPH. Aim 2 will use natural language processing to derive NPS from EHR clinical encounter notes and then characterize the association of NPS with PPH. Using the risk phenotype described in Aims 1 and 2, Aim 3 will develop logistic risk-prediction models to prospectively identify patients with dementia at highest risk for PPH. In subsequent grant proposals I will validate this risk- prediction model in other healthcare systems and prospectively pair the assessment tool with an evidence- based dementia intervention to reduce hospitalization.  My long-term career goals are to: (1) establish myself as independent investigator and national leader in geriatric mental health services research; (2) develop a programmatic line of funded health services research that develops risk-stratification models for late-life mental health and cognitive disorders; (3) translate knowledge from these research endeavors to improve the targeting and impact of future interventions research and health system delivery strategies; and (4) contribute broadly to the care of older adults by training and mentoring future clinical researchers in late-life mental health disorders. I am an Assistant Professor and geriatric psychiatrist at the University of Michigan, where I am also currently completing a MSc in Health and Healthcare Research, which provides an excellent background in health services research for clinicians. With this combination of clinical expertise and foundational training in health services research, I am uniquely qualified to undertake the advanced training activities outlined in this proposal, while UM affords the ideal environment in which to pursue this work. My primary mentor (Helen Kales, MD) and co-mentor (Frederic Blow, PhD) are national leaders in geriatric mental health who have used observational data to answer questions of national significance. My Advisory Panel includes Constantine Lyketsos, MD, MHS, an internationally-recognized expert in NPS and dementia care, and Kenneth Langa, MD, PhD, an internist, former Beeson Scholar, and renowned expert in using survey and secondary data to inform our understanding of dementia. Consultants include David Hanauer, MD, MS, an expert in bioinformatics and natural language processing, and Rodney Hayward, MD, a leader in risk assessment and intervention- targeting. My advisory team paired with resources of Michigan's Pepper Center, CTSA, and multi-disciplinary Institute for Healthcare Policy and Innovation make this the ideal environment in which to complete the proposed training activities.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Although hospitalization can negatively impact patients with dementia, we know very little about the specific risk factors associated with the chance of being hospitalized. It is important to understand what contributes to this risk, such as the behavior changes that accompany dementia, in order to identify those patients and caregivers that could benefit most from an intervention to avoid or reduce hospitalization. Given the rapidly rising numbers of patients with dementia, reducing potentially preventable hospitalization could have an enormous impact on public health.            ",Preventable Hospitalization in Dementia: The Impact of Neuropsychiatric Symptoms,8769634,K08AG048321,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Aggressive behavior', 'Aging', 'Agitation', 'Antipsychotic Agents', 'Applications Grants', 'Asthma', 'Attention', 'Benzodiazepines', 'Bioinformatics', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Code', 'Cognition Disorders', 'Communities', 'Comorbidity', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Delusions', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Distress', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Elderly', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emergency Care', 'Environment', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Geriatric Psychiatry', 'Geriatrics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Policy', 'Health Services Research', 'Health system', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hospitalization', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Institutionalization', 'Internist', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Intervention Trial', 'Kale - dietary', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Light', 'Literature', 'Location', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Logistics', 'Manuscripts', 'Medical', 'Mental Health', 'Mental Health Services', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outpatients', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Primary Health Care', 'Provider', 'Psychiatrist', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Public Health', 'Qualifying', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Rural', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sleeplessness', 'Source', 'Stratification', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Translating', 'Universities', 'Urinary tract infection', 'Validation', 'Veterans', 'Visit', 'Work', 'Writing', 'abstracting', 'behavior change', 'career', 'case control', 'clinical care', 'design', 'effective intervention', 'evidence base', 'geriatric mental health', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'medication compliance', 'meetings', 'neuropsychiatry', 'patient population', 'professor', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'repository', 'skills', 'statistics', 'tool']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,K08,2014,175103,-0.014382103376942358
"An Evaluation of Novel Domains for Predicting 30-Day Readmission     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services has proposed to financially penalize hospitals that have 30-day readmission rates above the national mean. As a result hospitals caring for disadvantaged populations with more needs might be penalized by current 30-day readmission models that do not include measures of social risk and functional status of the patients served. These are two important variable domains that directly impact a patient's ability to manage their disease. Social risk factors (e.g. living alone, social support, marginal housing, and alcohol abuse) and functional status (e.g. mobility, fall risk) are rarely present in administrative data, which is why so few readmission models include this data. Yet many of these variables are available in electronic health records (EHR) and the advancement of the field of informatics has made the extraction of these data feasible. These variables may improve the discriminative ability of 30-day readmission models which currently explain little of the variation in readmission rates among patients.  We propose to improve 30-day readmission models by extracting measures of social risk and functional status from the EHR using the novel method of Natural Language Processing (NLP). We will combine administrative data (VA and Medicare) and data extracted from the national EHR in the VA for 6000 patients 65 and older in 2011 to improve upon currently available 30-day hospital readmission risk prediction models for congestive heart failure (CHF), acute myocardial infarction (AMI), pneumonia and stroke. We have chosen these conditions because hospital-level 30-day readmission rates for these conditions (CHF, AMI and pneumonia) are currently or will soon be (stroke) publicly reported. Our proposal has two goals: 1) to develop, test and evaluate automated NLP algorithms designed to extract measures of social risk and functional status from the EHR and 2) to understand the impact of these two novel domains on 30-day readmission across four conditions with fundamentally different post-discharge hospital course and disease trajectories.  We propose a paradigm shift in the understanding and obtainment of factors predictive of 30-day readmission. Our overarching hypothesis is that social risk factors and functional status which directly influence a patient's self-management ability are critical factors predictive of 30-day readmission, can be extracted from the EHR, and should be included in risk prediction models. The development of better risk prediction models will allow the identification of patients at highest risk of readmission and facilitate post-discharge interventions in their care. In addition, if social risk factors and functional status are criticalin explaining variation in 30-day readmission rates, then hospitals that care for patients with a higher burden of social risk and functional needs may be inappropriately penalized by current risk predictions models that lack these measures. Also, as more hospitals adopt EHRs, we need to study more advanced technologies such as automated NLP as tools to efficiently extract information and to inform health systems about the characteristics of the patients they serve.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: About a fifth of all Medicare patients are readmitted within 30 days of hospital discharge, potentially exposing the patients and their families to distress and unnecessary costs. An improved understanding of who is at highest risk of readmission will allow hospitals to efficiently intervene in the care of patients who may benefit the most from post-discharge interventions.",An Evaluation of Novel Domains for Predicting 30-Day Readmission,8720810,R01HL116522,"['Accounting', 'Acute myocardial infarction', 'Adopted', 'Affect', 'Alcohol abuse', 'Algorithm Design', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical Data', 'Congestive Heart Failure', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disadvantaged', 'Disease', 'Distress', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Evaluation', 'Family', 'Goals', 'Health Status', 'Health system', 'Hospitals', 'Housing', 'Human', 'Incentives', 'Informatics', 'Intervention', 'Length of Stay', 'Life', 'Measures', 'Medicare', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pneumonia', 'Population', 'Predictive Factor', 'Publishing', 'Reporting', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Self Management', 'Severity of illness', 'Social support', 'Stroke', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'United States Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services', 'Variant', 'Veterans', 'cost', 'demographics', 'design', 'fall risk', 'falls', 'functional status', 'health administration', 'high risk', 'high risk behavior', 'hospital patient care', 'hospital readmission', 'improved', 'marginally housed', 'mortality', 'novel', 'payment', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'social', 'tool']",NHLBI,NORTHERN CALIFORNIA INSTITUTE/RES/EDU,R01,2014,718710,0.005947095173688992
"Novel Tree-based Statistical Methods for Cancer Risk Prediction     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The contradiction of early cancer detection is that while some benefit others receive a detrimental diagnosis. A definitive example is mammography and ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), a noninvasive breast cancer. DCIS, which most frequently presents as a non-palpable lesion, was rarely detected before the advent of modern mammography. Since 1983 there has been a 290% increase in DCIS incidence in women under 50 and 500% in those over 50. Given that only 5-10% of DCIS cases progress to invasive cancer with a 10-year mortality rate of 1-2%, DCIS experts suggest breast conservation for the majority of patients. However, these women continue to be overtreated with mastectomy and radiation, at rates comparable to those with invasive cancer. The inability to discern those at low vs. high risk is due in part to non-reproducible study results as well as inadequate statistical methods for risk prediction and validation.  We have collected a population-based DCIS cohort with the goal of delineating those women least likely to recur with invasive cancer and, hence, appropriate candidates for less aggressive treatments. Recently we established risk indices and published the corresponding absolute risk estimates for type of recurrence. However, two features of the study design, namely the presence of competing risks and the use of a stratified case-cohort design, constrained us to using crude empirical methods for analysis and left us unable to validate the clinical utility of our models. The overarching goal of this proposal is to develop a unified, principled statistical framework for building, selecting, and evaluating clinically relevant risk indices, permitting refinement and validation of existing risk prediction models in our DCIS study as well as beyond.  We face multiple challenges including how to objectively build risk indices with relevant variables; how to estimate the corresponding risks (competing or not) in various subsample study designs; and, how to validate the resulting risk prediction models. Recently, we developed partDSA, a tree-based method which affords tremendous flexibility in building predictive models and provides an ideal foundation for developing a clinician- friendly tool for accurate stratification and risk prediction. In its curret form, partDSA is unable to estimate absolute risk in the presence of competing risks accounting for subsample study designs. Here we extend partDSA for such clinically relevant scenarios (Aim 1). We also propose aggregate learning for risk prediction to increase prediction accuracy and subsequently to build more stable but easily interpretable risk models (Aim 2). Finally, we propose the necessary methods for validating the resulting models (Aim 3).  Our proposal has two immediate public health benefits: first, these novel statistical methods will result in a clinician-friendly, publicly available tool for accurate risk prediction, stratification and validaion in numerous clinical settings; second, current DCIS risk models will be refined and validated with the expectation of better delineating those at low risk, hence strong candidates for conservative treatments including active surveillance.          Our proposal has two public health components: first, our novel statistical methods will provide a clinician- friendly, publicly available tool for accurate isk prediction, stratification and validation in numerous clinical settings; second, current ductal carcinoma in situ risk models will be refined and validated, helping facilitate the decision-making process faced by patients and their clinicians.

"Family History, Genes, Environment and G X E Interaction in Predicting RA Risk DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Since receiving the K24 award, I have established a successful clinical research and training program in patient-oriented research (POR) in rheumatic disease with a focus on genetic, biomarker, and environmental risk factors for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). I continue to have independent grant support, and have mentored 15 new clinical investigators who have published 25 peer- reviewed papers during the K24 period. Three mentees have received NIH K awards and one has received an NIH R01. With renewal of the K24, I would continue to have protected time to devote to this program that has a unique training environment and an array of important POR projects. Genetic and environmental epidemiology studies have produced convincing evidence for multiple alleles and exposures as RA risk factors. A strong gene-environment (GXE) interaction between HLA-DRB1 alleles and smoking has been demonstrated for risk of the immune phenotype of CCP positive RA but not CCP negative RA. As CCP antibodies occur years before RA onset, I hypothesize that this interaction induces anti-citrulline immunity, a critical step in RA pathogenesis. These findings emphasize the need to study genes, environment and immunity with careful phenotyping. Family history encompasses unmeasured genetic and environmental risk, yet is not measured accurately in other studies including those in my research portfolio. Specific aims are to: 1) Maintain and expand my clinical research training program by mentoring new clinical investigators in POR in rheumatic diseases; 2) Enrich my comprehensive POR program to study family history, genetic, and environmental predictors in the etiology of RA using a new collection of RA cases and controls from Partners HealthCare; 2a) Collect family history data and environmental exposure data concerning smoking and reproductive factors on 1,500 RA patients and 4,500 age- and gender-matched controls by utilizing natural language processing (NLP) queries of electronic medical records; 2b: Examine genetic risk factors, environmental risk factors and GXE in predicting immune phenotypes of RA: RA with and without CCP antibodies (CCP?), and RA with and without rheumatoid factor antibodies (RF?); and 2c: Apply this comprehensive risk model to RA cases and controls and to subsets of RA stratified by specific immune phenotypes and stratified by family history of RA and other autoimmune diseases. The proposed study will leverage the NIH funded Informatics for Integrating Biology and the Bedside study that used an advanced informatics infrastructure to extract clinical data on RA diagnostic features through database mining and NLP. A highly specific algorithm was used to identify RA cases and collect samples from cases and controls. The NLP techniques will be used to extract risk factor data from clinical notes. This proposal builds on my strong track record of POR, extending the work to add family history from a new case-control collection, validate data by patient interview, and develop predictive models for risk of RA that can be used to select high risk individuals for future RA prevention trials. Project Narrative  Innovative predictive modeling incorporating family history, genes, environmental exposures, and geneenvironment interactions, is a key step in the progress towards an RA prevention clinical trial.","Family History, Genes, Environment and G X E Interaction in Predicting RA Risk",8664806,K24AR052403,"['Age', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'Antibodies', 'Autoantibodies', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biology', 'Citrulline', 'Classification', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Clinical Research', 'Code', 'Collection', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Environment', 'Environmental Epidemiology', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemiologic Studies', 'Epidemiology', 'Etiology', 'Exogenous Hormone Therapy', 'Family', 'Family Study', 'Family history of', 'Female', 'First Degree Relative', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Markers', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genetic Risk', 'Grant', 'HLA-DRB1', 'Healthcare', 'ICD-9', 'Immune', 'Immunity', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Institution', 'Interview', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Mid-Career Clinical Scientist Award (K24)', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'PTPN22 gene', 'Paper', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patients', 'Peer Review', 'Phenotype', 'Pollution', 'Prevention', 'Publishing', 'Recording of previous events', 'Records', 'Reproductive History', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Project Grants', 'Research Training', 'Rheumatism', 'Rheumatoid Arthritis', 'Rheumatoid Factor', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'STAT4 gene', 'Sampling', 'Siblings', 'Smoking', 'Sushi Domain', 'System', 'Systemic Lupus Erythematosus', 'TNF receptor-associated factor 1', 'Techniques', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Woman', 'Work', 'abstracting', 'base', 'case control', 'cigarette smoking', 'cohort', 'cyclic citrullinated peptide', 'epidemiology study', 'experience', 'gene environment interaction', 'genetic epidemiology', 'genetic risk factor', 'high risk', 'innovation', 'novel', 'patient oriented research', 'predictive modeling', 'prevention clinical trial', 'programs', 'research study', 'risk variant', 'sample collection', 'trafficking']",NIAMS,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,K24,2014,157939,0.01169785678410886
"Genetic Susceptibility and Risk Model for Pancreatic Cancer     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Pancreatic cancer (PanC) is the fourth leading cause of cancer-related death for both men and women in the U.S. Better understanding of the etiology and developing risk prediction models for early detection and prevention are urgently needed for this rapidly fatal disease. The majority of PanC are caused by the interplay of both genetic and environmental factors. Known risk factors for PanC include cigarette smoking, obesity, long-term type II diabetes, and family history. In addition, our previous case-control study has shown that excess body mass index (BMI) in young adulthood confers a higher risk of PanC than weight gain at later age. Recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified several chromosomal regions and genes in association with risk of PanC (PanScan). Our pathway analyses of the PanScan GWAS data have uncovered several novel biological pathways associated with the risk for PanC. However, it remains unknown how environmental or host risk factors modify the association between genetic factors and the PanC risk, which knowledge is critical to better understanding of the etiology and developing a risk prediction model and early intervention strategies for PanC. The goal of this project is to identify gene-environment interactions and develop and validate a risk prediction model including both common and rare genetic variants using the PanScan GWAS data and the exposure information of over 2,200 case-control pairs and an ongoing ExomeChip-based study of PanC genotyping both common SNPs and >240,000 rare functional exonic variants in over 4,100 cases and 4,700 controls from six case-control studies in the Pancreatic Cancer Case Control Consortium (PanC4) and a nested case-control study from Europe (EPIC). We will validate the absolute risk prediction model in two large prospective cohorts: the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) cohort of 15,000 individuals and the Kaiser Permanente cohort of 100,000 individuals. We will also develop novel statistical methods to identify genes modifying the association between changing BMI at different age periods and PanC risk using the unique dataset from a case-control study of PanC conducted at MD Anderson Cancer Center. Our proposed project hinges on novel integration of GWAS, ExomeChip, exposure data of a large number of PanC cases and controls, recently developed powerful statistical methods and analysis strategies for detecting genome-wide gene/pathway-environment interactions and polygenic approaches to genetic risk prediction. The work proposed here is expected not only to advance our understanding of the etiology of PanC and delineate how genes and lifestyle or host factors modify the risk of PanC, but also to greatly facilitate identification of high-risk individuals, and thus, contribute to early detection, improved survival and prevention of PanC. The novel statistical methods developed here are also applicable to other cancers and complex disease, and we will develop user-friendly software packages for public use.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Over 43,900 new cases of pancreatic cancer are expected to occur in the US in 2012, almost all rapidly fatal. This project will not only advance our understanding of the etiology of pancreatic cancer and delineate how genes and lifestyle or host factors modify the risk of pancreatic cancer, but also will facilitate identification of high-risk individuals, and thus, contribute to early detection, prevention, and improved survival of pancreatic cancer. The novel statistical methods developed here are also applicable to other cancers and complex disease, and we will develop user-friendly software packages for public use.

"Elective Induction of Labor and Pregnancy Outcomes     DESCRIPTION (provided by investigator): Background and goals: Each year in the US, up to 490,000 pregnant women undergo elective induction, an intervention to bring on labor without a medical reason. Whether this causes risks to the woman or fetus is unclear. Only one recent clinical trial studied elective induction before 41 weeks of fetal gestation, and it found no difference in outcomes compared to letting the pregnancy continue (expectant management). Observational studies have found more cesarean delivery after induction, but most compared induction to spontaneous labor at the same gestational age, which is not the genuine clinical alternative. Instead, elective induction should be compared to the true alternative, expectant management. Most studies were too small to study uncommon but important outcomes, and none looked at whether risks differ by the mother's race/ethnicity or obesity. Our goal is to compare outcomes for elective induction at 38, 39 or 40 weeks' gestation versus expectant management, to help pregnant women and their providers make more informed decisions. Methods: A multiphase retrospective study of births from 2001 to 2011 will be conducted in two integrated health care systems. In Phase 1, the eligible population (206,000 singleton births) will be identified and classified by their apparent induction and outcome status based on electronic health plan and birth certificate data. In Phase 2, we will conduct 8000 brief medical record reviews to determine true exposure status (elective induction vs. expectant management). In Phase 3, we will review 3500 records in depth for true outcome status and risk factors. Phases 2 and 3 will oversample women with elective induction or rare outcomes, improving our power to address these specific aims: Aim 1: Compare the risk of the following outcomes after elective induction at 38, 39 or 40 weeks' gestation versus expectant management: cesarean delivery, postpartum hemorrhage, chorioamnionitis, neonatal intensive care unit stay, shoulder dystocia, low Apgar score, stillbirth, and neonatal death; and Aim 2: Examine how risks vary by the mother's race/ethnicity, parity, and pre-pregnancy obesity. Secondary analyses will develop an algorithm to more accurately identify elective inductions from electronic data. Impact: This research will compare elective labor induction at 38, 39 or 40 weeks' gestation to expectant management to provide new information about its risks or benefits for the mother and fetus. Our results could immediately affect clinical practice by helping women and providers make more informed choices together. They will also provide a solid foundation for practice guidelines and policy making.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Many pregnant women undergo elective induction (bringing on labor without a medical reason), but there is little good information about whether this is risk for the mother or fetus. Few studies have compared elective induction to the true alternative, letting the pregnancy continue, with birth at a later date; and it is not known whether risks diffe by the mother's race/ethnicity or obesity. The study would fill these critical knowledge gaps, and findings could immediately shape clinical practice.            ",Elective Induction of Labor and Pregnancy Outcomes,8701182,R01HD071986,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Apgar Score', 'Birth', 'Birth Certificates', 'California', 'Childbirth', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Discipline of obstetrics', 'Dystocia', 'Electronics', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Event', 'Fetus', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Gestational Age', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Planning', 'Health Services Research', 'Infant Health', 'Infection of amniotic sac and membranes', 'Integrated Health Care Systems', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Medical', 'Medical Records', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Mothers', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neonatal', 'Neonatal Intensive Care Units', 'Obesity', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Phase', 'Physician&apos', 's Practice Patterns', 'Policy Making', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Postpartum Hemorrhage', 'Practice Guidelines', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Outcome', 'Pregnant Women', 'Provider', 'Race', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk', 'Risk Estimate', 'Risk Factors', 'Shapes', 'Shoulder', 'Solid', 'System', 'Uncertainty', 'Washington', 'Wing', 'Woman', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'clinically relevant', 'design', 'electronic data', 'fetal', 'health care delivery', 'improved', 'neonatal death', 'parity', 'pregnant', 'public health relevance', 'stillbirth', 'tool', 'trend']",NICHD,KAISER FOUNDATION HEALTH PLAN OF WASHINGTON,R01,2014,786907,0.009292373611592492
"Individualized Risk Assessment in Patients with Multiple, Chronic Conditions     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proportions of patients aged 50 years or older with multiple chronic conditions having surgical procedures are estimated to double in the next 50 years. More than 80 million surgical procedures are performed each year in the United States; these procedures are also increasingly being performed in those with multiple chronic conditions. These patients have the greatest risk of serious complications and procedure-related deaths. Although complication rates from major surgery rise with age and multiple conditions, the effect of specific combinations or sequences of comorbid conditions on outcome is not well understood. Identifying patients at increased risk for complications and adverse outcomes is critical to direct healthcare teams to adjust techniques or interventions, improve decision-making and quality improvement. The most common technique used to quantify the burden of health conditions using secondary data are comorbidity indices, or numeric scores based on a summation of the number of conditions that apply pre-determined ""weights"" to give certain conditions more importance over others. Comorbidity indices, however, are subject to several limitations and have not been widely incorporated into the routine assessment of patients in clinical care. The availability of a reliable, easy to use and accessible risk prediction tool for adverse events in surgery is essential. We hypothesize that the current techniques for assessing and predicting the relationship of multiple health conditions and outcome may be improved by: 1) using condition specific diagnoses and condition specific outcomes 2) evaluating specific combinations of conditions to assess if their contribution to the risk of outcome is something other than additive and, 3) determining if the temporal sequence of conditions contributes to the prediction of risk beyond the conventional assessment of whether the conditions are present at all. The last decade has seen a rapid increase in the number of available techniques for building predictive models, especially targeting applications with much larger numbers of attributes. This project applies a novel risk prediction strategy to a nationally representative administrative claims database, including longitudinal records from millions of patients. The focus of the project is on the enhanced risk prediction ability of novel dynamic statistical models that will relate the timing, sequence, combination, and clustering of chronic conditions to effectiveness, safety, resource use and cost of the 10 most commonly performed major elective surgical procedures. These novel risk prediction models will utilize dynamic statistical modeling and machine learning techniques to create an easy to use, interactive risk prediction platform. Successfully improving upon a risk prediction tool for adverse events in surgery will better inform patient-centered decision-making, direct healthcare teams to adjust techniques and interventions, help target quality improvement interventions, allow more equitable reimbursement activities and even support accountable care organization activities that rely on accurate estimates of population risk and health.           PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: More than 80 million surgical procedures are performed each year in the United States, increasingly among older patients and those with multiple chronic conditions. Identifying patients at increased risk for complications and adverse outcomes is critical to help inform patient-centered decision-making, direct healthcare teams to adjust techniques and interventions, help target quality improvement interventions, allow more equitable reimbursement activities and even support accountable care organization activities that rely on accurate estimates of population risk and health. Sensitive techniques for risk stratification based on secondary data are necessary, and we propose a novel flexible statistical framework to the use of longitudinal patient data, which defines predictor characteristics for every comorbid condition and relates these to outcome.              ","Individualized Risk Assessment in Patients with Multiple, Chronic Conditions",8725922,R21HS023080,[' '],AHRQ,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R21,2014,165816,0.016827319758148836
"An Evaluation of Novel Domains for Predicting 30-Day Readmission     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services has proposed to financially penalize hospitals that have 30-day readmission rates above the national mean. As a result hospitals caring for disadvantaged populations with more needs might be penalized by current 30-day readmission models that do not include measures of social risk and functional status of the patients served. These are two important variable domains that directly impact a patient's ability to manage their disease. Social risk factors (e.g. living alone, social support, marginal housing, and alcohol abuse) and functional status (e.g. mobility, fall risk) are rarely present in administrative data, which is why so few readmission models include this data. Yet many of these variables are available in electronic health records (EHR) and the advancement of the field of informatics has made the extraction of these data feasible. These variables may improve the discriminative ability of 30-day readmission models which currently explain little of the variation in readmission rates among patients.  We propose to improve 30-day readmission models by extracting measures of social risk and functional status from the EHR using the novel method of Natural Language Processing (NLP). We will combine administrative data (VA and Medicare) and data extracted from the national EHR in the VA for 6000 patients 65 and older in 2011 to improve upon currently available 30-day hospital readmission risk prediction models for congestive heart failure (CHF), acute myocardial infarction (AMI), pneumonia and stroke. We have chosen these conditions because hospital-level 30-day readmission rates for these conditions (CHF, AMI and pneumonia) are currently or will soon be (stroke) publicly reported. Our proposal has two goals: 1) to develop, test and evaluate automated NLP algorithms designed to extract measures of social risk and functional status from the EHR and 2) to understand the impact of these two novel domains on 30-day readmission across four conditions with fundamentally different post-discharge hospital course and disease trajectories.  We propose a paradigm shift in the understanding and obtainment of factors predictive of 30-day readmission. Our overarching hypothesis is that social risk factors and functional status which directly influence a patient's self-management ability are critical factors predictive of 30-day readmission, can be extracted from the EHR, and should be included in risk prediction models. The development of better risk prediction models will allow the identification of patients at highest risk of readmission and facilitate post-discharge interventions in their care. In addition, if social risk factors and functional status are criticalin explaining variation in 30-day readmission rates, then hospitals that care for patients with a higher burden of social risk and functional needs may be inappropriately penalized by current risk predictions models that lack these measures. Also, as more hospitals adopt EHRs, we need to study more advanced technologies such as automated NLP as tools to efficiently extract information and to inform health systems about the characteristics of the patients they serve.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: About a fifth of all Medicare patients are readmitted within 30 days of hospital discharge, potentially exposing the patients and their families to distress and unnecessary costs. An improved understanding of who is at highest risk of readmission will allow hospitals to efficiently intervene in the care of patients who may benefit the most from post-discharge interventions.                ",An Evaluation of Novel Domains for Predicting 30-Day Readmission,8576427,R01HL116522,"['Accounting', 'Acute myocardial infarction', 'Adopted', 'Affect', 'Alcohol abuse', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical Data', 'Congestive Heart Failure', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disadvantaged', 'Disease', 'Distress', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Evaluation', 'Family', 'Goals', 'Health Status', 'Health system', 'Hospitals', 'Housing', 'Human', 'Incentives', 'Informatics', 'Intervention', 'Length of Stay', 'Life', 'Measures', 'Medicare', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pneumonia', 'Population', 'Predictive Factor', 'Publishing', 'Reporting', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Self Management', 'Severity of illness', 'Social support', 'Stroke', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'United States Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services', 'Variant', 'Veterans', 'cost', 'demographics', 'design', 'fall risk', 'falls', 'functional status', 'health administration', 'high risk', 'high risk behavior', 'hospital patient care', 'hospital readmission', 'improved', 'marginally housed', 'mortality', 'novel', 'payment', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'social', 'tool']",NHLBI,NORTHERN CALIFORNIA INSTITUTE/RES/EDU,R01,2013,738594,0.005947095173688992
"Novel Tree-based Statistical Methods for Cancer Risk Prediction     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The contradiction of early cancer detection is that while some benefit others receive a detrimental diagnosis. A definitive example is mammography and ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), a noninvasive breast cancer. DCIS, which most frequently presents as a non-palpable lesion, was rarely detected before the advent of modern mammography. Since 1983 there has been a 290% increase in DCIS incidence in women under 50 and 500% in those over 50. Given that only 5-10% of DCIS cases progress to invasive cancer with a 10-year mortality rate of 1-2%, DCIS experts suggest breast conservation for the majority of patients. However, these women continue to be overtreated with mastectomy and radiation, at rates comparable to those with invasive cancer. The inability to discern those at low vs. high risk is due in part to non-reproducible study results as well as inadequate statistical methods for risk prediction and validation.  We have collected a population-based DCIS cohort with the goal of delineating those women least likely to recur with invasive cancer and, hence, appropriate candidates for less aggressive treatments. Recently we established risk indices and published the corresponding absolute risk estimates for type of recurrence. However, two features of the study design, namely the presence of competing risks and the use of a stratified case-cohort design, constrained us to using crude empirical methods for analysis and left us unable to validate the clinical utility of our models. The overarching goal of this proposal is to develop a unified, principled statistical framework for building, selecting, and evaluating clinically relevant risk indices, permitting refinement and validation of existing risk prediction models in our DCIS study as well as beyond.  We face multiple challenges including how to objectively build risk indices with relevant variables; how to estimate the corresponding risks (competing or not) in various subsample study designs; and, how to validate the resulting risk prediction models. Recently, we developed partDSA, a tree-based method which affords tremendous flexibility in building predictive models and provides an ideal foundation for developing a clinician- friendly tool for accurate stratification and risk prediction. In its curret form, partDSA is unable to estimate absolute risk in the presence of competing risks accounting for subsample study designs. Here we extend partDSA for such clinically relevant scenarios (Aim 1). We also propose aggregate learning for risk prediction to increase prediction accuracy and subsequently to build more stable but easily interpretable risk models (Aim 2). Finally, we propose the necessary methods for validating the resulting models (Aim 3).  Our proposal has two immediate public health benefits: first, these novel statistical methods will result in a clinician-friendly, publicly available tool for accurate risk prediction, stratification and validaion in numerous clinical settings; second, current DCIS risk models will be refined and validated with the expectation of better delineating those at low risk, hence strong candidates for conservative treatments including active surveillance.          Our proposal has two public health components: first, our novel statistical methods will provide a clinician- friendly, publicly available tool for accurate isk prediction, stratification and validation in numerous clinical settings; second, current ductal carcinoma in situ risk models will be refined and validated, helping facilitate the decision-making process faced by patients and their clinicians.

"Family History, Genes, Environment and G X E Interaction in Predicting RA Risk DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Since receiving the K24 award, I have established a successful clinical research and training program in patient-oriented research (POR) in rheumatic disease with a focus on genetic, biomarker, and environmental risk factors for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). I continue to have independent grant support, and have mentored 15 new clinical investigators who have published 25 peer- reviewed papers during the K24 period. Three mentees have received NIH K awards and one has received an NIH R01. With renewal of the K24, I would continue to have protected time to devote to this program that has a unique training environment and an array of important POR projects. Genetic and environmental epidemiology studies have produced convincing evidence for multiple alleles and exposures as RA risk factors. A strong gene-environment (GXE) interaction between HLA-DRB1 alleles and smoking has been demonstrated for risk of the immune phenotype of CCP positive RA but not CCP negative RA. As CCP antibodies occur years before RA onset, I hypothesize that this interaction induces anti-citrulline immunity, a critical step in RA pathogenesis. These findings emphasize the need to study genes, environment and immunity with careful phenotyping. Family history encompasses unmeasured genetic and environmental risk, yet is not measured accurately in other studies including those in my research portfolio. Specific aims are to: 1) Maintain and expand my clinical research training program by mentoring new clinical investigators in POR in rheumatic diseases; 2) Enrich my comprehensive POR program to study family history, genetic, and environmental predictors in the etiology of RA using a new collection of RA cases and controls from Partners HealthCare; 2a) Collect family history data and environmental exposure data concerning smoking and reproductive factors on 1,500 RA patients and 4,500 age- and gender-matched controls by utilizing natural language processing (NLP) queries of electronic medical records; 2b: Examine genetic risk factors, environmental risk factors and GXE in predicting immune phenotypes of RA: RA with and without CCP antibodies (CCP?), and RA with and without rheumatoid factor antibodies (RF?); and 2c: Apply this comprehensive risk model to RA cases and controls and to subsets of RA stratified by specific immune phenotypes and stratified by family history of RA and other autoimmune diseases. The proposed study will leverage the NIH funded Informatics for Integrating Biology and the Bedside study that used an advanced informatics infrastructure to extract clinical data on RA diagnostic features through database mining and NLP. A highly specific algorithm was used to identify RA cases and collect samples from cases and controls. The NLP techniques will be used to extract risk factor data from clinical notes. This proposal builds on my strong track record of POR, extending the work to add family history from a new case-control collection, validate data by patient interview, and develop predictive models for risk of RA that can be used to select high risk individuals for future RA prevention trials. Project Narrative  Innovative predictive modeling incorporating family history, genes, environmental exposures, and geneenvironment interactions, is a key step in the progress towards an RA prevention clinical trial.","Family History, Genes, Environment and G X E Interaction in Predicting RA Risk",8485543,K24AR052403,"['Age', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'Antibodies', 'Autoantibodies', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biology', 'Citrulline', 'Classification', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Clinical Research', 'Code', 'Collection', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Environment', 'Environmental Epidemiology', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemiologic Studies', 'Epidemiology', 'Etiology', 'Exogenous Hormone Therapy', 'Family', 'Family Study', 'Family history of', 'Female', 'First Degree Relative', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Markers', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genetic Risk', 'Grant', 'HLA-DRB1', 'Healthcare', 'ICD-9', 'Immune', 'Immunity', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Institution', 'Interview', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Mid-Career Clinical Scientist Award (K24)', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'PTPN22 gene', 'Paper', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patients', 'Peer Review', 'Phenotype', 'Pollution', 'Prevention', 'Publishing', 'Recording of previous events', 'Records', 'Reproductive History', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Project Grants', 'Research Training', 'Rheumatism', 'Rheumatoid Arthritis', 'Rheumatoid Factor', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'STAT4 gene', 'Sampling', 'Siblings', 'Smoking', 'Sushi Domain', 'System', 'Systemic Lupus Erythematosus', 'TNF receptor-associated factor 1', 'Techniques', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Woman', 'Work', 'abstracting', 'base', 'case control', 'cigarette smoking', 'cohort', 'cyclic citrullinated peptide', 'epidemiology study', 'experience', 'gene environment interaction', 'genetic epidemiology', 'genetic risk factor', 'high risk', 'innovation', 'novel', 'patient oriented research', 'predictive modeling', 'prevention clinical trial', 'programs', 'research study', 'sample collection', 'trafficking']",NIAMS,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,K24,2013,157939,0.01169785678410886
"Genetic Susceptibility and Risk Model for Pancreatic Cancer     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Pancreatic cancer (PanC) is the fourth leading cause of cancer-related death for both men and women in the U.S. Better understanding of the etiology and developing risk prediction models for early detection and prevention are urgently needed for this rapidly fatal disease. The majority of PanC are caused by the interplay of both genetic and environmental factors. Known risk factors for PanC include cigarette smoking, obesity, long-term type II diabetes, and family history. In addition, our previous case-control study has shown that excess body mass index (BMI) in young adulthood confers a higher risk of PanC than weight gain at later age. Recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified several chromosomal regions and genes in association with risk of PanC (PanScan). Our pathway analyses of the PanScan GWAS data have uncovered several novel biological pathways associated with the risk for PanC. However, it remains unknown how environmental or host risk factors modify the association between genetic factors and the PanC risk, which knowledge is critical to better understanding of the etiology and developing a risk prediction model and early intervention strategies for PanC. The goal of this project is to identify gene-environment interactions and develop and validate a risk prediction model including both common and rare genetic variants using the PanScan GWAS data and the exposure information of over 2,200 case-control pairs and an ongoing ExomeChip-based study of PanC genotyping both common SNPs and >240,000 rare functional exonic variants in over 4,100 cases and 4,700 controls from six case-control studies in the Pancreatic Cancer Case Control Consortium (PanC4) and a nested case-control study from Europe (EPIC). We will validate the absolute risk prediction model in two large prospective cohorts: the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) cohort of 15,000 individuals and the Kaiser Permanente cohort of 100,000 individuals. We will also develop novel statistical methods to identify genes modifying the association between changing BMI at different age periods and PanC risk using the unique dataset from a case-control study of PanC conducted at MD Anderson Cancer Center. Our proposed project hinges on novel integration of GWAS, ExomeChip, exposure data of a large number of PanC cases and controls, recently developed powerful statistical methods and analysis strategies for detecting genome-wide gene/pathway-environment interactions and polygenic approaches to genetic risk prediction. The work proposed here is expected not only to advance our understanding of the etiology of PanC and delineate how genes and lifestyle or host factors modify the risk of PanC, but also to greatly facilitate identification of high-risk individuals, and thus, contribute to early detection, improved survival and prevention of PanC. The novel statistical methods developed here are also applicable to other cancers and complex disease, and we will develop user-friendly software packages for public use.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Over 43,900 new cases of pancreatic cancer are expected to occur in the US in 2012, almost all rapidly fatal. This project will not only advance our understanding of the etiology of pancreatic cancer and delineate how genes and lifestyle or host factors modify the risk of pancreatic cancer, but also will facilitate identification of high-risk individuals, and thus, contribute to early detection, prevention, and improved survival of pancreatic cancer.

"Dynamic Multichain Graphical Models for the Analysis of Childhood Obesity Data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project aims to develop targeted strategies and methods for solving challenging methodological problems in the analysis of data on childhood obesity. Of special interest are statistical and computational models that can attend to the multiple levels of risk behaviors and risk factors that are deemed to be direct or indirect causes of childhood obesity. The multilevel perspective can be captured  through a behavioral-social-ecological conceptual model in which personal factors, beliefs; taste  preferences; dietary composition; environmental factors such as homes, schools, and food availability;  societal factors such as cultural norms; and physiological factors such as intrauterine and genetic disposition are included either as factors in causal chains explaining childhood obesity or as so-called risk regulators (a set of stable ecological conditions) that up- and down-regulate probabilities of  obesogenic outcomes. In order to operationalize and implement the conceptual multilevel model, we propose to build, around a core technology that we call the Dynamic Multi-chain Graphical Model (DMGM), a set of related strategies and methods for (1) the preprocessing of data, and (2) the modeling of multiple causal pathways to obesity. The DMGM separates direct risk factors and risk regulators into two distinct spaces the so-called causal space and the regulatory space. Interest in the mechanism-based model within the causal space focuses on the joint distribution of direct risk factors.  Alternatively, risk regulators within the regulatory space affect the system of variables in the causal space through regression-based models imposed upon system parameters; the joint distribution of regressors, however, is of little interest here. By capitalizing on the conceptual and computational advantages offered by the segregation of the causal and regulatory spaces, the DMGM is able to handle three or more levels of data, to the extent to which direct and indirect risk variables can be identified. Other strategies are also available for handling multiple levels of data within a specific space.  Besides the DMGM, this project will also include the development of a number of other tools that are especially designed to address the analytical complexity that childhood obesity researchers often encounter in their empirical work. The toolkit includes a recursive-partition-based decision tree that can handle temporal data, a functional data-analysis tool for processing history data, and latent-variable models for summarizing multiple measurements and handling within-space clustering effects. Other specific aims of the project include the application of the proposed methods to two national data sets collected, respectively, from the Louisiana Child Health Study and the Heartbeat! Project, and the dissemination of a user-friendly software program for increasing the potential impact of the project.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: As a social epidemic, childhood obesity is the result of the interaction between many levels of personal behavior and risk factors, as well as obesogenic ecological factors that span many sources, including families, schools, and communities. Using a broad and interdisciplinary team of clinical and methodology scientists, this project develops advanced analytic tools that could help clinicians better understand the mechanisms of how multiple levels of risk factors lead to childhood obesity, including the relative importance of the risk factors.

"Elective Induction of Labor and Pregnancy Outcomes     DESCRIPTION (provided by investigator): Background and goals: Each year in the US, up to 490,000 pregnant women undergo elective induction, an intervention to bring on labor without a medical reason. Whether this causes risks to the woman or fetus is unclear. Only one recent clinical trial studied elective induction before 41 weeks of fetal gestation, and it found no difference in outcomes compared to letting the pregnancy continue (expectant management). Observational studies have found more cesarean delivery after induction, but most compared induction to spontaneous labor at the same gestational age, which is not the genuine clinical alternative. Instead, elective induction should be compared to the true alternative, expectant management. Most studies were too small to study uncommon but important outcomes, and none looked at whether risks differ by the mother's race/ethnicity or obesity. Our goal is to compare outcomes for elective induction at 38, 39 or 40 weeks' gestation versus expectant management, to help pregnant women and their providers make more informed decisions. Methods: A multiphase retrospective study of births from 2001 to 2011 will be conducted in two integrated health care systems. In Phase 1, the eligible population (206,000 singleton births) will be identified and classified by their apparent induction and outcome status based on electronic health plan and birth certificate data. In Phase 2, we will conduct 8000 brief medical record reviews to determine true exposure status (elective induction vs. expectant management). In Phase 3, we will review 3500 records in depth for true outcome status and risk factors. Phases 2 and 3 will oversample women with elective induction or rare outcomes, improving our power to address these specific aims: Aim 1: Compare the risk of the following outcomes after elective induction at 38, 39 or 40 weeks' gestation versus expectant management: cesarean delivery, postpartum hemorrhage, chorioamnionitis, neonatal intensive care unit stay, shoulder dystocia, low Apgar score, stillbirth, and neonatal death; and Aim 2: Examine how risks vary by the mother's race/ethnicity, parity, and pre-pregnancy obesity. Secondary analyses will develop an algorithm to more accurately identify elective inductions from electronic data. Impact: This research will compare elective labor induction at 38, 39 or 40 weeks' gestation to expectant management to provide new information about its risks or benefits for the mother and fetus. Our results could immediately affect clinical practice by helping women and providers make more informed choices together.

"Mitigating risk in a closed loop system by exercise detection and miniaturization No abstract available PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In the US, approximately 1 million people have been diagnosed with type 1 diabetes. Diabetes is the leading cause of blindness, kidney failure, and non-traumatic amputation. Improving blood glucose control with a miniaturized closed loop (automated) system for use within real world situations including those in which patients move about freely and exercise, as proposed here, will decrease the risk of hypoglycemia and the risk of complications that can be debilitating, such as eye disease, and life-threatening, such as heart attacks.

"A New Hip Fracture Risk Prediction Tool Based on Common Predictors and Hip Geomer    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Osteoporosis is a major public health problem. Women are at a particularly high risk for osteoporosis and 50% of women age 50 or older may suffer from a fragility fracture in their remaining lifetime. Hip fractures are the most detrimental type of fractures. Research has been conducted to assess hip fracture risk so prevention methods could be used to reduce this risk in the growing number of older women. However, previous risk assessment approaches are limited to a few variables and linear combinations of these factors. Also, there is an increasing number of available measures, such as bone structures and skeletal muscle mass, that can be extracted, for instance, from dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA), and no reliable risk prediction model exist based on this wealth of information. The overall goal of this study is to develop a comprehensive and flexible model to assess the risk of hip fracture for a specific woman. This will be achieved by constructing a novel predictor that classifies data that include hip structural geometry, sarcopenia measurements as well as risk factors identified in previous studies. The construction of the predictive model will be partly based on a study conducted among a large (n = 11,432) multi-ethnic bone cohort from the nationwide Women's Health Initiative (WHI). In addition, to enhance the quality of the risk prediction, computational data from finite element simulations will be used. There are three specific aims. The first aim is to generate a risk model, based on clinical data that accounts for the coupling effects of the factors involved in hip fracture. This research introduces a new approach in the field of hip fracture, Support Vector Machines (SVM), which explicitly identifies the configurations of factors that are likely to lead to hip fracture. The second aim is to refine the prediction/decision model from the first aim using both the SVM classifier and finite element modeling. A scheme has been developed to select, in a high dimensional space, data points that would improve the accuracy of the SVM-based risk prediction model. These data points would be evaluated (fracture or not) using a finite element model. The novelty of the proposed finite element model stems from its full parameterization so that the variability of the bone response can be studied with respect to variations (even small) of structural geometry and material parameters. The third aim is to validate and compare the SVM-based risk with and without the use of finite element analysis and develop a hip fracture risk calculator for the web. A cross validation will be performed using data sets from the WHI as well as other cohorts. The flexibility of the SVM classification approach makes it easily deployable on the Internet. This study will be carried out using existing cohorts by an interdisciplinary team with experience in epidemiology of osteoporosis research, DXA measurements including hip structures and sarcopenia, fracture assessments, biostatistics approaches for large datasets, high dimensional analysis and finite element modeling, thus making this study highly feasible. The study results will have an extremely significant public health impact by providing an innovative tool for hip fracture risk assessments.        This study will use innovative approaches, existing cohort resources, and interdisciplinary expertise to address a significant public health challenge: assessing the risk of hip fracture, the most detrimental type of fragility fractures. The study aims for a better risk assessment tool on the web that can be used by researchers and clinicians to assess an individual's hip fracture risk.

"Novel Tree-based Statistical Methods for Cancer Risk Prediction     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The contradiction of early cancer detection is that while some benefit others receive a detrimental diagnosis. A definitive example is mammography and ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), a noninvasive breast cancer. DCIS, which most frequently presents as a non-palpable lesion, was rarely detected before the advent of modern mammography. Since 1983 there has been a 290% increase in DCIS incidence in women under 50 and 500% in those over 50. Given that only 5-10% of DCIS cases progress to invasive cancer with a 10-year mortality rate of 1-2%, DCIS experts suggest breast conservation for the majority of patients. However, these women continue to be overtreated with mastectomy and radiation, at rates comparable to those with invasive cancer. The inability to discern those at low vs. high risk is due in part to non-reproducible study results as well as inadequate statistical methods for risk prediction and validation.  We have collected a population-based DCIS cohort with the goal of delineating those women least likely to recur with invasive cancer and, hence, appropriate candidates for less aggressive treatments. Recently we established risk indices and published the corresponding absolute risk estimates for type of recurrence. However, two features of the study design, namely the presence of competing risks and the use of a stratified case-cohort design, constrained us to using crude empirical methods for analysis and left us unable to validate the clinical utility of our models. The overarching goal of this proposal is to develop a unified, principled statistical framework for building, selecting, and evaluating clinically relevant risk indices, permitting refinement and validation of existing risk prediction models in our DCIS study as well as beyond.  We face multiple challenges including how to objectively build risk indices with relevant variables; how to estimate the corresponding risks (competing or not) in various subsample study designs; and, how to validate the resulting risk prediction models. Recently, we developed partDSA, a tree-based method which affords tremendous flexibility in building predictive models and provides an ideal foundation for developing a clinician- friendly tool for accurate stratification and risk prediction. In its curret form, partDSA is unable to estimate absolute risk in the presence of competing risks accounting for subsample study designs. Here we extend partDSA for such clinically relevant scenarios (Aim 1). We also propose aggregate learning for risk prediction to increase prediction accuracy and subsequently to build more stable but easily interpretable risk models (Aim 2). Finally, we propose the necessary methods for validating the resulting models (Aim 3).  Our proposal has two immediate public health benefits: first, these novel statistical methods will result in a clinician-friendly, publicly available tool for accurate risk prediction, stratification and validaion in numerous clinical settings; second, current DCIS risk models will be refined and validated with the expectation of better delineating those at low risk, hence strong candidates for conservative treatments including active surveillance.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Our proposal has two public health components: first, our novel statistical methods will provide a clinician- friendly, publicly available tool for accurate isk prediction, stratification and validation in numerous clinical settings; second, current ductal carcinoma in situ risk models will be refined and validated, helping facilitate the decision-making process faced by patients and their clinicians.              Our proposal has two public health components: first, our novel statistical methods will provide a clinician- friendly, publicly available tool for accurate isk prediction, stratification and validation in numerous clinical settings; second, current ductal carcinoma in situ risk models will be refined and validated, helping facilitate the decision-making process faced by patients and their clinicians.            ",Novel Tree-based Statistical Methods for Cancer Risk Prediction,8373032,R01CA163687,"['Accounting', 'Anxiety', 'Breast', 'Carcinoma', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Cohort Studies', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Decision Making', 'Diagnosis', 'Epidemiology', 'Face', 'Face Processing', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Health Benefit', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Intervention Studies', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Left', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammography', 'Mastectomy', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Noninfiltrating Intraductal Carcinoma', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Radiation', 'Radiation therapy', 'Recurrence', 'Research Design', 'Risk', 'Risk Estimate', 'Screening for cancer', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stratification', 'Techniques', 'Trees', 'Validation', 'Woman', 'Work', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'breast lumpectomy', 'cancer risk', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'design', 'expectation', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'high risk', 'indexing', 'loss of function', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'mortality', 'novel', 'open source', 'population based', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'programs', 'research study', 'simulation', 'tool']",NCI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2012,335601,0.000798844449873866
"Family History, Genes, Environment and G X E Interaction in Predicting RA Risk DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Since receiving the K24 award, I have established a successful clinical research and training program in patient-oriented research (POR) in rheumatic disease with a focus on genetic, biomarker, and environmental risk factors for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). I continue to have independent grant support, and have mentored 15 new clinical investigators who have published 25 peer- reviewed papers during the K24 period. Three mentees have received NIH K awards and one has received an NIH R01. With renewal of the K24, I would continue to have protected time to devote to this program that has a unique training environment and an array of important POR projects. Genetic and environmental epidemiology studies have produced convincing evidence for multiple alleles and exposures as RA risk factors. A strong gene-environment (GXE) interaction between HLA-DRB1 alleles and smoking has been demonstrated for risk of the immune phenotype of CCP positive RA but not CCP negative RA. As CCP antibodies occur years before RA onset, I hypothesize that this interaction induces anti-citrulline immunity, a critical step in RA pathogenesis. These findings emphasize the need to study genes, environment and immunity with careful phenotyping. Family history encompasses unmeasured genetic and environmental risk, yet is not measured accurately in other studies including those in my research portfolio. Specific aims are to: 1) Maintain and expand my clinical research training program by mentoring new clinical investigators in POR in rheumatic diseases; 2) Enrich my comprehensive POR program to study family history, genetic, and environmental predictors in the etiology of RA using a new collection of RA cases and controls from Partners HealthCare; 2a) Collect family history data and environmental exposure data concerning smoking and reproductive factors on 1,500 RA patients and 4,500 age- and gender-matched controls by utilizing natural language processing (NLP) queries of electronic medical records; 2b: Examine genetic risk factors, environmental risk factors and GXE in predicting immune phenotypes of RA: RA with and without CCP antibodies (CCP?), and RA with and without rheumatoid factor antibodies (RF?); and 2c: Apply this comprehensive risk model to RA cases and controls and to subsets of RA stratified by specific immune phenotypes and stratified by family history of RA and other autoimmune diseases. The proposed study will leverage the NIH funded Informatics for Integrating Biology and the Bedside study that used an advanced informatics infrastructure to extract clinical data on RA diagnostic features through database mining and NLP. A highly specific algorithm was used to identify RA cases and collect samples from cases and controls. The NLP techniques will be used to extract risk factor data from clinical notes. This proposal builds on my strong track record of POR, extending the work to add family history from a new case-control collection, validate data by patient interview, and develop predictive models for risk of RA that can be used to select high risk individuals for future RA prevention trials. Project Narrative  Innovative predictive modeling incorporating family history, genes, environmental exposures, and gene-  environment interactions, is a key step in the progress towards an RA prevention clinical trial.","Family History, Genes, Environment and G X E Interaction in Predicting RA Risk",8288292,K24AR052403,"['ARHGEF5 gene', 'Address', 'Age', 'Air Pollution', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'Antibodies', 'Antigens', 'Area', 'Autoantibodies', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Behavioral', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Body mass index', 'Breathing', 'Calibration', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cigarette', 'Citrulline', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Clinical Research', 'Code', 'Cohort Studies', 'Collection', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Cox Proportional Hazards Models', 'DNA', 'DNA Markers', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Environmental Epidemiology', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemiologic Studies', 'Epidemiologist', 'Epidemiology', 'Epitopes', 'Etiology', 'Exposure to', 'Family', 'Family Study', 'Family history of', 'Female', 'First Degree Relative', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Models', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genotype', 'Grant', 'HLA-DR4 Antigen', 'HLA-DRB1', 'Healthcare', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hormonal', 'Hormones', 'Human Genome', 'ICD-9', 'Immune', 'Immunity', 'Immunologist', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Inflammatory', 'Informatics', 'Institution', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Interview', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Link', 'Logistic Models', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Lung', 'Measures', 'Menopausal Status', 'Mentors', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Methotrexate', 'Mid-Career Clinical Scientist Award (K24)', 'Minerals', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Notification', 'Occupational', 'PTPN22 gene', 'Paper', 'Particulate', 'Particulate Matter', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patients', 'Peer Review', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacogenetics', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Pollution', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Prevention', 'Prevention strategy', 'Principal Investigator', 'Publishing', 'Race', 'Recording of previous events', 'Records', 'Reproductive History', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Research Support', 'Research Training', 'Rheumatism', 'Rheumatoid Arthritis', 'Rheumatoid Factor', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'STAT4 gene', 'Sampling', 'Siblings', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Smoking', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stratification', 'Subgroup', 'Surface', 'Sushi Domain', 'Sweden', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Systemic Lupus Erythematosus', 'TNF receptor-associated factor 1', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Toxic Environmental Substances', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Travel', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'Woman', 'Work', 'abstracting', 'adalimumab', 'base', 'case control', 'cigarette smoking', 'cohort', 'cost effective', 'cyclic citrullinated peptide', 'cytokine', 'epidemiology study', 'experience', 'gene environment interaction', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic association', 'genetic epidemiology', 'genetic risk factor', 'genetic technology', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'high risk', 'improved', 'inclusion criteria', 'infliximab', 'innovation', 'insight', 'meetings', 'men', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'parity', 'patient oriented research', 'pre-clinical', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'prevention clinical trial', 'programs', 'reproductive', 'research study', 'response', 'sample collection', 'sex', 'toxin metabolism', 'trafficking', 'treatment response', 'tumor necrosis factor-alpha inhibitor']",NIAMS,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,K24,2012,157939,0.011677354508173735
"Dynamic Multichain Graphical Models for the Analysis of Childhood Obesity Data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project aims to develop targeted strategies and methods for solving challenging methodological problems in the analysis of data on childhood obesity. Of special interest are statistical and computational models that can attend to the multiple levels of risk behaviors and risk factors that are deemed to be direct or indirect causes of childhood obesity. The multilevel perspective can be captured  through a behavioral-social-ecological conceptual model in which personal factors, beliefs; taste  preferences; dietary composition; environmental factors such as homes, schools, and food availability;  societal factors such as cultural norms; and physiological factors such as intrauterine and genetic disposition are included either as factors in causal chains explaining childhood obesity or as so-called risk regulators (a set of stable ecological conditions) that up- and down-regulate probabilities of  obesogenic outcomes. In order to operationalize and implement the conceptual multilevel model, we propose to build, around a core technology that we call the Dynamic Multi-chain Graphical Model (DMGM), a set of related strategies and methods for (1) the preprocessing of data, and (2) the modeling of multiple causal pathways to obesity. The DMGM separates direct risk factors and risk regulators into two distinct spaces the so-called causal space and the regulatory space. Interest in the mechanism-based model within the causal space focuses on the joint distribution of direct risk factors.  Alternatively, risk regulators within the regulatory space affect the system of variables in the causal space through regression-based models imposed upon system parameters; the joint distribution of regressors, however, is of little interest here. By capitalizing on the conceptual and computational advantages offered by the segregation of the causal and regulatory spaces, the DMGM is able to handle three or more levels of data, to the extent to which direct and indirect risk variables can be identified. Other strategies are also available for handling multiple levels of data within a specific space.  Besides the DMGM, this project will also include the development of a number of other tools that are especially designed to address the analytical complexity that childhood obesity researchers often encounter in their empirical work. The toolkit includes a recursive-partition-based decision tree that can handle temporal data, a functional data-analysis tool for processing history data, and latent-variable models for summarizing multiple measurements and handling within-space clustering effects. Other specific aims of the project include the application of the proposed methods to two national data sets collected, respectively, from the Louisiana Child Health Study and the Heartbeat! Project, and the dissemination of a user-friendly software program for increasing the potential impact of the project.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: As a social epidemic, childhood obesity is the result of the interaction between many levels of personal behavior and risk factors, as well as obesogenic ecological factors that span many sources, including families, schools, and communities.

"Dynamic Multichain Graphical Models for the Analysis of Childhood Obesity Data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project aims to develop targeted strategies and methods for solving challenging methodological problems in the analysis of data on childhood obesity. Of special interest are statistical and computational models that can attend to the multiple levels of risk behaviors and risk factors that are deemed to be direct or indirect causes of childhood obesity. The multilevel perspective can be captured  through a behavioral-social-ecological conceptual model in which personal factors, beliefs; taste  preferences; dietary composition; environmental factors such as homes, schools, and food availability;  societal factors such as cultural norms; and physiological factors such as intrauterine and genetic disposition are included either as factors in causal chains explaining childhood obesity or as so-called risk regulators (a set of stable ecological conditions) that up- and down-regulate probabilities of  obesogenic outcomes. In order to operationalize and implement the conceptual multilevel model, we propose to build, around a core technology that we call the Dynamic Multi-chain Graphical Model (DMGM), a set of related strategies and methods for (1) the preprocessing of data, and (2) the modeling of multiple causal pathways to obesity. The DMGM separates direct risk factors and risk regulators into two distinct spaces the so-called causal space and the regulatory space. Interest in the mechanism-based model within the causal space focuses on the joint distribution of direct risk factors.  Alternatively, risk regulators within the regulatory space affect the system of variables in the causal space through regression-based models imposed upon system parameters; the joint distribution of regressors, however, is of little interest here. By capitalizing on the conceptual and computational advantages offered by the segregation of the causal and regulatory spaces, the DMGM is able to handle three or more levels of data, to the extent to which direct and indirect risk variables can be identified. Other strategies are also available for handling multiple levels of data within a specific space.  Besides the DMGM, this project will also include the development of a number of other tools that are especially designed to address the analytical complexity that childhood obesity researchers often encounter in their empirical work. The toolkit includes a recursive-partition-based decision tree that can handle temporal data, a functional data-analysis tool for processing history data, and latent-variable models for summarizing multiple measurements and handling within-space clustering effects. Other specific aims of the project include the application of the proposed methods to two national data sets collected, respectively, from the Louisiana Child Health Study and the Heartbeat!

"Family History, Genes, Environment and G X E Interaction in Predicting RA Risk    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Since receiving the K24 award, I have established a successful clinical research and training program in patient-oriented research (POR) in rheumatic disease with a focus on genetic, biomarker, and environmental risk factors for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). I continue to have independent grant support, and have mentored 15 new clinical investigators who have published 25 peer- reviewed papers during the K24 period. Three mentees have received NIH K awards and one has received an NIH R01. With renewal of the K24, I would continue to have protected time to devote to this program that has a unique training environment and an array of important POR projects. Genetic and environmental epidemiology studies have produced convincing evidence for multiple alleles and exposures as RA risk factors. A strong gene-environment (GXE) interaction between HLA-DRB1 alleles and smoking has been demonstrated for risk of the immune phenotype of CCP positive RA but not CCP negative RA. As CCP antibodies occur years before RA onset, I hypothesize that this interaction induces anti-citrulline immunity, a critical step in RA pathogenesis. These findings emphasize the need to study genes, environment and immunity with careful phenotyping. Family history encompasses unmeasured genetic and environmental risk, yet is not measured accurately in other studies including those in my research portfolio. Specific aims are to: 1) Maintain and expand my clinical research training program by mentoring new clinical investigators in POR in rheumatic diseases; 2) Enrich my comprehensive POR program to study family history, genetic, and environmental predictors in the etiology of RA using a new collection of RA cases and controls from Partners HealthCare; 2a) Collect family history data and environmental exposure data concerning smoking and reproductive factors on 1,500 RA patients and 4,500 age- and gender-matched controls by utilizing natural language processing (NLP) queries of electronic medical records; 2b: Examine genetic risk factors, environmental risk factors and GXE in predicting immune phenotypes of RA: RA with and without CCP antibodies (CCP?), and RA with and without rheumatoid factor antibodies (RF?); and 2c: Apply this comprehensive risk model to RA cases and controls and to subsets of RA stratified by specific immune phenotypes and stratified by family history of RA and other autoimmune diseases.

"Multi-institutional Consortium for CER in Diabetes Treatment and Prevention    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Project Summary /Abstract: The HMO Research Network's (HMORN) Diabetes Multi-Center Research Consortium (DMCRC) Coordinating Center proposes to build a national research network and a multi-system distributed database for conducting comparative effectiveness research (CER) in the treatment and prevention of diabetes mellitus. The network is comprised of 31 investigators from 12 integrated healthcare delivery systems and academic institutions who study diabetes mellitus, gestational diabetes mellitus, childhood and adult obesity, weight management, medical informatics and biostatistics. The network has broad experience conducting system-based interventions to improve treatment of diabetes or to support lifestyle changes to prevent diabetes, as well as broad experience conducting CER. The 12-system database will capture and standardize detailed demographic and longitudinal electronic health record (EHR)-derived clinical data on more than 750,000 persons with diabetes and a much larger membership without diabetes. Once constructed, the database will be used to conduct and publish surveillance data on trends (2005- 2012) in the incidence, prevalence, treatment and outcomes of diabetes in this population. It will also be used to conduct two CER studies. The first is a cluster randomized, multi-system intervention that will rapidly identify diabetes patients with ""early nonadherence"" to newly prescribed anti-diabetic, antihypertensive, and lipid-lowering medications. Early nonadherence refers to patient failure to fill either the first prescription of a new medication or the first refill, and has been shown to be more frequent than ""ongoing"" nonadherence. This information will be provided to population management outreach teams in 3-5 health systems via the EHR or other electronic database, along with training in counseling patients on adherence problems. Study outcomes of subsequent risk factor change and adherence to the new medication will be compared within each system to those for patients on teams that do not receive the new information. The second CER study is an observational evaluation of various communication, counseling and referral strategies as provided to women who have had an abnormal glucose test (fasting glucose or oral glucose tolerance test) in the first 6 months after a pregnancy complicated by gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) and who are therefore at very high risk for developing Type 2 diabetes. Study outcomes include weight change over one year and self-reported physical activity four months after the abnormal test. In each study, we will collect process of care data by applying natural language processing (NLP) to clinical text in EHRs and survey patients for information on demographic, clinical, and behavioral variables. These NLP-derived and patient-reported variables will be studied as possible mediators of treatment effectiveness or as potential modifiers of effectiveness (i.e. variables that identify patient subgroups that benefit less from usual interventions. Variables that prove to be important as mediators or modifiers may be good candidates for routine collection and incorporation into EHR's and/or future diabetes registries.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: A network of 32 health services and intervention scientists affiliated with the HMO Research Network propose to build a national database for conducting comparative effectiveness research on treatment and on approaches to preventing diabetes mellitus. The database will include information on more than 750,000 persons with diabetes. It will be used to generate ongoing information on the occurrence, treatments and outcomes of diabetes and to conduct 2 studies of approaches to treating and preventing this condition.           Project Narrative A network of 32 health services and intervention scientists affiliated with the HMO Research Network propose to build a national database for conducting comparative effectiveness research on treatment and on approaches to preventing diabetes mellitus.

"Clinical Validation of BCT - Phase II    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Fracture risk assessment is integral to the diagnosis and management of osteoporosis, a devastating clinical condition of which over 40 million Americans are at risk. Due to limitations in areal BMD measures obtained from 2D DXA scans - the current clinical standard for diagnosis of osteoporosis - it has recently become clear that those at risk of osteoporotic fracture need to be better identified. A 3D biomechanics-based technique, which we term Biomechanical Computed Tomography (BCT), addresses this need through a combination of engineering finite element analysis, 3D quantitative computed tomography (QCT), and bone fracture biomechanics. The main outcome parameter of BCT is an estimate of the biomechanical risk of a bone fracture that accounts for such factors as the patient's 3D bone geometry and distribution of bone density, body-weight, height, trochanteric soft tissue thickness (for hip fractures), muscle moment arm (for spine), and the age-related risk of sustaining an overload event (such as a fall or lifting of a heavy object with back bent). In the larger context of translating BCT to clinical practice, we seek in this Phase II SBIR project to test the overall hypothesis that BCT is a better predictor of osteoporotic fracture than is areal BMD, for both hip and spine fracture and for both women and men. In Phase I of this project, we successfully applied this technique to explain observed age-related trends in hip fracture rates. For Phase II, we plan in our first Aim to refine our BCT technique to produce a fully automated, highly reliable and highly accurate software suite with the capability to analyze CT scans acquired for any medical test with coverage of the hip and/or spine without an external calibration phantom. For Aim 2, in order to ensure optimal prediction of clinical fractures, we will further refine our overall BCT process by calibrating results from the two cohorts (the Mayo Clinic cohort of 750 men and women in Rochester MN, and the MrOS cohort of 3,500 men in six U.S. locations). Issues to be resolved in this calibration process include determining optimal methods for measuring soft tissue thickness, muscle moment arms, and spine loading. This analysis will also enable us to calibrate our function for age- related risk of sustaining an overload event, which may depend on both fracture type (hip vs. spine) and sex. In Aim 3, we will compile normative data for BCT outcomes, critical information for interpretation of clinical results. Having refined and calibrated the overall BCT technique and identified the most successful BCT predictors of clinical fracture in the Mayo and MrOS cohorts, we will proceed in Aim 4 to test the validity of these predictors in a fully prospective manner, without any further modification of the BCT technique. For this, we will analyze the AGES cohort of 5,500 women and men in Reykjavik, Iceland, for incident hip and spine fracture. Taken together, this multi-cohort international validation study will provide new insight into osteoporotic fracture etiology, important advancements for the BCT method, and a thorough evaluation of BCT clinical performance. This project should therefore have a significant impact on osteoporosis research and clinical practice. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Statement of Relevance This project will provide clinical validation to Biomechanical Computed Tomography, a promising clinical alternative to DXA for the diagnosis of osteoporosis. Successful translation of BCT to clinical practice has the potential to greatly improve non-invasive assessment of fracture risk, which would represent an important advance in the preventative care and treatment of osteoporosis.           Statement of Relevance This project will provide clinical validation to Biomechanical Computed Tomography, a promising clinical alternative to DXA for the diagnosis of osteoporosis.

For Phase II, we plan in our first Aim to refine our BCT technique to produce a fully automated, highly reliable and highly accurate software suite with the capability to analyze CT scans acquired for any medical test with coverage of the hip and/or spine without an external calibration phantom. For Aim 2, in order to ensure optimal prediction of clinical fractures, we will further refine our overall BCT process by calibrating results from the two cohorts (the Mayo Clinic cohort of 750 men and women in Rochester MN, and the MrOS cohort of 3,500 men in six U.S. locations). Issues to be resolved in this calibration process include determining optimal methods for measuring soft tissue thickness, muscle moment arms, and spine loading. This analysis will also enable us to calibrate our function for age- related risk of sustaining an overload event, which may depend on both fracture type (hip vs. spine) and sex. In Aim 3, we will compile normative data for BCT outcomes, critical information for interpretation of clinical results. Having refined and calibrated the overall BCT technique and identified the most successful BCT predictors of clinical fracture in the Mayo and MrOS cohorts, we will proceed in Aim 4 to test the validity of these predictors in a fully prospective manner, without any further modification of the BCT technique. For this, we will analyze the AGES cohort of 5,500 women and men in Reykjavik, Iceland, for incident hip and spine fracture. Taken together, this multi-cohort international validation study will provide new insight into osteoporotic fracture etiology, important advancements for the BCT method, and a thorough evaluation of BCT clinical performance.

"Integrated Cardio-Renal Risk Prediction Models in Type 1 Diabetes    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This application addresses broad Challenge Area (03) Biomarker Discovery and Validation, and the specific Challenge Topic that this application addresses is: 03-DK-101 Discovery of biomarkers for disease risk, progression or response to therapy in diseases of interest to NIDDK. The Challenge: Despite tremendous progress in treatment, patients with type 1 diabetes continue to die 15 years earlier, experience excess morbidity and have medical costs over 10 times higher than the general population. The risk of coronary artery disease and diabetic nephropathy is still greatly increased and responsible for 80% of deaths in these patients. Diabetic nephropathy and coronary artery disease are intertwined, suggesting common pathways, and yet current risk prediction is inadequate. Study Rationale: Nearly 25% of T1D patients develop end-stage renal disease. The conventional theory is that the sequence of events leading to diabetic nephropathy begins from microalbuminuria, progressing to overt proteinuria and eventual end-stage renal disease. Primary prevention with ACE/ARB treatment usually begins when persistent microalbuminuria is found. However, recent prospective studies using serial measurements of kidney function estimated from serum cystatin C have changed this paradigm by demonstrating that decline in glomerular filtration may begin in the absence of microalbuminuria or continue despite remission of microalbuminuria. By their mid 40's, over 70% of men and 50% of women with type 1 diabetes develop coronary artery calcification (CAC) - a marker of significant atherosclerotic plaque burden. Cardiovascular disease is particularly prevalent among patients with renal disease, but most cardiac events occur in patients with normal albumin excretion rates. Evidence has accumulated that diabetic nephropathy and CAC are parallel, rather than sequential, complications of type 1 diabetes, sharing a number of important predictors. Accurate prediction of the individual's global cardio-renal risk is needed to guide treatment choices. As a result, there is a recognized need for better risk partitioning, either from the discovery of additional biomarkers or the application of superior methods for discrimination of disease states. Our Approach: We are proposing to use the biobank of 652 adults with type 1 diabetes who have been thoroughly genotyped and prospectively followed for development of diabetic nephropathy and coronary artery disease by the Coronary Artery Calcification in Type 1 Diabetes study (CACTI, R01 HL61753, 1999- 2009) to develop and validate integrated biomarker prediction models for cardio-renal complications in type 1 diabetes. Our study aims are the investigation of biomarkers within the well-characterized CACTI cohort for 1) early progressive renal function decline, 2) the presence and progression of coronary artery calcium, and the 3) development of combined renal and cardiovascular disease burden. Renal disease and coronary artery disease (CAD) are the leading causes of death among adults with type 1 diabetes, but traditional screening tests (urinary albumin and serum creatinine) for renal disease are inadequate, and traditional CAD risk factors (dyslipidemia, hypertension, smoking, obesity) do not fully explain the increased burden of disease associated with type 1 diabetes. Renal and cardiovascular complications are intertwined, suggesting shared pathways. Increased systemic inflammation is present in type 1 diabetes and inflammatory mediators such as uric acid, vitamin D and bone metabolism markers have been suggested to play a role in both renal and cardiovascular diseases. As a result, it is of critical public health importance to discover and validate new biomarkers for cardio-renal disease among adults with type 1 diabetes.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Renal disease and coronary artery disease (CAD) are the leading causes of death among adults with type 1 diabetes, but traditional screening tests (urinary albumin and serum creatinine) for renal disease are inadequate, and traditional CAD risk factors (dyslipidemia, hypertension, smoking, obesity) do not fully explain the increased burden of disease associated with type 1 diabetes.

"Dynamic Multichain Graphical Models for the Analysis of Childhood Obesity Data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project aims to develop targeted strategies and methods for solving challenging methodological problems in the analysis of data on childhood obesity. Of special interest are statistical and computational models that can attend to the multiple levels of risk behaviors and risk factors that are deemed to be direct or indirect causes of childhood obesity. The multilevel perspective can be captured  through a behavioral-social-ecological conceptual model in which personal factors, beliefs; taste  preferences; dietary composition; environmental factors such as homes, schools, and food availability;  societal factors such as cultural norms; and physiological factors such as intrauterine and genetic disposition are included either as factors in causal chains explaining childhood obesity or as so-called risk regulators (a set of stable ecological conditions) that up- and down-regulate probabilities of  obesogenic outcomes. In order to operationalize and implement the conceptual multilevel model, we propose to build, around a core technology that we call the Dynamic Multi-chain Graphical Model (DMGM), a set of related strategies and methods for (1) the preprocessing of data, and (2) the modeling of multiple causal pathways to obesity. The DMGM separates direct risk factors and risk regulators into two distinct spaces the so-called causal space and the regulatory space. Interest in the mechanism-based model within the causal space focuses on the joint distribution of direct risk factors.  Alternatively, risk regulators within the regulatory space affect the system of variables in the causal space through regression-based models imposed upon system parameters; the joint distribution of regressors, however, is of little interest here. By capitalizing on the conceptual and computational advantages offered by the segregation of the causal and regulatory spaces, the DMGM is able to handle three or more levels of data, to the extent to which direct and indirect risk variables can be identified. Other strategies are also available for handling multiple levels of data within a specific space.  Besides the DMGM, this project will also include the development of a number of other tools that are especially designed to address the analytical complexity that childhood obesity researchers often encounter in their empirical work. The toolkit includes a recursive-partition-based decision tree that can handle temporal data, a functional data-analysis tool for processing history data, and latent-variable models for summarizing multiple measurements and handling within-space clustering effects. Other specific aims of the project include the application of the proposed methods to two national data sets collected, respectively, from the Louisiana Child Health Study and the Heartbeat! Project, and the dissemination of a user-friendly software program for increasing the potential impact of the project.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: As a social epidemic, childhood obesity is the result of the interaction between many levels of personal behavior and risk factors, as well as obesogenic ecological factors that span many sources, including families, schools, and communities.

"Clinical Validation of BCT - Phase II    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Fracture risk assessment is integral to the diagnosis and management of osteoporosis, a devastating clinical condition of which over 40 million Americans are at risk. Due to limitations in areal BMD measures obtained from 2D DXA scans - the current clinical standard for diagnosis of osteoporosis - it has recently become clear that those at risk of osteoporotic fracture need to be better identified. A 3D biomechanics-based technique, which we term Biomechanical Computed Tomography (BCT), addresses this need through a combination of engineering finite element analysis, 3D quantitative computed tomography (QCT), and bone fracture biomechanics. The main outcome parameter of BCT is an estimate of the biomechanical risk of a bone fracture that accounts for such factors as the patient's 3D bone geometry and distribution of bone density, body-weight, height, trochanteric soft tissue thickness (for hip fractures), muscle moment arm (for spine), and the age-related risk of sustaining an overload event (such as a fall or lifting of a heavy object with back bent). In the larger context of translating BCT to clinical practice, we seek in this Phase II SBIR project to test the overall hypothesis that BCT is a better predictor of osteoporotic fracture than is areal BMD, for both hip and spine fracture and for both women and men. In Phase I of this project, we successfully applied this technique to explain observed age-related trends in hip fracture rates. For Phase II, we plan in our first Aim to refine our BCT technique to produce a fully automated, highly reliable and highly accurate software suite with the capability to analyze CT scans acquired for any medical test with coverage of the hip and/or spine without an external calibration phantom. For Aim 2, in order to ensure optimal prediction of clinical fractures, we will further refine our overall BCT process by calibrating results from the two cohorts (the Mayo Clinic cohort of 750 men and women in Rochester MN, and the MrOS cohort of 3,500 men in six U.S. locations). Issues to be resolved in this calibration process include determining optimal methods for measuring soft tissue thickness, muscle moment arms, and spine loading. This analysis will also enable us to calibrate our function for age- related risk of sustaining an overload event, which may depend on both fracture type (hip vs. spine) and sex. In Aim 3, we will compile normative data for BCT outcomes, critical information for interpretation of clinical results. Having refined and calibrated the overall BCT technique and identified the most successful BCT predictors of clinical fracture in the Mayo and MrOS cohorts, we will proceed in Aim 4 to test the validity of these predictors in a fully prospective manner, without any further modification of the BCT technique. For this, we will analyze the AGES cohort of 5,500 women and men in Reykjavik, Iceland, for incident hip and spine fracture.

"HIV Risk Behavior in out-of school rural Af. Am. Young Adults    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recent epidemiological evidence indicates that the risk of contracting HIV is increasing among African American young adults living in the rural South. African American communities in rural Georgia are characterized by chronic unemployment and poverty along with a dearth of health and educational resources. Young adults in these communities face significant barriers to adequate employment and higher education. Many respond to this lack of opportunity and the resulting economic pressure by engaging in high-risk behavior, including substance use and unprotected sexual activity. Although young adults attending higher education have been studied extensively, barriers to obtaining valid samples have prevented empirical research on the risk and protective factors that affect rural African American young adults who do not attend college. The research proposed in this R-21 application addresses the public health need to develop new approaches to obtaining valid samples of hard-to-reach members of populations at risk for HIV and substance use and to identify the protective factors that dissuade them from engaging in high risk behaviors. The objectives of this study are to (1) test the feasibility of Respondent-Driven Sampling (RDS) for obtaining a sample of rural African American young adults age 18-21 who are out of school and living in resource- poor, rural environments, and (2) evaluate a model of the personal, interpersonal, and socioeconomic factors that explain high-risk sexual behavior among these young people. RDS is a novel technique that combines ""snowball sampling"" with a mathematical model that weights the sample to compensate for its non-random nature. RDS will be used to obtain a sample of 240 rural African American young adults. Data will be gathered to evaluate a heuristic model that includes the following predictors: socioeconomic and personal stressors; the negative emotions these stressors induce; support and socialization from prosocial adults; intrapersonal protective processes, including a future orientation, self-regulation, emotion regulation, and racial identity; affiliations with risk-taking peers and sexual partners; and antecedents of HIV-related risk behavior, such as behavioral intentions and attitudes toward sexually protective behaviors.           n/a",HIV Risk Behavior in out-of school rural Af.

"Computerized population Programs for Three Cancer Risks   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The specific aims of this research project                            are (1) to replicate one of the most effective approaches to behavioral              intervention, a series of expert system interventions, for both smoking              cessation and reduction of dietary fat on a national sample; (2) to extend the       intervention to the reduction of sedentary life style; (3) to develop and            assess the effectiveness of an innovative automated counseling intervention,         the TLC telecommunications system, applied to the same 3 behavioral risk             factors; (4) to compare the effectiveness of the current modular expert system       approach with an integrated expert system intervention, and (5) to determine         the cost-effectiveness of each of the 3 interventions. All subjects will be at       risk for all 3 risk factors and all interventions would intervene on all 3 risk      factors simultaneously. The modular expert system intervention involves 3            assessments, each followed by 3 separate feedback reports at 6-month intervals       for each of the risk factors.

"Osteoporosis in Hypercalciuric Kidney Stone Formers The aim of our research is to determine the risk of bone disease in hypercalciuric kidney stone formers and their families by establishing an algorithm that takes into account bone mineral density (BMD), demographic characteristics diet history, and urine and serum chemistries, including markers of bone turnover. The algorithm will allow us to determine which hypercalciurics need clinical evaluation for osteoporosis and will form the basis of a disease management product. In the process of creating this algorithm, we will be the first to determine the prevalence of bone disease in hypercalciuric stone formers and their families and over time make some estimates of incidence rates.

"HEART RATE RECOVERY AND MORTALITY  Although there has been considerable attention paid to the                                                                               prognostic significance of the heart rate rise during exercise, only recently        has it been noted that the heart rate fall after exercise, or ""heart-rate            recovery,"" may be an even more powerful predictor of outcome. Heart-rate             recovery after exercise is a consequence of central reactivation of vagal tone.      As impaired parasympathetic function has been associated with increased risk of      death, our hypothesis is that an impaired heart-rate recovery is a powerful and      independent predictor of mortality. Our group recently published the first           report linking heart-rate recovery to long-term mortality in the New England         Journal of Medicine. The proposed project will extend upon that report by            determining the optimal definition of heart-rate recovery, by showing that an        abnormal heart-rate recovery is an independent predictor of mortality in             diverse patient groups, and by developing accurate survival models that              incorporate heart-rate recovery. The overall aim of this project is to use           heart-rate recovery to substantially improve the prognostic value of the             exercise test. The specific aims of this project are: 1) Derive biologically         meaningful mathematical models of heart-rate recovery. Data from over 20,000         patients who have undergone exercise testing at Cleveland Clinic Foundation          between 1990 and 1998 will be used; all of these patients had their tests            performed on exercise workstations which recorded heart rates every 10 seconds       during and after exercise. Heart-rate recovery measures will be the difference       between heart rate at peak exercise and heart rate at different points during        recovery. Modeling will be based on exponential families, using stepwise             selection, bootstrapping, and information theory approaches. Correlates of           different patterns of heart rate recovery will be determined. 2) Using the           results of modeling of heart-recovery derived from the work in Specific Aim 1,       determine a prognostically defined optimal definition of abnormal heart rate         recovery and demonstrate that an abnormal heart rate recovery is a powerful and      independent predictor of mortality in diverse patient groups. Data from              exercise tolerance tests of over 40,000 patients studied at the Cleveland            Clinic Foundation between 1990 and 1999 will be analyzed. Statistical methods        to be used will include the nonparametric Kaplan-Meier product limit method and      the Cox proportional hazards model with bootstrap validation, which will             include use of the random forest technique. 3) Using completely parametric           techniques. develop predictive survival models in which heart-rate recovery is       included along with clinical data and other exercise findings, including             exercise capacity and heart rate changes during exercise. The advantages of the      parametric technique include: a) it allows for modeling of nonproportional           hazards that may permit differential strength of effect at different follow-up       times for different sets of risk factors; b) it generates absolute risk, not         just relative risk; and c) it permits patient-specific prediction. All the data      needed for this project are already electronically available; that fact, along       with the work already done, lends confidence to the feasibility of this              project.                                                                                                                                                                  n/a",HEART RATE RECOVERY AND MORTALITY,6530749,R01HL066004,"['cardiovascular stress test', ' clinical research', ' diagnosis design /evaluation', ' disease /disorder proneness /risk', ' exercise', ' heart function', ' heart rate', ' human data', ' human mortality', ' information theory', ' long term survivor', ' mathematical model', ' model design /development', ' parasympathetic nervous system', ' prognosis', ' statistics /biometry', ' vagus nerve']",NHLBI,CLEVELAND CLINIC FOUNDATION,R01,2002,222000,-0.04094343176092177

"HEART RATE RECOVERY AND MORTALITY  Although there has been considerable attention paid to the                                                                               prognostic significance of the heart rate rise during exercise, only recently        has it been noted that the heart rate fall after exercise, or ""heart-rate            recovery,"" may be an even more powerful predictor of outcome. Heart-rate             recovery after exercise is a consequence of central reactivation of vagal tone.      As impaired parasympathetic function has been associated with increased risk of      death, our hypothesis is that an impaired heart-rate recovery is a powerful and      independent predictor of mortality. Our group recently published the first           report linking heart-rate recovery to long-term mortality in the New England         Journal of Medicine. The proposed project will extend upon that report by            determining the optimal definition of heart-rate recovery, by showing that an        abnormal heart-rate recovery is an independent predictor of mortality in             diverse patient groups, and by developing accurate survival models that              incorporate heart-rate recovery. The overall aim of this project is to use           heart-rate recovery to substantially improve the prognostic value of the             exercise test. The specific aims of this project are: 1) Derive biologically         meaningful mathematical models of heart-rate recovery. Data from over 20,000         patients who have undergone exercise testing at Cleveland Clinic Foundation          between 1990 and 1998 will be used; all of these patients had their tests            performed on exercise workstations which recorded heart rates every 10 seconds       during and after exercise. Heart-rate recovery measures will be the difference       between heart rate at peak exercise and heart rate at different points during        recovery. Modeling will be based on exponential families, using stepwise             selection, bootstrapping, and information theory approaches. Correlates of           different patterns of heart rate recovery will be determined. 2) Using the           results of modeling of heart-recovery derived from the work in Specific Aim 1,       determine a prognostically defined optimal definition of abnormal heart rate         recovery and demonstrate that an abnormal heart rate recovery is a powerful and      independent predictor of mortality in diverse patient groups. Data from              exercise tolerance tests of over 40,000 patients studied at the Cleveland            Clinic Foundation between 1990 and 1999 will be analyzed. Statistical methods        to be used will include the nonparametric Kaplan-Meier product limit method and      the Cox proportional hazards model with bootstrap validation, which will             include use of the random forest technique. 3) Using completely parametric           techniques. develop predictive survival models in which heart-rate recovery is       included along with clinical data and other exercise findings, including             exercise capacity and heart rate changes during exercise. The advantages of the      parametric technique include: a) it allows for modeling of nonproportional           hazards that may permit differential strength of effect at different follow-up       times for different sets of risk factors; b) it generates absolute risk, not         just relative risk; and c) it permits patient-specific prediction. All the data      needed for this project are already electronically available; that fact, along       with the work already done, lends confidence to the feasibility of this              project.                                                                                                                                                                  n/a",HEART RATE RECOVERY AND MORTALITY,6223938,R01HL066004,"['cardiovascular stress test', ' clinical research', ' diagnosis design /evaluation', ' disease /disorder proneness /risk', ' exercise', ' heart function', ' heart rate', ' human data', ' human mortality', ' information theory', ' long term survivor', ' mathematical model', ' model design /development', ' parasympathetic nervous system', ' prognosis', ' statistics /biometry', ' vagus nerve']",NHLBI,CLEVELAND CLINIC FOUNDATION,R01,2001,222000,-0.04094343176092177
"Discovery and Validation of AMD Biomarkers for Progression Using Deep Learning Project Abstract Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the leading cause of blindness among elderly individuals. Currently there are no proven effective therapies for treatment of advanced non-neovascular AMD, termed geographic atrophy (GA). Earlier intervention may be preferable, but this would require identification of those individuals with the highest risk for progression to atrophy. Over the last two decades, various studies including ours have identified several optical coherence tomography (OCT)-based factors that appear to associate with a higher risk for AMD progression. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that a deep learning - artificial intelligence (AI) construct can objectively and automatically learn and quantify the most important risk factors, yielding a better prediction of AMD progression risk than current subjectively specified features. In this proposal, we will first develop an AI- based system to automatically identify the “subjectively-specified” high risk factors based on individual spectral domain (SD) OCT 2D scans, and to automatically segment GA (the end-stage outcome variable of AMD) in OCT 2D en face maps. Subsequently, as a proof-of-concept study of our hypothesis, we will apply an AI-based “reverse learning” approach to objectively learn and identify AMD high risk factors in longitudinal OCT data. To achieve these objectives, we will pursue the following specific aims: Aim 1: Develop and validate an AI approach to classify individual OCT 2D scans as containing or not containing the pre-specified risk factor(s). In our previous work, we manually identified the presence or absence of the pre-specific high-risk factors and assigned to a risk score based on the entire OCT volume. Such approach was time consuming and not precise. In this proposal, an AI algorithm will be applied to detect the high risk factors from individual OCT scans. Hence, the precision of the scoring system can be greatly enhanced with high computational complexity. Aim 2: Develop and validate an AI approach to segment GA lesions from 2D OCT en face maps. For the OCT volumes having atrophy, we will perform the GA segmentation from the choroidal hypertransmission-resulted en face map using the multi-scale CNNs. Aim 3: Develop and validate an AI “reverse learning” approach to objectively identify the high risk factors using longitudinal OCT data. The “reverse learning” will be based on the multiple CNNs, followed by de- convolutional networks to identify the high risk factors objectively. Our previous scoring system will possibly be refined and optimized by the potential inclusion (or substitution) of novel risk factors derived from our objective AI approaches. The work in this proposal will be performed retrospectively in SD-OCT images from the image data pool that the multi-PI Sadda has aggregated over years as the director of the Doheny image reading center. Project Narrative Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the leading cause of blindness among elderly individuals and it may be preferable to intervene at an earlier stage in the disease process. We propose to use artificial intelligence techniques to automatically and objectively identify and quantify end-stage atrophy as well to identify the features on spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT), which are associated with a higher risk for progression to late atrophic AMD. This research should have implications for clinical practice in the staging and monitoring of AMD patients, as well as facilitating new therapeutic trials for AMD.",Discovery and Validation of AMD Biomarkers for Progression Using Deep Learning,9986814,R21EY030619,"['3-Dimensional', 'Age related macular degeneration', 'Architecture', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Atrophic', 'Back', 'Blindness', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Consensus', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Data Pooling', 'Data Set', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Drusen', 'Early Intervention', 'Early intervention trials', 'Elderly', 'Future', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Monitor', 'Neurons', 'Nonexudative age-related macular degeneration', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Process', 'Reading', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Residual state', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Scanning', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Staging', 'Staging System', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Therapeutic Trials', 'Time', 'Validation', 'Visit', 'Work', 'algorithm training', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'convolutional neural network', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'effective therapy', 'follow-up', 'geographic atrophy', 'high risk', 'imaging Segmentation', 'improved', 'intelligent algorithm', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'primary outcome', 'prognostic', 'progression marker', 'research study']",NEI,DOHENY EYE INSTITUTE,R21,2020,196250,0.02117488927301486
"SURPASS: (Statin Use and Risk Prediction of Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease in minority Subgroups) PROJECT SUMMARY Despite advances in technology, cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains the leading cause of death, disability, and healthcare costs in the U.S. Yet, there is a tremendous gap in accurate cardiovascular risk prediction and prevention, particularly in racial/ethnic minorities. Furthermore, there is significant heterogeneity in CVD risks and outcomes for disaggregated Hispanic and Asian subgroups. The current cardiovascular risk assessment tools have not been well-validated in these diverse populations, and it remains largely unknown why minority patients are less likely to start and more likely to stop life-saving therapies. The overall goal of Dr. Rodriguez’s K01 application is to address gaps in knowledge about CVD prediction and treatment in understudied racial/ethnic minority populations. The proposed study will utilize the electronic health record (EHR) data from an established NHLBI-funded cohort enriched with disaggregated Hispanic and Asian patients. Using this cohort, Dr. Rodriguez will first test the ACC/AHA Pooled Cohort Equations in disaggregated Asian and Hispanic subgroups using a large diverse mixed-payer cohort of 1,234,751 patients from two large healthcare systems in Northern California and Hawaii. Secondly, she will build new CVD risk prediction models for diverse patient subgroups using machine learning techniques. Finally, she will identify reasons for statin underuse and discontinuation using natural language processing in the EHR. This study, which will evaluate existing data from real-world clinical practice in a stable population, will inform future risk prediction models and cholesterol treatment guidelines for diverse racial/ethnic groups. The proposal is aligned with the NHBLI’s strategic goals to eliminate health disparities and inequities by leveraging epidemiology and data science to understand and solve complex health problems. This proposal will also prepare Dr. Rodriguez to meet her long-term goal of becoming a national leader and independent investigator in CVD prevention and minority health. The proposed didactic and applied data science experiences, including training in advanced epidemiological methods and machine learning, will prepare Dr. Rodriguez to apply her research to other areas of CVD prevention and populations. This training program builds on the strengths of Stanford University in health services research, epidemiology, and biomedical informatics. Her mentorship team, led by Dr. Latha Palaniappan, includes experts in cardiovascular prevention and health services research (Dr. Heidenreich, co-mentor), applied statistical analyses (Dr. Robert Tibshirani, advisor), machine learning in the EHR (Dr. Nigam Shah, advisor), and chronic disease prediction and medical decision making (Dr. Michael Pignone, advisor). Dr. Rodriguez’s team is committed to ensuring the success of the proposal as well as overseeing her advanced training in their respective areas of expertise. The research and training plan proposed in this K01 application will develop Dr. Rodriguez into a unique and highly-skilled clinician researcher ready to compete for R-level funding and launch her independent research career. ! PROJECT NARRATIVE Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death for racial/ethnic minority groups in the U.S., yet current CVD risk prediction algorithms fail to adequately assess risk in these populations. The proposal will address this substantial knowledge gap by validating current risk prediction models in racial/ethnic minority subgroups, improving risk prediction using modern machine learning techniques, and identifying reasons for statin discontinuation. Findings from this study will provide the foundation for clinical guidelines, research agendas, and public health interventions to improve CVD prevention strategies in diverse populations. !",SURPASS: (Statin Use and Risk Prediction of Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease in minority Subgroups),9851429,K01HL144607,"['Address', 'Adherence', 'American', 'American Heart Association', 'Area', 'Asians', 'Assessment tool', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Biometry', 'Calibration', 'California', 'Cardiology', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cause of Death', 'Cholesterol', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Decision Making', 'Diagnosis', 'Discrimination', 'Disease Outcome', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Epidemiology', 'Equation', 'Ethnic group', 'Event', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Hawaii', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Services Research', 'Health system', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hispanics', 'Hypersensitivity', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Mexican Americans', 'Minority', 'Minority Groups', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Not Hispanic or Latino', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Prevention', 'Prevention strategy', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Puerto Rican', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Estimate', 'Risk Factors', 'Savings', 'Scientist', 'South Asian', 'Stable Populations', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Methods', 'Subgroup', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Veterans', 'Woman', 'Work', 'atherosclerosis risk', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'cardiovascular disorder prevention', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'career', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'college', 'disability', 'disparity reduction', 'epidemiologic data', 'ethnic minority population', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'health difference', 'health disparity', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'i(19)', 'improved', 'innovation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'men', 'minority health', 'mortality', 'neural network', 'patient subsets', 'prediction algorithm', 'prevention service', 'public health intervention', 'racial and ethnic', 'racial and ethnic disparities', 'racial diversity', 'racial minority', 'random forest', 'risk prediction model', 'side effect', 'skills', 'structured data', 'success', 'supervised learning', 'support vector machine', 'treatment guidelines', 'unstructured data']",NHLBI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,K01,2020,172001,0.01848259754246454
"Machine Learning to Reduce Hypertension Treatment Clinical Inertia PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Hypertension (HTN) is a main risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD). It can be managed through use of antihypertensive medications and lifestyle modification (i.e., diet and exercise). Adults who have controlled BP have close to a 50% decreased risk of CVD-related mortality compared to those with uncontrolled BP. However, using current guidelines, over 40% of the 100 million US adults with HTN have controlled BP. Thus, uncontrolled BP remains a significant and largely unchecked public health issue in the United States. Interventions to improve BP control exist (i.e., medication adherence and diet and exercise), but they are mostly complex and resource intensive. If resources to improve HTN control are to be efficiently used, identifying patients who are likely to have persistently uncontrolled BP may provide an opportunity for targeted and tailored intervention and close monitoring. Application of a machine learning algorithm (MLA) to electronic medical record (EMR) data could identify patients likely to have uncontrolled BP. The use and amount of data in EMRs continues to expand and improve in quality. The Temple Health EMR contains extensive demographic, clinical, prescribing, and dispensing data. MLAs are ideally suited to harness this complex and abundant data. MLAs recognize patterns in data that may be difficult to detect by researchers and identify variables that are important for prediction of an outcome. They have been used to predict hospital length of stay, hospital mortality rates, and even detect diabetic retinopathy. The objective of the major study proposed in this K01 application is to first, develop and validate a random forest MLA to predict risk of uncontrolled BP among adults with HTN. Second, identify barriers and facilitators to implementing an MLA-clinical decision support (CDS) tool that predicts uncontrolled BP into clinical settings by conducting key-informant interviews and focus groups with primary care clinicians and patients. Third, Compare clinical management of hypertension with and without a prototype of an MLA-CDS tool through a case-vignette study. These aims align with my career goal of lowering CVD risk in adults. I will accomplish these aims with the help of an accomplished mentoring team focused on hypertension and antihypertensive medication adherence, machine learning, and qualitative interviewing and CDS-tool development. During the timeframe of this study I will gain experience in (1) MLA development and validation, (2) qualitative interviewing skills to develop CDS tools for clinicians, and (3) leadership skills for principal investigators. These skills will allow me to become an independent investigator focused on identifying people at high risk for chronic disease related to CVD events and developing tools to assist physicians in lowering CVD risk at the population level. The objective of the major study proposed in this K01 application is to first, develop and validate a random forest machine learning algorithm (MLA) to predict risk of uncontrolled blood pressure among adults with hypertension. Second, identify barriers and facilitators to implementing an MLA-clinical decision support (CDS) tool that predicts uncontrolled blood pressure into clinical settings by conducting key-informant interviews and focus groups with primary care clinicians and patients.

"A Chatbot Utilizing Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing to Implement the Brief Negotiation Interview to Improve Engagement in Buprenorphine Treatment among Justice-Involved Individuals PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The people at greatest risk of dying from an opioid overdose are the least likely to get life-saving medication. Justice-involved individuals coming out of prison have the highest risk of death by overdose (8x greater than the general population), yet only 1 in 20 of these individuals receive buprenorphine (bup), a safe, effective medication that has been shown to reduce a person’s risk of death by overdose by half. There is an urgent need to facilitate an increase in bup treatment engagement among these individuals. Two of the top barriers to receiving bup for these individuals are 1) system level barriers and, 2) low levels of individual motivation. Our prior research shows that delivering individual level treatment engagement interventions increase the rate at which individuals receive bup. Thus, our solution is to improve engagement in bup treatment among justice-involved individuals by 1) “disrupting” system level barriers by circumventing the pieces of the probation system that are stigmatizing and reduce the chances of a bup referral by using an artificial intelligence (AI)-based chatbot to make the referral, and 2) addressing low individual motivation by programming the chatbot to deliver the BNI itself, without the need for a trained professional. Aim 1: Design and develop a functional prototype chatbot to motivate bup engagement. Milestones: (a) human-centered design (including focus groups) with all stakeholders; and (b) creation of a functional chatbot using ML and NLP that is integrated with a mobile application, an application program interface server, and an administrator portal. Aim 2: Conduct a 4-week pilot study with 60 probationers randomly assigned to BNI Chatbot or Treatment-as-Usual (TAU). Hypothesis 1. The BNI Chatbot group will have a higher percentage of participants attending their first bup appointment than the TAU group at 4 weeks (Primary outcome). Hypothesis 2. The BNI Chatbot group will demonstrate higher ratings of readiness and intention to engage in bup treatment, and lower opioid use, as measured by urine toxicology tests, than the TAU group at 4 weeks (Secondary outcomes). Hypothesis 3. The BNI Chatbot group will demonstrate higher ratings of satisfaction than the TAU group. PROJECT NARRATIVE Justice-involved individuals with Opioid Use Disorder coming out of prison have the highest risk of death by overdose (8x greater than the general population), yet only 1 in 20 of these individuals receive buprenorphine, a safe, effective medication that has been shown to reduce a person’s risk of overdose death by half.

"A Wearable, Biomarker-Tracking Device Platform Using Machine Learning and Predictive Technology for Positive Behavior Change. Project Summary/Abstract Behaivior is developing a patent-pending platform to predict and prevent addiction relapses and overdoses by treating those in recovery with timely interventions using wearables (like an advanced FitBit) and artificial intelligence. Knowing in real time when someone with opioid use disorder is at a high risk of relapsing revolutionizes the ability to intervene at the right moment to help people stay sober. Our research will contribute to fundamental knowledge about the specific information needed to be gathered in order to accurately detect when someone struggling with opioid use disorder is in a high risk opioid craving/obsession state and enabled the creation of a predictive model for just in time intervention. The number of deaths from opioid overdose is increasing every day, so reducing opioid addiction relapses will save lives and families and it will reduce rearrests, reincarcerations, and rehospitalizations. Over 23 million Americans are addicted to drugs and alcohol, and these addictions cost the U.S. $442 billion per year, according to the US Surgeon General’s office. The majority of treatment tools used to keep those in recovery sober have low or mixed success rates. Many people in recovery end up relapsing multiple times, with the heroin relapse rate around 90%. With the technology that we are developing, Behaivior will detect if someone in recovery is in a red alert craving or “obsession” state and then, using artificial intelligence, we will provide support in real time by connecting someone to a support network member and/or provide a customized digital intervention. The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project revolves around the human brain’s proclivity towards substances detrimental to human health and wellbeing, such as dangerous amounts of sugar, salt, and drugs, which is causing global health and safety risks. Inability to avoid these temptations shortens lifespans, increases healthcare costs, and strains resources. This team uses machine learning and pattern recognition AI to identify and react to factors that result in destructive human behaviors. While the initial focus is opioids, this unsupervised learning AI could, in subsequent iterations, be used to identify and react to any behavior -- such as unsafe driving, binge eating, or anger management. Helping people identify the precursors to their behaviors could serve as a type of biofeedback that gives them and their support networks timely and individualized insights, preventions, and interventions, resulting in cost and health benefits across many populations. Project Narrative Behaivior is developing a system to predict and prevent opioid addiction relapses and overdoses using wearables and artificial intelligence for timely interventions. Our innovation lowers relapse and overdose rates and improves treatment adherence, which we anticipate will mitigate pain points such as higher treatment costs insurers currently pay from patient relapses, will reduce emergency room and first responder costs, and will ease (or alleviate) employers’ pain points such as poorer employee productivity and the added training and replacement costs. Through this program, Team Behavior will explore how to best tailor our technology for our likely first payers and validate the next potential customer segment we should pursue.","A Wearable, Biomarker-Tracking Device Platform Using Machine Learning and Predictive Technology for Positive Behavior Change.",10085849,R43DA046149,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Alcohols', 'American', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavior', 'Binge Eating', 'Biofeedback', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Costs and Benefits', 'Custom', 'Dangerousness', 'Devices', 'Employee', 'Family', 'Health', 'Health Benefit', 'Health Care Costs', 'Heroin', 'Human', 'Innovation Corps', 'Insurance Carriers', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Legal patent', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Obsession', 'Opiate Addiction', 'Opioid', 'Overdose', 'Pain', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Productivity', 'Recovery', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'Sodium Chloride', 'Surgeon', 'System', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Cost', 'addiction', 'anger management', 'behavior change', 'cost', 'craving', 'digital', 'first responder', 'fitbit', 'global health', 'high risk', 'hospital readmission', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'member', 'opioid mortality', 'opioid use disorder', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'programs', 'rearrest', 'reincarceration', 'relapse patients', 'relapse risk', 'sobriety', 'success', 'sugar', 'support network', 'tool', 'treatment adherence', 'unsafe driving', 'unsupervised learning']",NIDA,"BEHAIVIOR, LLC",R43,2020,55000,-0.022569865517375186
"Physical Fitness as an Objective Biomarker for AD/ADRD Risk Modification About 6M Americans ≥65 years suffer from Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (AD/ADRD) which poses significant emotional, physical, and financial burden on patients and their families, and costs the US economy over $250 billion annually. AD/ADRD is a growing national public health crisis as the number of Americans ≥65 years is projected to double by 2050. There are no approved disease-modifying drugs for AD/ADRD, and no new symptom-modifying drug has been approved since 2003. This highlights the need for novel research approaches aimed at preventing AD/ADRD. Physical activity (PA) has been identified as the lifestyle intervention with the strongest potential to prevent AD/ADRD. However, most of the randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of PA including the 23 ongoing RCTs currently sponsored by the NIA are small with short follow-up. Larger RCTs with longer follow-up are needed to provide definitive evidence of benefit. Identification of relevant biomarkers and quantification of future risk can mitigate long duration and cost of such RCTs. Epidemiologic studies with large database and long follow-up are limited by imprecise and unreliable self-reports of PA. We propose the novel concept of using cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) as a reliable biomarker of PA for AD/ADRD risk reduction. Like body composition, blood pressure and heart rate, CRF is considered a biomarker of PA. Just as well-controlled blood glucose leads to optimal HbA1C, PA of adequate duration, frequency and intensity also leads to optimal CRF. The current application has been designed to test the hypotheses that higher CRF is independently linked to a lower risk of incident AD/ADRD and to determine optimal levels of CRF assessed by a standardized exercise tolerance test (ETT), for minimizing AD/ADRD risk at both population and individual levels. Our Specific Aims are (1) to determine the relationship between CRF and incident AD/ADRD, taking into consideration a non-linear relationship and potential interactions of CRF with other risk factors and (2) to define incremental CRF levels that are linked to progressively lower risk of AD/ADRD, overall, and in subgroups by age, sex, and race. Our Aim 3 is to develop and validate a deep learning-based risk prediction model to determine the optimal CRF level for individuals to achieve the lowest risk of AD/ADRD. Recent advances in deep (machine) learning, a key artificial intelligence (AI) technology, allow modeling of complex non-linear relationships necessary for more precise risk prediction. These aims will be achieved by using ETT data on 911,698 Veterans free of baseline AD/ADRD (mean age, 61 years, 54,411 women, 202,000 African American, 50,107 Hispanic Americans) with up to 19 years of follow-up data. Explainable deep learning risk prediction model will be developed in the VA data, and validated with a Medicare population to develop a “precision medicine” approach that will personalize CRF recommendations for individuals to lower their AD/ADRD risk. Future studies will incorporate molecular biomarkers to validate AD diagnosis and ascertain effect of CRF and CRF modification on AD risk. Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (AD/ADRD) affects about 6 million Americans ≥65 years but to date there are no drug that can cure it and no new drug to improve memory and function has been discovered in nearly past two decades. Physical activity is the only lifestyle intervention with the greatest potential to prevent AD/ADRD, but clinical trials of physical activity are often small with short follow-up, and self-reports of physical activity in observation studies are unreliable. We propose to use objectively measured cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) as a biomarker of physical activity in the largest epidemiological study to date in nearly 1 million Veterans using VA’s world-class electronic health record and advanced artificial intelligence technologies.",Physical Fitness as an Objective Biomarker for AD/ADRD Risk Modification,10055393,RF1AG069121,"['Affect', 'African American', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'American', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Attenuated', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Process', 'Blood Glucose', 'Blood Pressure', 'Body Composition', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emotional', 'Exercise Tolerance', 'Exposure to', 'Family', 'Financial Hardship', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Glycosylated hemoglobin A', 'Goals', 'Health Promotion', 'Heart Rate', 'Hispanic Americans', 'Individual', 'International Classification of Disease Codes', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Longterm Follow-up', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurable', 'Measures', 'Medicare', 'Memory', 'Metabolic', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Observational Study', 'Pathogenicity', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Physical Fitness', 'Physical activity', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Prevention Research', 'Prevention trial', 'Primary Prevention', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Race', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recommendation', 'Records', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk Reduction', 'Sample Size', 'Standardization', 'Subgroup', 'Surrogate Markers', 'Symptoms', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'United States', 'United States Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality', 'Veterans', 'Woman', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'cardiorespiratory fitness', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'dementia risk', 'design', 'epidemiology study', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'large datasets', 'lifestyle intervention', 'molecular marker', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'precision medicine', 'prevent', 'programs', 'response', 'risk mitigation', 'risk prediction model', 'sex', 'statistical learning', 'systematic review', 'unstructured data']",NIA,GEORGE WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,RF1,2020,2005396,-0.007562074255803345
"Using natural language processing and machine learning to identify potentially preventable hospital admissions among outpatients with chronic lung diseases Project Summary Patients living with chronic lung diseases (CLDs) are frequently admitted to the hospital for potentially preventable causes. Such admissions may be discordant with patient preferences and/or represent a low-value allocation of health system resources. To anticipate such admissions, existing clinical prediction models in this ﬁeld typically produce an “all-cause” risk estimate which, even if accurate, overlooks the actionable mechanisms behind admis- sion risk and therefore fails to identify a prescribed response. This limitation may explain the only modest – at best – reductions in hospital admissions and readmissions seen in most intervention bundles that have been tested in this population. An opportunity exists, therefore, to predict hospitalization risk while simultaneously identifying patient phenotypes (i.e. some constellation of social, demographic, clinical, and other characteristics) for which known preventive interventions exist. The proposed study seeks to overcome these limitations and capitalize on this opportunity by (1) conducting semi-structured interviews with hospitalized patients with CLDs, and their caregivers and clinicians, to directly identify modiﬁable risks and their associated phenotypes driving hospital ad- missions; (2) using natural language processing techniques (NLP) to build classiﬁcation models that will leverage nuanced narrative, social, and clinical information in the unstructured text of clinical encounter notes to identify patients with these phenotypes; and (3) building risk prediction model focused on actionable phenotypes with a wide-array of traditional regression and machine learning approaches while also incorporating large numbers of predictor variables from text data and accounting for time-varying trends. The candidate's preliminary work using basic NLP techniques to signiﬁcantly improve the discrimination of clinical prediction models in an inpatient population has motivated this methodologic approach. The rising burden and costs of hospitalizations associated with CLDs, and the increasing attention from federal payers, highlights the critical nature of this work. Completion of this research will build upon the candidate's past training, which includes a Masters of Science in Health Policy Research obtained with NHLBI T32 support, and will provide the experience, education, and mentorship to allow the candidate to become a fully independent investigator. Based on the candidate's tailored training plan, he will acquire advanced skills in mixed-methods research, NLP, and trial design all through coursework, close men- toring and supervision, and direct practice. The skills will position him ideally to submit successful R01s testing the deployment of the proposed clinical prediction models in real-world settings. The candidate's primary mentor, collaborators, and advisors will ensure adherence to the proposed timeline and goals and provide a support- ive environment for him to develop an independent research career testing the real-world deployment of clinical prediction models to reduce low-value and preference-discordant care for patients with CLDs. Project Narrative Every year many people living with chronic lung diseases are admitted to the hospital despite the fact that some of these admissions may have been prevented with early identiﬁcation and intervention prior to the hospitalization. Previous attempts at preventing such hospitalizations have been limited by their ability to both accurately identify those at risk, and because most risk models do not provide a reason for the likely admission. The proposed work draws directly on the experiences of patients with chronic lung diseases who are admitted to a hospital, and then uses cutting edge statistical and computer science techniques to use information in the electronic health record to accurately predict the risk and the likely reason for future hospital admissions.",Using natural language processing and machine learning to identify potentially preventable hospital admissions among outpatients with chronic lung diseases,9906933,K23HL141639,"['Accounting', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adherence', 'Admission activity', 'Adult', 'Ambulatory Care', 'Attention', 'Automobile Driving', 'Bioinformatics', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Chronic lung disease', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Diagnosis', 'Discrimination', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Education', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health Policy', 'Health system', 'Home environment', 'Hospital Costs', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Inpatients', 'Interstitial Lung Diseases', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Machine Learning', 'Master of Science', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Nurses', 'Outpatients', 'Palliative Care', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Preferences', 'Patients', 'Pennsylvania', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Policy Research', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Primary Health Care', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Estimate', 'Social support', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'TimeLine', 'Training', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Work', 'administrative database', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical center', 'clinical encounter', 'comorbidity', 'computer science', 'cost', 'design', 'discrete data', 'end of life', 'experience', 'hospital readmission', 'improved', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'interest', 'model development', 'modifiable risk', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'preference', 'prevent', 'randomized trial', 'response', 'risk prediction model', 'skills', 'social', 'statistical learning', 'structured data', 'supportive environment', 'trend', 'trial design', 'unstructured data']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,K23,2020,194806,0.007537522558565853
"Harnessing the Electronic Health Record to Predict Risk of Cardiovascular Disease PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the single largest killer in the United States for both men and women in every racial/ethnic group. Thus, accurate and systematic evaluation of CVD risk represents an aspect of Precision Medicine that will touch every patient. CVD risk scores that are currently the standard of care are derived from research cohorts and are particularly inaccurate in women, older patients, and those with missing data. The goal of this Precision Medicine based application is to capitalize on the depth and breadth of clinical data within electronic health record (EHR) systems to revolutionize CVD risk prediction, thereby optimizing personalized care for every patient. Our proposed approach is innovative in that we have identified and addressed the most significant barriers to development of an EHR-based risk score. Novel aspects of this research include: 1) use of complete EHR data to develop and validate algorithms to define a variety of risk factors (e.g., reproductive history), thus building a comprehensive risk profile for each patient that incorporates diagnosis and procedure codes, laboratory values, clinical test results, patient provided information (e.g., alcohol use), and natural language processing of unstructured clinical text; 2) incorporation of age at onset of risk factors; 3) use of highly flexible machine learning techniques in the form of generalized boosted regression modeling; 4) exploration of a new deep learning model for censored EHR data; and 5) determination of the extent of risk reclassification in multiple geographically-defined populations, including an underserved minority population. Furthermore, genetic studies demonstrate that incorporating variants into current risk models improves risk prediction and use of an individual's genetic risk could further enhance our ability to deliver precision medicine to every patient. Therefore, we seek to develop a sex-specific next-generation CVD risk prediction score using EHR data in combination with genetic variants. This paradigm is a significant departure from the current one that relies on scores derived from relatively small research cohorts that use only a restricted set of clinical parameters that differentially misclassify an individual's risk, especially in women. Our access to empirical clinical EHR data for hundreds of thousands of patients uniquely positions us to 1) develop a sex-specific risk prediction model for incident CVD using data from the EHR; 2) assess the performance of the sex-specific EHR risk score in an independent non-urban and rural population; and 3) identify and characterize patients for whom genetic information improves CVD prediction beyond the clinical risk score. Successful completion of these aims has the potential to impact all adult patients, drive clinical practice changes to systematically collect sex-specific risk factors, and inform attempts to embed the next-generation CVD risk score into EHR systems for automated use in clinical care. PROJECT NARRATIVE Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the single largest killer in the United States. We propose to use electronic health record data to improve our ability to accurately classify risk and identify those who would benefit from preventive therapies. Improved risk prediction will shed light on the mechanisms of CVD and potentially reduce incidence, save lives, and lower health care costs.",Harnessing the Electronic Health Record to Predict Risk of Cardiovascular Disease,9838270,R01HL136659,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Algorithms', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinics and Hospitals', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Community Hospitals', 'County', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Ethnic group', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic study', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Hybrids', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Laboratories', 'Latino', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Minnesota', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Not Hispanic or Latino', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevention strategy', 'Preventive', 'Preventive therapy', 'Procedures', 'Reproducibility', 'Reproductive History', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Rural', 'Rural Population', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Touch sensation', 'United States', 'Variant', 'Wisconsin', 'Woman', 'base', 'biobank', 'cardiovascular disorder prevention', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'clinical care', 'clinical practice', 'clinical risk', 'cohort', 'deep learning', 'electronic data', 'feature extraction', 'flexibility', 'genetic information', 'genetic panel test', 'genetic variant', 'improved', 'innovation', 'men', 'multiple data types', 'next generation', 'novel', 'older patient', 'personalized care', 'phenotyping algorithm', 'precision genetics', 'precision medicine', 'prospective', 'racial and ethnic', 'research clinical testing', 'risk prediction model', 'sex', 'standard of care', 'time use', 'underserved minority']",NHLBI,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,R01,2020,794994,-0.010628180907696542
"Identifying False HPV-Vaccine Information and Modeling Its Impact on Risk Perceptions PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Human papillomavirus (HPV) is the most common sexually transmitted infection in the United States, with over 30,000 new HPV-related-cancers are diagnosed annually. Although HPV vaccines have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) since 2006 and recommended for routine vaccination for school-age girls and boys, vaccination rates remain low. One reason that has contributed to low vaccination rates is incorrect “risk perceptions” around HPV vaccines such as the high perceived risks of adverse events or side effects from the HPV vaccine. Incorrect risk perceptions are often rooted in the false information about HPV vaccines that people are exposed to in their daily life, including social media. The impact of social media on health information is substantial. Negative social-media HPV-vaccine information has been found to have an association with low vaccination coverage. Given the negative consequences of false information, there is a need to develop a robust and scalable way to detect false HPV-vaccine information before it propagates and negatively impacts behavior. The overarching goal of the proposed research is to build a model to identify false HPV-vaccine information on Twitter, demonstrate its impact on individual risk perceptions and measure its underlying mechanisms on risk perception formation. We propose a novel approach to leverage machine learning, natural language processing, network analysis, crowdsourcing/expert data annotation, psycholinguistic analysis and statistical modeling to investigate the false HPV-vaccine information collectively (in terms of its detection and propagation patterns) and individually (in terms of its impact and underlying cognitive mechanisms). Our study will first build a computational model to detect false HPV-vaccine information on Twitter. By modeling the domain-specific HPV- vaccine related text content, information-veracity related linguistic features, individual and collective user behaviors, and dissemination patterns, our model will be able to detect false HPV-vaccine information before it gets verified and spreads widely. We will then investigate the impact of false HPV-vaccine information on risk perceptions around HPV vaccination operationalized by natural language processing methods and a developed HPV-vaccine Risk Lexicon. We will further conduct psycholinguistic analysis on the false HPV-vaccine information and use statistical modeling to uncover the underlying mechanism of risk perceptions. Our study will make a critical and timely contribution to identifying the false HPV-vaccine information and its impact, which has the potential to be applied to other health topics. This proposed project will also address the National Cancer Institute priorities in promoting HPV vaccines and combating misinformation in cancer prevention and control. PROJECT NARRATIVE The uptake of human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine remains low in part because of incorrect perceptions of vaccination risks, which has been linked to the spread of false HPV-vaccine information. The proposed study seeks to build a computational model to detect false HPV-vaccine information on social media (Twitter) and determine its impact on risk perceptions of the HPV vaccine. The findings will provide important contributions to understand the impact of false health information on HPV vaccination behavior and could be expanded to other health topics.",Identifying False HPV-Vaccine Information and Modeling Its Impact on Risk Perceptions,9954963,R21CA237483,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Anxiety', 'Attitude', 'Behavior', 'Cancer Control', 'Categories', 'Cognitive', 'Communication', 'Comprehension', 'Computer Models', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Electronic cigarette', 'Event', 'Exposure to', 'Fright', 'Goals', 'Harm Reduction', 'Health', 'Human Papilloma Virus Vaccination', 'Human Papilloma Virus Vaccine', 'Human Papilloma Virus-Related Malignant Neoplasm', 'Human Papillomavirus', 'Human papilloma virus infection', 'Individual', 'Information Dissemination', 'Knowledge', 'Lesion', 'Life', 'Linguistics', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Misinformation', 'Modeling', 'National Cancer Institute', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Participant', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Plant Roots', 'Politics', 'Property', 'Psycholinguistics', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'School-Age Population', 'Semantics', 'Sexually Transmitted Diseases', 'Source', 'Statistical Models', 'Text', 'Time', 'Twitter', 'United States', 'United States Food and Drug Administration', 'Vaccination', 'Vaccines', 'Work', 'adverse event risk', 'boys', 'cancer diagnosis', 'cancer prevention', 'combat', 'crowdsourcing', 'deep learning', 'girls', 'high risk', 'information model', 'information processing', 'multilevel analysis', 'news', 'novel strategies', 'premalignant', 'prevent', 'recurrent neural network', 'response', 'risk perception', 'side effect', 'social media', 'theories', 'uptake']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT URBANA-CHAMPAIGN,R21,2020,211659,-0.07223560717826968
"Machine learning approaches towards risk assessment and prediction of adverse pregnancy outcomes PROJECT SUMMARY The primary objectives of this project include understanding the interplay between molecular, genetic and clinical factors related to adverse pregnancy outcomes (APOs), method development for accurate risk assessment of APOs well before they occur, and method development for collecting additional clinical data in routine treatment of at-risk-subjects. Towards these goals we have assembled a team of investigators with clinical, translational, and computational expertise capable of identifying novel contributors to APOs as well as facilitating clinician-patient interactions using data-driven and theoretically sound machine learning approaches. Our strategies will rely on advanced machine learning as well as integration of clinical, genetic, and molecular data and hold promise to bring precision medicine to the treatment and experience of women during and post pregnancy. We will predominantly rely on the data collected during the national “Nulliparous Pregnancy Outcomes Study: monitoring mothers-to-be”; i.e., the nuMoM2b study. Using the cohort of 10,038 nulliparous women, we will efficiently accomplish 3 Aims: to integrate genetic, clinical, and molecular features towards a deep understanding of APOs; to develop machine learning models for advanced risk prediction; and to engage in active data collection towards risk assessment and model development. Using a close collaboration between computational and clinical scientists, we believe this proposal will result in important advances in understanding the molecular and clinical aspects of APOs as well as assessing the risk for APOs and thus providing tangible contributions to maternal health.

"Using Machine Learning to Develop Just-in-Time Adaptive Interventions for Smoking Cessation PROJECT SUMMARY Mobile technology has enormous potential for delivering highly innovative, dynamic smoking cessation interventions. Phone sensors, wearable technology, and real time data collection methods such as ecological momentary assessment (EMA) have made it possible to collect a wealth of environmental and physiological data such as location, heart rate, and mood. Environmental and situational cues such as craving and proximity to others smoking are highly predictive of lapse among those trying to quit, suggesting that lapse risk is characterized by immediate, dynamic influences. Emerging strategies such as just-in-time adaptive interventions (JITAI), aim to prevent smoking lapse using tailored support delivered via mobile technology in the moments when it is most needed. Although research has identified antecedents of smoking lapse based on observations from EMA data, studies have been unable to utilize the full spectrum of contextual and environmental data available with current technology. Given the importance of dynamic influences on lapse risk, there is a critical need for strategies that accurately identify moments of highest lapse risk to improve cessation interventions. Recent research has demonstrated the utility of machine learning to predict individual behavior. Machine learning is a robust data analytic strategy that can produce highly accurate predictive models from large datasets and can automatically adapt to new data in real time. The overall objective of this application is to use supervised machine learning methods to develop an automated algorithm to quantify smoking lapse risk at the individual level. Specifically, we aim: 1) to apply supervised machine learning methods to quantify personalized risk of smoking lapse, and 2) to evaluate the feasibility and preliminary effectiveness of delivering a personalized, just-in-time adaptive intervention driven by machine learning prediction of smoking lapse risk in real time. The proposed research and training plan will take place at The University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center (OUHSC) and the Stephenson Cancer Center (SCC). Training will focus on increasing knowledge of machine learning methodology, and the conduct and analysis of JITAIs, which will facilitate completion of the proposed project. Results of the proposed research have the potential to reduce the amount and frequency of data needed from participants and sensors, enabling the development of less burdensome interventions. It is expected that completion of these aims will yield preliminary data to inform an automated, dynamic intervention that fully utilizes the strengths of mobile technology for measuring individual behavior and environmental context in real time. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed project will be among the first to use machine learning methods to predict risk of individual smoking lapse in real time. The resulting algorithm will provide a personalized model for each participant that adapts to new data and triggers the delivery of a tailored, precision intervention when it is most needed. If successful, this project and its methodology could be adapted to target other health behaviors such as diet, physical activity, or other substance use disorders.",Using Machine Learning to Develop Just-in-Time Adaptive Interventions for Smoking Cessation,9883770,K99DA046564,"['Accelerometer', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Behavior', 'Cancer Center', 'Car Phone', 'Classification', 'Control Groups', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Demographic Factors', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diet', 'Ecological momentary assessment', 'Effectiveness', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Health Sciences', 'Health behavior', 'Heart Rate', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Moods', 'Oklahoma', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Physical activity', 'Physiological', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Randomized', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Training', 'Risk', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Smoking', 'Smoking Behavior', 'Smoking Cessation Intervention', 'Social Environment', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'System', 'Technology', 'Telephone', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Wrist', 'adaptive intervention', 'automated algorithm', 'base', 'craving', 'experience', 'improved', 'innovation', 'large datasets', 'machine learning algorithm', 'machine learning method', 'mobile application', 'mobile computing', 'personalized intervention', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'psychologic', 'secondary analysis', 'sensor', 'standard care', 'supervised learning', 'trend', 'wearable device']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF OKLAHOMA HLTH SCIENCES CTR,K99,2020,87670,-0.010237087699360084
"Detecting bleeding events using EHRs for prediction in Afib Abstract Atrial fibrillation (AF) affects millions of mostly older Americans. Atrial fibrillation contributes to stroke and weighing stroke risk against risk of bleeding from oral anticoagulants (AC) is central to AF management. AC decision-making has become more complex in recent years with the introduction of several target specific oral AC agents. It remains challenging to advise older AF patients about AC since they are frequently at high risk for stroke and complications from AC, particularly bleeding, and data are limited on real-world outcomes of AC among vulnerable populations. Our project, Detecting bleeding Events using Electronic records for Prediction in Atrial Fibrillation (DEEP AF), will leverage novel biomedical natural language processing (NLP) approaches to integrate bleeding-related information from both the structured and unstructured EHR records and statistical and deep learning approaches to predict risk of bleeding on AF patients on AC therapy. DEEP AF will address present knowledge gaps to accurately identify bleeding events from longitudinal electronic health records and to improve bleeding prediction accuracy and focus on modifiable, clinically relevant risk factors, thereby facilitating future large-scale comparative effectiveness studies evaluating AC agents, and helping clinicians develop better approaches to weighing AC risks and benefits.

"Adiposity-obesity-related subgroups discovery and metabolomics analysis for chronic kidney disease Project Summary Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is prevalent in the U.S. population and is a major cause of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), cardiovascular disease morbidity, and mortality. Current gaps exist in characterizing the heterogeneity of CKD population. Obesity further increases the risks of adverse outcomes among people with impaired kidney function. However, the mechanism between obesity and CKD is not fully understood, and numerous studies have observed “obesity paradox” or survival advantage being associated with higher body fat among advanced CKD patients. In this context, the Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort (CRIC) Study provides an ideal opportunity to study the mechanism of CKD with its rich clinical information and population characteristics, as well as its availability of non-targeted high-dimensional metabolomics data. To better understand the “adiposity-obesity-related” (AOR) mechanisms of CKD and to discover novel biomarkers, we propose to identify distinct subgroups based on AOR attributes and to perform metabolomics analysis on the identified subgroups and CKD outcomes. The overall goal of this research and the training plan is to execute three studies as the subjects of a doctoral dissertation in metabolomics analysis and CKD epidemiology. First, in Aim 1, we will identify latent AOR subgroups in the CRIC CKD population using the data-driven approach of consensus clustering. We will also evaluate the utility and the independent risk discrimination performance of the AOR subgroups with key CKD outcomes (CKD progression, CVD, and death), using Cox regression model with adjustment for known CKD risk factors. Next, in Aim 2, we will perform metabolomics analysis and identify metabolites and metabolomic patterns that are associated with the different AOR subgroups. In response to the statistical challenges in analyzing the high-dimensional metabolomics data, we will implement both the machine learning random-forest algorithm and the conventional univariate and multivariate regression analysis. Finally, in Aim 3, we will investigate the relationship between CKD outcomes and the metabolites and metabolomic patterns identified in Aim 2, using Cox regression model, extended by pathway analysis and mediation analysis. Mining high-dimensional metabolomics data with AOR phenotypes in the CRIC Study holds promise to expand our knowledge of pathophysiology and molecular characterization of CKD. Future studies can be built upon these findings to improve more effective and personalized CKD management in the setting of the obesity epidemic. A rigorous curriculum including didactic and experiential learning in biomedical data mining, statistics, and advanced epidemiology will round out the applicant's training, preparing her to be an independent and collaborative investigator and a kidney disease epidemiologist at the completion of his PhD. Project Narrative Chronic kidney disease (CKD) and its risk factors of obesity, diabetes, and hypertension are prevalent in the United States. To better understand the mechanism between adiposity-obesity-related CKD mechanism, the proposed research will implement machine learning algorithms, and identify distinct patient subgroups and discover novel CKD biomarkers, using the clinical and high-dimensional metabolomics data from a diverse cohort of CKD patients. The findings of our study hold promise to expand our knowledge of pathophysiology and molecular characterization of CKD, and facilitate personalized disease management.",Adiposity-obesity-related subgroups discovery and metabolomics analysis for chronic kidney disease,9964494,F31DK122683,"['Active Learning', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Albuminuria', 'Algorithms', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Pressure', 'Body fat', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Chronic Kidney Insufficiency', 'Clinical', 'Cohort Studies', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Disease Outcome', 'Disease Progression', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Educational Curriculum', 'End stage renal failure', 'Epidemiologist', 'Epidemiology', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Glomerular Filtration Rate', 'Glucose', 'Glycosylated hemoglobin A', 'Goals', 'Height', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hypertension', 'Impairment', 'Insulin Resistance', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Knowledge', 'Kynurenine', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Mediation', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Obesity', 'Obesity Epidemic', 'Outcome Assessment', 'PTH gene', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Population Characteristics', 'Regression Analysis', 'Renal function', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Specimen', 'Subgroup', 'Techniques', 'Training', 'Troponin T', 'Tryptophan', 'United States', 'Weight', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'cohort', 'data mining', 'fibroblast growth factor 23', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'machine learning algorithm', 'metabolomics', 'mortality', 'multidimensional data', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'patient subsets', 'personalized management', 'population based', 'preservation', 'random forest', 'response', 'statistics', 'targeted biomarker', 'tool']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,F31,2020,45520,0.007879204507348773
"Genotype First: Actionable Genetic Risk through Genotype-to-Phenotype Prediction Project Summary Early disease prevention, detection, and intervention are fundamental goals for advancing human health. Meanwhile, genetic risk is, for all intents and purposes, the earliest significant contributor to common, heritable, disease risk. Thus, in theory, genetic profiling should be the ideal tool for early disease prevention. Yet, genetic factors are rarely used directly to predict future disease risk. Rather, genetic information is typically relegated to phenotype-first scenarios: providing or confirming diagnoses for individuals with overt disease or clarifying the genetic risk for individuals with a strong family history of disease. For modern genomics to make a significant impact on disease prevention the use of genomic information must transition to a genotype-first approach; prediction of genetic disease risk in otherwise healthy individuals. A major barrier to this transition includes our limited ability to predict the precise array of risks and likely phenotypic expression of disease in an individual from genetic and other risk factors. The degree of disease risk and phenotypic expression conveyed to any single individual by genetic factors is a result of a complex interplay between direct and indirect genetic effects, other unmodifiable risk factors (age, gender, ancestry, family history), and intermediate modifiable risk factors (environment, behavior, laboratory values, health status, therapy status, etc.) many of which have their own direct genetic mediators. New approaches are required to dissect this interplay in order to personalize and contextualize preventative actions that most effectively reduce overall disease risk. The overarching goal of this proposal is the development of innovative Deep learning and machine-learning approaches to integrate baseline genetic risk predictions with the measurement of traditional risk factors in order to provide more accurate and actionable predictions of disease risk. By tying genetic risk to traditional risk factors, especially modifiable risk factors, we will enable actionability by allowing both a determination of preventative actions that may be especially effective because they offset genetic risk, as well as the identification of modifiable risk factors that should be monitored and controlled proactively given increased genetic predisposition. To accomplish this goal, we propose to develop methods to: (1) infer the likely phenotypic expressivity of monogenic risk variants via a spatial covariance machine learning approach, (2) predict prevalent disease cases and the expected value of intermediate modifiable risk factors from polygenic and other unmodifiable risk factors, and finally (3) predict prevalent disease cases through interactions between baseline genetic expectations and observed (measured) intermediate modifiable risk factors in a deep learning framework. Adjusting age and modifiable risk factors in these trained models would then allow for the interactive projection of future disease risk and the identification of modifiable risk factors that, when manipulated, lead to the greatest change in future disease risk. We focus on the development of methods for coronary artery disease given its public health importance, the known utility of polygenic risk estimation, and the current evidence for polygene-by-environment interactions. In addition, the approach we propose integrates directly with current clinical decision support tools for coronary artery disease management. However, we will build a general framework that can be extended to any common heritable adult-onset condition, especially those with known heritable, traditional risk factors Project Narrative Significant investment has been placed in the identification of genetic risk factors for common diseases. Yet, outside of family history, genetic risk is almost never included in routine clinical risk assessments. The goal of this proposal is to develop deep learning methods for the integration of genetic and traditional risk factors into comprehensive disease risk prediction.",Genotype First: Actionable Genetic Risk through Genotype-to-Phenotype Prediction,10051655,R01HG010881,"['Adult', 'Age', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Blood Pressure', 'Cholesterol', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Family', 'Family history of', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Status', 'Heritability', 'Human', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Investments', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Medical Genetics', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Onset of illness', 'Output', 'Pathogenicity', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Prevention', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Sample Size', 'Training', 'Variant', 'base', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical practice', 'clinical risk', 'data standards', 'deep learning', 'disease phenotype', 'disorder prevention', 'disorder risk', 'expectation', 'feature extraction', 'feedforward neural network', 'genetic information', 'genetic predictors', 'genetic profiling', 'genetic risk factor', 'genome-wide', 'genome-wide analysis', 'improved', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'method development', 'modifiable risk', 'multitask', 'novel strategies', 'personalized intervention', 'rare variant', 'risk variant', 'supervised learning', 'support tools', 'theories', 'tool', 'unsupervised learning', 'variant of unknown significance']",NHGRI,SCRIPPS RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2020,790452,0.01986498685900564
"Addressing racial disparities in monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance and progression to multiple myeloma from a prevention perspective PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Multiple myeloma (MM) is a lethal neoplasm and a common hematologic malignancy. MM is uniformly preceded by monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS). Unlike MM, patients with MGUS are asymptomatic. The current management for MGUS is watchful waiting for disease progression. A marked racial disparity in this disease area is long-established with a 2 to 3-fold increased risk in African Americans (AAs) compared to Caucasians. Moreover, obesity is a risk factor for MM independent of race. Obesity is prevalent in U.S. adults, and particularly more prevalent among AAs than Caucasians. As a result, without any intervention, racial disparities in this disease will continue to worsen. Metformin, a widely-used, safe, well- tolerated, and inexpensive medication, induces weight loss and has been found to be more effective in glycemic control in AAs compared to Caucasians. It has also been used in prospective trials for non-diabetes indications and solid tumor malignancies. We therefore hypothesize that metformin use in MGUS patients will prevent MM and reduce MM disparities. This project plans to focus on the precursor condition of MM – MGUS. The findings from the proposed project will inform biological mechanism studies and MGUS/MM prevention trials. The long-term goal is to identify intervention strategies to prevent the progression of MGUS to MM, reduce the overall burden of MM, and reduce MM disparities. We plan to identify whether high body mass index (BMI) and/or significant change in BMI over the life course are risk factors for MGUS by race (Aim 1), utilizing linked databases with nearly lifelong follow-up of BMI and other health measures ,as well as utilizing artificial intelligence, i.e., machine learning approaches, to perform big data analyses. We will then assess racial differences in the M-protein trajectory after MGUS diagnosis in metformin versus non-metformin users in a subgroup of MGUS patients diagnosed with diabetes mellitus (Aim 2.1) and the association of metformin use with the progression of MGUS to MM (Aim 2.2). Last, we will assess racial differences in the M-protein trajectory in the subgroup of MGUS patients without diabetes mellitus (Aim 3). This project is significant in its capability to 1) identify perhaps the only modifiable risk factor (high BMI) to inform interventions to prevent MM; 2) identify a dynamic marker for disease progression by race (M-protein concentration), where these biomarkers can be a surrogate for MM diagnosis in future prevention trials; and 3) reduce MM health disparities by a) identifying race-specific biomarkers for MGUS and MGUS progression, available through clinical encounters (as opposed to expensive genetic testing); and b) exploring metformin use as a chemopreventive measure. It is innovative in its 1) focus on MM prevention rather than treatment and 2) utilization of artificial intelligence to analyze big data. Successful completion of this study will provide evidence for a paradigm shift in current clinical practice of MGUS management and help prevent MM, an incurable and costly disease. More importantly, it will provide evidence to guide interventions to reduce MM disparities. PROJECT NARRATIVE RELEVANCE: Racial disparities in multiple myeloma (MM), a common and incurable malignancy whose management is extremely costly, are long-established. Although MM is preceded by monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) by many years, no established prevention strategies exist and current clinical practice does not treat patients with MGUS; thus, racial disparities for this disease are expected to persist or even worsen due to the disproportionate burden of obesity – a known risk factor for MM – in the African American population. This project plans to study racial differences in risk factors/biomarkers for MGUS and the progression of MGUS to MM to inform future biological mechanism studies and MGUS/MM prevention trials with the goal of reducing MM health disparities.",Addressing racial disparities in monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance and progression to multiple myeloma from a prevention perspective,10055834,R01CA253475,"['Address', 'Adult', 'African American', 'Age', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Body Weight decreased', 'Body mass index', 'Caucasians', 'Chemoprevention', 'Chemopreventive Agent', 'Clinical', 'Cost of Illness', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Databases', 'Department of Defense', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Marker', 'Disease Progression', 'Economic Burden', 'Event', 'Future', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Hematologic Neoplasms', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'International Agency for Research on Cancer', 'Intervention', 'Life', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Medicare/Medicaid', 'Metformin', 'Monoclonal gammopathy of uncertain significance', 'Multiple Myeloma', 'Neoplasms', 'Obesity', 'Patient observation', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Play', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Prevention strategy', 'Prevention trial', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Race', 'Rare Diseases', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Serum', 'Solid Neoplasm', 'Subgroup', 'Variant', 'Veterans', 'base', 'carcinogenicity', 'clinical encounter', 'clinical practice', 'cost', 'diabetic', 'follow-up', 'genetic testing', 'glycemic control', 'health disparity', 'health economics', 'innovation', 'modifiable risk', 'multiple myeloma M Protein', 'preclinical study', 'premalignant', 'prevent', 'progression marker', 'prospective', 'racial difference', 'racial disparity', 'specific biomarkers', 'working group']",NCI,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,360281,0.025178416485961978

Focused coursework at HSPH and HMS will complement the experience she gains through her proposed studies of pseudogout risk factors and long-term outcomes. Training in dual- energy CT and ultrasound interpretation for crystalline arthritis will be obtained via one-on-one sessions. Her long-term career goal is to become an independent patient-oriented investigator focused on pseudogout. Environment: Dr. Tedeschi has a commitment from her Division for >75% protected time for research and career development activities during the K23 award period. Support from the Division and her primary mentor’s research funds will supplement her salary and project-related expenses. The SCS, a collaborative clinical research group in the Division of Rheumatology, has extensive infrastructure including the VERITY Bioinformatics Core (NIH-P30-AR072577, PI: Solomon) that will provide resources and expertise for the proposed studies. In addition, the BWH Arthritis Center is one of the largest nationally, facilitating subject recruitment, and the BWH Division of Musculoskeletal Imaging has state-of-the-art equipment and expertise applying dual-energy CT in crystalline arthritis. Coursework at HSPH and HMS, adjacent to BWH, will provide training necessary for Dr. Tedeschi’s development into an independent investigator. Research: Dr. Tedeschi’s long-term objective is to prevent and reduce morbidity from pseudogout, an understudied, painful crystalline arthritis that affects 8-10 million Americans. She will use natural language processing and machine learning approaches to enhance an algorithm for identifying pseudogout in EMR data. She will study risk factors for and long-term outcomes in pseudogout, harnessing vast amounts of information contained in Partners HealthCare EMR data and Medicare claims data, and will gain experience working with linked datasets. Dr. Tedeschi will recruit subjects with pseudogout and other types of mono- and oligoarthritis to test and compare the performance of dual-energy CT scanning, musculoskeletal ultrasound, and x-ray for identifying pseudogout. Her proposed K23 projects will lead to manuscripts and data to be leveraged in an R01 application focused on pseudogout during the award period, leading to independence as a patient-oriented investigator. Project Narrative The proposed studies will contribute fundamental knowledge about pseudogout, a common, painful crystalline arthritis for which we have little prognostic information and no targeted treatments. Results from the proposed projects could lead to methods for non-invasive, accurate pseudogout diagnosis, development of preventive strategies for pseudogout, and interventions to reduce cardiovascular disease risk.

"Deep probabilistic predictive models for stroke and coronary heart disease Project Summary  Cardiovascular disease negatively affects millions of people worldwide. Globally, it accounts for approximately thirty percent of all deaths. Furthermore, a significant fraction of deaths caused by cardiovascular disease occur in a non-geriatric population; fifteen percent of all worldwide deaths are attributed to cardiovascular disease for people under the age of seventy. Treatment to prevent cardiovascular events should be based on highly individualized risk prediction. High risk patients should get more aggressive treatments because the risk of disease outweighs the burden of treatment, while low risk patients should be managed more conservatively. For example, anti-thrombotic therapy for coronary heart disease may increase bleeding risk and may not be appropriate for low-risk patients. Two primary kinds of cardiovascular disease are stroke and coronary heart disease, and there have been a number of developments in risk scores for both ailments. However, these risk scores only use a small fraction of the available measurements about a patient and treat risk as a collection of independent factors rather than considering how their interactions amplify or ameliorate risk. Moreover, a majority of the popular coronary heart disease and stroke risk scores are designed to be manually computed by a busy physician at the point of care, which further limits their scope and fidelity. Next generation risk scores for stroke and cardiovascular disease should take into account all of the available information in the electronic health record without the constraints of the parametric assumptions of traditional risk modeling. More accurate risk assessment of coronary heart disease and stroke will lead to better care and reduce the cardiovascular disease burden.  Our vision is to capitalize on large collections of electronic health records along with recent advances in deep learning to build risk scores that use more available health information while making minimal mathematical assumptions about the nature of clinical risk. Our proposal propels the field from human computable independent risks calculations necessitated by previous limitations of technology to calculations that make use of deep learning to learn highly nonlinear risks and risk factor interactions. We additionally demonstrate how deep learning can be used to deal with the ever-present issue of missing values in medicine. Our proposal also targets an area under- explored by previous work on risk scores: fairness. Treatment quality is affected by the quality of risk estimation. This means populations where estimated risk is less accurate may receive worse care. Risk scores developed with simple models may only capture risk accurately for the majority population as simple models are not flexible enough to cover multiple populations. We seek to identify potential risk calculation differences with respect to race and ethnicity. We will construct and evaluate deep learning methods for coronary heart disease and stroke risk assessment from electronic health records. We will develop techniques to incorporate clinical text, handle missing data, and evaluate fairness of deep learning for cardiovascular risk scores. Finally, we will make our work available as open source code written in deep learning frameworks, at clinical conferences, and publications. Project Narrative Coronary heart disease and stroke create a large burden of disease in the world and require accurate risk assessment to aid in providing appropriate treatments. We will construct and validate deep learning risk scores for both coronary heart disease and stroke using large quantities of information from the electronic health record and take care to evaluate potential racial and ethnic biases present in the algorithm.

"Methods for High-Dimensional Statistical Inference and Individualized Risk Prediction under Semi-Competing Risks Project Summary/Abstract Patient care has been transformed by the availability of high-dimensional sources like electronic health records (EHR) and genomic data, allowing health care decisions to be tailored to individual patients. Statistical methods have been developed to efﬁciently use such high dimensional data, but critical gaps still remain. Several common models for survival analysis have recently been extended to accommodate high-dimensional variable selection and machine learning prediction methods, but similar tools have not yet been developed for the setting of semi- competing risks. In the semi-competing risks setting, interest focuses on jointly modeling both a terminal time- to-event outcome, as well as a non-terminal time-to-event outcome which can only occur for subjects who have not yet experienced the terminal event. Examples of this exist in severe pregnancy-related diseases such as pre-eclampsia (PE - further described below). PE and subsequent delivery are natural semi-competing risks, as PE can develop before delivery, but not after. Current methods do not provide analysts with data-driven tools for uncovering important covariates from high-dimensional data, and clinicians lack meaningful, personalized predictions of patients' joint probability of experiencing one or both outcomes prospectively through time.  This proposal addresses these methodological gaps with tools for high-dimensional inference and prediction. In Aim 1, I will address the challenge of variable selection by developing a suite of regularized estimators for se- lecting important covariates from large datasets into a semi-competing risks model, and evaluating performance by simulation. In Aim 2, I will create a deep feed forward neural network modeling framework for predicting individual patients' joint probabilities of experiencing one or both outcomes of interest across future time points. Together, these aims will improve personalization of health care decisions. Software will be developed that provides researchers practical and user-friendly tools for applying these methods. In Aim 3, I will apply these approaches for semi-competing risks to evaluate risk of PE, which is globally a leading cause of maternal and fetal/neonatal mortality and morbidity. Using EHR pregnancy data from 50,000 births between 2011-2020, I will use the proposed variable selection methods to develop a model identifying risk factors for PE along with factors affecting time-to-delivery among PE patients. Through this work, I will also build a deep learning model in order to jointly predict maternal PE and NICU admission of the infant, yielding personalized prediction plots to facilitate care decisions that balance maternal and fetal health risks. For ease of use by clinicians and patients, I will disseminate this prediction model using an interactive online tool. Project Narrative  Using personalized risk prediction to help clinicians and patients make health care decisions is a vital and rapidly growing way to improve outcomes and quality of care. However, in the common survival analysis setting known as semi-competing risks where both a non-terminal event and a terminal event are of interest, there lack adequate methods for modeling patients' joint risks using high-dimensional data sources such as electronic health records. The focus of this proposal is the development of statistical and machine-learning methods for this setting to predict individual patients' prospective joint risk over time of experiencing one or both outcomes of interest, and apply them to risk stratiﬁcation and individualized prediction of outcomes for preeclampsia in pregnant women.",Methods for High-Dimensional Statistical Inference and Individualized Risk Prediction under Semi-Competing Risks,9992419,F31HD102159,"['Address', 'Admission activity', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Birth', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Decision Making', 'Developed Countries', 'Developing Countries', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Equilibrium', 'Event', 'Fellowship', 'Fetal health', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Infant', 'Israel', 'Joints', 'Journals', 'Lasso', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuscripts', 'Maternal Health', 'Medical center', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Mothers', 'Neonatal', 'Neonatal Mortality', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Peer Review', 'Performance', 'Pre-Eclampsia', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnant Women', 'Premature Birth', 'Probability', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Quality of Care', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk stratification', 'Software Tools', 'Source', 'Statistical Methods', 'Survival Analysis', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Woman', 'Work', 'deep learning', 'experience', 'falls', 'feedforward neural network', 'fetal', 'flexibility', 'genomic data', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'individual patient', 'insight', 'interactive tool', 'interest', 'large datasets', 'machine learning method', 'method development', 'multidimensional data', 'neonatal morbidity', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'personalized decision', 'personalized health care', 'personalized predictions', 'personalized risk prediction', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'simulation', 'skills', 'statistical and machine learning', 'tailored health care', 'theories', 'tool', 'unborn child', 'user-friendly']",NICHD,HARVARD SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH,F31,2020,39120,0.0008533758401345014
"Quantitative Prediction of Disease and Outcomes from Next Generation SPECT and CT PROJECT SUMMARY Quantitative Prediction of Disease and Outcomes from Next Generation SPECT and CT Coronary artery disease remains a major public health problem worldwide. It causes approximately 1 of every 6 deaths in the United States. Imaging of myocardial perfusion (delivery of blood to the heart muscle) by myocardial perfusion single photon emission tomography (MPS) allows physicians to detect disease before heart attacks occur and is currently used to predict risk in millions of patients annually. Under the current grant, we have established a unique collaborative multicenter registry including over 23,000 imaging datasets (REFINE SPECT) with both prognostic (major adverse cardiovascular events) and diagnostic (invasive catheterization) outcomes. Using this registry, we have demonstrated that a combination of MPS image analysis and artificial intelligence (AI) tools achieved superior predictive performance compared to visual assessment by experienced readers or current state-of-the-art quantitative techniques. In the renewal, we plan to expand REFINE SPECT with now-available enhanced datasets (adding CT and myocardial blood flow information) and leverage latest AI advances to provide a personalized decision support tool for patient-specific cardiovascular risk assessment and estimation of benefit from revascularization following MPS. The overall aim is to optimize the clinical capabilities of MPS in risk prediction and treatment guidance by integrating all available imaging and clinical data with state-of-the-art AI methods. For this work, we propose the following 3 specific aims: (1) To expand and enhance our REFINE SPECT registry including CT and MPS flow data, (2) To develop fully automated techniques for all MPS and CT image analysis, (3) To apply explainable deep learning time-to-event AI models for optimal prediction of MACE and benefit from revascularization from all image and clinical data. This work will result in an immediately deployable clinical tool, which will optimally predict risk of adverse events and establish the relative benefits from specific therapies, beyond what is possible by subjective visual analysis and mental integration of all imaging (MPS, CT, flow), and clinical data by physicians. Such quantitative integrative methods are not yet available, leaving the current practice for assessing risk and recommending therapy highly subjective. The precise quantitative results will be presented to clinicians in easy to understand terms (e.g., % risk per year, or relative risk of one therapy vs. the alternative) for a specific patient. Additionally, our methods to make AI conclusions more tangible will improve adoption of this technology. All results will be derived fully automatically thus eliminating any variability. Our approach will fit into current MPS practice and will be immediately translatable to clinics worldwide. Most importantly, this research will allow patients to benefit from increased precision and accuracy in risk assessment, thereby optimizing the use of imaging in guiding patient management decisions and ultimately improving outcomes. PROJECT NARRATIVE Myocardial perfusion imaging with SPECT is often used to predict who is at risk of heart attack and should undergo treatment such as coronary bypass or stenting; however, physicians read images visually and report results with wide variability. With the latest artificial intelligence tools and new types of imaging (including CT and fast SPECT scans), the investigators propose to develop and validate an automated clinical tool to optimize risk prediction and objectively establish the relative benefit of a specific therapy. This new tool will consider all available patient images and other relevant information to provide a personalized explanation and precise calculation of risk and potential benefits from therapy for each patient.",Quantitative Prediction of Disease and Outcomes from Next Generation SPECT and CT,9888240,R01HL089765,"['Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Automobile Driving', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood flow', 'Calcium', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Catheterization', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Coronary Artery Bypass', 'Country', 'Cox Models', 'Cox Proportional Hazards Models', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Deposition', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Event', 'Grant', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Image Enhancement', 'Injections', 'International', 'Joints', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Myocardial', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Myocardial perfusion', 'Myocardium', 'Outcome', 'Patient imaging', 'Patients', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Perfusion', 'Photons', 'Physicians', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Psyche structure', 'Public Health', 'Reader', 'Recommendation', 'Registries', 'Relative Risks', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Estimate', 'Risk Factors', 'Scanning', 'Site', 'Statistical Models', 'Stents', 'Stress', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States', 'Visual', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'adverse event risk', 'attenuation', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'clinically relevant', 'deep learning', 'experience', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'multidisciplinary', 'next generation', 'non-invasive imaging', 'novel', 'perfusion imaging', 'personalized decision', 'prognostic', 'radiotracer', 'relating to nervous system', 'single photon emission computed tomography', 'support tools', 'time use', 'tomography', 'tool']",NHLBI,CEDARS-SINAI MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2020,808131,-0.03847764100066085
"Harnessing the power of CTSA-CDRN data networks: Using social determinants of health, frailty and functional status to identify at-risk patients and improve risk adjustment Postoperative complications and readmissions rates are higher in minority and low socioeconomic status (SES) patients. Low SES is associated with frailty, one of the best predictors of 30-day postoperative complications and early hospital readmission. Despite their influence on health outcomes, frailty and social risk factors are not considered in risk adjustment for reimbursement and quality measures. CMS developed financial incentive- based programs to improve quality of care. Yet this strategy disproportionately penalizes minority-serving, major teaching and safety net hospitals (SNH), further constraining resources for the care of vulnerable populations. Our long-term goal is to use frailty and social risk factors to identify at-risk patients to design more effective clinical care pathways. Frailty can be derived retrospectively using the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (ACS NSQIP) dataset. Data networks are powerful research tools that can be used to answer important questions. However, extracting data from EHR is challenging. The Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI) developed 13 Clinical Data Research Networks (CDRN) that have considerable overlapping membership with Clinical Translational Science Award (CTSA) institutions. While steady progress has been made, multiple barriers exist to efficiently access and use data. We will engage 3 CTSA hubs, each members of a different CDRN, to locally merge identified datasets developing data accessing and linking strategies at diverse institutions for dissemination across sites within CDRNs and to ultimately perform similar studies across CDRNs. We will use the SMART IRB reliance platform to harmonize the regulatory approval process as much as possible for each step of this project to identify barriers to use in data networks. We propose the following Aims: 1) Determine the predictive power of ethnicity, race, SES, and frailty for postoperative complications, mortality  and readmissions to improve risk adjustment at 3 CTSA/CDRNs 2) Estimate postoperative functional status using natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning  algorithms on inpatient physical therapy (PT), occupational therapy (OT) and nursing notes for ACS NSQIP  patients to predict long-term functional status 3) Develop methods to predict long-term loss of independence after major surgery 4) Determine hospital resource utilization stratified by SES, frailty and minority status The significance of our study is the incorporation of social risk factors, frailty and functional status in risk adjustment forming the basis for future interventions by targeting patients at the highest risk for postoperative complications and reducing health care disparities. Our innovative approach harnesses data sources at diverse institutions with the goal of disseminating these methods across 3 CDRNs and the CTSA network. Project Narrative: Patients with social risk factors, including poverty, being a minority, lack of an education and frailty are all associated with having worse health outcomes and with more difficulties recovering after surgical procedures. Safety net hospitals take care of many people with social risk factors and are being judged on the quality of care provided without accounting for the challenges faced by poor people. We will study the effect of social risk factors and frailty on health outcomes after surgery to identify patients that would benefit from care pathways that help poor and/or frail people.","Harnessing the power of CTSA-CDRN data networks: Using social determinants of health, frailty and functional status to identify at-risk patients and improve risk adjustment",9981049,U01TR002393,"['Accounting', 'Agreement', 'Ambulatory Care Facilities', 'American', 'American College of Surgeons', 'Authorization documentation', 'Caring', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical and Translational Science Awards', 'Community Surveys', 'Costs and Benefits', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Discipline of Nursing', 'Education', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Fibrinogen', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hispanics', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Inpatients', 'Institution', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'Intervention', 'Link', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Occupational Therapy', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Physical therapy', 'Postoperative Complications', 'Postoperative Period', 'Poverty', 'Predictive Analytics', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quality of Care', 'Race', 'Recovery of Function', 'Registries', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Institute', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Adjustment', 'Risk Factors', 'Site', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Testing', 'Text', 'United States Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'base', 'clinical care', 'cost effective', 'data access', 'design', 'electronic data', 'financial incentive', 'frailty', 'functional status', 'health care disparity', 'high risk', 'hospital readmission', 'improved', 'incentive program', 'innovation', 'low socioeconomic status', 'machine learning algorithm', 'member', 'mortality', 'outcome prediction', 'payment', 'postoperative recovery', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'readmission rates', 'safety net', 'simulation', 'social', 'social health determinants', 'tool', 'usability']",NCATS,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCIENCE CENTER,U01,2020,100000,0.00356104615509853
"Identifying Personalized Risk of Acute Kidney Injury with Machine Learning PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) is a common and highly lethal health problem, affecting 10-15% of all hospitalized patients and >50% of patients in intensive care units (ICUs). It has been shown that a small increase in serum creatinine (SCr) of ≥0.5 mg/dl was associated with a 6.5-fold increase in the odds of death, a 3.5-day increase in length of stay, and nearly $7,500 in excess hospital costs. Unfortunately, no specific treatment exists to cure AKI once it has developed. The ability to predict AKI in hospitalized patients would provide clinicians the opportunity to modify care pathways and implement interventions, which could in turn prevent AKI and yield better outcomes. Although electronic medical record (EMR) based monitoring systems for AKI have led to expedited interventions and may increase the percentage of patients returning to baseline kidney function, most of these systems are reactive rather than proactive, with little or no contribution to AKI prevention. Moreover, our current knowledge of AKI risk factors is far from complete, especially in the ICU and general inpatient populations, characterized by numerous deficiencies and systematic failings that may be avoidable To transform the reactive AKI care to proactive and personalized care, early identification of high risk patients and better understanding of individual modifiable risk factors for AKI is the key. In Aim 1, to discover novel risk factors predictive of AKI, we propose to develop an ensemble multi-view feature selection framework to simultaneously consider the differences and interrelations between feature spaces and obtain robust knowledge by synthesizing findings from diverse patient populations across multiple institutions in nine US states. In Aim 2, to discover general modifiable causes of AKI to help physicians design more effective AKI prevention policies, we propose to develop a novel multi-cause inference method to identify causal relationships between modifiable factors and AKI for susceptible patient subgroups. In Aim 3, to explain what caused AKI in individual patients to support physicians in designing personalized AKI intervention, we propose to develop a new causal explanation method by integrating causal inference and case based reasoning to quantify patient-level causal significance of modifiable factors. The proposed study will have a significant clinical impact by not only expanding the capacity of clinicians to identify high risk patients for AKI early and advancing the general knowledge on causal and modifiable risk factors for AKI but also supporting personalized AKI intervention with suggestions on potential patient-specific actionable items. The work will not only advance AKI but also the machine learning and clinical research informatics community and the methodology developed is generalizable to other clinical domains. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research is to identify clinical risk factors of acute kidney injury (AKI) in hospitalized patients from electronic medical records (EMRs) with machine learning. AKI risk factors discovered from EMR of diverse populations from multiple institutions across nine US states will be reliable and robust and can assist clinicians in providing proactive and personalized care to high-risk patients.",Identifying Personalized Risk of Acute Kidney Injury with Machine Learning,10003227,R01DK116986,"['Acute Renal Failure with Renal Papillary Necrosis', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Communities', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Creatinine', 'Data', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Early identification', 'Elderly', 'Event', 'Exposure to', 'Geographic Locations', 'Geographic state', 'Health', 'Health system', 'Hospital Costs', 'Hospital Mortality', 'Hospitals', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Injury to Kidney', 'Inpatients', 'Institution', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Intervention', 'Kidney', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Length of Stay', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Myocardial', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Physiology', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Predictive Factor', 'Renal function', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Sepsis', 'Series', 'Serum', 'Suggestion', 'System', 'Time', 'Work', 'adjudication', 'base', 'case-based', 'clinical predictors', 'clinical risk', 'design', 'feature selection', 'heterogenous data', 'high dimensionality', 'high risk', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'injury prevention', 'machine learning algorithm', 'modifiable risk', 'mortality risk', 'nephrotoxicity', 'novel', 'patient population', 'patient subsets', 'personalized care', 'prevent']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF KANSAS MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2020,506170,0.0033146792427319028
"Leveraging machine learning to improve risk prediction for chemotherapy induced neuropathy Project Summary/Abstract Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) affects more than two-thirds of adults with invasive cancer who receive select adjuvant chemotherapies (e.g., taxanes, platinum analogs). Severe CIPN symptoms can lead to chemotherapy dose reductions, treatment delays, or changes in treatment regimens; thereby affecting the potential curative effects of chemotherapy. For some patients, CIPN symptoms can persist over time, contributing to lower quality of life.  Little is known about risk factors for CIPN. Chemotoxicity risk scores have been developed and evaluated for use among elderly patients receiving chemotherapy. However, these tools generally report moderate predictive accuracy (60%-70%), small sample sizes, and short-term follow up. We are aware of no publicly available, validated risk models to assess risk of severe and chronic CIPN among diverse patients at risk for this potentially disabling side effect.  The goal of this proposal is to identify patients at risk for CIPN and to understand how patients and provider interpret and use CIPN risk information in clinical decision-making. Focusing on more than 8,500 insured adults (18+) diagnosed with invasive, stage I-III breast and II-IIIA colorectal cancers (2013-2021) who received adjuvant chemotherapy treatment with known risk for CIPN, we will develop and validate predictive models to quantify the risk of severe CIPN and incident chronic CIPN and assess how CIPN risk information might be used to inform clinical decision-making about cancer treatment and survivorship care planning.  We hypothesize that CIPN risk is a high priority for patients in thinking about treatment choice and survivorship care planning. In addition, we hypothesize that the relative importance of CIPN risk for patient and provider decision-making will vary by patient characteristics (e.g., age, cancer stage). We anticipate that the risk of severe and chronic CIPN can be predicted with a high degree of accuracy using electronic health records and machine learning methods.  The study team has significant and complementary expertise in health services research, biostatistics and predictive modeling, oncology practice, cancer epidemiology, pharmacotherapy, drug safety and the patient care experience. To our knowledge, this will be one of the first studies to develop and validate a CIPN predictive model that can be used by oncology teams to inform treatment and care planning decisions and improve patient-valued outcomes. Translation and replication of the findings will be catalyzed through publication in peer-reviewed journals and the development and distribution of free software to facilitate testing and adaptation of the resulting risk models across diverse systems of care. Narrative Two out of three people treated with select types of chemotherapy experience a side effect known as peripheral neuropathy that causes pain, discomfort and numbness in the extremities and contributes to poor quality of life. We do not know who is at greatest risk for this side effect or how patients and providers weigh the risks of neuropathy against the potentially life-saving benefits of cancer treatment. The proposed study will help identify patients at high risk for chemotherapy induced neuropathy and assess how patients and clinicians might use information about neuropathy risk to make better informed decisions about cancer care.",Leveraging machine learning to improve risk prediction for chemotherapy induced neuropathy,9955985,R01CA249127,"['Address', 'Adjuvant Chemotherapy', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Awareness', 'Biometry', 'Breast', 'Cancer Survivorship', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dose', 'Dose-Limiting', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Goals', 'Health Services Research', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Interview', 'Journals', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Limb structure', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mental Depression', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Nature', 'Neuropathy', 'Numbness', 'Obesity', 'Oncology', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Preferences', 'Patients', 'Peer Review', 'Peripheral Nervous System Diseases', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Platinum', 'Prevention', 'Provider', 'Publications', 'Quality of life', 'Race', 'Reporting', 'Risk', 'Risk Estimate', 'Risk Factors', 'Sample Size', 'Savings', 'Statistical Models', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'Translations', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Vinca Alkaloids', 'analog', 'associated symptom', 'base', 'cancer care', 'cancer epidemiology', 'cancer invasiveness', 'cancer therapy', 'cancer type', 'care systems', 'chemotherapy', 'chemotherapy induced neuropathy', 'clinical decision-making', 'community based practice', 'comorbidity', 'disability', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'fall risk', 'follow-up', 'health care settings', 'high risk', 'improved', 'machine learning method', 'mathematical ability', 'medication safety', 'neurotoxicity', 'older patient', 'predictive modeling', 'side effect', 'survivorship', 'taxane', 'tool', 'treatment choice', 'treatment duration']",NCI,KAISER FOUNDATION RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2020,663447,0.01376684436870179
"Neurodegenerative diseases and the role of green space: A deep learning assessment PROJECT SUMMARY Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD) have well-established risk factors such as physical activity (PA), depression, and hypertension (HTN). These risk factors disproportionately affect racial minority populations, but the mechanisms underlying racial health disparities are not well understood. In this, geographic factors could be key, as PA, depression and HTN are strongly affected by geographic exposures, including green space. However, green space is typically measured with questionnaires, which have substantial error, or satellite-based indexes that are nonspecific and provide no information on the type of vegetation (e.g., tree vs. grass), nor whether the vegetation is within view at the street level. As a result, no study has quantified the contribution of green space to racial disparities in ADRD. And while novel technologies such as Google Street Views (GSV) imaging are promising data sources for capturing unique measures of green space, managing, processing, and analyzing high-dimensional data present significant logistical and analytical challenges, especially when linking these data to existing data from large prospective cohorts. Finally, we need to understand green space in the context of other potentially correlated geographic exposures, or the urban exposome—the totality of life- course geographic exposures (the set of green space, air pollutants, noise, built environment, and social environment)—to estimate which factors drive health. This proposal will address these challenges by using GSV imaging to assess the effect of green space on PA, depression, and HTN, as well as subsequent ADRD risk within the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA)—a 10-year longitudinal study of 6,814 men and women without clinical cardiovascular disease at baseline from 4 racial/ethnic groups (Non-Hispanic White, African-American, Chinese, and Hispanic). Aim 1 will quantify the effect of specific aspects of green space (e.g. trees, grass, shrubs, plants) on ADRD and cognitive decline and evaluate whether these associations differ according to race/ethnicity. Aim 2 will determine the indirect effect of green space on ADRD that is mediated through PA, depression, and HTN. Aim 3 will quantify exposome associations with ADRD and cognitive decline using untargeted data-driven approaches in conjunction with dimension reduction techniques and evaluate whether they differ according to race/ethnicity. This research plan is complemented by a training plan that builds on the applicant’s background in epidemiology and biostatistics and includes new training in (1) implementing deep learning algorithms to analyze high-resolution geographic data, (2) cognitive function epidemiology, and (3) developing and refining data-driven approaches to perform exposome-informed epidemiological studies. These combined plans will successfully prepare the applicant for an independent research career focused on identifying modifiable geographic determinants of ADRD in diverse populations using innovative measures of geographic context. Project Narrative Green space or trees and natural vegetation can provide mental health benefits and possibly lower risk of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD); however, green space is often measured poorly in epidemiologic research. I propose to integrate high-resolution images from Google Street Views to derive ground-level objective measurements of green space into a diverse prospective cohort study using deep learning algorithms, mediation analysis and geographic mixtures. This research will enable unprecedented perspectives on exposures that drive ADRD and related cognitive decline risk, and will provide translational insights into potential interventions to optimize opportunities for ADRD prevention and reduce racial disparities in ADRD.",Neurodegenerative diseases and the role of green space: A deep learning assessment,9952648,K99AG066949,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'African American', 'Age', 'Air Pollutants', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Baltimore', 'Biological', 'Biometry', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Chicago', 'Chinese People', 'Cities', 'Clinical', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'County', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Elderly', 'Environment', 'Environmental Hazards', 'Epidemiology', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Ethnic group', 'Exposure to', 'Family', 'Funding', 'Geographic Factor', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Green space', 'Health', 'Health Benefit', 'Healthcare', 'Hispanics', 'Hypertension', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Impaired cognition', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Logistics', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Los Angeles', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'New York', 'Noise', 'Not Hispanic or Latino', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Physical activity', 'Plants', 'Poaceae', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Prevention strategy', 'Prospective cohort', 'Prospective cohort study', 'Questionnaires', 'Race', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Social Environment', 'Social Impacts', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'Trees', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Woman', 'aged', 'base', 'built environment', 'career', 'cognitive function', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'dementia risk', 'design', 'economic impact', 'epidemiology study', 'ethnic minority population', 'healthy aging', 'high resolution imaging', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'insight', 'longitudinal analysis', 'men', 'multidimensional data', 'neurocognitive disorder', 'new technology', 'novel', 'physical inactivity', 'public health intervention', 'racial and ethnic', 'racial disparity', 'racial health disparity', 'racial minority', 'segmentation algorithm', 'skills', 'urban public health']",NIA,HARVARD SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH,K99,2020,129600,-0.007860550252004453
"Project Motivate: A digital motivation and prediction platform to improve treatment retention and reduce relapse in opioid use disorder PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The opioid crisis is the deadliest drug epidemic in American history and new approaches are needed. One novel approach includes predicting likelihood of opioid use disorder (OUD) treatment retention by assessing someone’s risk of early departure from treatment. Current methods to improve treatment retention rely on providers using their intuition to identify when an individual is at risk of leaving treatment early in order to intervene, which often happens too late. Mobile health and machine learning predictive analytics offer a new opportunity to personalize OUD treatment, improve retention in OUD care, and mitigate the risk of relapse and overdose episodes. Project Motivate will combine physiological and behavioral data from disparate sources in order to predict when an individual is at risk of early departure from OUD treatment. This data will be displayed in a user-friendly manner so that providers can more effectively support patients to remain in treatment with timely intervention and responses. PROJECT NARRATIVE Early departure from opioid use disorder treatment programs is common, with early termination rates over 50% for many opioid use disorder treatments, putting individuals at an increased risk of relapsing, overdose and death. Using physiological monitoring tools to predict the likelihood that someone is at risk of early departure from opioid use disorder treatment due to worsening symptoms and/or cravings will allow for proactive interventions that will improve treatment retention. Making an impact here will not only save lives, but it will also lower medical costs, municipal emergency response costs, recidivism, workplace accidents, lost workplace productivity and costs to families.",Project Motivate: A digital motivation and prediction platform to improve treatment retention and reduce relapse in opioid use disorder,10013066,R43DA051279,"['Accidents', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Applications Grants', 'Beds', 'Behavioral', 'Caring', 'Cellular Phone', 'Cessation of life', 'Chest', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Reporting', 'Disadvantaged', 'Dropout', 'Early treatment', 'Emergency response', 'Ensure', 'Epidemic', 'Family', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Heart Rate', 'Heroin', 'Image', 'Imaging technology', 'Individual', 'Inpatients', 'Intervention', 'Intuition', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Moods', 'Motion', 'Motivation', 'Municipalities', 'Overdose', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Physiologic Monitoring', 'Physiological', 'Predictive Analytics', 'Prescription drug overdose', 'Productivity', 'Professional counselor', 'Program Development', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Regulatory Pathway', 'Relapse', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Residential Treatment', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Sleep', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Source', 'Stress', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States', 'Visualization software', 'Weather', 'Workplace', 'Wrist', 'base', 'clinical decision support', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'craving', 'dashboard', 'data visualization', 'digital', 'early onset', 'experience', 'heart rate variability', 'improved', 'mHealth', 'machine learning algorithm', 'meetings', 'member', 'motivational intervention', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'opioid epidemic', 'opioid overdose', 'opioid use disorder', 'overdose death', 'patient engagement', 'personalized intervention', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'premature', 'prevent', 'prototype', 'recidivism', 'relapse risk', 'response', 'sensor', 'sleep quality', 'tool', 'treatment program', 'user-friendly', 'validation studies', 'wearable device']",NIDA,"BIOMOTIVATE, LLC",R43,2020,251492,-0.03545544773380471
"Effects of Chronic Kidney Disease on Cardiovascular Disease and Dementia Among People with Diabetes: Causal Modeling with Machine Learning Approach PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Diabetes has been the major public health issues imposing substantial health and economic burden on individuals and society. Given the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in which United Nations has resolved to reduce morbidity and mortality from non-communicable diseases by one-third by year 2030, understanding the major risk factors of long-term adverse health outcomes such as cardiovascular disease (CVD) among patients with diabetes are imperative. While chronic kidney disease (CKD) and depression are closely interrelated with both diabetes and CVD, the causal link between these non-communicable diseases have not been sufficiently established. This is possibly due to (1) ill-defined temporality (i.e. unclear time- ordering of disease occurrence) and (2) their complex multifactorial and high-dimensional interaction with potential confounders such as demographic characteristics, socio-economic status, and comorbidities. The overall objective of this application is to investigate the causal relationship between diabetes and its complications including CKD. My specific aims are as follows: Aim 1 (F99 phase) assesses the causal relationship between depression and CVD among people with diabetes. After summarizing the previous literature, I will utilize longitudinal data to examine the joint effect of diabetes and depression on CVD sufficiently considering time-dependent exposure and confounders. Aim 2 (K00 phase) examines the causal pathway from diabetes to CKD, and to CVD mortality. I will develop the machine learning-based prediction model of CKD among people with diabetes, and then estimate the effect of CKD on CVD mortality using the obtained prediction model within causal inference structure. I will also investigate the extent to which CKD mediates the pathway from diabetes to CVD mortality. This study presents a timely opportunity to contribute to growing literature on how these non-communicable diseases (i.e. diabetes, depression, CKD, and CVD) interact with each other. Moreover, applications of machine learning in causal inference structure will contribute to the “precision health” concept by targeting high-risk populations and design effective interventions to prevent future non-communicable diseases and their complications. PROJECT NARRATIVE Diabetes, depression, chronic kidney disease (CKD), and Cardiovascular disease (CVD) are major health concerns imposing substantial health and economic burden on individuals and society. This study proposes to estimate the effects of depression on CVD events among people with diabetes (F99 phase) and investigate the causal relationship between diabetes, CKD, and CVD mortality using machine learning within the causal inference structure (K00 phase). This project will provide research and training, contributing a much-needed analysis of diabetes and CKD on long-term adverse health outcomes as well as helping me develop into an independent researcher with expertise in diabetic kidney disease epidemiology.",Effects of Chronic Kidney Disease on Cardiovascular Disease and Dementia Among People with Diabetes: Causal Modeling with Machine Learning Approach,10059131,F99DK126119,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Aging', 'Area', 'Award', 'Big Data', 'Biological Markers', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diabetic Nephropathy', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Economic Burden', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Epidemiology', 'Event', 'Fostering', 'Future', 'General Population', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Laboratories', 'Latino', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Longitudinal cohort', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Mental Depression', 'Mentors', 'Metabolic Diseases', 'Methodology', 'Mexican Americans', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Precision Health', 'Prevalence', 'Probability', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Risk Factors', 'Scoring Method', 'Societies', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Sustainable Development', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United Nations', 'United States', 'Update', 'Weight', 'base', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'causal model', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'demographics', 'depressive symptoms', 'design', 'diabetic patient', 'diet and exercise', 'effective intervention', 'epidemiology study', 'follow-up', 'health economics', 'high dimensionality', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'innovation', 'lifestyle intervention', 'mortality', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'successful intervention', 'therapy development']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,F99,2020,34360,0.0008516038704846323
"Adverse pregnancy outcomes in women with systemic lupus erythematosus: improving and validating risk prediction ABSTRACT: Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) predominantly affects women during reproductive years, raising concerns regarding maternal and fetal health during pregnancy. Although physicians no longer uniformly discourage women with SLE from childbearing, patients face 20% likelihood of adverse pregnancy outcomes (APO), including preeclampsia, fetal and neonatal death, growth restriction, and preterm delivery, even during clinical disease quiescence. Because there are no established instruments to predict APO in individual patients, SLE pregnancies are intensely monitored at an emotional cost to patients and financial burden to society. The ability to identify, early in pregnancy, patients at high risk of APO would significantly enhance our capacity to clinically manage patients. Furthermore, validated risk stratification models are needed to design and execute trials to prevent APOs. In PROMISSE, the largest multi-center, multi-ethnic and multi-racial study of pregnant SLE patients to date, several risk factors were identified as significant predictors of APO. Although a major advance, these results have neither been externally validated nor shown to generalize to independent study populations. Moreover, risk factors were identified using standard statistical models that did not fully account for complex effects of multiple predictor variables. In this project, an international team of SLE, obstetric and biostatistics researchers, led by PROMISSE investigators, will rigorously develop and externally validate an APO prediction model by leveraging data from PROMISSE (N=447), as well as five independent cohorts of lupus patients from different countries (total N = 979). In Aim 1, powerful machine learning algorithms will be applied to PROMISSE data to create an accurate and clinically useful model to predict APOs in SLE patients. To maximize utility of this model in the real world, only clinical and laboratory features that are routinely and accurately assessed on SLE patients during clinical care will be considered as potential predictors. In Aim 2, the APO model will be externally validated in prospective cohorts of pregnant lupus patients from Europe (France: N=246; Germany: N=180; Norway: N=349) and regions in the US, not included in PROMISSE (South Carolina: N=82; Bronx, NY: N=122). These cohorts are heterogeneous with respect to race, ethnicity, socioeconomic strata, and SLE disease activity, allowing for a thorough investigation into generalizability and transportability of the APO model to diverse lupus patient populations. In each cohort, detailed baseline and longitudinal clinical, laboratory and pregnancy outcome data have been obtained using procedures similar to those in PROMISSE. The overarching goal is development of an online risk calculator that will significantly improve real world clinical decision making and enable risk stratification for future APO prevention trials. Impact: An accurate, validated, and user-friendly prediction model for APO is necessary for effective clinical care of pregnant lupus patients, optimal allocation of healthcare resources, and the design of and recruitment to future clinical trials of experimental interventions to prevent APO. Project Narrative Pregnancies in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) are at increased risk for poor outcomes, such as very premature delivery, fetal death or growth restriction, yet there are no validated instruments to predict pregnancy outcomes in individual patients and focus care on those most likely to have serious complications. Our proposal is to develop and validate a prediction model that can be used to identify, early in pregnancy, SLE patients at high risk for adverse outcomes. This tool will significantly enhance the capacity to manage these patients, optimize allocation of healthcare resources, and design and conduct trials of new treatments to prevent the placental insufficiency that can result in poor outcomes.",Adverse pregnancy outcomes in women with systemic lupus erythematosus: improving and validating risk prediction,9873121,R21AR076612,"['Adopted', 'Affect', 'Angiogenic Factor', 'Antihypertensive Agents', 'Antiphospholipid Antibodies', 'Antiphospholipid Syndrome', 'Autoantibodies', 'Biological Markers', 'Biometry', 'Blood Platelets', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complement Activation', 'Complex', 'Conceptions', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Discipline of obstetrics', 'Disease', 'Emotional', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Europe', 'Face', 'Failure', 'Fetal Death', 'Fetal Growth Retardation', 'Fetal health', 'Fetus', 'Financial Hardship', 'Financial cost', 'First Pregnancy Trimester', 'France', 'Future', 'Germany', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Healthcare', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Laboratories', 'Lupus', 'Lupus Coagulation Inhibitor', 'Maternal Health', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mothers', 'Norway', 'Outcome', 'Patient Focused Care', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Placenta', 'Placental Insufficiency', 'Pre-Eclampsia', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Outcome', 'Premature Birth', 'Prevention trial', 'Procedures', 'Prospective cohort', 'Race', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk stratification', 'Salmon', 'Schedule', 'Societies', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'South Carolina', 'Statistical Models', 'Systemic Lupus Erythematosus', 'Testing', 'Vascularization', 'Woman', 'adverse outcome', 'adverse pregnancy outcome', 'child bearing', 'clinical care', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'cost', 'design', 'fetal', 'high risk', 'hypoperfusion', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'instrument', 'machine learning algorithm', 'machine learning method', 'maternal risk', 'model development', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'neonatal death', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'patient population', 'predictive modeling', 'pregnant', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'random forest', 'recruit', 'reproductive', 'socioeconomics', 'study population', 'tool', 'user-friendly']",NIAMS,HOSPITAL FOR SPECIAL SURGERY,R21,2020,249418,0.0018485806995685605
"Alignment of cortical development trajectories with emergent dimensional psychopathology and related risk factors among early adolescents in the ABCD Study Efforts to decipher biological signatures for mental illness now focus increasingly on adolescence, a period of rapid brain development that immediately precedes the peak age of onset for many disorders. Maturation of the cerebral cortex during this time has long been thought to mediate emergence of early symptoms. However, while specific cortical changes have been implicated in a small number of specific syndromes, for the most part, patterns in cortical development that underlie the differentiation of psychopathology remain uncertain. The ongoing Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study provides an unprecedented opportunity to align emergence of specific patterns of psychopathology with specific changes in cortical maturation. Over the next 5 years, ABCD will obtain annual, standardized measures dimensional psychopathology, and biennial MRI scans, of 11,875 youths across 21 US-based sites, covering age 9 to 16. The proposed studies will leverage this longitudinal design to discover regionally- and temporally-specific features of cortical development that associate with emergence of dimensional psychopathology, and then to relate these patterns to specific profiles of underlying genomic and environmental risk. Analysis of baseline data from age 9-10, included in this application, indicates that psychopathology is in early stages of differentiation, although already strongly related to polygenic risk for child-onset disorders, and to well- established pre- and post-natal environmental insults. Aim 1 of the proposed studies will juxtapose clinical and imaging data from baseline through three follow-up time points, focusing primarily on whether departures from neurotypical age-related cortical thinning trajectories (assessed via intercept, slope, and quadratic indices) associate with emergence of specific dimensions of illness. The precise temporal alignment of clinical and cortical thinning trajectories will take an initial step towards inferring causal relationships, which will be further substantiated through triangulation with genomic (Aim 2) and environmental (Aim 3) risk profiles. Polygenic scoring methods developed by the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium will be used to determine whether cortical maturation trajectories developed in Aim 1 mediate relationships between genomic risk and emergent dimensional psychopathology. Then, using data from hundreds of environmental measures that canvass participants’ daily activities, nutrition, life stressors, socioeconomic status, family dynamics, neighborhood safety, and numerous other factors, we will use novel machine learning methods to develop profiles of exposomic risk factors that predict emergent dimensional psychopathology, and determine whether cortical maturation patterns mediate the relationship between environmental risk profiles and clinical course. By the conclusion of the proposed studies we hope to establish specific cortical signatures that bridge causal factors with emergent psychopathology in adolescence, and that can be leveraged to develop new preventative interventions. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Adolescence is a critical period for emergence of a range of psychiatric syndromes, as well as for maturation of the cerebral cortex. Investigators have long presumed these events to be linked, potentially in ways that can predict specific clinical outcomes, but until now we have lacked data from sufficiently large, prospective studies to establish definitive or tractable patterns. Leveraging data from the ongoing Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development Study (n=11,875), we will map emergent psychopathology across a range of symptoms to specific patterns of cortical development from age 9 to 16, and anchor these relationships to mediating genomic and environmental risk factors.",Alignment of cortical development trajectories with emergent dimensional psychopathology and related risk factors among early adolescents in the ABCD Study,10096054,R01MH124694,"['Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Age of Onset', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Cerebral cortex', 'Child', 'Child Behavior Checklist', 'Clinical', 'Clinical assessments', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Data', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Enrollment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemiology', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Family', 'Family dynamics', 'Foundations', 'Genomics', 'Heritability', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Intercept', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Link', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Mood Disorders', 'Onset of illness', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Plant Roots', 'Predictive Factor', 'Prevention', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Process', 'Prospective Studies', 'Psychopathology', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Scoring Method', 'Site', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Thinness', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'Youth', 'age related', 'base', 'cognitive development', 'critical period', 'effective intervention', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'genomic data', 'indexing', 'longitudinal design', 'machine learning method', 'neighborhood safety', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'nutrition', 'polygenic risk score', 'precision medicine', 'prenatal', 'psychiatric genomics', 'spatiotemporal', 'standardize measure', 'stressor', 'theories']",NIMH,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2020,413200,0.002804261896835106
"Cardiovascular Health After Placental Abruption (CHAP) Abstract Placental abruption is an obstetrical complication defined as premature placental separation. Despite its elusive etiology, it is believed to be the consequence of acute stimuli – ischemia, inflammation, and oxidative stress at the maternal‐fetal interface – associated with rupture of the decidual artery, resulting in (premature) placental separation. The study of abruption and maternal and newborn long‐term cardiovascular and hemorrhagic/thrombotic cerebrovascular events is the central focus of the proposed project. We will examine the long‐term impact of abruption on rates of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular morbidity and mortality in women and in their children. We will also investigate the relationship of clinical classification (mild and severe forms) of abruption, risks based on abruption across successive pregnancies, and abruption in twin pregnancies, on rates of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events. We will undertake a causal mediation analysis to evaluate the extent to which these associations may be mediated through (i) preterm delivery and (ii) small for gestational age births. We will perform this analysis by clinical classification of abruption and estimate the extent of mediation following corrections for both measured (socio‐demographic characteristics, including maternal smoking, comorbid medical conditions, and obstetrical events), and unmeasured confounding. A unique aspect of this project will be to identify, through applications of Support Vector Machines and Deep Learning algorithms, subsets of women at high risk for abruption and cardiovascular and cerebrovascular mortality and morbidity. Finally, we will examine whether maternal race/ethnicity and socioeconomic status are effect measure modifiers of the association between abruption and risks of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events. We propose to address these aims through a large population‐based epidemiologic study, utilizing data from the Myocardial Infarction Data Acquisition System (MIDAS), a New Jersey statewide database of all patients admitted to all non‐federal acute care hospitals in NJ with a CVD diagnosis, with longitudinal follow‐up of up to 30 years. The MIDAS data will be linked to the NJ fetal death and linked live birth‐ infant death data with associated maternal and newborn hospitalization data between 1980‐2017 to create one of the largest and most comprehensive databases in the US to evaluate the extent to which sentinel events in pregnancy impart lasting risk for women's and children's health later in life. This project will provide unprecedented opportunities to address public health, policy implications and clinical screening recommendations of women during the period following delivery regarding risk susceptibility to cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease. PROJECT NARRATIVE (PUBLIC HEALTH SIGNIFICANCE) The overarching goal of this project is to examine the associations between placental abruption and risks of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular morbidity and mortality later in life. The project will focus on overall associations, as well as identifying subsets of women at high risk based on abruption severity, recurrent abruptions, gestational age at delivery, and fetal growth restriction. This project will provide unprecedented opportunities to address public health, and policy implications regarding women's health, and clinical screening recommendations of women during the period following delivery regarding risk susceptibility to cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases.",Cardiovascular Health After Placental Abruption (CHAP),10051711,R01HL150065,"['Abruptio Placentae', 'Acute', 'Acute myocardial infarction', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Arteries', 'Attention', 'Birth', 'Cardiovascular Diagnostic Techniques', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cerebrovascular Disorders', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Child Health', 'Chronic Disease', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Congestive Heart Failure', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Discipline of obstetrics', 'Disease', 'Educational workshop', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Fetal Death', 'Fetal Growth Retardation', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Gestational Age', 'Gestational Diabetes', 'Goals', 'Health Policy', 'Hemorrhage', 'High Risk Woman', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Infant Health', 'Infant Mortality', 'Inflammation', 'Ischemia', 'Life', 'Link', 'Live Birth', 'Machine Learning', 'Maternal-Fetal Exchange', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Medical', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Myocardial Ischemia', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'National Institute of Child Health and Human Development', 'New Jersey', 'Newborn Infant', 'Outcome', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Patients', 'Perinatal mortality demographics', 'Placenta', 'Pre-Eclampsia', 'Predisposition', 'Pregnancy', 'Premature Birth', 'Public Health', 'Pulmonary Embolism', 'Race', 'Recommendation', 'Recurrence', 'Reporting', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Rupture', 'Sentinel', 'Severities', 'Small for Gestational Age Infant', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Stimulus', 'Stroke', 'System', 'Twin Multiple Birth', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Uterus', 'Vision', 'Woman', 'Women&apos', 's Health', 'acute care', 'base', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'cardiovascular health', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'cerebrovascular', 'comorbidity', 'data acquisition', 'deep learning algorithm', 'epidemiology study', 'follow-up', 'health of the mother', 'high risk', 'hypertensive heart disease', 'improved', 'infant death', 'insight', 'interest', 'maternal cigarette smoking', 'maternal risk', 'mortality', 'obstetrical complication', 'policy implication', 'population based', 'premature', 'screening guidelines', 'sociodemographics', 'stillbirth', 'support vector machine']",NHLBI,RBHS-ROBERT WOOD JOHNSON MEDICAL SCHOOL,R01,2020,707286,0.013691954210323033
"PsycheMERGE: Leveraging electronic health records and genomics for mental health research Neuropsychiatric disorders are the leading causes of disability in the US and are associated with increased mortality (e.g. through suicide and associations with chronic diseases and their risk factors). Evidence suggests that early detection and treatment of psychiatric illness is essential to improving long-term outcomes and may even modify illness trajectories at a biological level. Unfortunately, a substantial proportion of patients undergo a long diagnostic odyssey before receiving an appropriate diagnosis and initiating effective treatment. Efforts to improve surveillance for emerging or occult psychopathology are often complex, costly, and have limited yield. Thus, there is an urgent public health need to improve clinical decision support for the early detection of psychiatric disorders in clinical settings. The growing availability of large-scale biobanks linking EHRs to biospecimens has created a powerful, but still relatively untapped, opportunity for psychiatric research. In 2007, the NHGRI organized the Electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) network which has brought together investigators around the U.S. to facilitate EHR-based genomic research and the implementation of genomic medicine. To date, however, EHR-based risk prediction and genomics have not been widely leveraged for psychiatric research. To address this gap, we have created a new, large-scale collaborative consortium—PsycheMERGE—which leverages the resources and existing infrastructure of the eMERGE network, the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium (PGC), and local EHR and biobank resources. In this proposal, we aim to: (1) phenotypically and genomically validate and harmonize case and control phenotypes across multiple disorders (2) build clinically-useful risk surveillance models for mood disorders that also leverage cross-institutional genomewide data, and (3) examine whether EHR- and genomic-based risk profiles are associated with clinically-relevant health outcomes. We will further use these risk profiles to examine disparities in diagnostic delay by age, sex and race/ethnicity. The resulting diagnostic and risk prediction algorithms will be made available to the scientific community through the eMERGE network. Successful completion of these aims would represent a major advance in demonstrating the utility of EHR resources for precision medicine approaches to psychiatry, provide the first step toward clinical decision support tools that can be implemented within health systems, and create an invaluable resource for the scientific community. Neuropsychiatric disorders are leading causes of disability and even mortality. We have created a collaborative consortium of health systems--PsycheMERGE—to enable clinical and genetic research that will improve the understanding and early detection of psychiatric disorders. We will use cutting-edge computational and genetic methods to examine the predictors of psychiatric illness and provide a key step toward the goals of “precision psychiatry”.",PsycheMERGE: Leveraging electronic health records and genomics for mental health research,9873997,R01MH118233,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Biological', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Childhood', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Eating Disorders', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Electronic Medical Records and Genomics Network', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Research', 'Genomic medicine', 'Genomics', 'Gilles de la Tourette syndrome', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health system', 'Heritability', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Insurance Coverage', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'National Human Genome Research Institute', 'Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychopathology', 'Public Health', 'Race', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Schizophrenia', 'Site', 'Suicide', 'Surveillance Modeling', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'biobank', 'case control', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical risk', 'clinically relevant', 'comorbidity', 'cost', 'data resource', 'delay sex', 'disability', 'disorder risk', 'effective therapy', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'genomic predictors', 'health care service utilization', 'high risk', 'improved', 'indexing', 'mortality', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'phenotyping algorithm', 'polygenic risk score', 'precision medicine', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'psychiatric genomics', 'random forest', 'sex', 'support tools', 'support vector machine']",NIMH,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2020,791339,-0.0186554625396381
"Elucidating the role of the gut metagenome in hypertension. Project Summary Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death world-wide. The primary modifiable risk factor for CVD is hypertension (HTN), which is exacerbated by high sodium intake. One third of Americans are hypertensive, of which half exhibit salt-sensitive HTN. Additionally, 12% of HTN patients do not respond to treatment using standard medications. Taken together, these statistics highlight the critical need to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the development of HTN for the design of alternative treatment options. The gut microbiome has been implicated in many diseases including HTN. This project is designed to identify HTN- exacerbating or protective bacteria and their associated metabolic genes to inform the design of microbiome-based therapeutics for the treatment of HTN. Our preliminary results demonstrate that severe HTN induced by salt consumption correlates with shifts in the gut microbial community of Dahl salt-sensitive (SS) rats. Therefore, we tested the potential for the gut microbiota to affect HTN by performing a fecal material transfer (FMT) from hypertensive Dahl SS into HTN-resistant rats. We demonstrated that the microbiome was sufficient to exacerbate HTN in recipients and corresponded with statistically significant shifts in the gut microbiome. These results lead us to hypothesize that the gut microbiota directly influences HTN. Aim 1 will evaluate the role of bacterial supplementation during onset of HTN in the Dahl SS rat model. Predetermined strains identified from our preliminary experiments will be grown in vitro and transferred into SS Dahl rats and the effect on blood pressure and kidney damage will be evaluated. Potential mechanisms through which the bacteria influence the severity of HTN will be explored by measuring metabolite production, evaluating gut barrier function, and identifying shifts in the gut microbiome. Aim 2 will utilize machine learning to identify specific gut bacteria and metabolic genes that serve as signatures for the severity of HTN. Experiments in this aim will exploit shotgun metagenomic sequencing and computational approaches to identify specific bacteria and metabolic genes associated with HTN. Their use as predictive biomarkers for HTN will be validated by PCR-based analysis. This work will take place in the laboratory of Dr. John Kirby in the Department of Microbiology & Immunology (M&I) at the Medical College of Wisconsin, a highly collaborative and stimulating environment that is well equipped to perform the proposed aims. The Department of M&I offers a state-of-the-art educational program and various opportunities to explore alternative career pathways. We have designed a complementary training plan for my scientific and professional growth that will position me to reach my goal of becoming an independent biomedical scientist. In all, this project is critical for my advancement as a Latina woman in biomedical research, the field of HTN research, and the generation of microbiome-based therapeutics for CVD. Project Narrative Hypertension (HTN) is the primary risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD), which is the leading cause of death world-wide. While the gut microbiome has been implicated in many diseases, a mechanism by which the microbiota influence HTN remain unknown. This project is designed to identify specific bacteria, metabolic genes, and potential mechanisms by which the microbiota influence HTN.

"Developing and validating EHR-integrated readmission risk prediction models for hospitalized patients with diabetes PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Hospital readmission is an undesirable, costly outcome that may be preventable. Hospitalized patients with diabetes are at higher risk of readmission within 30 days (30-d readmission) than patients without diabetes, and >1 million readmissions occur among diabetes patients in the US annually. Certain interventions can reduce readmission risk, but applying these interventions widely is cost prohibitive. One approach for improving the efficiency of interventions that reduce readmission risk is to target high-risk patients. We previously published a model, the Diabetes Early Readmission Risk Indicator (DERRITM), that predicts the risk of all-cause 30-d readmission of patients with diabetes. The DERRI, however, has modest predictive accuracy (C-statistic 0.63- 0.69), and requires manual data input. Recently, we demonstrated that adding variables to the DERRI substantially improves predictive accuracy (DERRIplus, C-statistic 0.82). However, using this larger model to predict readmission risk based on manual input of data would be too labor intensive for clinical settings. Indeed, most readmission risk prediction models are limited by the trade-off between accuracy and ease of use; lack of translation to a tool that integrates with clinical workflow; modest accuracy; lack of validation; and dependence on data only available after hospital discharge.  The objectives of the current proposal are: 1) To develop more accurate all-cause unplanned 30-d readmission risk prediction models using electronic health record (EHR) data of patients with diabetes (eDERRI); 2) To translate the models to an automated, EHR-based tool that predicts % readmission risk of hospitalized patients; and 3) To prospectively validate the eDERRI models and tool. The new eDERRI models will expand upon the variables in the DERRIplus based on availability in EHR data (e.g., sociodemographics, encounter history, medication use, laboratory results, comorbidities, and length of stay). To develop the models, we will leverage data from the PaTH Clinical Data Research Network (CDRN), a multi-center, 40-plus hospital member of the National Patient-Centered Clinical Research Network (PCORnet). We will apply state-of-the-art deep-learning methods to develop optimal predictive models. This project will analyze a large, multi-center cohort of nearly 340,000 discharges with cutting-edge techniques to develop better models and translate them to an automated tool that predicts readmission risk for individual patients with diabetes. The proposed tool would identify higher risk patients more likely to benefit from intervention, thus improving care and reducing costs. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project seeks to develop more accurate models that predict the risk of repeat hospitalizations among patients with diabetes. The models will be programmed into a tool that will be integrated with an electronic health record system and automatically predict the re-hospitalization risk of patients. Such a tool could be used to identify higher risk diabetes patients more likely to benefit from intervention, thus improving care and reducing costs.",Developing and validating EHR-integrated readmission risk prediction models for hospitalized patients with diabetes,9971861,R01DK122073,"['Admission activity', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Paths', 'Clinical Research', 'Collection', 'Complement', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dependence', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Goals', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Institution', 'Insulin', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Length of Stay', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Modeling', 'Participant', 'Patient Readmission', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Publishing', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'comorbidity Index', 'cost', 'cost outcomes', 'deep learning', 'demographics', 'design', 'diabetes risk', 'experience', 'high risk', 'hospital readmission', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'learning strategy', 'member', 'model development', 'patient oriented', 'patient subsets', 'point of care', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive tools', 'prospective', 'readmission risk', 'risk prediction model', 'sociodemographics', 'statistics', 'tool']",NIDDK,TEMPLE UNIV OF THE COMMONWEALTH,R01,2020,658109,0.006798017993704611
"Multisite Electronic Health Record-Based Surveillance of the Burden of Diabetes by Type in Young Adults Approximately 3 million young adults aged 18-44 years currently have diabetes in the United States. This number is projected to increase to ~5.8 million by 2060. Differentiating diabetes types is crucial, because the etiology, treatments, and outcomes of diabetes differ substantially by type. Type 1 diabetes (T1D) accounts for ~17% and type 2 diabetes (T2D) ~75% of total diabetes in US young adults. This distribution of diabetes types continuously evolves. We do not have a large-scale surveillance system to monitor the prevalence and incidence of T1D and T2D in US young adults. The widespread use and increasing functionality of electronic health record (EHR) systems substantially increase the quantity, breadth, and timeliness of data available for surveillance and reduce costs compared with population-based registries and surveys. EHR algorithms have shown great potential in identifying diabetes cases. This study will analyze both structured EHR data (e.g., diagnosis codes, medications, and laboratory results) and unstructured clinical notes. We will apply expert knowledge, machine learning, and natural language processing to develop the best algorithms for identifying prevalent and incident T1D and T2D cases. The primary objective of this study is to establish an EHR-based surveillance system for monitoring the burden of T1D and T2D in US young adults. We will collaborate with 3 EHR research networks from the National Patient-Centered Clinical Research Network (PCORnet), covering ~6 million racially, ethnically, and socioeconomically diverse young adults from 4 states (IL, LA, NY, and TX) in 3 Census regions. The patient populations in this study are roughly representative of the source populations in the catchment areas. The specific aims of this study are 1) to estimate the prevalence of T1D and T2D in US young adults by age, sex, race/ethnicity, and geographic region in 2019; 2) to estimate the incidence of T1D and T2D in US young adults by age, sex, race/ethnicity, and geographic region in 2019; 3) to estimate 10-year trends in the prevalence and incidence of T1D and T2D in US young adults by age, sex, race/ethnicity, and geographic region, 2014-2023; and 4) to compare the prevalence and incidence of diabetes by type, as well as temporal trends, in US young adults with those in young adults from other countries and regions. This study is innovative, because it will detect a false negative rate as low as 0.2%, leverage EHRs for surveillance (more efficient and cost-effective than registries and surveys), use advanced statistical approaches (e.g., machine learning and natural language processing), estimate a denominator using patient zip codes, build flexibility into the surveillance methods according to local availability of clinical notes, and use a 2-staged sampling approach to improve chart review efficiency. This study will advance our understanding of the age, sex, racial/ethnic, and geographic differences in the burden of T1D and T2D in US young adults. The obtained surveillance data will inform planning for healthcare needs, prioritize the allocation of healthcare resources, and reduce health disparities via identifying and prioritizing subpopulations for prevention of diabetes and related comorbidities. The burden of diabetes has been increasing considerably in recent decades in US young adults. However, there is no large-scale surveillance system for monitoring the burden of diabetes by type in US young adults. This study will build an efficient and cost-effective multisite surveillance system using electronic health records, to estimate the prevalence, incidence, and temporal trends of type 1 and type 2 diabetes in US young adults according to age, sex, race/ethnicity, and geographic region.",Multisite Electronic Health Record-Based Surveillance of the Burden of Diabetes by Type in Young Adults,10085448,U18DP006502,[' '],NCCDPHP,CORNELL UNIVERSITY,U18,2020,250000,-0.02303424000343388
"A Pragmatic Latent Variable Learning Approach Aligned with Clinical Practice Abstract With growing interest in personalized medicine and the rise of machine learning, constructing good risk prediction and prognostic models has been drawing renewed attention. In this development, much effort is concentrated in identifying good predictors of patient outcomes, although the same level of rigor is often absent in improving the outcome side of prediction. The majority of popular supervised techniques (e.g., regularized logistic regression and its variations), which can be readily applied in risk model development, assumes that the prediction target is a clear single outcome measured at a single time point. In clinical reality, patient outcomes are often complex, multivariate, and measured with errors. Even when a target is a relatively clear univariate outcome (e.g., death, cancer, diabetes, etc), the process that leads to this ultimate outcome often involves complex intermediate outcomes, where predicting and understanding this intermediate process can be crucial in providing effective care and preventing negative ultimate outcomes. The situation calls for a ﬂexible learning framework that can easily incorporate this important but neglected aspect in model development - better characterizing and constructing prediction targets before building prediction models.  Focusing on risk labels as prediction targets, we propose a pragmatic 3-stage learning approach, where we sequentially 1) generate latent labels, 2) validate them using explicit validators, and 3) go on with supervised learning with labeled data. Latent variable (LV) strategies used in Satge 1 have great potentials in handling complex outcome information. The unsupervised nature of LV strategies makes highly ﬂexible data synthesis and organization possible. The same nature, however, can also be seen as esoteric and subjective, which is not desirable in situations where transparency and reproducibility are of great concern such as in risk prediction. As a practical solution to this problem, we propose the use of explicit clinical validators, which not only makes LV-based labels closely aligned with contemporary science and clinical practice, but also makes it possible to automatically validate and narrow a large pool of candidate labels. With the goal of developing a practical and transparent system of learning and inference for clinical research and practice, we formed a highly interdisciplinary team of researchers with expertise in latent variable modeling, machine learning, psychometrics and causal inference along with clinical/substantive expertise. Our streamlined learning framework focuses on direct and transparent validation of latent variable solutions to ensure clear communication across risk model developers, clinical researchers and practitioners. The project ultimately aims to improve personalized treatment and care by improving risk prediction. Narrative This project intends to develop a pragmatic learning and risk predction framework that will facilitate utilization of multivariate data collected from research and health care services, which otherwise is underutilized in developing methods to improve personalized care of future patients. The project ultimately aims to improve personalized treatment and care by improving risk prediction, and therefore will have positive impact on public health.",A Pragmatic Latent Variable Learning Approach Aligned with Clinical Practice,10033908,R01MH123443,"['Address', 'Anxiety', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Attention', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Brain', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Ensure', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heart', 'Hybrids', 'Hyperglycemia', 'Intention', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manic', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motivation', 'Nature', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Process', 'Psychometrics', 'Public Health', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Side', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'clinical risk', 'comorbidity', 'data exploration', 'flexibility', 'health care service', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'interest', 'model development', 'neglect', 'personalized care', 'personalized medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'prognostic', 'risk prediction model', 'simulation', 'supervised learning', 'tool', 'treatment planning', 'unsupervised learning']",NIMH,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,565519,0.013855890491404404
"Development and validation of an electronic health record prediction tool for first-episode psychosis Psychosis is a major public health challenge, with approximately 100,000 adolescents and young adults in the US experiencing a first episode of psychosis (FEP) every year. Early intervention following FEP is critical for achieving improved outcomes, yet treatment of FEP is often delayed between 1 and 3 years in the US due to delays in detection and referral. The World Health Organization has advocated shortening the duration of untreated psychosis (DUP) to three months or less. The goal of this study is to develop and validate a universal EHR-based screening tool for early detection of FEP across large clinical populations in diverse healthcare settings. In order to maximize the impact and generalizability of the tool across a wide range of healthcare settings, we will rely only on coded medical information collected in the course of care and thus widely available in EHRs. The tool will be developed and validated with data from three diverse health systems that cover over 8 million patients spanning a wide range of demographic, socioeconomic and ethnic backgrounds: Partners Healthcare System, Boston Children's Hospital, and Boston Medical Center. The study will be conducted by a closely collaborating interdisciplinary team of clinical specialists, psychosis researchers, and risk modeling experts based at these health systems and Harvard Medical School, with extensive experience in treating psychosis patients, and developing strategies for detecting FEP and EHR-based risk screening tools for early detection of various clinical conditions. Our preliminary studies show that EHR-based risk models can be used to sensitively and specifically detect FEP cases, on average 2 years before the first psychosis diagnosis appears in their EHR. Our specific aims include: 1. Define a robust cross-site case definition for FEP that relies only on information commonly available in EHRs and validate it through expert chart review; 2. Train and validate a predictive model for early detection of FEP based on large samples of patient data from the three sites; 3. Develop and validate FEP early detection models for key subpopulations, including patients receiving care at mental health clinics, adolescent medicine outpatient programs, and substance abuse treatment programs; and 4. Engage clinical stakeholders in the process of developing a prototype clinician-facing EHR-based risk screening tool for FEP, and release it as an open source SMART App, enabling further validation and clinical integration across a wide range of healthcare settings. Completion of these aims would provide a novel, clinically deployable, and potentially transformative tool for improving the trajectory of those affected with psychosis and reducing the burden and costs of untreated illness. Psychosis is a major public health challenge, with difficulties and delays in detecting its onset that can lead to worse clinical outcomes. The proposed research will develop a clinician-facing electronic-health-record-based automated screening tool for early detection of the first episode of psychosis, with implications for reducing the duration of untreated psychosis as recommended by the NIMH and World Health Organization. The tool will be validated across three large and diverse health systems and released as an open source application (SMART App), increasing its potential for rapid implementation in health systems and clinical care.",Development and validation of an electronic health record prediction tool for first-episode psychosis,9864102,R01MH116042,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Adolescent Medicine', 'Adolescent and Young Adult', 'Advocate', 'Affect', 'Boston', 'Calibration', 'Caring', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Electronic Health Record', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Health system', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Inpatients', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Mental Health', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Primary Health Care', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Support', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Screening procedure', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Site', 'Specialist', 'Suicide', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Work', 'World Health Organization', 'base', 'clinical care', 'cost', 'data resource', 'design', 'experience', 'first episode psychosis', 'health care settings', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'individual patient', 'interest', 'medical schools', 'medical specialties', 'novel', 'open source', 'outpatient programs', 'predictive modeling', 'prototype', 'random forest', 'socioeconomics', 'substance abuse treatment', 'support vector machine', 'tool', 'treatment program']",NIMH,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2020,847935,0.00010685135558719966
"Sudden Cardiac Arrest (SCA): Prediction and Prevention Project Summary: The recent advances in information technologies and biotechnologies is an opportunity to substantially improve healthcare. To exploit the power of data to benefit patients, however, effective clinical decision support tools and novel, individualized interventions must be designed, tested, and implemented. Although there has been progress in the development of statistical/machine learning methods, numerous challenges remain to tailor and translate them into useful clinical decision support tools. Sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) accounts for 15-20% of all adult deaths and is the industrial world’s leading cause of death. Clinical studies of SCA produce repeated measures on risk factors and multiple different kinds of events over time. We refer to these data as survival, longitudinal, and multivariate (SLAM) data. In this project, we will develop novel statistical learning methods for SLAM data and apply them to two distinct aspects of the SCA problem. First, we propose to develop novel statistical learning algorithms that better predict an individual’s multivariate longitudinal data with a focus on the risk of first and subsequent SCA. Second, we propose to develop micro-randomization and just-in-time adaptive intervention trial designs to reduce behavioral risk factors for SCA among persons at high risk. The methods that we propose to develop will be applicable in many areas of medicine. However, they are motivated by and applied to SCA in this project. Our team has expertise in statistics including causal inference, longitudinal data and survival analyses, plus machine learning, epidemiology, cardiology, and behavioral interventions through mobile health (mHealth). This proposed collaboration has the following specific aims: Aim 1: Develop and test statistical learning tools for real-time risk prediction of survival, longitudinal, and multivariate (SLAM) outcome data. Aim 2: Estimate the risk of SCA and its dependence on dynamic modifiable and non-modifiable factors in population-based and clinical cohorts. Aim 3: Plan and conduct a feasibility-usability study of micro-randomization and just-in-time adaptive intervention trial designs for behavioral change to reduce SCA risk. Upon successful completion of these aims, we will have contributed to the progress of healthcare delivery through the application of computational statistics to medicine. ! ! Project Narrative: Although sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) is the industrial world’s leading cause of death, SCA prediction and prevention strategies remain limited. In this project, we contribute towards addressing the global burden of SCAs through the development of novel statistical/machine learning methods for SCA risk prediction and the design of mobile health (mHealth) interventions for risk reduction. While developed in the context of SCA, these methods will be applicable in many areas of medicine and public health. !",Sudden Cardiac Arrest (SCA): Prediction and Prevention,9986884,F30HL142131,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Archives', 'Area', 'Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Biomedical Technology', 'Biotechnology', 'Cardiac health', 'Cardiology', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical assessments', 'Collaborations', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Epidemiology', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Future', 'Growth', 'Health Promotion', 'Health Technology', 'Healthcare', 'Heart Arrest', 'Heart failure', 'Hospitalization', 'Implantable Defibrillators', 'Individual', 'Industrialization', 'Information Technology', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Modernization', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Physicians', 'Prevention', 'Prevention strategy', 'Preventive Medicine', 'Public Health', 'Randomized', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Research Proposals', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Estimate', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk Reduction', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Subgroup', 'Survival Analysis', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'adaptive intervention', 'career', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical decision-making', 'cohort', 'design', 'health care delivery', 'high risk', 'improved', 'interest', 'learning algorithm', 'learning strategy', 'mHealth', 'machine learning method', 'mobile application', 'modifiable risk', 'novel', 'open source', 'population based', 'prospective', 'randomized trial', 'statistical and machine learning', 'statistical learning', 'statistics', 'support tools', 'survival prediction', 'time use', 'tool', 'trial design', 'usability']",NHLBI,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,F30,2020,35760,0.004519597790411179
"Magnetic Resonance Imaging Based Calf Muscle Perfusion To Assess Patients With Symptomatic Peripheral Artery Disease Abstract: Peripheral artery disease (PAD) is associated with impaired leg function, possible limb loss and an increased risk of cardiovascular events. Intermittent claudication (IC) is a classic PAD symptom occurring in 40% of symptomatic patients, and is associated with 5-, and 15-year mortality rates of 30% and 70%, respectively. PAD is a debilitating illness affecting more than 8.5 million Americans of age 40 and older and 202 million people globally. Despite the high prevalence, PAD patients are less likely to receive appropriate treatment for their atherosclerotic risk factors than patients with coronary artery disease. Advances in endovascular therapy have reduced risks associated with intervention, enabling revascularization as a routine procedure in patients with lower extremity ischemia. However, revascularization success rates vary substantially and numerous PAD patients do not improve at 1-year despite technically good revascularization. Previous findings suggest that alterations in the microcirculation due to a paucity of collateralization may contribute to functional impairment in PAD patients. We hypothesize that the change in microvascular perfusion can identify PAD patients who do not improve at 12-months after revascularization. We will utilize contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (CE-MRI) to assess skeletal muscle perfusion in PAD patients. The CE-MRI measures will be associated with hemodynamics and symptoms. The early identification of individuals with a likely poor prognosis post intervention could help to improve surgical treatment strategies. We will investigate the association of microvascular perfusion (Aim 1) and measures of arterial hemodynamics (Aim 2) with leg function and PAD symptoms. We will utilize machine learning methodologies to identify predictors of poor leg function and symptoms (Aim 3). Given the high incidence of PAD and the associated high risk of cardiovascular events, it is paramount to identify individuals who are less likely to improve following lower extremity revascularization. The data of this clinical imaging study will provide novel information on the etiology of microvascular blood flow in PAD. Relevance: The proposed research study is of considerable public health importance given that patients with peripheral artery disease (PAD) have an increased risk of atherothrombotic cardiovascular events and mortality. The development of improved non-invasive imaging techniques to assess PAD may enable optimized treatment for individuals who are at an increased risk of future cardiovascular events.",Magnetic Resonance Imaging Based Calf Muscle Perfusion To Assess Patients With Symptomatic Peripheral Artery Disease,9997993,R01HL137763,"['Affect', 'Age', 'American', 'Ankle', 'Arteries', 'Blood Vessels', 'Blood flow', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical assessments', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Data', 'Data Reporting', 'Development', 'Disease Outcome', 'Early identification', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Exercise', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'High Prevalence', 'Hospitals', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Impairment', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Intermittent Claudication', 'Intervention', 'Ischemia', 'Leg', 'Legal patent', 'Limb structure', 'Literature', 'Lower Extremity', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical center', 'Methodist Church', 'Methodology', 'Microcirculation', 'Muscle', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Oxygen', 'Partial Pressure', 'Participant', 'Patient imaging', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perfusion', 'Peripheral arterial disease', 'Phase', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Pilot Projects', 'Procedures', 'Public Health', 'Recovery', 'Reference Values', 'Resolution', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Signal Transduction', 'Skeletal Muscle', 'Standardization', 'Superficial Femoral Artery', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Toes', 'Treadmill Tests', 'Ultrasonography', 'Validation', 'Veterans', 'Walking', 'atherosclerosis risk', 'base', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'comorbidity', 'contrast enhanced', 'contrast imaging', 'functional disability', 'hemodynamics', 'high risk', 'imaging modality', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'mortality', 'non-invasive imaging', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'post intervention', 'recruit', 'regional difference', 'research study', 'skeletal', 'success', 'successful intervention', 'support vector machine', 'symptomatic improvement', 'treadmill', 'treatment optimization', 'treatment strategy', 'two-dimensional']",NHLBI,PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIV HERSHEY MED CTR,R01,2020,515780,-0.0014615503808355357
"Epidemiology and clinical outcomes of diabetic macular edema Approximately 25% of the millions of veterans (est. 8.92 million FY 2013) enrolled for care in Veterans Health Administration (VHA) have diabetes mellitus, and diabetic macular edema (DME) is the leading cause of vision loss in the adult diabetic population world-wide. Although diabetic retinopathy has been well-studied, comparatively little is known about the burden of DME. In fact, only two national prevalence studies and no national study on the incidence of DME in persons with type 2 diabetes have been conducted. Similarly many risk factors have been characterized for DR, but no large studies have established predictors for DME.  Beyond the Medicare claims database, the VHA National Patient Care Database (NPCD) contains standardized administrative data for several aspects of patient care including diagnoses, procedures, medications, lab test results, vital signs, clinical text notes, and mortality. Because the VA uses teleretinal screening as routine clinical care for all patients with diabetes with these results included in the NPCD, the NPCD is an ideal source for studying the epidemiology of and risk factors for DME.  This study proposes to determine the burden of diabetic macular edema, establish risk factors, and examine treatment outcomes in a previously extracted dataset on 1.98 million veterans who have undergone diabetic retinopathy screening at least once since 2004. Currently invaluable ophthalmic data are encoded in unstructured clinical encounter notes in the Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS), and no validated automated extraction method exists to capture these data elements. An automated extraction method using natural language processing will be created and validated to unlock key ophthalmic variables. These text extraction methods will be applicable to extracting ophthalmology data from not only notes of patients with DME but also any ophthalmology clinical note. This will enable future large scale studies in ophthalmology using NPCD and be immediately valuable to the research community at large.  The candidate, Dr. Aaron Lee, MD MSCI, is an ophthalmologist with subspecialty training in retina surgery with a strong background in computer science and epidemiology. His career goal is to become an independent clinician scientist studying diabetic eye disease with large-scale electronic medical record extracted data. While he possesses the foundational skills, he seeks to gain training in advanced statistics and natural language processing to unlock the data captured in unstructured clinical encounter notes. He has assembled an outstanding mentorship team under the primary mentor, Dr. Edward Boyko, MD MPH. This mentorship team includes renowned experts in clinical epidemiology, health informatics, ophthalmology, and natural language processing. This K23 will provide Dr. Lee the structured coursework, mentorship, and applied learning needed to acquire new research skills. He will leverage key local resources to carry out the proposed research at the University of Washington and the VA Seattle Epidemiologic Research and Information Center. Despite the significant visual loss associated with diabetic macular edema, little is known about the frequency of its occurrence, its risk factors, and the real-world effectiveness of existing treatments. The purpose of this proposed research is to utilize the VA National Patient Care Database to extract relevant data elements to examine these three clinical questions: 1) what is the incidence and prevalence of diabetic macular edema, 2) what are the risk factors associated with its development, and 3) what is the comparative real-world effectiveness of its treatments, including intravitreal anti-VEGF therapy, intravitreal corticosteroid therapy and macular laser. The methods developed in this research proposal will not only further our understanding of DME but also generalize and enable future large-scale ophthalmic studies.",Epidemiology and clinical outcomes of diabetic macular edema,9995499,K23EY029246,"['Adopted', 'Adrenal Cortex Hormones', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Anemia', 'Blindness', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Caring', 'Cataract Extraction', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Computerized Patient Records', 'Data', 'Data Element', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diabetic Retinopathy', 'Diagnosis', 'Dyslipidemias', 'Effectiveness', 'Enrollment', 'Epidemiology', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Exclusion Criteria', 'Eye', 'Eye diseases', 'Foundational Skills', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Handedness', 'Hypertension', 'Incidence', 'Information Centers', 'Injections', 'Intervention', 'Lasers', 'Lead', 'Light Coagulation', 'Manuals', 'Masks', 'Measures', 'Medicare claim', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Ophthalmologist', 'Ophthalmology', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Prevalence', 'Prevalence Study', 'Procedures', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health Informatics', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Regimen', 'Research', 'Research Proposals', 'Resources', 'Retina', 'Risk Factors', 'Scientist', 'Severities', 'Sleep Apnea Syndromes', 'Smoking Status', 'Source', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'System', 'Test Result', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Treatment outcome', 'Universities', 'Use Effectiveness', 'Validation', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factors', 'Veterans', 'Visual', 'Visual Acuity', 'Washington', 'automated algorithm', 'bevacizumab', 'career', 'clinical care', 'clinical encounter', 'clinical epidemiology', 'cohort', 'comparative', 'computer science', 'diabetes management', 'diabetic', 'epidemiology study', 'hands-on learning', 'health administration', 'intravitreal injection', 'kidney dysfunction', 'laser photocoagulation', 'macula', 'macular edema', 'mortality', 'proliferative diabetic retinopathy', 'screening', 'skills', 'statistics', 'therapy outcome', 'traditional therapy', 'treatment optimization', 'unstructured data']",NEI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,K23,2020,238049,-0.008777366283109352
"Effectiveness of Digital Versus In-Person Diabetes Prevention Programs 1 PROJECT SUMMARY  Millions of U.S. adults living with prediabetes, a high risk state for future type 2 diabetes, do not receive appropriate lifestyle counseling to lower their risk of type 2 diabetes. Mobile health (mHealth) technologies represent a potential scalable solution to address this far-reaching problem. The objective of this project is to compare the real-world effectiveness of a digital diabetes prevention program (dDPP) to standard of care in- person diabetes prevention programs (ipDPPs). This study will test a novel, fully-automated digital health platform (Sweetch Health, Ltd.) that uses artificial intelligence technology to provide just-in-time and adaptive lifestyle change coaching for prediabetic adults. Preliminary evidence from feasibility or observational studies suggests that JITAIs, which are often delivered via smartphone apps by virtue of their ability to provide continuous self-monitoring and feedback, can be effective. However, it is currently not known whether dDPPs that deliver a JITAI are as effective as ipDPPs in improving health outcomes in patients with prediabetes, a susceptible patient population that is positioned to benefit from such an intervention.  The overarching goal of this project, therefore, is to compare the effectiveness of the Sweetch digital diabetes prevention program (dDPP) to real-world in-person diabetes prevention programs (ipDPPs) for promoting weight loss, increasing physical activity, and reducing hemoglobin A1C in prediabetic adults. The proposed study addresses an evidence gap in the science of chronic disease prevention and health behavior change and is supported by promising short-term results from a previous pilot trial conducted by our team. Building on our previous study and leveraging the collective expertise of our multidisciplinary study team, we will conduct a randomized controlled trial of 382 overweight/obese, prediabetic adults ages 18-75 with 6 and 12 month follow-up visits: Arm 1 (N=191) will receive the fully automated Sweetch digital health kit (“dDPP” arm) and Arm 2 (N=191) will be referred to a local CDC-recognized ipDPP. Both arms will have physical activity measured serially during the trial using actimetry at baseline and 2 month intervals. We hypothesize that the dDPP will be more effective than the ipDPP for the outcomes of weight loss, physical activity, and lowering of hemoglobin A1C at 6 months, with sustained effects at 12 months. We further hypothesize that the overall engagement and acceptability will be greater in the dDPP, and that the superiority of the dDPP on clinical outcomes will be mediated by higher engagement in this arm.  This project will advance chronic disease prevention and behavioral science research by elucidating the extent to which fully-automated digital interventions using artificial intelligence technology can deliver effective, scalable, sustainable, and cost-effective health-promoting behavioral change interventions in high-risk populations. The implications of this fully-automated approach for scalability in diabetes prevention are profound. 2 PROJECT NARRATIVE  Prediabetes, a high risk state for future type 2 diabetes, currently affects nearly 1 in 3 Americans, the vast majority of whom do not receive appropriate lifestyle counseling to lower their risk for type 2 diabetes. In this project, we propose to evaluate the real-world effectiveness of a fully-automated digital diabetes prevention program for weight reduction, promotion of physical activity, and lowering of hemoglobin A1C (a measure of average blood glucose control) compared to standard of care in-person diabetes prevention programs. Since this digital diabetes prevention program uses artificial technology and requires no human component, it would potentially offer a breakthrough in improving population health in a scalable and cost- effective way, helping the tens of millions of affected U.S. patients and hundreds of millions of patients globally living with prediabetes.",Effectiveness of Digital Versus In-Person Diabetes Prevention Programs,10034797,R01DK125780,"['Address', 'Adherence', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'American', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Benchmarking', 'Blood Glucose', 'Body Weight decreased', 'Caloric Restriction', 'Cellular Phone', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Counseling', 'Data', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diabetes prevention', 'Diet Monitoring', 'Effectiveness', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Favorable Clinical Outcome', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Glycosylated hemoglobin A', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Promotion', 'Health Technology', 'Health behavior change', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Human Resources', 'Hybrids', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Life Style', 'Maintenance', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Monitor', 'Motivation', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Obesity', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Overweight', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Physical activity', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prediabetes syndrome', 'Prevention', 'Questionnaires', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Science', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Visit', 'Weight', 'Weight Gain', 'adult obesity', 'arm', 'base', 'blood glucose regulation', 'comparative effectiveness study', 'compare effectiveness', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'diabetes prevention program', 'digital', 'disorder prevention', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'improved', 'interest', 'lifestyle intervention', 'mHealth', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'patient population', 'pilot trial', 'population health', 'program costs', 'programs', 'response', 'smartphone Application', 'standard of care', 'tool']",NIDDK,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,733116,-0.010534862835195944
"Reducing Non-Medical Opioid Use: An automatically adaptive mHealth Intervention ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In recent years in the U.S., problems associated with opioid prescriptions, including non-medical use and overdose, increased to historically unprecedented levels and represent a public health crisis. Emergency departments (EDs) play an important role in opioid prescribing, particularly to individuals at high risk for adverse opioi-related outcomes. Half of all ED visits are for a painful condition, and one third of all ED visits result in an opioid being prescribed. Moreover, in our pilot work, a quarter of patients surveyed at the ED study site reported non-medical opioid use in the prior three months. Despite the importance of this problem, strategies to reduce non-medical opioid use after an ED visit have not been well-studied. Our recent trial of a motivational intervention delivered to patients in the ED by a therapist resulted in modest reductions in non- medical use after the ED visit compared to a control condition. However, the intervention was unable to address the implications of opioids prescribed as a result of the ED encounter on post-ED opioid use behavior. This project will adapt the intervention for delivery after the ED visit through mobile technology in order to directly address the use of ED-provided opioids. Patients (n=600) will be recruited during an ED visit for a randomized controlled trial of the adapted intervention based on having used opioids non-medically in the prior three months and being given an opioid by an ED prescriber. In the intervention condition, interactive voice response calls will repeatedly assess non-medical opioid use and pain level and deliver intervention content. The intervention will include several potential actions that vary in intensity: assessment only, a brief message, extended messaging, or connection to a therapist by phone. Because the most helpful intensity of intervention is unknown and likely to vary between patients, the project will use an artificial intelligence stratey called reinforcement learning (RL). The RL system will continuously ""learn"" from the success of prior actions in similar situations with similar patients in order to select the action most likelyto reduce non-medical opioid use for each participant during each call. The RCT will be complemented by qualitative interviews to inform later implementation. The specific aims are to: (1) Adapt and enhance an existing motivational intervention to decrease non-medical opioid use after an ED visit by optimizing intervention intensity and duration through RL; (2) Examine the impact of the intervention on non-medical opioid use level during the six months post-ED visit; (3) Examine the impact of the intervention on driving after opioid use, overdose risk behaviors, and subsequent opioid-related ED visits. Secondary Aims are: (1) to examine differences in intervention effects between participants with high and low baseline levels of non-medical opioid use; and (2) to understand barriers and facilitators of implementation. This project will use a highly innovative strategy, artificial intelligence, to address a highly significant problem, non-medical opioid use. Ultimately, this study can lead to reductions in opioid- related harms and move forward the field of mobile health. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Non-medical use of opioid pain medications has increased substantially over the last decade, and ensuring the safe use of opioids prescribed as part of medical care has become a critical public health priority. Emergency Departments (EDs) are on the front lines of this emerging public health problem. This randomized controlled trial will test the impact of a mobile health intervention, which incorporates an innovative artificial intelligenc component to determine intervention duration and intensity, on non-medical opioid use and related harms for adult ED patients treated with opioids and who have a history of non-medical opioid use.",Reducing Non-Medical Opioid Use: An automatically adaptive mHealth Intervention,9869872,R01DA039159,"['Abnormal coordination', 'Accident and Emergency department', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Automobile Driving', 'Behavior', 'Caring', 'Complement', 'Emergency Care', 'Emergency Department patient', 'Emergency department visit', 'Ensure', 'Future', 'Guidelines', 'Health Technology', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Medical', 'Methodology', 'Monitor', 'Opioid', 'Opioid Analgesics', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Overdose', 'Pain', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Play', 'Process', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Psychotherapy', 'Public Health', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Resources', 'Risk Behaviors', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Severities', 'Site', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Voice', 'Work', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'behavioral outcome', 'brief motivational intervention', 'clinical encounter', 'clinical practice', 'comparison intervention', 'drugged driving', 'experience', 'high risk', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'innovation', 'intervention effect', 'learning progression', 'mHealth', 'mobile computing', 'motivational intervention', 'multidisciplinary', 'new technology', 'nonmedical use', 'opioid misuse', 'opioid therapy', 'opioid use', 'overdose risk', 'post intervention', 'prescription opioid', 'public health priorities', 'public health relevance', 'recruit', 'response', 'screening', 'skills', 'success', 'treatment as usual']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2020,547843,-0.009160542172244797
"Olfactory and facial markers of developmental risk for psychosis in 22q11 deletion syndrome Project Summary: 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11DS) is associated with an increased risk for psychiatric disorders, including psychosis with similar symptoms to individuals with idiopathic schizophrenia (SZ), and about 1-2% of cases of idiopathic SZ have 22q11.2 deletions. Thus, targeted approaches detailing specific brain dysfunction in 22q11DS may elucidate critical neural mechanisms in psychosis. Specifically, approaches that capture abnormalities common to individuals at-risk for psychosis and with a genetic risk to psychosis, such as 22q11DS, may help explain risk and resilience for psychosis. Minor physical anomalies (MPAs) are phenotypic abnormalities of aberrant development. MPAs include subtle abnormalities of morphological structures encompassing numerous body parts including eyes, ears, mouth and head. Abnormalities of the face and head likely represent a disruption of early embryologic development, including the olfactory system and facial morphology, making these promising entry points for understanding neurodevelopmental neuropathology associated with 22q11DS and psychosis In this study, we seek to compare 1) measures of olfactory function; 2) structural abnormalities of the olfactory system and 3) structural abnormalities of the face in a large cohort of patients with 22q11DS (n=100), including those with and without psychosis, to typically developing (TD) individual. Finally, we will employ machine learning algorithms to select features that best differentiate 22q11DS+ from 22q11DS- and use those features to classify individual with idiopathic risk for psychosis (PS). In addition, analyses will leverage recent advances in machine learning to predict salient features associated with dimensional measures of psychosis. We believe this innovative approach can significantly advance our understanding of the etiology of psychosis and provide advances to precision medicine in psychiatry. Through the proposed multi-level analysis, this innovative research will provide a substantial advance in our understanding of the neurodevelopmental substrates of psychosis. RELEVANCE: Psychosis is a debilitating psychiatric condition. Greater understanding of how abnormalities in neural development lead to dysfunction during youth and produce symptoms of psychosis or psychosis risk may be critical for the conceptualization of earlier and more effective treatments. This would benefit public health by reducing the great costs of psychosis to individuals and society at large.",Olfactory and facial markers of developmental risk for psychosis in 22q11 deletion syndrome,10023944,R01MH119185,"['22q11.2', '3-Dimensional', 'Acoustic Rhinometry', 'Behavioral', 'Biometry', 'Body part', 'Brain region', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Craniofacial Abnormalities', 'Data', 'Development', 'DiGeorge Syndrome', 'Diffuse', 'Dimensions', 'Distress', 'Dysmorphology', 'Ear', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Eye', 'Face', 'Functional disorder', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genetic Risk', 'Geometry', 'Head', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Mandible', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Mental disorders', 'Minor', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Nasal cavity', 'Neurobiology', 'Nose', 'Odors', 'Olfactory Cortex', 'Olfactory Pathways', 'Oral cavity', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Peripheral', 'Phenotype', 'Process', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychophysics', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Severities', 'Smell Perception', 'Societies', 'Structural defect', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Testing', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Work', 'Youth', 'associated symptom', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'brain dysfunction', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'cost', 'effective therapy', 'functional outcomes', 'genetic disorder diagnosis', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'microdeletion', 'multilevel analysis', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuromechanism', 'neuropathology', 'olfactory bulb', 'olfactory sulcus', 'precision medicine', 'psychotic symptoms', 'resilience', 'trait']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2020,740401,0.004248241768897272
"iTransform: Wearable Biosensors to Detect the Evolution of Opioid Tolerance in Opioid Naïve Individuals PROJECT SUMMARY The integrated research and training plans outlined in this K23 submission will prepare me for a career as a clinician-scientist conducting translational substance abuse research. My career goal is to perform hypothesis- driven original research investigations directed toward reducing morbidity and mortality from opioid overdose. In this proposal, I intend to deploy wearable biosensors (small devices that continuously record physiology) to study the effects of therapeutic administration of opioid analgesics. I have already studied wearable biosensors in individuals receiving opioids; my preliminary data demonstrates that opioid-tolerant individuals have different biometric signals than non-tolerant individuals. This observation suggests that biosensors can be used to identify the onset of tolerance, an important event that correlates with higher doses of opioid analgesics, and higher risk of death from opioid overdose. Biosensor data management and analysis requires signal processing, data analytic, and machine learning techniques; these approaches are beyond the areas of traditional medical training. My short-term goal is to utilize this K23 award to fill my knowledge gaps in wearable biosensing and advanced data analysis so that I can generate ever more innovative responses to the problem of opioid prescribing, tolerance, misuse, addiction, and overdose. To optimize this important line of investigation, I have developed a training plan that includes: 1) completing a PhD through the Millennium PhD program; 2) expanding my skills in wearable biosensing and behavioral health-based research; 3) developing an understanding of signal processing and machine learning; 4) developing data analytic and data science skills; and 5) expanding my research presentation and dissemination skills. I will achieve these goals through directed coursework, focused seminars, and practical experience. My mentorship team of expert investigators who will ensure my productivity and success includes E. Boyer (primary mentor), D. Smelson, J. Fang, and P. Indic (secondary mentors), and D. Ganesan (advisor) My research plan has three specific aims: 1) to deploy a wearable biosensor technology to detect digital biomarkers associated with the initiation of opioid analgesic therapy in an opioid naïve population; 2) to use signal-processing analytics to identify transitions in digital biomarkers with progressive opioid use and to identify individual characteristics associated with this transition; and, 3) to apply and explore supervised learning algorithms that can predict transitions in digital biomarkers that herald the onset of opioid tolerance. To identify dynamic patterns in response to opioids, I will study the digital biomarkers of opioid-naïve patients with acute fractures who are prescribed opioid analgesics. Results will be used to develop “big data” approaches to apply predictive algorithms to identify the onset of opioid tolerance. This work has the potential to prevent development of problematic opioid use and will provide the basis for subsequent R01 submissions to implement sensor-based interventions triggered by the onset of tolerance in individuals receiving opioid analgesics. PROJECT NARRATIVE Morbidity and mortality related to opioids (both prescription and illicit) has reached staggering proportions: more than half of individuals who currently abuse heroin report that opioid abuse began with a prescription opioid. Dr. Carreiro has demonstrated that wearable biosensors can discriminate between individuals who are naïve to the effects of opioids from those who are opioid tolerant, a characteristic that increases risk for opioid-related death. This career development award will provide her with the training to use of wearable biosensors to identify the onset of opioid tolerance and the expertise to reach her ultimate goal of developing tools to prevent opioid-related death and increase the safety of opioid prescribing.",iTransform: Wearable Biosensors to Detect the Evolution of Opioid Tolerance in Opioid Naïve Individuals,9889092,K23DA045242,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Acute', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Analgesics', 'Area', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Biological Markers', 'Biometry', 'Biosensing Techniques', 'Biosensor', 'Characteristics', 'Consent', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Collection', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Dose', 'Drug abuse', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Fracture', 'Funding', 'Galvanic Skin Response', 'Gender', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Heroin Abuse', 'Immersion', 'Individual', 'Ingestion', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Italy', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Motion', 'Opiate Addiction', 'Opioid', 'Opioid Analgesics', 'Overdose', 'Pain', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Predictive Analytics', 'Productivity', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Records', 'Relapse', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Research Training', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Safety', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Signal Transduction', 'Skin Temperature', 'Source', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Teacher Professional Development', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Effect', 'Therapeutic Uses', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'Wrist', 'addiction', 'analytical method', 'base', 'behavioral health', 'career', 'comparative', 'data integrity', 'data management', 'digital', 'experience', 'high risk', 'innovation', 'insight', 'learning algorithm', 'mHealth', 'machine learning algorithm', 'machine learning method', 'mortality', 'novel', 'opiate tolerance', 'opioid abuse', 'opioid mortality', 'opioid overdose', 'opioid therapy', 'opioid use', 'prediction algorithm', 'prescription opioid', 'prevent', 'programs', 'recruit', 'response', 'sensor', 'signal processing', 'skills', 'social', 'success', 'supervised learning', 'tool']",NIDA,UNIV OF MASSACHUSETTS MED SCH WORCESTER,K23,2020,188616,-0.012883064814030325
"Factors associated with hospitalization, ICU use and death among vulnerable populations diagnosed with COVID-19 Project Summary. As of April 30, 2020, over 1 million individuals in the U.S. have been diagnosed with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Patients with COVID-19 may develop various symptoms – while the majority of patients have mild symptoms, some require hospitalization, admissions to intensive care unit (ICU), and may die. To date, there is only limited knowledge on risk factors associated with the severity of COVID-19. First, older adults have been found to have higher risks of developing severe symptoms of COVID-19 and are more likely to be hospitalized or die. Studies have suggested that some underlying conditions, such as hypertension, diabetes, or obesity, are associated with the severity of COVID-19. However, it is unknown to what extent these comorbidities explain the variation in the severity of COVID-19, whether older age is independently associated with the severity of COVID-19; and whether and how older age modifies the relationship between comorbidities and the severity of COVID-19. Second, it has been reported that black Americans experienced a higher rate of COVID-related hospitalization and were more likely to die of COVID- 19, compared to white Americans. However, it is unknown what may contribute to such racial difference – whether it is due to the differences in health conditions between blacks and whites, or due to the characteristics of the community where they reside in, or due to some other factors that are also associated with race. The objective of this study is to identify individual risk factors that are associated with the severity of COVID-19 (i.e. hospitalizations, ICU use and death), especially among older adults, and to understand reasons that may contribute to racial differences in COVID-19 severity. To achieve these goals, we will use the daily- updated national Veterans Affairs (VA) data, which contain rich individual-level information on veterans diagnosed with COVID-19. As of April 30, 2020, almost 9,000 veterans have been diagnosed with COVID-19, and about 500 had died, thus providing a large study cohort. This proposed study has two Specific Aims:1) To identify individual risk factors that are associated with COVID-19 related hospitalizations, ICU use and mortality, to understand the role of older age in COVID-19 severity, and to build a predictive model for COVID- 19 severity by machine learning; and 2) To examine reasons for racial differences in illness severity among veterans diagnosed with COVID-19: whether and how such difference is related to individual factors and community characteristics, especially socio-economic status. This study is innovative because it will be the first study to examine the role of multiple risk factors in the severity of COVID-19 by using national data with detailed individual-level information and machine learning algorithm; and it will be the first to examine the reasons, including the role of social determinants, for racial differences in COVID-19 severity. This proposed research is significant as it will help to identify patients with the highest-risk phenotypes, thus providing insights into disease prevention and resource allocation. Project Narrative: This proposed research aims to understand risks factors associated with the severity of COVID-19 (i.e. hospitalization, ICU use and death) and the role of older age in the severity of COVID-19; and to examine reasons leading to racial differences in the severity of COVID-19. This proposed research is highly relevant to public health because the findings from this study will help target prevention strategies and allocation of resources to high-risk populations and help fight this novel infectious disease.","Factors associated with hospitalization, ICU use and death among vulnerable populations diagnosed with COVID-19",10159581,RF1AG063811,"['Address', 'Admission activity', 'African American', 'Age', 'COVID-19', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Cohort Studies', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Death Rate', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Elderly', 'Ensure', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Hospitalization', 'Hypertension', 'Individual', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Prevention strategy', 'Public Health', 'Race', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resource Allocation', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Severities', 'Severity of illness', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Symptoms', 'Time', 'Update', 'Variant', 'Veterans', 'Virus', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'caucasian American', 'comorbidity', 'coronavirus disease', 'disorder prevention', 'experience', 'fighting', 'health administration', 'health difference', 'health service use', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'innovation', 'insight', 'machine learning algorithm', 'male', 'mortality', 'novel', 'novel virus', 'parent grant', 'predictive modeling', 'racial difference', 'racial health disparity', 'social determinants', 'sociodemographics', 'socioeconomics', 'study population', 'success']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF ROCHESTER,RF1,2020,578879,-0.03322673218662552
"Finding Genomic Profiles of COVID-19 Phenotypes from the EHR Abstract: As the world searches for effective treatments and potential cures for the COVID-19 pandemic, the ability to consolidate data, insights, and expertise from many disparate sources will be key to fully understanding the patient outcomes of the infection. Key to facilitating this type of research is a cohesive and secure research environment that enables clinicians, researchers, data scientists, and technologists from multiple organizations to work together with a common goal of better understanding COVID-19 symptoms, associated risk factors, and successful therapies. Building upon faculty, staff and infrastructure already in place through the eMERGE IV Clinical Center at Mass General Brigham, we are proposing the creation of a COVID- 19 Biobank Portal to provide a foundation for building a truly collaborative environment that is compliant with patient privacy and offers a common set of bioinformatic tools and a standardized IT approach for the staging of data and analyses. We will do this by accomplishing the following three Specific Aims which supplement the parent grant’s Aim I which is: “Polygenic risks scores will allow us to stratify eMERGE participants based on genetic risk for common complex traits” which will focus in this supplement on risk factors for severity of COVID-19 illness in our biobank participants. We propose to build on our expertise to accomplish the specific aims: Aim 1: We will create a COVID-19 Centric Biobank Portal that allows general institutional use with proper research agreements in place where patient cohorts can be studied using easily assessable and transformed data and through which genomic samples can be obtained. Aim 2: Supplement the COVID-19 Biobank Portal with test results, phenotype risk factors, symptoms, and outcomes for COVID-19 which are derived from data in the electronic health record (EHR) by using natural language processing and computational phenotypes and by performing chart reviews to validate severity indices and clinical outcomes found in COVID-19 infected patients. Aim 3: Genetic data (array and sequence data) will be contributed to the eMERGE IV network and to the International l COVID-19 Host Genetics Initiative (https://covid19hg.org) such that data can be used to calculate polygenic risk scores (PRS) for genome-wide association studies of risk phenotypes and patient outcomes and polygenic risk scores (PRS) for COVID-19 outcomes in our dataset and in collaborations with others.

"Development and clinical validation of multimodal risk algorithms for predicting future internalizing psychopathology I am currently Assistant Professor and a licensed clinical psychologist in the Department of Psychiatry at the University of Vermont. My long-term career goal is to become an independent investigator using novel strategies in developmental neuroimaging to study mood and anxiety symptomatology from birth to maturity. Although I have been trained in the analysis of longitudinal structural MRI, I require further training in the processing and analysis of state-of-the-art multiband neuroimaging data that allows for more sensitive measures of brain connectivity. I am also lacking expertise with regard to more sophisticated analytic methods for more fully leveraging large-sample multimodal datasets. Such approaches will enable me to move beyond conventional univariate statistical analyses and prepare me for future Big Data initiatives. During the proposed K08 period, my overarching goal is to develop expertise in the application of machine-learning approaches to multimodal data in order to characterize the most salient psychosocial and brain-based predictors of youth internalizing psychopathology. To achieve these goals, I am pursuing career development and training activities in the following areas: 1) assessment and characterization of psychosocial risk factors; 2) theory and implementation of Big Data methods, including machine learning algorithms and cross-validation strategies; 3) analysis of multiband multimodal brain imaging data using Human Connectome Project pipelines with the aim of more comprehensively assessing aspects of cortico-limbic connectivity; 4) independently running my own neuroimaging research study; and 5) developing and submitting a competitive R01 application. In order to obtain this expertise, I am proposing training activities at several institutions, including the University of Vermont, Harvard Medical School, McGill University, and Oregon Health and Science University. The research project in this K08 proposal aims to produce risk algorithms for a transdiagnostic dimension of psychopathology, using novel machine learning approaches to leverage two of the largest longitudinal neuroimaging samples in the world (IMAGEN and the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development study). These risk algorithms will subsequently undergo refinement using a new sample of clinic-referred youths that I will recruit from an outpatient psychiatric clinic in Vermont. As part of the project, I will also test the degree to which these algorithms predict treatment response. These data will be used as pilot data for my planned R01 application. Given the methods that I am proposing, this project will be able to detect complex non-linear interactions involving risk factors from a multitude of domains. As a result, this work will inform, and help to delineate, various etiological pathways that ultimately result in internalizing problems. Most importantly, this project could inform early identification and targeted intervention strategies during a critical period for the development of internalizing symptomatology. !

"Contextualized daily prediction of lapse risk in opioid use disorder by digital phenotyping PROJECT SUMMARY Opioid use disorder is increasingly widespread, leading to devastating consequences and costs for patients and their families, friends, and communities. Available treatments for opioid and other substance use disorders (SUD) are not successful at sustaining sobriety. The vast majority of people with SUD relapse within a year. Critically, they often fail to detect dynamic, day-by-day changes in their risk for relapse and do not adequately employ skills they developed or take advantage of support available through continuing care. The broad goals of this project are to develop and deliver a highly contextualized, lapse risk prediction models for forecasting day-by-day probability of opioid and other drug use lapse among people pursuing drug abstinence. This lapse risk prediction model will be delivered within the Addiction-Comprehensive Health Enhancement Support System (A-CHESS) mobile app, which has been established by RCT as a state-of-the-art mHealth system for providing continuing care services for alcohol and substance use disorders. To accomplish these broad goals, a diverse sample of 480 participants with opioid use disorder who are pursing abstinence will be recruited. These participants will be followed for 12 months of their recovery, with observations occurring as early as one week post-abstinence and as late as 18 months post-abstinence across participants in the sample. Well-established distal, static relapse risk signals (e.g., addiction severity, comorbid psychopathology) will be measured on intake. A range of more proximal, time-varying opioid (and other drug use) lapse risk signals will also be collected via participants’ smartphones. These signals include self-report surveys every two months, daily ecological momentary assessments, daily video recovery “check-ins”, voice phone call and text message logs, text message content, moment-by-moment location (via smartphone GPS and location services), physical activity (via smartphone sensors), and usage of the mobile A-CHESS Recovery Support app. The predictive power of these risk signals will be further increased by anchoring them within an inter-personal context of known people, locations, dates, and times that support or detract from participants’ abstinence efforts. Machine learning methods will be used to train, validate, and test opioid (and other drug) lapse risk prediction models based on these contextualized static and dynamic risk signals. These lapse risk prediction models will provide participant specific, day-by-day probabilistic forecast of a lapse to opioid (or other drug) use among opioid abstinent individuals. These lapse risk prediction models will be formally added to the A-CHESS continuing care mobile app at the completion of the project for use in clinical care. These project goals position A-CHESS to make relapse prevention and recovery support, information, and risk monitoring available to patients continuously. Compared to conventional continuing care, A-CHESS will provide personalized care and be available and implemented during moments of greatest need. Integrated real-time risk prediction holds substantial promise to encourage sustained recovery through adaptive use of these continuing care services. PROJECT NARRATIVE The project’s goals are to develop and deliver a real-time model for forecasting day-by-day opioid use lapse among abstinent patients with opioid use disorder. This lapse prediction model will be integrated into an existing, validated mHealth app to encourage sustained recovery through adaptive use of continuing care services.",Contextualized daily prediction of lapse risk in opioid use disorder by digital phenotyping,9980350,R01DA047315,"['Abstinence', 'Acoustics', 'Advertising', 'Affect', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Alcohols', 'Behavior', 'Caring', 'Cellular Phone', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Data Sources', 'Diagnosis', 'Distal', 'Drug usage', 'Ecological momentary assessment', 'Enrollment', 'Equilibrium', 'Face', 'Facebook', 'Family', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Friends', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Home environment', 'Individual', 'Intake', 'Location', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Mobile Health Application', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Narcotics', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Opioid', 'Paper', 'Participant', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Physical activity', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predictive Analytics', 'Probability', 'Psychopathology', 'Publishing', 'Race', 'Recovery', 'Relapse', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Services', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Social Environment', 'Social Network', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Support System', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Text Messaging', 'Theoretical model', 'Time', 'Training', 'Visual', 'Voice', 'addiction', 'alcohol testing', 'base', 'care providers', 'care systems', 'chronic pain', 'clinical care', 'comorbidity', 'cost', 'craving', 'digital', 'disorder later incidence prevention', 'drug abstinence', 'experience', 'information gathering', 'innovation', 'mHealth', 'machine learning method', 'meetings', 'microphone', 'mobile application', 'opioid use', 'opioid use disorder', 'overdose death', 'peer', 'personalized care', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'real time model', 'recruit', 'relapse risk', 'risk prediction model', 'rural setting', 'sensor', 'signal processing', 'skills', 'sleep quality', 'sobriety', 'social media', 'stressor', 'suburb']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R01,2020,681159,-0.02540223871541038
"Buprenorphine Effect on Suicidal Behavior Mortality and morbidity related to suicidal behavior and opioid use disorder (OUD) have increased significantly over the past decade. These two public health crises are intertwined at multiple levels.  Medications for OUD, especially buprenorphine, have the potential to decrease illicit opioid use and reduce the multiple negative consequences of OUD, including fatal and nonfatal overdose, criminal justice involvement, infectious complications, and misuse of other substances. In addition, several small randomized trials of buprenorphine treatment in treatment-resistant depression (with or without co-occurring OUD) suggest that buprenorphine may reduce depressive symptoms and suicidal ideation. No conceivable randomized trial, however, would be large enough to assess effects of buprenorphine on suicidal behavior.  Consequently, we propose a large observational study to evaluate the effects of initiating buprenorphine treatment on subsequent suicidal behavior among people with OUD, including those with and without co- occurring mental health conditions or other known risk factors for suicidal behavior. We propose to assemble data from four MHRN health systems serving a combined member/patient population of approximately 11 million. This work will take advantage of methods successfully implemented in previous MHRN research and research by our HCSRN Addictions Research Network.  Valid causal inference will require appropriate methods to account for confounding by indication (i.e. people with OUD treated with buprenorphine have higher or lower pre-existing risk of suicidal behavior than people not treated with buprenorphine). Choice of the optimal method will depend on patterns observed in actual data (e.g. rates and correlates of buprenorphine use), but we anticipate considering the following: • Propensity-score matching using machine learning-derived propensity scores • Propensity-score weighting using machine learning-derived propensity scores • Disease risk score adjustment using machine learning-derived suicide risk prediction scores Using this data resource and these analytic methods, we will address the following specific questions: 1) Overall effect: Among people with recognized OUD, how does initiation of buprenorphine treatment affect  risk of suicidal behavior over the following 90 days compared to risk among otherwise similar people with  OUD not initiating buprenorphine treatment? 2) Heterogeneity of effect: Does any effect of initiating buprenorphine vary according to:  a. Means or mechanism of suicidal behavior (opioid overdose vs. other overdose vs. self-injury)?  b. Presence/absence of co-occurring mood disorder or severe mental illness? 3) Specificity of effect: Are effects observed for buprenorphine also observed for alternative medications for treatment of OUD (e.g. naltrexone)? This large observational study will evaluate the effects of initiating buprenorphine treatment on subsequent suicidal behavior among people with opioid use disorder, including those with and without co-occurring mental health conditions or other known risk factors for suicidal behavior. We will use comprehensive health records data from four large health systems serving a combined member/patient population of approximately 11 million. Analyses will examine overall effect of buprenorphine treatment on subsequent suicide attempt or death, heterogeneity of effects in patient subgroups, and specificity of effects to buprenorphine vs other medications.",Buprenorphine Effect on Suicidal Behavior,10136935,U19MH121738,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Buprenorphine', 'Criminal Justice', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Feeling suicidal', 'Health system', 'Heterogeneity', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Naltrexone', 'Observational Study', 'Overdose', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Public Health', 'Records', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Self-Injurious Behavior', 'Specificity', 'Suicide attempt', 'Therapeutic Effect', 'Therapeutic Uses', 'Translations', 'Weight', 'Withdrawal', 'Work', 'World Health', 'addiction', 'analytical method', 'buprenorphine treatment', 'chronic pain', 'data resource', 'depressive symptoms', 'design', 'disorder risk', 'health record', 'high risk', 'illicit opioid', 'member', 'mortality', 'opioid overdose', 'opioid tapering', 'opioid use', 'opioid use disorder', 'patient population', 'patient subsets', 'population based', 'prescription opioid', 'randomized trial', 'risk prediction model', 'severe mental illness', 'social factors', 'suicidal behavior', 'suicidal morbidity', 'suicidal risk', 'targeted treatment', 'tool', 'treatment-resistant depression']",NIMH,KAISER FOUNDATION RESEARCH INSTITUTE,U19,2020,514616,-0.05998920305290272
"Social Determinants of Health and Novel Prediction of Cardiovascular Health from Young Adulthood to Middle Age in the CARDIA Study Project Summary In the U.S., approximately 840,000 Americans die from cardiovascular disease (CVD) each year. The prevalence of CVD is on the rise and widespread disparities in CVD exist across economic, racial, and ethnic groups. In order to address the rising prevalence of CVD and persistent disparities, there has been a shift in focus to public health strategies addressing cardiovascular health (CVH). CVH is a broader and more positive construct beyond the absence of CVD. Despite this recent focus on improving CVH, widespread disparities still exist. Social determinants of health (SDOH) may be important contributors to these continued disparities. The World Health Organization (WHO) defines SDOH as the “structural determinants and conditions in which people are born, grow, live, work, and age.” There has been limited work in studying how a diverse set of SDOH change over time and perform in the prediction of CVH. To address this need, we will identify patterns of SDOH exposure over time and determine if the addition of SDOH variables allows for better prediction of an individual's CVH status. The primary hypothesis is that a diverse set of SDOH will be associated with and improve the prediction of CVH, independent of baseline CVH and other covariates. To examine this hypothesis, we will pursue the following Specific Aims: 1) identify patterns of SDOH exposure up to age 50 and define exposure subgroups and 2) determine whether overall and domain-specific patterns of SDOH exposures from young adulthood to middle age, identified in Aim 1, are associated with and improve the prediction of CVH and its component metrics. We will utilize the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study, a prospective cohort study with detailed information on cardiovascular risk factors and disease in a geographically and racially diverse sample of young adults. In Aim 1, we will use a novel sequential pattern mining method to identify the associations among SDOH and determine the SDOH exposure patterns from baseline to age 50. The Aim 1 SDOH exposure definitions will be included as predictors of CVH at age 50 and beyond using supervised machine learning techniques. By including SDOH in predictive models, health services professionals and clinicians may have an improved understanding of patients at high-risk for low CVH and may better tailor social and clinical interventions to each patient's needs. If awarded, this fellowship will allow me to contribute novel research to the SDOH and cardiovascular health fields, gain competency in new research skills, and improve my writing and presentation skills. The completion of this project and training will prepare me for my long-term career goal of becoming an independent research scientist in an academic setting, studying SDOH and using data science and informatics tools to improve public health. Project Narrative The incorporation of social determinants of health (SDOH) in predictive models for cardiovascular health (CVH) may help health services professionals and clinicians in identifying patients at high-risk for low CVH. This has important public health implications because social and clinical interventions may be tailored to each patient's needs. This research may also help to identify which SDOH are predictive of CVH from young adulthood to middle age, allowing public health professionals to target specific SDOH through directed social, behavioral, and policy-related interventions.",Social Determinants of Health and Novel Prediction of Cardiovascular Health from Young Adulthood to Middle Age in the CARDIA Study,9911103,F31HL151178,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Age', 'American', 'American Heart Association', 'Award', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Blood Pressure', 'Body mass index', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Cholesterol', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Competence', 'Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults Study', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Disease', 'Economics', 'Education', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Ethnic group', 'Event', 'Fellowship', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Professional', 'Health Services', 'Health Status', 'Health behavior', 'Healthcare', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Life', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Neighborhoods', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Physical activity', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Predictive Analytics', 'Prevalence', 'Prospective cohort study', 'Public Health', 'Race', 'Research', 'Research Training', 'Risk Behaviors', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Site', 'Smoking Status', 'Social Identification', 'Socioeconomic Factors', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'Work', 'World Health Organization', 'Writing', 'age group', 'base', 'biracial', 'built environment', 'burden of illness', 'cardiovascular health', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'career', 'cohort', 'fasting plasma glucose', 'good diet', 'health disparity', 'health economics', 'high risk', 'improved', 'informatics tool', 'machine learning algorithm', 'machine learning method', 'middle age', 'mortality', 'novel', 'patient population', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'racial difference', 'racial diversity', 'secondary analysis', 'sex', 'skills', 'social', 'social factors', 'social health determinants', 'supervised learning', 'theories', 'training opportunity', 'young adult']",NHLBI,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,F31,2020,40733,-0.007260006409640085
"Clinical Biomechanics of Hip Fracture Over 300,000 hip fractures occur each year in the U.S. and up to 25% of hip-fracture patients die within a year of their injury. Despite the importance of this clinical problem, the diagnostic screening rate for osteoporosis is only 5% of the eligible population, and the sensitivity of measuring bone mineral density (BMD) by DXA, the clinical standard test for diagnosis, is only 50%. Therefore, most patients are not being screened diagnostically for osteoporosis, and for those who are, about half who will experience a hip fracture are missed. Given that the current empirical approach is inadequate, we propose to pursue a more mechanistic approach, combining state-of-the-art biomechanics and machine learning approaches. Biomechanically, the three etiological elements of hip fracture are fall risk, femoral strength, and femoral impact force. In this project, our overall goal is to provide a deeper understanding of how all three biomechanical etiological elements interact in the event of a hip fracture and from that, directly improve clinical fracture risk assessment through the use of a single predictive “Integral Biomechanical Risk (IBR)” parameter. In addition, we will also address the problem of low DXA screening rates by further developing our Biomechanical Computed Tomography (BCT) technology. This test estimates the breaking strength of the femur using finite element analysis of routine clinical CT scans previously acquired for any medical reason, and represents an improvement compared to the use of BMD alone. Since millions of patients are scanned with CT each year, this approach could double screening rates if offered as an alternative to DXA. The proposed study will investigate this biomechanical approach in a large incident hip fracture, case-cohort study (3,000 patients with hip fracture, 6,000 without). This retrospective study will include patients seen at Kaiser Permanente who had an abdominal CT scan as part of medical care prior to any hip fracture; and have standard geriatric measurements in their electronic medical records, which we will use to estimate fall risk. Specifically, our aims are to: 1) utilize electronic medical record data and CT scans to obtain patient-specific measurements related to fall risk, femoral strength, and fall severity, and 2) combine the different elements of hip fracture etiology into the IBR parameter to test the hypothesis that this metric predicts hip fracture independent of age, sex, BMI, race/ethnicity, and history of prior fracture and improves hip fracture prediction compared to the clinical standard (BMD with FRAX). Scientifically, a major novelty of this work is its use of contemporary machine learning algorithms to inform construction of a mechanistic model of the three etiological elements of hip fracture, which should better capture any interactions between these elements compared to a purely statistical-regression approach. In addition, the study cohort will be the largest and most diverse CT-based hip fracture cohort ever assembled. Importantly, positive results from this project would provide a compelling “second front” to DXA that could be quickly translated to widespread clinical practice, profoundly impacting osteoporosis care. STATEMENT OF RELEVANCE More than half of individuals who experience hip fracture do not have osteoporosis as assessed by DXA. This project draws together the latest technological advances in CT-based finite element modeling and combines it into a probabilistic model of fracture risk that uses as inputs, data typically available in medical records. By going beyond BMD, the fracture risk prediction tool developed by this work aims to significantly improve clinical fracture risk assessment and substantially impact the preventative care and treatment of osteoporosis.",Clinical Biomechanics of Hip Fracture,9886227,R01AR074958,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Archives', 'Biomechanics', 'Blinded', 'Bone Density', 'Calibration', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical assessments', 'Cohort Studies', 'Complex', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Discrimination', 'Dual-Energy X-Ray Absorptiometry', 'Economics', 'Elderly', 'Elements', 'Ensure', 'Equilibrium', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Femur', 'Finite Element Analysis', 'Fracture', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hip Fractures', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Intramuscular', 'Investigation', 'Logistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Records', 'Modeling', 'Muscle', 'Osteoporosis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Preventive care', 'Preventive treatment', 'Probability', 'Race', 'Recording of previous events', 'Regression Analysis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Scanning', 'Severities', 'Shapes', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Statistical Models', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Validation', 'Weight', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'abdominal CT', 'base', 'biomechanical model', 'bone', 'bone strength', 'clinical practice', 'clinical risk', 'clinical translation', 'cohort', 'diagnostic screening', 'ductile', 'electronic data', 'experience', 'fall risk', 'falls', 'fracture risk', 'high risk', 'hip bone', 'improved', 'indexing', 'insight', 'kinematics', 'machine learning algorithm', 'neuromuscular', 'older patient', 'patient health information', 'screening', 'sex', 'soft tissue', 'standing height', 'theories', 'tool']",NIAMS,"O.

"Cross-sectional and longitudinal predictors of distressing psychotic-like experiences in childhood and adolescence Project Summary Research has yet to understand why some with psychotic-like experiences (PLEs; early markers of psychosis risk) transition to psychosis spectrum disorders whereas others report only transient PLEs. This information will be critical for understanding the etiology of psychosis spectrum symptoms and for prevention and intervention efforts for this major public health concern (~90% of individuals with significant PLEs report mental health diagnoses in adulthood). According to the expanded proneness-persistence-impairment (PPI) model, potential distinguishing factors between transient PLEs and those transitioning to psychotic disorders is whether they are sustained and distressing (i.e., sustained dPLEs). Consistent with NIMH Strategic Objective 2, this K23 application will fill critical missing gaps in the literature by characterizing the key risk factors and clinical significance of early sustained dPLEs. The application will focus on ~11,800 children from the Adolescent Brain and Cognitive Development study initially aged 9-11-years-old followed annually over the course of the award. The analyses will test PPI model hypotheses, including investigating the most important factors distinguishing sustained from transient dPLEs, examining neurobiological correlates (e.g., resting state functional connectivity, cortical thickness, cognitive functioning), family history of psychosis, motor and speech developmental delays, and environmental predictors (adverse childhood experiences, cannabis use; Aim 1). Models will also test whether longitudinal changes in cognitive, neural predictors, and environmental risk factors distinguish sustained versus transient dPLEs (Aim 2). Lastly, the application will also fill a critical research gap by examining the clinical significance of sustained dPLEs, examining the social and educational functional impairments, treatment seeking behavior, and conducting additional data collection when the youth are ages 16 to 18 to assess the base rates of attenuated psychosis syndrome (APS) among youth endorsing sustained dPLEs (Aim 3). To assess rates of APS, the applicant and a masters-level clinician will interview a subset of ABCD participants (n=500) and their parents/caregivers using the Structured Interview of Prodromal Syndromes. Overall, the applicant will implement rigorous practices, including running all analyses for the aims and hypotheses outlined below on two-thirds of data and then replicating the exact same models on an untouched one-third of data. Under the mentorship of a diverse team of experts of developmental psychosis spectrum psychopathology, longitudinal analyses, machine learning, and neuroimaging analyses, this scientifically rigorous proposal will test hypotheses regarding cross- sectional and longitudinal predictors of sustained versus transient dPLEs for the future application of early identification and preventative interventions. The application addresses several gaps in the applicant’s training that are critical for success as an independent clinical investigator, including the need for further training in advanced statistical techniques (e.g., machine learning, longitudinal analyses, neuroimaging analyses) and increased exposure in the area of developmental psychosis spectrum psychopathology. PROJECT NARRATIVE The current application will make important advances in understanding the nature of early markers of risk for psychotic disorders such as schizophrenia, otherwise known as psychotic-like experiences. Specifically, we do not yet understand why some individuals go on to develop more severe forms of psychotic-like experiences (i.e., sustained distressing psychotic-like experiences) and why for some individuals these experiences are transient. The current application will make significant strides in understanding the most important factors (such as family history and cognition) distinguishing sustained from transient distressing psychotic-like experiences, as well as understanding the clinical importance of these symptoms (including how many individuals with sustained distressing psychotic-like experiences seek treatment or have problems in school or at homes as a result of these symptoms).",Cross-sectional and longitudinal predictors of distressing psychotic-like experiences in childhood and adolescence,10054751,K23MH121792,"['11 year old', 'Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Area', 'Award', 'Behavior', 'Brain', 'Caregivers', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive deficits', 'DSM-V', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Developmental Delay Disorders', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Distress', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemiology', 'Etiology', 'Exposure to', 'Family', 'Family history of', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Home environment', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Institution', 'Interview', 'Knowledge', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Nature', 'Neurobiology', 'Neuropsychological Tests', 'Neurosciences', 'Occupational', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Psychopathology', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Project Summaries', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk Marker', 'Running', 'Schizophrenia', 'Schools', 'Site', 'Speech', 'Structure', 'Sustainable Development', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Training', 'Youth', 'adverse childhood events', 'aged', 'attenuated psychosis syndrome', 'base', 'career', 'clinically significant', 'cognitive development', 'cognitive function', 'data modeling', 'experience', 'functional disability', 'improved', 'large scale data', 'longitudinal analysis', 'machine learning method', 'marijuana use', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'relating to nervous system', 'skills', 'social', 'structured data', 'success', 'theories']",NIMH,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,K23,2020,162963,0.007346018442878461
"Obesity Prevention in Early Life (OPEL): Risk Screening and Targeted Intervention Given the difficulty of reversing obesity once present, there has been increasing focus on the primary prevention of obesity early in the lifecourse. Few attempts have been made to prevent obesity during the first years of life. This proposal summarizes a 5-year program of mentored professional development tied to a multi-method research project intended to improve the identification and potential treatment of infants and toddlers with high risk for obesity. My long-term goal is to prevent obesity by identifying infants at greatest risk and providing for them an effective, family-centered intervention that targets modifiable, life course factors. My central hypothesis, based on my prior research, is that identifying infants at risk for obesity prior to the onset of unhealthy weight gain will enable early intervention. My research plan aims to: (1) create risk prediction models for obesity at age 24 months by linking three existing data systems that combine birth certificate, contextual- level, and health outcome data; (2) test the feasibility of linking these data prospectively to validate the Aim 1 obesity risk prediction models over a 24-month period within a contemporary, clinical cohort; and (3) identify best approaches for family-focused risk communication regarding the prevention of excessive weight gain and obesity in infants and toddlers using a human-centered design approach. Through my career development plan and guidance from my mentors, I will expand upon a foundation in epidemiology and pediatric health services research to develop expertise in machine learning, health informatics, data integration, qualitative methods, human-centered design, and behavior change. Together, the research and educational aims of this proposal will provide me with the necessary groundwork to compete for additional funding as an independent investigator. Specifically, I will seek R03-level grant funding from the NIDDK in year 4 of my K01 award to test the communication strategy developed in Aim 3 and to partner with families to modify an existing behavioral change intervention for use in infancy. By the end of this award, I will be well positioned to apply for funding from the NIDDK to conduct a robust R01-level study that combines the validated prediction models, family- focused communication strategy, and modified intervention to determine whether we can effectively prevent obesity in those infants and toddlers identified as being at the highest risk. This line of research will help ensure that prevention efforts are deployed in an efficient, cost-effective manner and accepted by those who need them. I will accomplish this work under the mentorship of Dr. Aaron E. Carroll, a child health services researcher, and a multidisciplinary team of faculty with expertise machine learning, health informatics, data integration and surveillance, qualitative research, human-centered design approaches, behavior change, and childhood obesity. I am ideally suited to complete this research due to my past research productivity, current mentorship team, open access to health care data, and the established clinical decision support infrastructure at the Indiana University School of Medicine. Project Narrative Increasing evidence suggests that the infancy and toddler periods represent the best opportunity for obesity prevention, but few attempts have been made to prevent obesity during the first years of life. The current proposal seeks to develop practical methods to assess the risk of future obesity in infants and toddlers in the clinical setting, and to partner with families to explore new ways to communicate early life obesity risk in ways that account for their perceptions, concerns and beliefs. This proposal has the promise to lead to targeted, tailored interventions for infants most at-risk for obesity, ensuring that prevention efforts are deployed in an efficient, cost-effective manner and accepted by those who need them.",Obesity Prevention in Early Life (OPEL): Risk Screening and Targeted Intervention,9912764,K01DK114383,"['Address', 'Age', 'Age-Months', 'Award', 'Behavioral', 'Belief', 'Birth Certificates', 'Child', 'Child Health Services', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Epidemiology', 'Faculty', 'Family', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Geographic Information Systems', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health Services Research', 'Health Status', 'Human', 'Indiana', 'Infant', 'Information Systems', 'Infrastructure', 'Intervention', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mentored Research Scientist Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Child Health and Human Development', 'National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases', 'Obesity', 'Obesity Epidemic', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Perception', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Pregnancy Histories', 'Prevention', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Primary Prevention', 'Process', 'Productivity', 'Public Health Informatics', 'Publishing', 'Qualitative Methods', 'Qualitative Research', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Source', 'Testing', 'Toddler', 'Universities', 'Weight', 'Weight Gain', 'Work', 'approach behavior', 'base', 'behavior change', 'career development', 'clinical decision support', 'cohort', 'cost effective', 'data access', 'data integration', 'data warehouse', 'design', 'epidemiologic data', 'health care availability', 'health data', 'healthy weight', 'high risk', 'improved', 'infancy', 'innovation', 'machine learning method', 'medical schools', 'multidisciplinary', 'obesity in children', 'obesity prevention', 'obesity risk', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'programs', 'prospective', 'risk prediction model', 'screening', 'sociodemographics', 'tool']",NIDDK,INDIANA UNIV-PURDUE UNIV AT INDIANAPOLIS,K01,2020,139614,0.020271168376573185
"In Vivo Knee Motion and ACL Biomechanics During Dynamic Activities Abstract: Radiographic evidence of OA is present in more than 50% of patients 10 years after ACL reconstruction. However, the etiology of early onset OA after ACL reconstruction is not well understood. While previous work has demonstrated changes in joint motion following reconstruction, it is unclear how these altered motions relate to changes in the local mechanical response of cartilage to in vivo loading. This information may be critical to understanding the onset of OA, as the mechanical response of cartilage affects cartilage homeostasis. In line with this mechanism, our pilot data indicates that regions of high cartilage strain measured in patients with ACL injury and reconstruction are susceptible to decreased cartilage thickness, a characteristic feature of OA. Importantly, these degenerative changes are observed as early as 18 months post-reconstruction. Therefore, in this proposal our overall hypothesis is that site-specific changes in the mechanical response of cartilage to loading following ACL injury and reconstruction are predictive of long-term cartilage degeneration. Specifically, we hypothesize that in regions of cartilage experiencing elevated strain during loading, early degeneration will be reflected by altered composition and decreased cartilage thickness. Thus, we will measure localized cartilage strain, composition, and thickness at four time-points: after ACL injury but prior to reconstruction, as well as at 3 months, 1 year, and 2 years after surgery. At each time point, a combination of high-speed biplanar radiography and MR imaging will be used to measure local cartilage strains during in vivo loading. To assess cartilage degeneration, we will use MRI to measure site-specific changes in composition (using T1rho and T2 relaxation times) and cartilage thickness. Additionally, our analyses will account for relevant biological variables such as age, sex, and BMI, and clinical factors such as graft placement characteristics and meniscus injuries. In addition to mechanical factors, biological factors such as joint inflammation and lubrication may also play a role in cartilage degeneration after ACL reconstruction. Therefore, synovial fluid and serum will be collected to measure inflammatory mediators and metabolic biomarkers. Using this data, we will develop a predictive model of cartilage degeneration after ACL reconstruction that utilizes both mechanical and biological factors, as well as other demographic and clinical characteristics, to predict declines in cartilage health. Furthermore, this comprehensive dataset will be used to develop clinical phenotypes to identify those at high risk for cartilage degradation after ACL reconstruction. Importantly, the development of these phenotypes will enable targeted treatment approaches focusing on surgical procedures, pharmaceutical targets, and non- pharmacological interventions such as physical therapy or weight loss in preventing cartilage degeneration. Therefore, our findings will both elucidate the role of alterations in the local mechanical response of cartilage on degeneration after ACL reconstruction and improve the identification and treatment of patients at high risk for cartilage degeneration.

"Longitudinal neuroimaging and neurocognitive assessment of risk and protective factors across the schizophrenia spectrum PROJECT SUMMARY Schizotypal personality disorder (SPD) is similar to schizophrenia (SZ), but with fewer and attenuated abnormalities, thus representing an important yet understudied intermediate SZ-spectrum phenotype. Examination of abnormalities in SPD will provide information regarding etiology, genetics, treatment and risk factors associated with psychosis. Although individuals with SPD demonstrate marked temporal lobe abnormalities that resemble SZ, we hypothesize that relative “sparing” or “functional enhancement” in the frontal lobes (e.g., dorsolateral prefrontal cortex), may protect these individuals from frank psychosis and the severe social and cognitive deficits typically observed in SZ. Studying SPD is powerful as antipsychotic medication and hospitalization confounds observed in SZ are not present. Moreover, there is no study examining neurobiological changes in the SZ-spectrum that incorporates individuals with SPD using a longitudinal design as proposed here. This novel approach will help disentangle potential risk and protective factors for psychosis in the SZ spectrum. This is the first longitudinal study to utilize multimodal MR imaging and Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) approaches in SZ-spectrum disorders to identify aberrant neural circuitry along a continuum from healthy controls (HCs) to SPD to SZ and examine changes in these measures in relationship to impairments in symptom severity, neurocognition and functional outcome. We propose studying three groups (80 in each) of demographically matched and rigorously diagnosed individuals (age 18- 40): HCs (no Axis I or personality disorder), unmedicated individuals with SPD (and no Axis I disorder), and early-onset (first 2 years of illness) SZ patients at baseline, 9-, and 18-month follow-up. Measures assessing frontal and temporal lobe integrity include multimodal MR imaging (structural MRI, DTI, resting-state fMRI, and task-based fMRI with a nonverbal event related working-memory task; baseline and 18-months) and neuropsychological assessment (all three timepoints). We will utilize dynamic causal modeling to test competing neurobiological models involving abnormal frontotemporal connectivity in the SZ-spectrum and machine learning approaches to integrate multimodal neuroimaging, neurocognitive, and clinical assessment data. We focus on three specific aims: (1) Investigate the longitudinal course of frontal-temporal lobe/circuitry abnormalities in the SZ-spectrum using multimodal MR imaging; (2) Investigate the longitudinal course of neurocognition, clinical, and functional outcome in the SZ spectrum; (3) Determine which factor or combination of factors differentiate groups in the SZ-spectrum to identify those that are associated with risk for and protection from SZ using machine learning. PROJECT NARRATIVE Schizotypal personality disorder (SPD) is similar to schizophrenia (SZ), but with fewer and attenuated abnormalities, representing an important yet understudied intermediate SZ-spectrum phenotype that provides important information regarding etiology, genetics, treatment and risk factors associated with psychosis. This study utilizes a Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) approach coupled with longitudinal multimodal MR imaging and neurocognitive assessment in SZ-spectrum disorders to identify aberrant neural circuitry and cognition along a continuum from healthy controls to SPD (in the SZ spectrum but not fully psychotic) to SZ (psychosis).

"Identifying primary care patients at increased risk of atrial fibrillation for screening interventions Project Summary/Abstract Atrial Fibrillation (AF) increases the risk of stroke 5-fold and accounts for roughly 15% of all strokes in the United States. Many individuals may have undiagnosed AF whose arrhythmia does not prompt evaluation either because of minimal symptoms or brief episodes. Oral anticoagulation (OAC) is highly effective at reducing stroke risk in patients with AF, but is only prescribed to individuals with recognized disease. Identifying subjects with undiagnosed AF is important so they may be treated with OAC and prevent strokes from occurring. This project will help advance our knowledge of screening patients for undiagnosed AF in the primary care setting by identifying patients at high risk of developing AF for targeted clinic and home-based screening strategies. Fundamental questions of who to target and how to implement a screening program in the United States remain unanswered. To address these gaps in knowledge, the principal investigator (PI) proposes a career development program that blends rigorous methodologic and content area training with an innovative research agenda. This plan has three scientific objectives: 1) To identify predictors of AF incidence from electronic health record structured and free-text data, 2) To develop and implement an electronic algorithm that improves upon existing models to identify patients at increased risk for AF in a primary care population, and 3) To implement and evaluate feasibility, acceptability, appropriateness, and usability of a clinic and home-based screening program to identify undiagnosed AF. This project aligns with several objectives of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute’s Strategic Vision by implementing novel diagnostic tools to diagnose AF and prevent strokes, by optimizing clinical and implementation research to improve health and reduce disease, and leveraging emerging opportunities in data science, through the use of natural language processing of text data in the electronic health record, to improve identification of patients at high risk for AF. The long-term goal of this career development award is to establish the PI as an independent researcher with expertise in cardiovascular disease and targeting populations for prevention of cardiovascular disease events. Career development activities include training in biomedical informatics, data mining and risk prediction, survey research design, implementation research, and cardiovascular disease pathophysiology and clinical management through formal coursework, clinical shadowing, as well as mentorship by an exceptionally qualified team of senior scientists. Successful completion of this career development proposal will improve prediction of which patients are at the highest risk of developing AF, and evaluate how to use this risk information to implement an effective screening strategy in primary care. Pilot data from this award will lay the groundwork for a highly competitive application for NIH R01 funding. Project Narrative Atrial fibrillation increases the risk of ischemic stroke and the prevalence is estimated to increase from 5.2 million adults in the United States to more than 12 million by 2030, however, many additional individuals have undiagnosed disease. The proposed research program will significantly advance our understanding of screening for undiagnosed atrial fibrillation, by 1) improving identification of patients at high risk of developing atrial fibrillation, and 2) targeting patients at high risk of developing atrial fibrillation in the primary care setting with an efficient strategy for clinic and home-based screening. This program will significantly increase knowledge of how to overcome the real-world issue of how to effectively and efficiently screen for atrial fibrillation in clinical practice.",Identifying primary care patients at increased risk of atrial fibrillation for screening interventions,9982695,K01HL148506,"['Address', 'Adhesives', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Anticoagulation', 'Area', 'Arrhythmia', 'Atrial Fibrillation', 'Award', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caring', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Research', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'General Hospitals', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Technology', 'Home environment', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Ischemic Stroke', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Massachusetts', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Oral', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Primary Health Care', 'Principal Investigator', 'Program Development', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Senior Scientist', 'Stroke', 'Stroke prevention', 'Structure', 'Survey Methodology', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'Target Populations', 'Techniques', 'Text', 'Training', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vision', 'Work', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'cardiovascular disorder prevention', 'career development', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'data mining', 'data registry', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'implementation research', 'implementation science', 'improved', 'innovation', 'mHealth', 'medical specialties', 'mobile computing', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'patient screening', 'population based', 'practice setting', 'primary care setting', 'programs', 'prospective', 'randomized trial', 'risk minimization', 'screening', 'screening program', 'stroke risk', 'structured data', 'tool', 'usability']",NHLBI,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,K01,2020,177770,-0.054769560523544626
"Southern California Clinical Center of the Type 1 Diabetes in Acute Pancreatitis Consortium This application describes a robust Southern California-based Clinical Center for participation in the Type 1 Diabetes in Acute Pancreatitis Consortium (T1DAPC). Proposed protocols address the metabolic mechanisms and the genetic, protein, and imaging signature of patients with acute pancreatitis (AP) and recurrent acute pancreatitis (RAP) who are at high risk for future development of diabetes. AP is the most common cause of pancreatogenic diabetes. While meta-analyses have revealed an incidence rate of 23% for diabetes arising after AP, they have not shed light on the type of diabetes that develops, which may comprise autoimmune or idiopathic type 1 diabetes (T1DM), type 2 diabetes (T2DM), or a unique diabetes pathobiology. A detailed understanding of diabetes developing after AP will yield great benefit by facilitating novel approaches to predict, prevent, and treat this form of diabetes. The following aims are proposed to address these goals:  Specific Aim 1. Recruit a cohort of non-diabetic patients with a recent episode of AP or RAP and prospectively characterize their islet autoimmunity and glucose/insulin homeostasis using the frequently sampled intravenous glucose tolerance test and mixed meal tolerance tests performed 1 month after hospital discharge, and at 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months, and yearly thereafter. The goals of this aim are to (a) determine the incidence of diabetes after AP, (b) identify the types of diabetes that develop after AP, (c) identify early metabolic trajectories associated with post-AP diabetes, (d) assemble the cohort that will be the platform for Aims 2-4.  Specific Aim 2. Evaluate genetic and protein risk factors for diabetes in patients with AP or RAP. This Aim will evaluate association of genetic risk scores for T1DM and T2DM with post AP diabetes. Thirteen candidate proteins, associated with post AP diabetes in preliminary studies, will be assessed for association with incident diabetes after AP, yielding a key set of proteins with utility not only in diabetes prediction but also targets for future preventive or therapeutic measures.  Specific Aim 3. Characterize the imaging phenotype that predicts development of diabetes after AP or RAP. Retrospective CT scans obtained during hospitalization for AP as well as CT and novel multiparametric MRI scans obtained 1 and 12 months afterward will undergo artificial intelligence analysis to identify the imaging biomarkers that signal diabetes risk.  Specific Aim 4. Develop a multi-factorial model to predict development of diabetes after AP or RAP. A wealth of data will be collected from Aims 1-3, which will be combined with clinical factors to build and validate (in independent datasets) an integrative predictive model of post AP diabetes. The goal is to create a model that can be used in clinical settings to identify those at highest risk, facilitating targeted measures to prevent diabetes.  This innovative research will be conducted by an experienced team of investigators in endocrinology, gastroenterology, imaging, physiology, and epidemiology to solve a problem of great public health significance. This is an application for the establishment of a Southern California Clinical Center to participate in the Type 1 Diabetes in Acute Pancreatitis Consortium, comprised of an expert team to carry out studies of the Consortium in Los Angeles County, the most populous and ethnically diverse county in the United States. Acute pancreatitis, one of the most frequent causes of hospitalization in the USA, greatly increases the risk of future development of diabetes, yet the type of diabetes is unclear. We propose studies to determine the metabolic mechanisms and the genetic, protein, and imaging signature of diabetes occurring after pancreatitis, which will provide the means to understand, prevent, and treat this form of diabetes.",Southern California Clinical Center of the Type 1 Diabetes in Acute Pancreatitis Consortium,10128180,U01DK127403,"['Address', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Autoantibodies', 'Autoimmune Process', 'Autoimmunity', 'Biological Assay', 'Blood', 'California', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'County', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Defect', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Endocrinology', 'Enrollment', 'Epidemiology', 'Etiology', 'Fasting', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Gastroenterology', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genotype', 'Glucose', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Homeostasis', 'Hormonal', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Insulin', 'Insulin Resistance', 'Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Intake', 'Lead', 'Light', 'Liquid substance', 'Los Angeles', 'MRI Scans', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Necrosis', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Pancreas', 'Pancreatitis', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Preventive', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Recurrence', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Set protein', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Swelling', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'United States', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'acute pancreatitis', 'base', 'chronic pancreatitis', 'clinical center', 'cohort', 'design', 'diabetes risk', 'ethnic diversity', 'experience', 'genetic association', 'genetic profiling', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'high risk', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insulin secretion', 'intravenous glucose tolerance test', 'islet', 'non-diabetic', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'pancreas imaging', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'recruit', 'response', 'type I and type II diabetes']",NIDDK,CEDARS-SINAI MEDICAL CENTER,U01,2020,324613,-0.015991786275226745
"Mentoring in patient-oriented atrial fibrillation and cardiovascular research PROJECT SUMMARY This application will provide the Principal Investigator, Dr. Alvaro Alonso, with protected time and other support to (1) accelerate a successful record of mentoring junior clinical investigators and graduate students engaged in patient-oriented cardiovascular research; (2) obtain additional training in omics, machine learning, and mentoring best-practices; and (3) advance Dr. Alonso's ongoing research on the risk factors and mechanisms contributing to the development of atrial fibrillation (AF). Mentoring activities will build upon the ongoing involvement of Dr. Alonso in several training programs at Emory University, including an NHLBI-funded multidisciplinary T32 training grant on cardiovascular health disparities, the research-track Cardiology fellowship program at the School of Medicine, and the Master of Public Health and PhD programs in epidemiology at the Rollins School of Public Health. Training will focus on cutting-edge methodological areas in rapid development, including integration of omic technologies and machine learning in patient-oriented research, as well as acquisition of skills in academic, research, and clinical mentoring. Finally, this award will support a research project that extends Dr. Alonso's ongoing work on understanding the factors influencing the development of the AF substrate, understanding AF pathophysiology, and preventing AF-related outcomes. The specific aims of this research are: (1) to identify novel AF phenotypes (phenogroups) using extensive clinical and multi-omic data (“phenomapping”), (2) to discover specific risk factors for the different AF phenogroups, and (3) to determine associations of AF phenogroups with selected endpoints (stroke, heart failure, mortality). These research aims will be carried out in the context of the Emory Cardiovascular Biobank, an ongoing prospective registry of patients undergoing cardiac catheterization in three Emory-affiliated hospitals currently including approximately 7,000 unique individuals with detailed phenotyping, clinical outcomes, and multi-omic markers. In summary, the activities proposed in this application will favorably impact Dr. Alonso's capabilities to conduct cutting-edge and innovative patient-oriented research on cardiovascular prevention and his ability to perform as a highly qualified mentor for junior clinicians pursuing research on clinical cardiovascular epidemiology and prevention. PROJECT NARRATIVE Despite progress, atrial fibrillation, a common cardiac arrhythmia, remains a major public health program. This award will contribute to advance our understanding of the causes and consequences of atrial fibrillation.

"Imaging the Suicide Mind using Neurosemantic Signatures as Markers of Suicidal Ideation and Behavior ABSTRACT: The assessment of suicidal risk is critical for treatment planning and monitoring of therapeutic progress for suicidal individuals. Current standard-of-care relies on patient self-report and clinician impression, which are not strongly predictive of imminent suicidal risk. This project advances a highly innovative approach to the assessment of suicidal risk, by using machine-learning detection of brain activation patterns that are neural signatures of individual concepts that have been altered in suicidal individuals. The overarching goal is to establish reliable neurocognitive markers of suicidal ideation (SI) and attempt (SA) in individual participants, and to assess these measures’ ability to predict future ideation and attempts. In previous work, this approach was applied to the fMRI-based neurosemantic signature (NSS’s) during the thinking about each of 30 words related to either to suicide, negative concepts, or positive concepts in 17 SI young adults and 17 healthy controls (HCs). A machine learning classifier was able to discriminate between the SI and HCs with 91% accuracy, based on differential brain activation patterns in the L superior medial frontal cortex and anterior cingulate, areas known to be involved in self-referential thinking. Within the ideators, NSS’s also discriminated between those with a history of a SA from those without such a history with 94% accuracy. Moreover, using the classification algorithm derived from this sample, we were able to accurately classify a second sample of suicidal individuals with 87% accuracy. It was also possible to assess the emotions differentially manifested during the thinking about these words, and thus to differentiate SI from HC with 85% accuracy, and SI with and without SA with 88% accuracy. On the basis of these promising pilot findings, we propose to study 300 young adult SI (about half of whom will have made a SA), 100 never-suicidal psychiatric controls, and 100 HCs, use fMRI to assess NSS at intake and 3 months, and assess for suicidal ideation and behavior at intake, 3, 6, and 9 months thereafter. The goals are to determine if: (1) NSS’s are sensitive to changes in level of suicidal ideation when repeated at 3 months; and (2) whether NSS can predict trajectories of suicidal ideation and behavior upon prospective follow-up. We will also examine the relationship between NSS activation of circuits related to self-referential thinking and the death/suicide Implicit Association Test (IAT) that examines the extent to which a person associates suicide-related concepts with self. Finally, as a translational goal, we aim to develop and test a neurally based IAT that examines associations of suicidal concepts with self and with emotions as informed by NSS findings. This study, by shedding light on alterations in suicidal individuals’ neural representation of suicide-relevant concepts could be extremely useful for: (1) identification of those with suicidal ideation who may not self-report their level of risk; (2) monitoring fluctuations in suicidal risk over time; (3) identification of emotional states associated with suicidal ideation; (4) guiding therapy to mitigate these alterations; and (5) the prediction of future suicidal ideation and behavior. PROJECT NARRATIVE: This project takes a novel approach to the study of suicidal risk by examining the differences in brain activation patterns between suicidal and non-suicidal young adults when thinking about concepts related to suicide, negative, and positive emotions while undergoing neuroimaging. We use modern computing techniques called machine learning to identify brain activation patterns that differentiate suicidal and non-suicidal individuals and that can help to predict future suicidal ideation and behavior and will develop an easy-to-use computer test based on these brain activation studies that we hope will also be predictive of future suicidal ideation and behavior. If this project is as successful as our preliminary work, it will advance clinical practice by improving clinicians’ ability to: (1) detect and monitor suicidal risk, (2) understand alterations in thinking and feelings related to suicide in their patients; and (3) develop personalized treatment strategies for their suicidal patients based on their altered patterns of thinking and feeling that can more precisely and effectively reduce suicidal risk.",Imaging the Suicide Mind using Neurosemantic Signatures as Markers of Suicidal Ideation and Behavior,9901631,R01MH116652,"['Affect', 'Age', 'Anterior', 'Area', 'Brain', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical assessments', 'Computers', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Feeling', 'Feeling suicidal', 'Frequencies', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Implicit Association Test', 'Individual', 'Intake', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Methods', 'Mind', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Neurocognitive', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Pilot Projects', 'Recording of previous events', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Severities', 'Shame', 'Suicide', 'Suicide attempt', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'cingulate cortex', 'classification algorithm', 'clinical practice', 'design', 'follow-up', 'frontal lobe', 'ideation', 'impression', 'improved', 'innovation', 'learning classifier', 'longitudinal design', 'neural patterning', 'neuroimaging', 'novel strategies', 'personalized medicine', 'positive emotional state', 'predictive test', 'prospective', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'standard of care', 'suicidal', 'suicidal behavior', 'suicidal individual', 'suicidal morbidity', 'suicidal patient', 'suicidal risk', 'treatment planning', 'treatment strategy', 'young adult']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2020,720691,-0.10584253680747203
"2/5 CAPER Computerized assessment of psychosis risk Summary  Research suggests that early identification of individuals at clinical high risk (CHR) for psychosis may be able to improve illness course. Studies suggest that early identification of CHR using specialized interviews with help-seeking individuals (with attenuated psychosis symptoms) is a useful approach. This work has two major limitations: 1) interview methods have limited specificity as only 20% of CHR individuals convert to psychosis, and 2) the expertise needed to make CHR diagnosis is only accessible in a few academic centers. We propose to develop a new psychosis symptom domain sensitive (PSDS) battery, prioritizing tasks that show correlations with the symptoms that define psychosis and are tied to the neurobiological systems and computational mechanisms implicated in these symptoms. To promote accessibility, we utilize behavioral tasks that could be administered over the internet; this will set the stage for later research testing widespread screening that would identify those most in need of in-depth assessment. To reach that goal we first need determine which tasks are effective for predicting illness course and how this strategy compares to published prediction methods. We propose to recruit 500 CHR participants, 500 help-seeking individuals, and 500 healthy controls across 5 sites with the following Aims: Aim 1A) To develop a psychosis risk calculator through the application of machine learning (ML) methods to the measures from the PSDS battery. In an exploratory ML historical analysis, we will determine the added value of combining the PSDS with self-report measures and predicators;Aim 1B) We will evaluate group differences on the risk calculator score and hypothesize that the risk calculator score of the CHR group will differ from help-seeking and healthy controls. We further hypothesize that the risk calculator score of the CHR converters will differ significantly from groups of CHR nonconverters, help-seeking and healthy controls. The inclusion of a help-seeking group is critical for translating the risk-calculator into clinical practice, where the goal is to differentiate those at greatest risk for psychosis from those with other forms of psychopathology; Aim 1C): Evaluate how baseline PSDS performance relates to symptomatic outcome 2 years later examining: 1) symptomatic worsening treated as a continuous variable, and 2) conversion to psychosis. We hypothesize that the PSDS calculator: 1) will predict symptom course and, 2) that the differences observed between converters and nonconverters will be larger on the PSDS calculator than on the NAPLS calculator. Aim 2) Use ML methods, as above, to develop calculators that predict: 2A) social, and, 2B) role function deterioration, both observed over two years. Because negative are more strongly linked to functional outcome than positive symptoms, we predict that negative mechanism tasks will be the strongest predictor of functional decline in both domains.This project will provide a next-generation CHR battery, tied to illness mechanisms and powered by cutting-edge computational methods that can be used to facilitate the earliest possible detection of psychosis risk. Narrative  Early detection of young people at clinical high risk for psychosis offers a critical opportunity for early intervention to improve the course of illness, and perhaps even prevent onset entirely. Current interview-based methods for psychosis risk detection lack specificity, and are only available in a handful of research centers in the United States. The proposed study aims to improve accessibility and broaden impact of high risk screening by testing brief computerized measures, ultimately able to be administered on the internet, and to improve prediction by focusing on tasks specific to underlying mechanisms driving emerging psychotic symptoms.",2/5 CAPER Computerized assessment of psychosis risk,9978241,R01MH120088,"['Address', 'American', 'Attenuated', 'Automobile Driving', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Detection', 'Deterioration', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Human Resources', 'Individual', 'Internet', 'Intervention Trial', 'Interview', 'Joints', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurobiology', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Primary Prevention', 'Psychopathology', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sample Size', 'Secondary Prevention', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Severities', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Translating', 'United States', 'Work', 'Youth', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'cognitive testing', 'computerized', 'design', 'follow-up', 'functional decline', 'functional outcomes', 'help-seeking behavior', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'improved', 'machine learning method', 'new therapeutic target', 'next generation', 'prevent', 'psychotic symptoms', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'screening', 'social', 'trait']",NIMH,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,377685,0.02933781690900867

"4/5 CAPER: Computerized assessment of psychosis risk Summary  Research suggests that early identification of individuals at clinical high risk (CHR) for psychosis may be able to improve illness course. Studies suggest that early identification of CHR using specialized interviews with help-seeking individuals (with attenuated psychosis symptoms) is a useful approach. This work has two major limitations: 1) interview methods have limited specificity as only 20% of CHR individuals convert to psychosis, and 2) the expertise needed to make CHR diagnosis is only accessible in a few academic centers. We propose to develop a new psychosis symptom domain sensitive (PSDS) battery, prioritizing tasks that show correlations with the symptoms that define psychosis and are tied to the neurobiological systems and computational mechanisms implicated in these symptoms. To promote accessibility, we utilize behavioral tasks that could be administered over the internet; this will set the stage for later research testing widespread screening that would identify those most in need of in-depth assessment. To reach that goal we first need determine which tasks are effective for predicting illness course and how this strategy compares to published prediction methods. We propose to recruit 500 CHR participants, 500 help-seeking individuals, and 500 healthy controls across 5 sites with the following Aims: Aim 1A) To develop a psychosis risk calculator through the application of machine learning (ML) methods to the measures from the PSDS battery.

"Risk Factors for Psychosis and Mania with Prescription Amphetamine Use ABSTRACT: The use of prescription amphetamines for the treatment of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) has markedly increased in the last fifteen years, with the greatest increase in adolescents and young adults. In 2007, the FDA mandated changes to stimulant labels to warn of increases in psychosis and mania in patients without pre-existing conditions. Our multidisciplinary research team from Brigham and Women's Hospital and McLean Hospital recently published a landmark cohort study demonstrating an increased risk of psychotic episodes in new users of amphetamine compared to methylphenidate in adolescents and young adults with ADHD. Alarmingly, the use of amphetamines increased four-fold over the study period (2004 – 2015). In addition, our data show that prescription amphetamine use has dramatically increased in patients with pre-existing bipolar disorder. Thus, there is an urgent need to accelerate knowledge about prescriber-level factors, patient-level factors and disease states that potentiate the risk of psychosis and mania with prescription amphetamines. Large-scale studies using real-world data are the only option to study the risk of infrequent and serious adverse outcomes. In Aim 1, using incident-user cohort study designs, we will utilize data from two national administrative claims databases to identify prescriber dosing strategies that increase the risk of first-episode psychosis in ~220,000 adolescents and adults with ADHD initiating amphetamines. We hypothesize that there will be a dose-dependent increase in the risk of psychosis. The goal of Aim 2 is to identify patient subgroups at heightened risk of psychosis/mania with prescription amphetamine use. To accomplish this goal, we will perform a case control study using electronic medical records (EMR) from McLean Hospital in ~1,650 patients hospitalized for an initial episode of psychosis or mania compared to ~3,300 controls with a first psychiatric hospitalization for reasons other than psychosis or mania. We will apply natural language processing to unstructured narrative notes to capture detailed patient data not available in claims data. We hypothesize that patients with a family history of psychiatric illness will have an increased risk of psychosis/mania with amphetamines compared to patients without a family history. We also hypothesize that patients with concurrent cannabis use will have an increased risk of psychosis/mania with amphetamines compared to patients without cannabis use. Aim 3 compares the risk of treatment-emergent mania in ~52,000 new users of amphetamine versus methylphenidate in a cohort study of patients with pre-existing bipolar disorder, an urgent issue given the known risk of mania with stimulant use. Combined, these studies will provide actionable evidence to be incorporated into clinical practice guidelines with the goal of mitigating the risk of psychosis and mania with prescription stimulants. The proposed research agenda aligns with NIMH Strategic Objective 3.3 “Striving for Prevention and Cure” on testing interventions in real-world practice settings to evaluate the impact of patient- and provider-level factors on clinical outcomes. PROJECT NARRATIVE: In recent years, 6.1 million U.S. children and adolescents were diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and 16 million adults reported past-year use of prescription stimulants. The research team recently found an increased risk of psychosis in new users of prescription amphetamines compared to new users of prescription methylphenidate in adolescents and young adults with ADHD, translating to potentially increased risk of psychosis for thousands of U.S. patients. Therefore, identifying patient subgroups and prescribing practices that increase the risk of psychosis and mania with prescription amphetamines has enormous public health significance and will guide providers to avoid amphetamines in patients at highest risk, preventing future cases of psychosis and mania.",Risk Factors for Psychosis and Mania with Prescription Amphetamine Use,9939094,R01MH122427,"['Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adolescent and Young Adult', 'Adult', 'Affective', 'Age', 'Amphetamine Users', 'Amphetamines', 'Antipsychotic Agents', 'Area', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Big Data', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Boston', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Practice Guideline', 'Clinical Practice Patterns', 'Cohort Studies', 'Complement', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Family', 'Family history of', 'First Degree Relative', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Immigration', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention', 'Journals', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Manic', 'Measurement', 'Medicine', 'Mental disorders', 'Modification', 'Mood stabilizers', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Natural Language Processing', 'New England', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Pharmacy facility', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Practice Guidelines', 'Prevention', 'Principal Investigator', 'Provider', 'Psychiatric Hospitals', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Race', 'Recording of previous events', 'Relative Risks', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Ritalin', 'Sampling', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Translating', 'Woman', 'adverse outcome', 'amphetamine use', 'base', 'comorbidity', 'comparative', 'cost effective', 'data warehouse', 'first episode psychosis', 'high risk', 'innovation', 'marijuana use', 'patient subsets', 'practice setting', 'prevent', 'stimulant use', 'treatment risk', 'university student']",NIMH,MCLEAN HOSPITAL,R01,2020,746678,0.022477338008501217
"Prediction of risk of disability worsening and inflammatory disease activity in MS utilizing multimodal prediction algorithms Project Summary:  Multiple sclerosis (MS) exhibits a markedly heterogeneous and unpredictable course, with a clinical spectrum ranging from very mild forms of the disease in some patients (often termed “benign MS”) to an aggressive disease course with rapid accumulation of disability in others. Furthermore, there appears to be significant inter-individual variability in the responses to the many available disease-modifying therapies (DMT). A variety of factors have been proposed to be associated with the disease course in MS, including demographics, lifestyle factors, clinical characteristics, MRI-derived measures, and elevated serum neurofilament light chain (NfL), among others. It remains unclear though if these factors are complementary or redundant in their predictive value. Moreover, there is a lack of validated tools to accurately predict, at an individual level, future inflammatory disease activity or disability worsening. This is largely due to the lack of datasets with sufficient size, breadth and representativeness. The use of electronic medical records (EMR) has dramatically increased in recent years, enabling the capture of a wide variety of data measures from large numbers of individuals. Furthermore, the development and refinement of statistical machine learning methods has revolutionized the approach to analysis of such high-dimensional datasets. This background provides a unique opportunity to leverage and analyze “big data” in order to develop clinical risk prediction algorithms and personalized medicine tools in MS.  Multiple Sclerosis Partners Advancing Technology and Health Solutions (MS PATHS) is a network of 10 MS centers that have standardized elements of their clinical practice to implement a centralized health information exchange architecture. MS PATHS was designed around the concept of a learning health system (LHS), merging research with ongoing patient care by collecting standardized clinical and imaging data during routine medical visits. As of August, 2019, >15,000 patients have opted to participate in MS PATHS. Thus, the MS PATHS network is an ideal, deeply phenotyped, “real-world”, large population of people with MS, in which clinically relevant predictive algorithms may be developed and validated.  The goal of the current project is to develop and validate multi-modal predictive algorithms of clinically relevant disease outcomes in MS. We hypothesize that integrating a wide variety of potential predictors, including demographics, clinical characteristics (including current/historical DMT use), comorbidities/lifestyle factors, MRI- derived measures and laboratory data (including serum NfL) will lead to the development and validation of algorithms that may accurately predict future clinical disability worsening and inflammatory disease activity. Furthermore, this approach will allow the assessment of the individual contribution of specific predictors to the developed predictive algorithms, and may aid with the identification of novel risk factors of disease severity in MS. Project Narrative Successful completion of this project will lead to the development and dissemination of clinically relevant predictive algorithms to enable personalized risk assessment and therapeutic decision-making in MS, provide the means to optimize selection/stratification of participants in clinical trials, and will also provide insight regarding the interactions and relative importance of putative prognostic factors in MS.",Prediction of risk of disability worsening and inflammatory disease activity in MS utilizing multimodal prediction algorithms,10039145,K23NS117883,"['Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Award', 'Benign', 'Big Data', 'Biological Markers', 'Biostatistical Methods', 'Blood specimen', 'Brain', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Counseling', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Demographic Factors', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Digit structure', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Elements', 'Enhancing Lesion', 'Enrollment', 'Exhibits', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Health', 'Health system', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Inflammatory', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Light', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Prognostic Factor', 'Recording of previous events', 'Relapse', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Serum', 'Severity of illness', 'Standardization', 'Stratification', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Visit', 'Walking', 'base', 'biobank', 'career', 'clinical practice', 'clinical predictors', 'clinical risk', 'clinically relevant', 'comorbidity', 'demographics', 'design', 'dexterity', 'disability', 'follow-up', 'foot', 'gray matter', 'high dimensionality', 'insight', 'inter-individual variation', 'lifestyle factors', 'machine learning method', 'multimodality', 'neurofilament', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'performance tests', 'personalized medicine', 'prediction algorithm', 'processing speed', 'prognostic', 'response', 'statistical and machine learning', 'tool', 'walking speed']",NINDS,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,K23,2020,199260,0.00431200414761655
"Novel computational techniques to detect the relationship between sitting patterns and metabolic syndrome in existing cohort studies. Abstract Metabolic syndrome is a cluster of conditions (increased blood pressure, high blood sugar, excess body fat around the waist, and abnormal cholesterol or triglyceride levels) that occur together, increasing risk of heart disease, stroke and diabetes. Epidemiological studies have shown that prolonged sitting is deleterious to metabolic indicators, even after adjusting for physical activity (PA). Acute laboratory trials have shown that breaking up sitting time can improve metabolic factors. Sitting is a prevalent behavior in all population groups by age, gender and ethnicity. Associations with metabolic syndrome factors, such as obesity, have also been shown in all population groups. Epidemiological studies have mostly depended on reported sitting time, especially TV reviewing. More recently large cohort studies have collected data from hip worn accelerometers and applied a cut point (e.g., 100 counts per minute) on single axis data to estimate sedentary time. Such devices have been included in numerous studies, principally because of their accuracy to measure PA intensity. Primarily used in intervention trials to reduce sitting, the thigh worn ActivPAL has been shown to more accurately assess posture and provide valid measures of sitting, standing, and sit-stand transitions. To date, very few health outcome cohort studies have included the ActivPAL. Compared to the ActivPAL and free living observations of sitting time, the 100 count cut point has been shown to underestimate prolonged sitting by substantially overestimating sit-stand transitions. New studies are showing that how we accumulate sitting time (i.e. in long or short bouts) is associated with metabolic health outcomes, and may be independent of total sitting time and PA. Study results on prolonged sitting and metabolic risk factors from accelerometer data are inconsistent and may be due to measurement error in the cut points employed. In a small sample of older women, adults, and youth we have demonstrated that novel machine learned methods can greatly improve estimates of prolonged sitting and transitions. Further development and testing of these methods would support valid applications to existing large cohort studies with raw accelerometer data to improve estimates of associations between sitting patterns and metabolic health. There are also many large cohorts (e.g. NHANES 2003/6), with quality health outcomes, but non raw accelerometer count data, so calibration methods to adjust non raw estimates of sitting time are also needed and would be attractive to researchers not yet familiar with the machine learning process. We proposed to employ 7 existing data sets (N=20,000) matched for age and spanning youth, adults and older adults. We will scale up our training and test the performance of the refined algorithms to detect sit-stand frequencies, prolonged sitting, usual bout duration and Alpha (a combination of duration & frequency). We will test performance of the algorithms against ActivPAL (ground truth) and in new samples assess predictive validity with objective health outcomes. We will test differences between the existing and new techniques using R2 and mean-squared error of prediction (via bootstrapping) and GEE techniques. Narrative There are many large studies with existing data that could be better used to understand health behaviors. We will focus on improving measurement of sitting patterns from body worn devices. We will see how sitting is related to obesity and other metabolic risk factors for chronic disease across different age groups.",Novel computational techniques to detect the relationship between sitting patterns and metabolic syndrome in existing cohort studies.,10003222,R01DK114945,"['Accelerometer', 'Acute', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'American Heart Association', 'Behavior', 'Blood Glucose', 'Blood Pressure', 'Body Patterning', 'Body fat', 'Calibration', 'Cholesterol', 'Chronic Disease', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cohort Studies', 'Computational Technique', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Elderly', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Frequencies', 'Gender', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health behavior', 'Hip region structure', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Trial', 'Laboratories', 'Longitudinal cohort study', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic syndrome', 'Methods', 'National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Physical activity', 'Population Group', 'Posture', 'Process', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Stroke', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thigh structure', 'Time', 'Training', 'Triglycerides', 'Use of New Techniques', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Youth', 'age group', 'algorithm training', 'cohort', 'epidemiology study', 'heart disease risk', 'improved', 'indexing', 'machine learning algorithm', 'novel', 'older women', 'performance tests', 'response', 'scale up', 'sedentary', 'young adult']",NIDDK,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2020,640068,-0.02695599303702724

"Clinical, Radiologic and Biochemical Factors Related to Diabetes Development after Acute Pancreatitis Abstract Nearly 40% of patients develop diabetes after an initial episode of acute pancreatitis (AP). Various studies have evaluated risk factors for the development of diabetes but they have shown inconsistent findings, suggesting methodologic shortcomings. The present proposal consists of three specific aims where we will attempt to determine the biochemical, radiologic and clinical factors related to the development of diabetes after AP. Aim 1: To identify autoantibodies associated with the progression of type 1 diabetes in patients after AP using a large human proteome array. Aim 2: To study the role of imaging, more specifically quantitative textural analysis to predict the development of type 1 diabetes after AP. Aim 3 is to build a machine learning model to predict type 1 diabetes after AP using patient-related risk factors, textural analysis on imaging and autoantibodies involved in disease progression. Our proposal will help us better understand diabetes after AP. Successful completion of this study has the potential to improve management for AP. Project Narrative Relevance to Public Health Statement Acute pancreatitis is increasing in incidence and can lead to diabetes in some patients. Diabetes is a morbid disease. We plan to study both established and novel risk factors for developing diabetes in patients with acute pancreatitis.","Clinical, Radiologic and Biochemical Factors Related to Diabetes Development after Acute Pancreatitis",10128083,U01DK127400,"['Acute', 'Acute Necrotizing Pancreatitis', 'Address', 'Antibodies', 'Autoantibodies', 'Autoantigens', 'Autoimmune Diabetes', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Autoimmune Responses', 'Autologous Transplantation', 'Beta Cell', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Markers', 'Biopsy Specimen', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical/Radiologic', 'Collection', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diabetes autoantibodies', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Glucagon', 'Goals', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Hypoglycemia', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Inflammatory', 'Insulin', 'Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mediating', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Organ', 'Organ failure', 'Pancreas', 'Pancreatic Diseases', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Prediabetes syndrome', 'Process', 'Proteome', 'Proteomics', 'Public Health', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recovery', 'Recurrence', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Serological', 'Serum', 'Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Texture', 'Time', 'Total Pancreatectomy', 'Visceral', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'acute pancreatitis', 'base', 'biomarker identification', 'clinical center', 'clinical risk', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'impaired glucose tolerance', 'improved', 'islet', 'macrovascular disease', 'model development', 'mortality', 'novel', 'nutrient absorption', 'predictive modeling', 'radiological imaging', 'radiomics', 'subcutaneous', 'systematic review']",NIDDK,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,U01,2020,286563,-0.0051148928741822025
"Characterizing Trauma Outcomes: From Pre-trauma Risk to Post-trauma Sequelae Abstract Background: Trauma is common, but we have little ability to predict who will develop post-trauma psychopathology. Consistent challenges to our understanding of the etiology of post-trauma psychopathology include: (1) obtaining unbiased prospective data on risk factors preceding or concurrent with trauma; (2) the inability to model large comprehensive risk structures with traditional null hypothesis testing methods, despite the knowledge that risk factors do not operate in isolation; and (3) the almost universal focus on PTSD outcomes to date, while post-trauma psychopathology likely involves various symptoms spanning multiple disorder categories. The aims of this study are to (1) use data from a large, prospective population trauma cohort to establish multidimensional classes of post-trauma psychopathology which include diagnoses from various theoretically derived categories (e.g., stress diagnoses, mood disorders, personality disorders) and (2) to discover multivariate predictor sets and novel interactions which predict post- trauma psychopathology class membership and class transitions over time. Given the projected sample size we will also be able to examine gender differences in psychopathology and resilience, as well as differences by trauma type. Study Design: This study will make use of national prospective data previously assembled as part of an R21 project (and augmented with additional trauma data and more years of follow-up) to establish a trauma cohort from 1995 – 2015. Trauma cohort members will have experienced at least one of 10 traumatic events (i.e., fires/explosions, accidents and assaults, poisoning, life-threatening illness/injury, pregnancy-related trauma and sudden family deaths). Extensive pre- trauma and post-trauma data on psychiatric diagnoses, treatment (medication and psychotherapy) and social variables will be included. We will use latent class analyses to characterize multidimensional post-trauma psychopathology outcomes (including the absence of psychopathology) and latent transition analyses to examine changes in class membership over time. Machine learning statistical methods will be applied to the expansive risk factor data to develop multivariate predictor sets for outcome classes and class transitions over time. Bias analyses will be used to assess the impact of various forms of systematic error on our results. Implications: This study fulfills NIMH’s strategic priorities of (1) charting mental illness trajectories to determine when, where, and how to intervene and (2) strengthening the public health impact of NIMH-supported research. Our approach will achieve robust and valid risk profiles of post-trauma psychopathology in the most efficient way possible by using pre- existing prospective data from a full and unselected population. A life course multidimensional approach to trauma research is a critical next step in this field. In future work, psychopathology classes and multivariate predictor sets discovered as part of this study can be replicated and expanded in other populations to examine variations of our findings, and used as the basis for a more detailed exploration of newly discovered pathways to psychopathology risk and resilience following trauma. Narrative This large general population-based trauma cohort study will elucidate risk profiles for multidimensional psychopathology and resilience following trauma. Use of registry-based data from an unselected population and rigorous epidemiologic methods allows us to efficiently examine predictor combinations (e.g., psychiatric diagnoses, treatments, social variables), while minimizing bias.

"Understanding the role of community determinants in opioid use disorder and program implementation factors influencing patient adherence to opioid agonist therapy PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  To inform an effective response to the opioid epidemic, understanding the multilevel factors that influence risk of opioid use disorder (OUD) is critical. In addition, although the efficacy of medication-assisted treatment (MAT) for OUD is proven, long-term retention in treatment has been a challenge. Thus, efforts are needed to identify program implementation factors that can be strengthened to improve OUD treatment outcomes. The K01 Award will provide the candidate the requisite skills and mentored research experience necessary to meet her long-term goal of conducting independent, innovative research on OUD and its treatment that can guide strategic investment to prevent OUD and inform implementation of MAT programs to increase patient adherence. This proposal comprises a 5-year plan that includes mentorship by Wade Berrettini, MD, PhD, Brian Schwartz, MD, MS, H. Lester Kirchner, PhD, MS, Danielle Mowery, PhD, MS, and Alanna Kulchak Rahm, PhD, MS; didactic training activities to meet the candidate's training goals; and conduct of a two-phase research project that will provide the candidate with substantive experience leading epidemiologic research using electronic health record (EHR) data and in implementation science. The proposed research will be conducted at Geisinger, an integrated healthcare system serving a large geographically diverse region of Pennsylvania, leveraging its research assets—including a wealth of health-related EHR data and linked genetic data—and the ability to integrate research into the clinical environment. The aims of the research are twofold. Aim 1 centers on the social determinants that engender vulnerability to OUD, evaluating associations of community contextual factors related to socioeconomic, social, and physical conditions with OUD, and the role individual-level genetic risk factors, healthcare factors, and comorbid medical conditions play in these relations. Aim 1 will utilize EHR and genetic data from Geisinger patients (n = 18,728) coupled with secondary data characterizing community factors to conduct a nested case-control study. Aim 2 seeks to understand program implementation factors that impact patient adherence to MAT for OUD. Aim 2 is a mixed methods study that will involve interviews with key informants (n ≈ 30) to identify multilevel barriers and facilitators influencing MAT success, followed by a survey of adult patients (n = 500) in Geisinger's MAT clinics to quantify factors influencing MAT adherence from a patient perspective. Completion of this research will fulfill the candidate's short-term goals by providing training in: (1) OUD, its treatment, and substance use disorder research; (2) natural language processing; (3) measurement of contextual factors; (4) statistical analysis including multilevel modeling and mediation analysis; (5) gene-environment interaction research; and (6) implementation science. The proposed research will generate evidence to understand novel, understudied risk factors for OUD, with implications for investment in community-level prevention interventions, and how health systems can improve treatment retention among individuals with OUD. PROJECT NARRATIVE  The proposed research will elucidate how community contextual factors related to economic, social, and physical conditions work in conjunction with individual-level genetic risk factors, healthcare factors, and comorbid medical conditions in generating or mitigating risk for opioid use disorder. It will also identify program implementation factors at the individual, interpersonal, and organizational levels that influence adherence to medication-assisted treatment among patients with opioid use disorder. The research results will inform investment in preventive interventions where community conditions may increase risk for opioid use disorder as well as how health systems can increase retention in treatment programs for opioid use disorder.",Understanding the role of community determinants in opioid use disorder and program implementation factors influencing patient adherence to opioid agonist therapy,10054517,K01DA049903,"['Abate', 'Adherence', 'Administrator', 'Adult', 'Buprenorphine', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'County', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Death Rate', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Dropout', 'Economics', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Epidemiologist', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genotype', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Health Status', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Individual', 'Integrated Health Care Systems', 'Interview', 'Investments', 'Knowledge acquisition', 'Link', 'Measurement', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentored Research Scientist Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nested Case-Control Study', 'Opioid', 'Outpatients', 'Overdose', 'PF4 Gene', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pennsylvania', 'Pharmacogenetics', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Program Effectiveness', 'Qualitative Research', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Surveys', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Treatment outcome', 'Work', 'addiction', 'base', 'biobank', 'buprenorphine treatment', 'case control', 'community intervention', 'comorbidity', 'compliance behavior', 'contextual factors', 'deprivation', 'design', 'disorder risk', 'epidemiology study', 'exome sequencing', 'experience', 'gene environment interaction', 'genetic risk factor', 'health data', 'illicit opioid', 'implementation science', 'improved', 'informant', 'innovation', 'medication-assisted treatment', 'mortality', 'multilevel analysis', 'novel', 'opioid agonist therapy', 'opioid epidemic', 'opioid mortality', 'opioid overdose', 'opioid treatment program', 'opioid use', 'opioid use disorder', 'overdose death', 'prevent', 'programs', 'response', 'rural counties', 'scale up', 'skills', 'social', 'social cohesion', 'social determinants', 'social health determinants', 'socioeconomics', 'success', 'treatment adherence', 'treatment program']",NIDA,GEISINGER CLINIC,K01,2020,162032,-0.033989437633946254
"Predictive modeling of peripartum depression ABSTRACT Psychiatric problems surrounding parturition affect both the mother’s health and her child’s developmental trajectory. Peripartum depression (PPD), referring to a depressive episode occurring during pregnancy or after childbirth, is both common and morbid. PPD has been implicated in various short and long term adverse outcomes, including preterm delivery and heightened risk for mental illness in the adult offspring. In extreme cases, PPD can lead to maternal suicide and/or infanticide. Although an estimated 760,000 American women (and children) suffer from PPD each year and screening for PPD has been recommended by the USPTF, no accurate screening tool is available to adequately identify women at risk of PPD. This novel study will capitalize on the rich clinical, demographic, and laboratory information in patients’ electronic medical reports (EMRs) to improve screening for PPD. We propose to implement advanced machine learning methods to build a model to optimize identification of women at risk for PPD. We we will adopt a psycho-social- biological approach of mental illness to prospectively explore the combined effect of various disease-related factors in improving the accuracy of PPD prediction. Our dataset will make use of a sample of 20,000 women who have been followed during their obstetrical care in two leading academic hospitals in Boston. We will gather information concerning socioeconomic factors, relevant obstetric factors, and mental and physical conditions in pregnancy and disease history, as derived from laboratory test results and the patient’s report. We expect our findings to advance scientific knowledge of women at risk for PPD. Our work may lead to the development of a screening protocol that is low-cost and easily performed by health providers in clinical settings. Early identification of women at risk could potentially allow targeted interventions to reduce the prevalence and morbidity of PPD in the US. This in turn could reduce treatment costs, avoid a potentially preventable disease, and improve the quality of care and health outcomes of mothers and their children. Our study accords with the NICD high priority area of research aimed at improving the health of women during and after pregnancy and improving pregnancy outcomes. The proposed project will further the NICHD mission that women suffer no harmful effects from reproductive processes, and that children achieve healthy and productive lives. PROJECT NARRATIVE Peripartum depression (PDD) referring to the occurrence of depressive episode during pregnancy or following childbirth is a common and serious illness. While the US Preventive Services Task Force recommends universal screening for PPD, there is no accurate tool to predict women who would be at risk of suffering from PPD. The goal of this study is to test a machine learning predictive model of PPD using information in patients’ medical records to decrease PPD’s prevalence and ultimately prevent it.",Predictive modeling of peripartum depression,9958240,R03HD101724,"['Adopted', 'Adult Children', 'Advisory Committees', 'Affect', 'American', 'Anxiety', 'Area', 'Biological', 'Birth', 'Boston', 'Caring', 'Child', 'Child Development', 'Child Health', 'Childbirth', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Complex', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Discipline of obstetrics', 'Disease', 'Early identification', 'Educational Intervention', 'Eligibility Determination', 'Etiology', 'Feeling suicidal', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Hospitals', 'Infanticide', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Low income', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mothers', 'National Institute of Child Health and Human Development', 'Newborn Infant', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Perinatal', 'Postpartum Period', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Outcome', 'Premature Birth', 'Prevalence', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Preventive service', 'Primigravidities', 'Psyche structure', 'Quality of Care', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Reproductive Process', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Scientific Advances and Accomplishments', 'Screening procedure', 'Socioeconomic Factors', 'Suicide', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Third Pregnancy Trimester', 'Time', 'Training', 'Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Treatment Cost', 'Woman', 'Women&apos', 's Health', 'Work', 'adverse outcome', 'antenatal', 'antepartum depression', 'base', 'cost', 'depressive symptoms', 'health of the mother', 'holistic approach', 'improved', 'insight', 'machine learning method', 'novel', 'obstetric care', 'patient health information', 'peripartum depression', 'physical conditioning', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive test', 'predictive tools', 'prevent', 'primipara', 'prospective', 'psychosocial', 'screening', 'sociodemographic factors', 'tool']",NICHD,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R03,2020,84000,-0.008523738872493528
"Diseases of Despair in Young Adulthood: Risk, Resilience, and Prevention ABSTRACT After decades of improvement, premature mortality is uniquely on the rise in the U.S. among White non- Hispanic adults with low education. Suicide, drug poisoning (particularly from opiates), and alcoholic liver disease appear to be the culprits and have been coined “deaths of despair.” Suicidal thoughts and behaviors, illicit drug use, and alcohol problems (or “diseases of despair,” DoD)—the conditions that likely precede these deaths—are the focus of this application, as are the pathways to these DoD. Despite many years of research and in the face of rising suicides and a nationwide opiates public health emergency, we lack accurate and appreciable predictions of who will succumb to DoD and who will be shielded from them. Speedy new insights on the development of DoD are needed to inform efforts to reverse the rising tide of DoD. These can only be generated with decades' worth of prospective-longitudinal data with rich coverage of multiple levels of risk and protective factors—from community contexts to molecular mechanisms—with clinically-relevant characterizations of DoD. Realistically, no single extant dataset can fulfill these requirements. Secondary data analysis of multiple long- term longitudinal studies of recent cohorts, with recent young adult assessments, can provide an unprecedented opportunity here. We capitalize on three complementary, long-standing, prospective- longitudinal data sets spanning childhood, adolescence, and young adulthood, with recent assessments in young adulthood. (1) The nationally representative National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (Add Health) allows for fine-grained socio-structural characterizations of individuals and communities affected by DoD. (2) The community-representative psychiatric-diagnostic Great Smoky Mountains Study (GSMS) was collected in mostly impoverished rural communities in Appalachia—one of the epicenters of the DoD epidemic. It features a quasi-experiment that allows testing for whether cash transfers—received by a subgroup of participants for over 15 years—are protective against DoD. (3) Fast Track is a comprehensive 10- year randomized clinical intervention trial with 15 years of follow-up data that targeted mechanisms that are key in recent models of pathways to DoD. The first aim is to look longitudinally at the developmental epidemiology of DoD across the early lifespan in the nationally-representative Add Health and in the rural- Appalachian GSMS with a large American Indian subsample. The second aim is to test a childhood/adolescent strain  young adult social/economic disengagement  despair  DoD pathways model and also to test protective factors that could intervene on each pathway. We will also use discovery-focused machine learning algorithms to uncover new pathways to DoD in Add Health and GSMS. The third aim is to assess the impact of childhood interventions on DoD in GSMS and Fast Track. PROJECT NARRATIVE This interlocking series of aims allows us to identify who is at risk for DoD in contemporary America, how they came to be, and whether DoD could be prevented by early intervention. Results will provide direct, actionable and fine-tuned knowledge for prevention science and public policy efforts to curb the troubling new premature mortality trends.","Diseases of Despair in Young Adulthood: Risk, Resilience, and Prevention",9917845,R01MH117559,"['Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Alcohol abuse', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Alcoholic Liver Diseases', 'Algorithms', 'American Indians', 'Americas', 'Appalachian Region', 'Behavior', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Biological Response Modifier Therapy', 'Censuses', 'Cessation of life', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Coin', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'County', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Economics', 'Education', 'Epidemic', 'Epidemiology', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Exposure to', 'Feeling suicidal', 'Grain', 'Health', 'Immune', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Trial', 'Knowledge', 'Life Expectancy', 'Longevity', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Mediation', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Neighborhoods', 'Not Hispanic or Latino', 'Opioid', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Poisoning', 'Premature Mortality', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Psychopathology', 'Public Policy', 'Quasi-experiment', 'Race', 'Randomized', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Rural', 'Rural Appalachia', 'Rural Community', 'Science Policy', 'Series', 'Societies', 'Subgroup', 'Suicide', 'Testing', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'cost', 'deprivation', 'disorder risk', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'illicit drug use', 'insight', 'longitudinal dataset', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mortality risk', 'multimodality', 'prevent', 'programs', 'prospective', 'protective factors', 'psychosocial', 'public health emergency', 'resilience', 'secondary analysis', 'sex', 'social', 'social structure', 'sociodemographics', 'suicidal behavior', 'trend', 'young adult']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF VERMONT & ST AGRIC COLLEGE,R01,2020,371411,-0.06302934282097648
"Connectome-based neuromarkers of problem cannabis use Project Summary/Abstract  Insufficient knowledge of brain-based risk factors for problem cannabis use is a key barrier to identifying individuals at risk for cannabis-related harm and designing targeted prevention and early intervention approaches to promote positive development for persons at risk. The current proposal combines multiple, large- scale, neuroimaging datasets with novel densely-sampled fMRI data to identify a neuromarker of problem cannabis use and characterize its development prior to cannabis use onset, and in the context of current cannabis use in adolescence. We will apply a whole-brain, machine-learning method – connectome-based predictive modeling – to identify a neural network predictive of problem cannabis use in a large sample of college students (Brain and Alcohol Research in College Students study; BARCS), and compare this network to canonical neural networks previously implicated in risk for cannabis use: frontoparietal, salience, and default mode networks. We will then examine the developmental trajectory of these cannabis risk networks in relation to other known risk factors for addiction prior to cannabis use onset in the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) dataset, a nationally-representative sample of 11,875 children. We will examine whether individuals at high-risk for substance use problems (family history of substance use and exposure to early adversity) display a delay in the typical trajectory of network stabilization within cannabis risk networks. Finally, we will collect densely-sampled fMRI data (4 scans in 6 months) from 20 adolescents (age 15-17) who regularly use cannabis and 20 age- and sex-matched typically-developing adolescents. This study design will enable us to examine cannabis effects on short-term neural network dynamics and evaluate whether cannabis using adolescents are characterized by reduced stability of cannabis risk networks relative to their typically-developing peers. By combining multiple existing large-scale neuroimaging datasets with original, longitudinal, densely- sampled fMRI data, the proposed study design offers a unique opportunity to examine the interplay between neural mechanisms of risk for problem use and cannabis exposure effects on the developing adolescent brain and promises to yield important insights into the neural mechanisms of risk for problem cannabis use that can foster novel prevention and intervention initiatives to mitigate cannabis-related harms for individuals at high risk.  The current proposal also aims to provide Dr. Sarah Lichenstein with expert mentorship by Drs. Pearlson, Casey, Yip, Scheinost and Stevens to build the skills necessary to develop into an independent clinical scientist applying multimodal neuroimaging methods to study the pathophysiology of addiction. Dr. Lichenstein will pursue specialized training in studying cannabis effects on brain and behavior, big data science, and the conduct of research with adolescent participants. Furthermore, the collection of novel, densely-sampled, adolescent fMRI data will also provide Dr. Lichenstein with a rich and unique pilot dataset to support the submission of a R01 application by the end of the award period and facilitate her transition to an independent investigator. Project Narrative Cannabis use is extremely common and associated with clinically-significant negative outcomes for a subset of users, yet it is not currently possible to predict who is at highest risk for cannabis-related harms at the individual level. The current proposal aims to identify a neural network predictive of problem cannabis use, and to characterize the development of this network both before and after cannabis use onset. Elucidating the neural basis of problem cannabis use will facilitate the development of novel prevention and early intervention efforts to mitigate potential cannabis-related harms for individuals at highest risk.",Connectome-based neuromarkers of problem cannabis use,10038977,K08DA051667,"['18 year old', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Award', 'Base of the Brain', 'Brain', 'Cannabis', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Early Intervention', 'Exhibits', 'Exposure to', 'Family', 'Family history of', 'Fostering', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Knowledge', 'Literature', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Play', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk Marker', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Scientist', 'Specificity', 'Students', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Work', 'addiction', 'alcohol research', 'base', 'big-data science', 'brain behavior', 'brain research', 'clinically significant', 'cognitive development', 'connectome', 'connectome based predictive modeling', 'design', 'early life adversity', 'endogenous cannabinoid system', 'high risk', 'illicit drug use', 'improved', 'insight', 'machine learning method', 'marijuana legalization', 'marijuana use', 'multimodality', 'neural network', 'neurobiological mechanism', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'peer', 'predictive modeling', 'relating to nervous system', 'sex', 'skills', 'university student']",NIDA,YALE UNIVERSITY,K08,2020,191700,-0.029886214464632747
"Acute predictors of long-term post-trauma outcomes in youth victims of violence Youth violence victimization is common and increases risk for a host of negative health outcomes, most notably posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), which is the strongest predictor of poor quality of life following trauma, even among those injured during the event. Given the potential harmful sequelae of trauma exposure, it is crucial to identify acute post-victimization risk factors that predict chronic PTSD. At this juncture relatively little data exists to aid in prediction of youth at risk for poor long-term adjustment following victimization or other types of trauma, and there are no studies measuring relevant neural systems. Thus, our team aims to 1) characterize acute post-victimization neurobehavioral predictors of risk for chronic PTSD with a focus on prefrontal-subcortical function during processing of threat processing and frontoparietal networks for cognitive control, and 2) use machine learning to identify the most robust set of predictors of chronic PTSD drawn from a comprehensive assessment of youth neuroimaging, behavior and self-report, parent and family factors, and neighborhood and community variables. Our team is well-prepared to successfully achieve these aims, as we have relevant expertise in conducting prospective longitudinal assessment of acute neurobehavioral predictors of risk for PTSD in adults (Larson), conducting longitudinal assessment of youth victims of violence (Levas), and longitudinally characterizing neurobehavioral profiles of youth PTSD (Herringa). We will recruit youth victims of violence aged 10-16 from the Emergency Department at Children’s Hospital of Wisconsin in Milwaukee, and conduct comprehensive assessments at 2 weeks, 3 months, and 12 months following victimization. To achieve a final sample of 200 youth at 12 month follow-up, we will recruit 240 youth, oversampled for risk for PTSD based on currently available brief self-report indicators. Each assessment will include measures of neural systems instantiating threat processing, including both reactivity to threat and anticipation of unpredictable and predictable threat, and cognitive control, along with measures of PTSD and other symptoms, cognitive functioning, family environment, social and school functioning, and socioenvironmental factors (e.g. neighborhood disadvantage, discrimination). We will examine how acute post- victimization variables (2 week) and early change following victimization (from 2 weeks to 3 months) predict PTSD and other outcomes twelve months later. We will use both hypothesis-driven analyses focusing on a priori specified regions and predictors, as well as comprehensive data-driven machine learning analyses. The comprehensive assessment will allow for determination of the additional utility of neural markers for predicting risk beyond previously identified self-report indicators. We expect this project to lead to identification of predictors of risk for PTSD following victimization that are linked to underlying processes (hyper-responsivity to threat, aberrant cognitive control) that can directly inform preventive interventions, ultimately improving the quality of life for youth victims of violence. PROJECT NARRATIVE Identifying youth victims of violence most at risk for long-term post-traumatic distress is a pressing public health problem. This work seeks to identify dysregulation in neural circuitry supporting cognitive and affective processes two weeks after victimization predicts PTSD and other post-trauma symptom twelve months later. These data will advance our understanding of neurobiological factors associated with vulnerability to specific trauma-related pathology and provide an important step toward identifying appropriate early interventions in the wake of violence victimization.",Acute predictors of long-term post-trauma outcomes in youth victims of violence,9941466,R01MH124076,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'Age', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anxiety', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Chronic Post Traumatic Stress Disorder', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Data', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Discrimination', 'Distress', 'Early Intervention', 'Early-life trauma', 'Elements', 'Emotions', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Family', 'Functional disorder', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hormonal', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Link', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Neighborhoods', 'Neurobiology', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Pathology', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Performance', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Predictive Factor', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Process', 'Psychopathology', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Schools', 'Signal Transduction', 'Social Environment', 'Social Functioning', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Suicide attempt', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Time', 'Trauma', 'Victimization', 'Violence', 'Wisconsin', 'Work', 'Youth', 'aged', 'base', 'brain health', 'child and adolescent victimization', 'clinical care', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive function', 'disorder risk', 'emotion regulation', 'emotional functioning', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'improved', 'injured', 'innovation', 'multidisciplinary', 'neighborhood disadvantage', 'neural circuit', 'neurobehavioral', 'neuroimaging', 'physical assault', 'post-trauma', 'predictive marker', 'programs', 'prospective', 'recruit', 'reduce symptoms', 'relating to nervous system', 'resilience', 'sexual assault', 'social', 'stress symptom', 'trauma exposure', 'trauma symptom', 'traumatic stress', 'violence exposure', 'violence victimization', 'youth violence']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN MILWAUKEE,R01,2020,768281,-0.008811288967109338
"Psychosis Risk Evaluation, Data Integration and Computational Technologies (PREDICT): Data Processing, Analysis, and Coordination Center The “clinical high risk” (CHR) for psychosis syndrome is an antecedent period characterized by attenuated psychotic symptoms that are marked by subtle deviations from normal development in thinking, motivation, affect, behavior, and a decline in functioning. Early intervention in this CHR population is critical to prevent psychosis onset as well as other adverse outcomes. However, the presentation of symptoms and subsequent course is highly variable, and there is a paucity of biomarkers to guide treatment development. Thus, to improve predictive models that are clinically relevant, several issues need to be addressed: 1) focusing on outcomes beyond psychosis; 2) taking into account heterogeneity in samples and outcomes; and 3) integrating data sets with a broad array of variables using innovative algorithms to overcome variability across studies. To address these challenges, the proposed “Psychosis Risk Evaluation Data Integration and Computational Technologies: Data Processing, Analysis, and Coordination Center” (PREDICT-DPACC) brings together a multidisciplinary team of highly experienced researchers with proven capabilities in all aspects of large-scale studies, CHR studies, as well as computational expertise. The ultimate goal is to identify new CHR biomarkers, and CHR subtypes that will enhance future clinical trials. To do so, the PREDICT-DPACC will 1) aggregate extant CHR- related data sets from legacy datasets; 2) provide collaborative management, direction, data processing and coordination for new U01 multisite network(s); and 3) develop and apply advanced algorithms to identify biomarkers that predict outcomes, and to stratify CHR into subtypes based on outcome trajectories, first from the extant data and then refined and applied to the new data. The PREDICT-DPACC team has the broad, comprehensive, and robust infrastructure that is sufficiently flexible to accommodate the inclusion of multiple data types and to optimally address the needs of the CHR U01 network(s). Carefully selected extant data will be rapidly obtained, processed, and uploaded to the NIMH Data Archive (NDA). Proposed analysis methods are powerful and robust, leveraging the expertise and experience of computer scientist developers, and experienced clinical researchers. The U01 network(s) will be coordinated by a team that is experienced in managing large studies, familiar with the needs of such studies, flexible, and is knowledgeable in all aspects of CHR studies, including measures, outcomes, biomarkers, and cohorts. Upon meeting the goals of this U24, and the supported U01 network(s), the expected outcomes of the PREDICT-DPACC will be new predictive biomarkers for CHR outcomes, new definitions of CHR subtypes that are clinically useful, and new curated and comprehensive CHR datasets (extant and new) as well as processing tools and prediction algorithms that are shared with the research community through the NIMH Data Archive. NARRATIVE The “Clinical High Risk” (CHR) for psychosis syndrome in young people represents an opportune window for early intervention to prevent the onset of psychosis and other disorders, and to forestall disability; however, clinical heterogeneity and the paucity of biomarkers have hampered the development of effective intervention. To address these challenges, working with NIMH and key stakeholders, we will harmonize and aggregate existing “legacy” CHR data, and guide and coordinate the collection of new data across a network of sites, to develop biomarker algorithms that can predict individual trajectories for diverse outcomes. This proposal leverages a multidisciplinary team with broad and CHR-specific experience in large-scale multisite and multimodal studies (including clinical trials), along with expertise in data type-specific processing, coordination, analysis, and computational analyses (e.g., machine and deep learning tools from artificial intelligence, and advanced statistical approaches), ethics, community outreach, and data dissemination, all of which will ensure the success of this project.","Psychosis Risk Evaluation, Data Integration and Computational Technologies (PREDICT): Data Processing, Analysis, and Coordination Center",10092398,U24MH124629,"['Address', 'Adolescent', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Attenuated', 'Behavior', 'Big Data', 'Biological Markers', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collection', 'Common Data Element', 'Communities', 'Community Outreach', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Aggregation', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease remission', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Enrollment', 'Ensure', 'Ethics', 'Evaluation', 'FAIR principles', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human Resources', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Infrastructure', 'Instruction', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Longterm Follow-up', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Moods', 'Motivation', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Perception', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Quality Control', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk stratification', 'Safety', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Secure', 'Site', 'Social Functioning', 'Standardization', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Suggestion', 'Symptoms', 'Technology', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'Training', 'Transact', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Visualization software', 'adverse outcome', 'analytical tool', 'attenuated psychosis syndrome', 'base', 'bioinformatics infrastructure', 'candidate marker', 'clinical heterogeneity', 'clinical risk', 'clinical subtypes', 'clinically relevant', 'cloud based', 'cohort', 'computerized data processing', 'data acquisition', 'data archive', 'data dictionary', 'data dissemination', 'data harmonization', 'data infrastructure', 'data integration', 'data tools', 'deep learning', 'demographics', 'design', 'disability', 'effective intervention', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'functional decline', 'functional disability', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'improved', 'inclusion criteria', 'innovation', 'meetings', 'member', 'multidisciplinary', 'multimodal data', 'multimodality', 'multiple data types', 'outcome prediction', 'persistent symptom', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'psychotic symptoms', 'quality assurance', 'recruit', 'research study', 'resilience', 'response', 'success', 'therapy development', 'tool', 'working group']",NIMH,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,U24,2020,3935239,0.00968283571942014
"Machine learning to inform health services and policy for traumatic brain injury Project Summary Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is recognized as the leading cause of death and disability in all parts of the world and costs the international economy approximately US$400 billion annually, which, given an estimated standardized gross world product of US $73.7 trillion, is a striking 0.5% of the entire annual global output. To address the profound issues related to a drastic increase in emergency department visits and hospitalizations for TBI over the past decades, the United States Congress highlighted injury surveillance as a federal priority. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention defines surveillance as “use of health-related data that precede diagnosis and signal a sufficient probability of a case or an outbreak to warrant further public health response”. To prevent TBI, it is essential to understand its distribution and patterns, in addition to having strong knowledge of clinical disorders, characteristic, or other definable entity, that differentiates TBI from other clinical populations. A critical barrier to the progress of the NIH-funded program “Comorbidity in traumatic brain injury and risk of all-cause mortality, functional and financial burden: a decade-long population based cohort study” was the presence of complex and multifaceted comorbidities in a patient with TBI before and at the time of the injury, and their links to patients’ frailty, injury circumstances, severity, and outcomes. This resulted in a shift in the research paradigm, and development of a novel data mining approach used in genomics to sequence more than 70,000 clinical diagnosis codes in a TBI population, and compare them to a matched population. The developed data mining approach allowed not only the validation of previously known risk factors of TBI, but also the identification of associations previously unknown, without any preconceived human biases. This project will continue advancement of a non-hypothesis driven scientific approach, which will: (1) Characterize patients with TBI at three different time periods in relation to the TBI event – before, at the time of, and after the injury; (2) Develop individual and population level models to study the transitions between the different time states; and (3) Construct and validate predictive models of susceptibility to TBI events, adverse outcomes, and high healthcare resource use at the individual and population level. Decades- long population-based health administrative data from the publicly-funded healthcare system in Ontario, Canada is ready to be further analysed for clinical and technological advancement, to support human thinking in categorizing personal, clinical, and environmental exposure data preceding TBI. Project Narrative To detect, manage, and prevent traumatic brain injury (TBI), a complex and often lifelong disabling injury, it is essential to understand its distribution and patterns and have a comprehensive knowledge of the clinical disorder, characteristic, or other definable entity that differentiates between and within persons at risk of TBI of varying mechanisms, injury presentation, and its course. This research proposal expands an ongoing NIH-funded project that started to categorize clinical comorbidities and personal and environmental exposure data into clinically meaningful factors that increase the risk of injury and its severity at the population and individual levels. With the support of data mining and big data, this proposed program will advance research methods with a goal-directed learning process and the fields of injury surveillance and precision medicine, covering a variety of interests in public health, brain injury medicine, and behavioural and social sciences.",Machine learning to inform health services and policy for traumatic brain injury,10030705,R01NS117921,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Ambulances', 'Americas', 'Amnesia', 'Area', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Brain Injuries', 'Brain Pathology', 'Canada', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Categories', 'Cause of Death', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Cohort Studies', 'Complex', 'Congresses', 'Data', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Elements', 'Emergency department visit', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Explosion', 'Exposure to', 'Financial Hardship', 'Funding', 'Gender', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Health', 'Health Policy', 'Health Services', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hospitalization', 'Human', 'Human Resources', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Injury', 'International', 'International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision (ICD-10)', 'Investments', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Medicine', 'Metabolic', 'Modeling', 'Musculoskeletal System', 'Natural regeneration', 'Ontario', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Populations at Risk', 'Predisposition', 'Prevalence', 'Preventive', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Province', 'Public Health', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Proposals', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk stratification', 'Role', 'Secondary to', 'Services', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Standardization', 'Stratification', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'TBI Patients', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Unconscious State', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Woman', 'adverse outcome', 'assault', 'behavioral/social science', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'comorbidity', 'cost', 'data mining', 'disability', 'expectation', 'falls', 'frailty', 'functional outcomes', 'gender disparity', 'improved', 'informatics tool', 'injury recovery', 'injury surveillance', 'interest', 'medically necessary care', 'men', 'mortality', 'mortality risk', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'personalized medicine', 'population based', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'prognostic', 'programs', 'response', 'sex', 'social', 'survivorship', 'vehicular accident', 'virtual']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF TORONTO,R01,2020,185878,-0.003763707343000395
"Identifying Healthy and High-Risk Weight Loss Phenotypes to Optimize Obesity Management in End Stage Kidney Disease Project Summary/Abstract  In 2016, 47,000 individuals who initiated dialysis in the United States (~42% of all incident dialysis patients that year) had obesity, with a body mass index (BMI) of ≥ 30 kilograms per meters squared. Across the BMI spectrum, individuals with kidney disease commonly lose weight after initiating dialysis treatment. However, whereas body weight typically stabilizes after the first several months of dialysis among patients without obesity, those with obesity often continue to lose weight. Both people with and without obesity who are on dialysis may lose weight due to muscle wasting and malnutrition, and recent studies have identified weight loss as a risk factor for death among people on dialysis, independent of BMI. Yet, some of the weight loss observed among obese dialysis patients may also reflect deliberate attempts to improve health, mobility, or access to kidney transplantation. Currently, there are no guidelines to help clinicians to differentiate between healthy and high-risk weight loss among people with obesity on dialysis. Further, typical obesity management paradigms are not easily transferrable to obese people with end-stage kidney disease, given factors such as chronic malnutrition, inflammation, and sarcopenia in this population that may modify the risks and benefits of different weight loss strategies. Therefore, the overarching goal of this five-year research proposal is to define healthy and high-risk weight loss phenotypes among people with obesity who are on dialysis, and to provide clinically feasible tools to improve obesity management in the setting of end-stage kidney disease. We will accomplish this goal by conducting three distinct but interrelated studies. In the first study, we will qualitatively determine patient-prioritized endpoints of weight loss, in addition to patient, physician and other stakeholder perspectives on the key factors that differentiate healthy from high-risk weight loss on dialysis. In the second study, we will leverage a national dataset of 23,000 obese dialysis patients and apply constructs of high and low physiologic reserve to derive healthy and high-risk weight loss phenotypes. We will then develop a weight- loss risk calculator tool that predicts the risks of hospitalization and death that are associated with each weight loss phenotype, using dynamic predictive joint models and machine learning techniques. In the third study, we will enroll 250 obese dialysis patients in a prospective, longitudinal study across five regions in the United States to evaluate the association between nutritional, inflammatory, and hemodynamic biomarkers and measures of health trajectory that are not typically captured in registry data, such as sarcopenia, dynapenia, body composition, and patient-prioritized endpoints such as quality of life. In accomplishing its aims, this research will provide urgently needed knowledge and tools that will improve the medical management of tens of thousands of people with end-stage kidney disease and obesity, ensuring that clinicians will be better able to incorporate patient-prioritized outcomes into assessments of weight loss interventions, and recognize and mitigate the effects of high-risk weight loss. Project Narrative Although over 40,000 obese individuals with end-stage kidney disease initiate dialysis each year in the United States, there are no guidelines on optimal obesity management in the setting of dialysis care. Obese dialysis patients may lose weight due to chronic illness or due to intentional weight loss attempts, though it is difficult to differentiate between healthy and unhealthy weight loss in these patients. This proposal seeks to advance the science of obesity management in dialysis settings by providing new tools to differentiate between healthy and unhealthy weight loss trajectories among obese dialysis patients.",Identifying Healthy and High-Risk Weight Loss Phenotypes to Optimize Obesity Management in End Stage Kidney Disease,9943129,R01DK124388,"['Benefits and Risks', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Pressure', 'Body Composition', 'Body Weight', 'Body Weight decreased', 'Body mass index', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Confidence Intervals', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dialysis patients', 'Dialysis procedure', 'Dietitian', 'End stage renal failure', 'Enrollment', 'Ensure', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Status', 'Hemodialysis', 'Hospitalization', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Intake', 'Interview', 'Joints', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Kidney Transplantation', 'Kilogram', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Malnutrition', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Modeling', 'Muscle function', 'Muscular Atrophy', 'Nephrology', 'Non obese', 'Nutritional', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Centered Care', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Process', 'Prospective cohort study', 'Provider', 'Quality of life', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Proposals', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Science', 'Services', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Transplant Recipients', 'United States', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Weight', 'adverse outcome', 'clinical care', 'clinical predictors', 'cohort', 'data registry', 'experience', 'hazard', 'health related quality of life', 'healthy weight', 'hemodynamics', 'high risk', 'improved', 'improved mobility', 'inflammatory marker', 'machine learning algorithm', 'meter', 'mortality', 'mortality risk', 'muscle form', 'muscle strength', 'novel', 'nutrition', 'obesity management', 'patient oriented', 'patient population', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive tools', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'reduced muscle strength', 'sarcopenia', 'sleep quality', 'tool', 'weight loss intervention']",NIDDK,DREXEL UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,301998,0.0019948973540381953
"Infralimbic circuit control over a sex-dependent switch in threat responding Project Summary Sex differences in the development and prevalence of mental illnesses are widespread, suggesting that the factors that promote disease risk and resilience may be distinct in men and women. The neurobiological mechanisms underlying this possibility are poorly understood, however, because the vast majority of pre- clinical animal research has been conducted in males. In addition, the behavioral outcome measures used to understand learned fear have focused predominantly on passive, or freezing behavior. We recently identified an active, escape-like conditioned fear response in rats (“darting”) that occurred almost exclusively in females and was predictive of improved extinction retention. A better understanding of potentially sexually dimorphic mechanisms that drive this behavior could open new avenues for treatment of disorders that are more prevalent in women, like PTSD. We propose here to define the neural circuitry that drives the selection of conditioned darting vs. freezing, and how that integrates with known extinction circuits to promote extinction retention. Our preliminary data implicate the infralimbic cortex (IL) in this role, and we will use pharmacological, chemogenetic, and viral techniques to probe how descending IL projections to the dorsal and ventral periaqueductal gray (PAG) may mediate a strategic switch between active and passive responding and drive long-term behavioral flexibility through putative collaterals in the amygdala. We will then use sophisticated machine vision and machine learning-based tools to define the broader behavioral repertoires within which darting exists, thereby identifying a multifaceted phenotype that could provide insight into the mechanisms underlying individual differences in stress resilience and vulnerability. Project Narrative Sex differences in the development and prevalence of mental illnesses are widespread, suggesting that the risk factors that promote disease susceptibility may be distinct in men and women. This project explores the neurobiological basis of divergent (active vs. passive) fear responses in males and females, which could help identify novel ways to prevent or treat post-traumatic stress disorder.",Infralimbic circuit control over a sex-dependent switch in threat responding,10033671,R01MH123803,"['Amygdaloid structure', 'Anatomy', 'Animal Experimentation', 'Aversive Stimulus', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Conditioned Reflex', 'Crete', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease susceptibility', 'Dorsal', 'Equilibrium', 'Exhibits', 'Extinction (Psychology)', 'FOS gene', 'Female', 'Freezing', 'Fright', 'Goals', 'Immunofluorescence Immunologic', 'Individual Differences', 'Investigation', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Mental disorders', 'Modeling', 'Neurobiology', 'Odors', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Pain', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Pharmacology', 'Phenotype', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Pre-Clinical Model', 'Prevalence', 'Rattus', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk Marker', 'Role', 'Sex Differences', 'Shock', 'Stimulus', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Viral', 'Woman', 'Work', 'base', 'behavioral outcome', 'behavioral response', 'cohort', 'conditioned fear', 'conditioning', 'coping', 'disorder risk', 'flexibility', 'improved', 'insight', 'machine vision', 'male', 'men', 'midbrain central gray substance', 'neural circuit', 'neurobiological mechanism', 'novel', 'pre-clinical', 'predictive marker', 'prevent', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'resilience', 'response', 'selective expression', 'sex', 'sexual dimorphism', 'stress resilience', 'success', 'tool', 'translational neuroscience', 'trauma exposure']",NIMH,NORTHEASTERN UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,503268,-0.007752337857282657
"EHR-based Genomic Risk Assessment and Management for Diverse Populations PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Recently, large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWAS) provide evidence for a substantial polygenic contribution to the risk of many common complex diseases. However, most of these studies were performed in Europeans, and new data and methods are necessary to tailor polygenic risk prediction to non-Europeans, to ensure that genomic stratification does not further exacerbate health disparities. The overarching goal of the eMERGE-IV network is to leverage genetic and electronic health record (EHR) data for diverse populations to design, validate and test the clinical utility of ancestry-tailored polygenic risk scores for common diseases. As a current member of the eMERGE network, Columbia University has significantly advanced its goals, having recruited over 2,500 diverse patients for sequencing and return of actionable findings, leading the effort to transition the network to the OMOP Common Data Model to improve the efficiency, accuracy, reproducibility and portability of electronic phenotypes, and contributing a widely-adopted XML parser for structuring genetic test reports. Since our last application, the Columbia Precision Medicine Initiative has also grown and now includes participation in several national initiatives, such as the All-of-Us program, in which we have demonstrated our ability to rapidly recruit patients under-represented in biomedical research. Our scientific expertise combined with our strong tradition of patient-centered research and community engagement in a socioeconomically, racially, and ethnically diverse community of Northern Manhattan, positions us to successfully contribute as the Enhanced Diversity Clinical Site of the eEMERGE-IV network. We will leverage our prior experience with eMERGE, scientific expertise, and knowledge gained from participation in other national precision medicine initiatives to develop, optimize, validate and disseminate ancestry-tailored genomic risk assessment and clinical management tools. In Aim 1, we will continue to advance electronic phenotyping by contributing sharable natural language processing tools for converting clinical text into OMOP-based discrete data and facilitating phenotype interoperability. In Aim 2, we will develop and optimize accurate ancestry-tailored genome-wide polygenic predictors, integrate them with clinical risk predictions, and test their performance in diverse populations. In Aim 3, we will investigate ELSI issues related to the return of health risk predictions to diverse patients by ascertaining patients’, clinicians’, and IRB members’ views through focus groups. In Aim 4, we will develop portable EHR plug-ins to facilitate prospective risk communication and management using integrated genomic data, family history, and clinical data. In Aim 5, we will recruit 2,500 diverse patients and use a randomized controlled trial design to assess the impact of return of genomic prediction on the accuracy of risk perception, health surveillance, and risk reducing measures. This proposal will address major knowledge gaps in genetic risk assessment for diverse populations, and the solutions and knowledge gained will be broadly applicable to precision medicine for common complex traits across many clinical specialties. PROJECT NARRATIVE Advances in precision medicine are making it increasingly possible to tailor healthcare decisions based on the individual patient’s genomic risk profile. However, large-scale validation studies of risk prediction accuracy and its clinical utility are severely lacking in diverse populations.

"Biobehavioral Studies of Cardiovascular Disease ABSTRACT Biobehavioral Studies of Cardiovascular Disease (PO1-HL040962) This Program Project (P01) continuation application focuses on the human brain substrates of behavioral and socio-environmental influences on cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk in midlife adults. Proposed are 3 Projects that are conceptually cross-linked and supported by 3 Core Units. Collaborative investigators represent multiple disciplines, including psychology, neuroscience, biophysics, medicine, psychoneuroimmunology, epidemiology, machine learning, bioinformatics, and statistics. Project 1 aims to elucidate functional and structural brain phenotypes that predict the multiyear progression of preclinical vascular disease and dysfunction, with a focus on neural circuitries for visceral control that coordinate autonomic, neuroendocrine, hemodynamic, and immune physiology with stress- and emotion-related behavioral processes. Project 2 aims to establish whether functional characteristics of these visceral control circuits moderate the influences of stress-related environmental exposures on the progression of preclinical vascular disease and dysfunction, tracking individuals' behavior and cardiovascular physiology in daily life to test a novel neuro-diathesis model of CVD risk. Project 2 also tests for the first time whether daily life physical activity associates with daily life stress physiology through its effects neural circuits for visceral control. Project 3 aims extend those of the other Projects by elucidating the neural and peripheral processes linking physical activity with physiological and psychophysiological markers of CVD risk (including daily life affect and stress physiology) using an experimental intervention methodology. These P01 aims are unique in cardiovascular behavioral medicine, and they will be pursued in the context of multi-component data collection efforts that satisfy all project-specific aims. As a result, the P01 will create new opportunities for integrative and translational science on the human neurobiology of CVD risk that cuts across multiple methods and levels of analysis. Helping to advance its parent field, the P01 will generate and disseminate original and expansive public-domain resources and tools to the broader scientific and clinical communities through comprehensive data and software sharing and educational objectives. Enabling a precise focus on early CVD etiology, the study cohorts comprise nearly 900 midlife adults without clinically apparent CVD, and study methods will include novel combinations of neuroimaging, ecological momentary assessments of experienced environments, ambulatory hemodynamic monitoring, autonomic, neuroendocrine, immune, and vascular assessments, laboratory clinical evaluations, hetero-method health behavior assessments, and arterial imaging. The 3 Core Units of this P01 provide for synergy and inter-project coordination by administrative, data management and participant accrual services; measurement and instrumentation support; and direction in cutting-edge bio-statistical and data-intensive (machine learning) analyses. The present application thus represents a thematic continuation and next- generation extension of translational neurobiological research on CVD by this P01, which was initiated in 1988. PROJECT NARRATIVE Biobehavioral Studies of Cardiovascular Disease (PO1-HL040962) This Program Project focuses on human brain substrates of behavioral and socio-environmental influences on cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk in midlife, with an emphasis on factors that moderate and mediate brain-to- risk relationships.

"Direct sub-second measurement of neuromodulator signaling during risky decision-making PROJECT SUMMARY Much work in decision neuroscience has been predicated on the hypothesis that dopaminergic signaling plays a critical role in value representations and their updating, and recent work has linked abnormalities in such value representations to specific features of psychiatric illness (e.g., anhedonia in major depression). However, despite the fundamental role that risk plays in evaluating choice options as well as the role sensitivity to risk plays in psychiatric illness, including anxiety disorders at one extreme and health risk behaviors like substance use at another other, an understanding of the neurobiology of risk remains elusive. Indirect evidence from pharmacological studies have suggested both serotoninergic and noradrengergic signaling may play roles in representations of risk; however, direct measurement of serotonin or norepinephrine signaling during risky choice has yet to be examined in humans. Recent advances by MPI Montague’s group allow the unprecedented ability to track neuromodulator responses with high temporal resolution and chemical specificity. Specifically, MPI Montague’s team is able to directly and simultaneously measure dopamine and serotonin responses in awake humans with the temporal resolution (~ 1 ms) required to examine the relationship of neuromodulator release with decision-making processes. For signal identification and extraction, the recording method uses machine-learning algorithms (elastic net regression) combined with electrochemistry using only off-the shelf hardware and software. The product of this ‘elastic net electrochemistry’ is recordings of in vivo neuromodulator fluctuations at sub-second resolution. This application merges the decision neuroscience expertise of MPI King-Casas with these advances of MPI Montague to directly examine serotonergic, noradrenergic, and dopaminergic functioning during risky choice. To achieve this goal, we will record neuromodulator responses in participants with medication-resistant epilepsy who already have intracranial depth electrodes in place for phase-II monitoring. Depth electrodes will be implanted by our neurosurgery colleagues at Virginia Tech’s medical affiliate Carilion Clinic (Carilion Clinic PI: Witcher). During recording, participants will perform i) a risk elicitation task (Holt & Laury type task) and ii) a reward learning task (multi-arm bandit task) that have been shown by our group and others both to reliably evoke neural responses associated with risk and representations as they are monitored in a standard (i.e., non-surgical) hospital suite. Depth recordings will be made using a standard montage that includes multiple contacts along the dorsal-rostral axis of the medial prefrontal cortex. PROJECT NARRATIVE Despite the fundamental role that risk plays in evaluating choice options as well as the role sensitivity to risk plays in psychiatric illness, including anxiety disorders at one extreme and health risk behaviors like substance use at another other, an understanding of the neurobiology of risk remains elusive. Here, we take advantage of a new technology to directly measure serotonin, norepinephrine and dopamine on a sub-second basis to investigate the neurocomputational role of these neurotransmitters in risky choice.",Direct sub-second measurement of neuromodulator signaling during risky decision-making,9961146,R01MH122948,"['Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Anhedonia', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Behavioral', 'Chemicals', 'Clinic', 'Computer software', 'Decision Making', 'Dopamine', 'Dorsal', 'Electrochemistry', 'Electrodes', 'Epilepsy', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Implant', 'Implanted Electrodes', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Medical', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Morale', 'Neurobiology', 'Neuromodulator', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurotransmitters', 'Norepinephrine', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology Study', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Process', 'Resistance', 'Resolution', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Risk Behaviors', 'Role', 'Serotonin', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specificity', 'Testing', 'Update', 'Virginia', 'Work', 'arm', 'awake', 'base', 'experience', 'in vivo', 'machine learning algorithm', 'neurosurgery', 'new technology', 'noradrenergic', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'temporal measurement']",NIMH,VIRGINIA POLYTECHNIC INST AND ST UNIV,R01,2020,717227,-0.019277322851097865
"Administrative Supplement to Biobehavioral Studies of Cardiovascular Disease ABSTRACT Biobehavioral Studies of Cardiovascular Disease (PO1-HL040962) This Program Project (P01) continuation application focuses on the human brain substrates of behavioral and socio-environmental influences on cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk in midlife adults. Proposed are 3 Projects that are conceptually cross-linked and supported by 3 Core Units. Collaborative investigators represent multiple disciplines, including psychology, neuroscience, biophysics, medicine, psychoneuroimmunology, epidemiology, machine learning, bioinformatics, and statistics. Project 1 aims to elucidate functional and structural brain phenotypes that predict the multiyear progression of preclinical vascular disease and dysfunction, with a focus on neural circuitries for visceral control that coordinate autonomic, neuroendocrine, hemodynamic, and immune physiology with stress- and emotion-related behavioral processes. Project 2 aims to establish whether functional characteristics of these visceral control circuits moderate the influences of stress-related environmental exposures on the progression of preclinical vascular disease and dysfunction, tracking individuals' behavior and cardiovascular physiology in daily life to test a novel neuro-diathesis model of CVD risk. Project 2 also tests for the first time whether daily life physical activity associates with daily life stress physiology through its effects neural circuits for visceral control. Project 3 aims extend those of the other Projects by elucidating the neural and peripheral processes linking physical activity with physiological and psychophysiological markers of CVD risk (including daily life affect and stress physiology) using an experimental intervention methodology. These P01 aims are unique in cardiovascular behavioral medicine, and they will be pursued in the context of multi-component data collection efforts that satisfy all project-specific aims. As a result, the P01 will create new opportunities for integrative and translational science on the human neurobiology of CVD risk that cuts across multiple methods and levels of analysis. Helping to advance its parent field, the P01 will generate and disseminate original and expansive public-domain resources and tools to the broader scientific and clinical communities through comprehensive data and software sharing and educational objectives. Enabling a precise focus on early CVD etiology, the study cohorts comprise nearly 900 midlife adults without clinically apparent CVD, and study methods will include novel combinations of neuroimaging, ecological momentary assessments of experienced environments, ambulatory hemodynamic monitoring, autonomic, neuroendocrine, immune, and vascular assessments, laboratory clinical evaluations, hetero-method health behavior assessments, and arterial imaging. The 3 Core Units of this P01 provide for synergy and inter-project coordination by administrative, data management and participant accrual services; measurement and instrumentation support; and direction in cutting-edge bio-statistical and data-intensive (machine learning) analyses. The present application thus represents a thematic continuation and next- generation extension of translational neurobiological research on CVD by this P01, which was initiated in 1988. PROJECT NARRATIVE Biobehavioral Studies of Cardiovascular Disease (PO1-HL040962) This Program Project focuses on human brain substrates of behavioral and socio-environmental influences on cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk in midlife, with an emphasis on factors that moderate and mediate brain-to- risk relationships. The Program Project applies integrative, multi-level and multi-method approaches in community samples of midlife men and women to understand brain phenotypes for CVD risk.

"Accelerating viral outbreak detection in US cities using mechanistic models, machine learning and diverse geospatial data ABSTRACT Since early January 2020, our interdisciplinary research team has conducted several studies to elucidate the emerging threat of COVID-19 and support public health responses throughout the United States, resulting in peer-reviewed publications, online COVID-19 forecasting tools, and extensive engagement with city, state and national decision makers. In our collaboration with the CDC to develop a national modeling resource for pandemic preparedness, we had recently developed a national model for evaluating multi-layered intervention strategies to contain and mitigate outbreaks in US cities. We adapted the model to COVID-19 by incorporating the latest estimates for age- and risk-group specific rates of transmission, disease progression, asymptomatic infections, and severity (including risks of hospitalization, critical care, ventilation and death). The model is designed to flexibly incorporate combinations of social distancing, contact tracing-isolation, antiviral prophylaxis and treatment, as well as vaccination strategies. Our Supplementary Aims propose to build a more granular and data-driven model of COVID-19 to elucidate the transmission, identify high-risk populations, surveillance targets and effective control of this and future epidemics within US cities. Aim S1: Focusing initially on the Austin-Round Rock metropolitan area in Texas, we will apply these models to improve real-time risk assessments and optimize the timing and extent of layered social distancing measures. Aim S2: We will rapidly evaluate strategies for rolling out antiviral prophylaxis and therapy based on clinical trial data. Aim S3: We will develop user interfaces for our Austin and national models to support both scientific research and public health efforts to mitigate COVID-19 and plan for future pandemic threats. These Aims are synergistic with Specific Aim 2 of our parent grant (R01 AI151176-01), in which we are developing high-resolution models of viral transmission to improve the early detection and control of anomalous respiratory viruses, particularly in at risk populations. NARRATIVE Our Supplementary Aims will accelerate the development of a flexible and granular model of COVID-19 emergence, transmission and control within US cities. Leveraging unprecedented data and a high level engagement with city and state leadership in the Austin-Round Rock MSA and Texas, we will rapidly improve our existing models to evaluate strategies for real-time surveillance and multifaceted interventions including non-pharmaceutical measures (eg, adaptive social distancing and cocooning of high risk populations) as well as future antiviral drugs to mitigate COVID-19. Finally, we will develop user-friendly interfaces for our models to support research and public health decision making for COVID-19 and future pandemic threats.","Accelerating viral outbreak detection in US cities using mechanistic models, machine learning and diverse geospatial data",10150283,R01AI151176,"['Age', 'Antiviral Agents', 'Area', 'COVID-19', 'Categories', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Cessation of life', 'Cities', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Contact Tracing', 'Critical Care', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Disease Progression', 'Dose', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Economics', 'Epidemic', 'Epidemiology', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Health Care Costs', 'Hospitalization', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Influenza', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention', 'Leadership', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Neighborhoods', 'Peer Review', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Policy Maker', 'Population Surveillance', 'Populations at Risk', 'Prophylactic treatment', 'Public Health', 'Publications', 'Readiness', 'Research', 'Research Support', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Severities', 'Social Distance', 'Testing', 'Texas', 'Time', 'United States', 'Update', 'Vaccines', 'Viral', 'Visualization', 'austin', 'base', 'cost', 'design', 'evidence base', 'flexibility', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'improved', 'metropolitan', 'mortality', 'multi-component intervention', 'pandemic disease', 'pandemic preparedness', 'parent grant', 'prevent', 'respiratory virus', 'response', 'social', 'socioeconomics', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'user-friendly', 'vaccination strategy', 'ventilation', 'viral transmission']",NIAID,YALE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,387199,-0.005863556356620175
"Temperamental emotionality in preschoolers and depression risk PROJECT SUMMARY Depressive disorders (DD) are one of the most prevalent forms of mental disorders, and are associated with significant mortality, morbidity, and economic costs. The incidence of DD begins to increase in early-mid adolescence and peaks in emerging adulthood. The Stony Brook Temperament Study is a longitudinal study that seeks to identify early behavioral and neural precursors and risk factors for DD and understand the neurobiological and psychosocial processes through which these early manifestations develop into clinically significant psychopathology. We initially assessed a large community sample of 3-year old children, and have followed them at 3-year intervals through age 15. This competing renewal application seeks to re-evaluate the sample at ages 18 and 21. Specifically, we propose to trace pathways from laboratory observations of temperamental low positive emotionality and high negative emotionality at age 3 to neural indices of emotional and social information processing and DD symptoms and onsets from middle childhood through emerging adulthood. In addition, we seek to understand how life stress over the lifespan and the developmental challenges of emerging adulthood contribute to risk for DD, and to examine the specificity of these risk pathways in comparison with anxiety and substance use disorders. Finally, we will use cutting-edge machine learning techniques to maximize prediction of DD and understand which domains and developmental periods contribute most to prediction. This information about risk pathways and processes should contribute to understanding when and how to intervene in order to prevent DD and limit their progression. PROJECT NARRATIVE Depressive disorders are highly prevalent and associated with significant impairment and mortality. Rates of depression begin to rise rapidly in early-mid adolescence and peak in early adulthood.

"Determining critical skill deficits that predict novice driver crashes: A prospective study using a novel virtual driving test at point of licensure, state licensing data and crash outcomes Project Summary Motor vehicle crashes lead causes of adolescent mortality, making this a major health threat facing US adolescents. Given that 95.6% of novice driver crashes are due to driver error, improved skill should reduce crash incidence. Research supports this: novice driver crash rates peak immediately following licensure and decline steeply with experience gained over the months following licensure. However, it is not known which critical driving skill deficits present at licensure predict crashes. The long-term goal of this research is to develop interventions prior to licensure that can lead to the safest independent driving post licensure. With this R21 project, we will identify deficits in driving skills that are (a) associated with major predictors of early crash risk (age at licensure and sex) and that (b) can predict differences in crash rates within the first year of independent licensure. We will leverage our exclusive access to an innovative, newly available data source for young driver research. To enable study of safety critical driving skill deficits in novice drivers, results from a new (as of July 2017) virtual driving test (VDT) - developed by the PI, adopted by the State of Ohio and delivered immediately prior to the on-road licensing examination - will be linked to Ohio licensing and crash data. We propose these aims: Aim 1: identify skill clusters using multivariate clustering, regression and machine learning techniques to test the hypothesis that these clusters are related to age at licensure, sex, and time spent in the learner period; Aim 2a: use data on driving skills linked with reported crash data in Ohio to determine whether the skill clusters identified in Aim 1 are associated with crash risk; and Aim 2b: determine if those skill clusters from Aim1 are predictive of crashes in rural teen drivers. With a large sample of new driver applicants (>25,000), this study will examine, for the first time, differences in skill, starting at an age (adolescence) and a time (within the first year of licensure) when crash risk is high. We will create a normative dataset of novice driver skills; classify skill deficits by age, sex and time in learner period; and quantify the relationship between skill deficits and crash rates during the first 2 months of licensure (when crash rates are highest for young drivers) and the following 10 months as experience accumulates. If the use of the VDT proves successful in predicting crash risk, we will be able to identify novice drivers with elevated crash risk before granting a license. This R21 will enable the following lines of research: (1) Develop new interventions that address skill deficits through training, individualized to the needs of the novice driver (in partnership with Ohio). (2) Develop or adapt advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) or self-driving vehicle technology to mitigate identified skill deficits (as part of Dr. Winston’s National Science Foundation Industry/University Cooperative Research Center). (3) Conduct a prospective study (R01) of the interacting trajectories of driving skill acquisition and cognitive development that lead to individual differences in skills at the time of licensure and the ensuing crash risk. Narrative We will identify safety-critical driving skill deficits immediately prior to licensure that predict crashes, starting at an age (adolescence) and a time (within the first year of licensure) when crash risk is high. We will leverage exclusive access to newly available data on >25,000 novice drivers: state licensing and crash data linked to results from a new (as of July 2017), well-validated virtual driving test that identifies driving skill deficits (adopted by Ohio). If this R21 finds the VDT successful in predicting crash risk, we plan to: (1) conduct a future study of the interacting trajectories of driving skill acquisition and cognitive development that lead to individual differences in skills at the time of licensure and the ensuing crash risk and (2) develop new interventions (training and vehicle technology) to address this risk.","Determining critical skill deficits that predict novice driver crashes: A prospective study using a novel virtual driving test at point of licensure, state licensing data and crash outcomes",10000116,R21HD099635,"['Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adopted', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Automobile Driving', 'Behavior', 'Cognitive', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Incidence', 'Individual Differences', 'Industry', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Licensing', 'Licensure', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Ohio', 'Outcome', 'Police', 'Population', 'Population Study', 'Populations at Risk', 'Prospective Studies', 'Proxy', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Support', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Rural', 'Safety', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Site', 'Speed', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Teenagers', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Time Factors', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Vehicle crash', 'Young driver', 'base', 'cognitive development', 'design', 'driving skills', 'experience', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'mortality', 'novel', 'personalized intervention', 'programs', 'prospective', 'safety study', 'sex', 'skill acquisition', 'skills', 'suburb', 'virtual']",NICHD,CHILDREN'S HOSP OF PHILADELPHIA,R21,2020,210334,0.011004592191766879
"Evidence to improve heat warning effectiveness in reducing morbidity and mortality. Project Summary/Abstract  While exposure to high ambient temperature (i.e., heat) has long been recognized as a threat to public health, the burden of illness and death attributable to heat in the US remains high. In an effort to reduce heat- related mortality and morbidity, the US National Weather Service (NWS) issues heat alerts in advance of forecasted extreme heat events to communicate these risks to the public and government officials. However, it is largely unknown: (1) what are the optimal metrics of heat stress to inform when to issue heat alerts, (2) how effective are heat alerts in protecting the public’s health and (3) what factors make heat alerts comparatively more or less effective in some places or in some people versus others. In the absence of such information, we will fail to maximize the public health benefits of heat alerts.  The goals of this proposal are to identify the optimal health-based and location-specific metrics for issuing heat alerts, to estimate the causal benefits of heat alerts, and to identify characteristics of individuals or communities associated with the greatest reductions in morbidity or mortality following heat alerts. Specifically, using national claims data on deaths and hospital admissions among the large, geographically diverse population of >60 million US Medicare beneficiaries age ≥65 years enrolled between 2001 and 2015, and on emergency department visits among >130 million participants of all ages from one of the nation’s largest health insurers, we propose to: (Aim 1) Use novel machine learning methods to identify the heat metric(s) (e.g., heat index, ambient temperature, spatial synoptic classification, wet bulb globe temperature, absolute humidity) that best predict excess heat-related deaths, emergency hospitalizations, and emergency departments visits in each location, (Aim 2) estimate the causal effects of NWS heat alerts on rates of mortality, hospitalizations, and emergency department visits across the country and within groups stratified by health outcome, sex, and age group, and (Aim 3) assess how the benefits of heat alerts vary across characteristics of communities.  Key innovations of this proposal include a very large sample size, geographic diversity encompassing the entire US, the assessment across multiple health endpoints and age groups, and the use of sophisticated methods in statistical learning and causal inference. Collectively, the findings from this proposal will provide meteorologists, public health and emergency management officials, and local policy-makers with critical information to better protect public health during extreme heat events and guide more targeted future research on strategies to mitigate the adverse health effects of heat. Project Narrative Extreme heat is recognized as an important threat to public health, and the burden of illness and death attributable to heat in the US remains high. In an effort to reduce heat-related mortality and morbidity, the US National Weather Service (NWS) issues heat alerts in advance of forecast extreme heat events to communicate these risks to the public and local government officials, although it remains largely unknown whether such alerts are effective in protecting people. We propose to provide forecasters and public health officials across the country with location-specific, health-based evidence as to the effectiveness of heat alerts and insights into how to improve them to better protect the public’s health.",Evidence to improve heat warning effectiveness in reducing morbidity and mortality.,10164490,R01ES029950,"['Age', 'Air Conditioning', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Communities', 'Country', 'Data', 'Effectiveness', 'Emergency Situation', 'Emergency department visit', 'Enrollment', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Event', 'Exposure to', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Government Agencies', 'Government Officials', 'Health', 'Health Benefit', 'Heat Stress Disorders', 'Hospitalization', 'Humidity', 'Individual', 'Insurance Carriers', 'Knowledge', 'Local Government', 'Location', 'Medicare', 'Methods', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Policy Maker', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Predisposition', 'Prevalence', 'Public Health', 'Race', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Sample Size', 'Seasons', 'Services', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Structure', 'Temperature', 'United States', 'Weather', 'age group', 'attributable mortality', 'base', 'beneficiary', 'burden of illness', 'comparative', 'evidence base', 'extreme heat', 'human old age (65+)', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning method', 'mortality', 'mortality risk', 'novel', 'prevent', 'public health emergency', 'response', 'sex', 'statistical learning']",NIEHS,BOSTON UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CAMPUS,R01,2020,613553,-0.004712805839490724
"Resilience, cultural alignment, and social support in brain aging: Data from the Strong Heart Study ABSTRACT When life stresses are especially intense, chronic, or overwhelming, deleterious health effects can occur, including inflammation, cardiovascular disease, disability, depression, low quality of life, and dementia. In this context, resilience can be defined as the ability to maintain a healthy aging trajectory despite adverse conditions of stress. American Indians (AI) have a unique history and ongoing experience of trauma and disparities in environmental and socioeconomic conditions, which amplify daily stresses and contribute to health risks. Despite these adverse circumstances, remarkable resilience has been described in AI populations. Recent work by our group suggests that social support and alignment with Native culture correlate with lower levels of stress, negativity, anger, hostility, depression, mortality, and cardiovascular disease. However, our findings on cultural alignment are limited, and none has yet explored associations of resilience and social support. It remains an open question whether neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) can result from chronic stress, or whether individual psychosocial characteristics such as resilience can mediate such risk. We propose to address these knowledge gaps by efficiently leveraging an existing effort funded by the NHLBI in the Strong Heart Study, a longitudinal cohort of AI adults from 13 tribal communities across the US. The existing contract covers recruitment, consenting, and basic clinical examination of 3,000 eligible participants in 2022-2024; we propose to augment the limited protocol by administering additional psychosocial and neuropsychological instruments on resilience, social support, cultural identity and alignment, and cognition. Our Specific Aims are to: describe associations of individual resilience among AI adults with identity and self-regard, social support, and cultural alignment, by age and sex; evaluate resilience, social support, and cultural features in relation to ADRD; and use machine learning to develop explanatory models of resilience and dementia. Our study has the potential to advance epidemiologic knowledge of modifiable psychosocial conditions in a vulnerable, underserved population, and consequently to offer a clearer picture of the relative contributions of psychosocial, behavioral, interpersonal, and socioeconomic factors related to ADRD. PROJECT NARRATIVE Chronic stress can result in negative health effects, including inflammation, cardiovascular disease, and Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD); American Indian (AI) populations have endured excess stresses and traumas, but have also shown remarkable psychosocial resilience, which may be related to robust social support, community environment, cultural identity. It is unclear which of these psychosocial features may be most predictive of psychosocial resilience in AI adults, or whether any is protective against neurodegeneration and ADRD. A search on NIH Reporter uncovered many projects focused on cognitive reserve—sometimes also called resilience—but none on psychosocial resilience or its related features as protective health characteristics in adult AIs. This project seeks to fill this knowledge gap with novel data collection and analysis on trait-based psychosocial resilience, related features, cognitive function, and ADRD in 3000 adult AIs as part of the ongoing Strong Heart Study.","Resilience, cultural alignment, and social support in brain aging: Data from the Strong Heart Study",10126397,R01AG070822,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'American Indians', 'Anger', 'Anthropology', 'Behavioral', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Chronic stress', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Cohort Studies', 'Communities', 'Consent', 'Contracts', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Discrimination', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Event', 'Failure', 'Family', 'Female', 'Funding', 'Health', 'Heart', 'Hostility', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Life Stress', 'Link', 'Longitudinal cohort', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Medical Genetics', 'Mental Depression', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Navajo', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neuropsychology', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient-Centered Care', 'Persons', 'Philosophy', 'Population', 'Poverty', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychosocial Factor', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporter', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Social Network', 'Social support', 'Socioeconomic Factors', 'Spirituality', 'Stress', 'Time', 'Trauma', 'Tribes', 'Underserved Population', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'Youth', 'aging brain', 'base', 'bullying', 'clinical examination', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive reserve', 'cohort', 'disability', 'eligible participant', 'epidemiology study', 'experience', 'healthy aging', 'heterogenous data', 'improved', 'instrument', 'intergenerational', 'male', 'mortality', 'novel', 'optimism', 'practical application', 'psychosocial', 'public health intervention', 'recruit', 'resilience', 'screening', 'sex', 'sociodemographics', 'socioeconomics', 'theories', 'trait', 'tribal community']",NIA,WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,521320,-0.02803312515278899
"Brain substrates for cardiovascular stress physiology Project Summary/Abstract The candidate’s long-term goal is to become an independent investigator focused on the neurophysiological pathways that link psychological stress with cardiovascular disease (CVD). Individual differences in biological responses to acute psychological stress have been shown to predict risk for subclinical and clinical markers of CVD, indicating that variation in the stress response relates to measurable health outcomes. The proposed research and career development program will position the candidate to definitively address open and mechanistic questions on cardiovascular stress physiology with a multi-dimensional approach. The overall objective of the current project is to identify the ‘brain–cardiovascular’ pathways of metabolically excessive cardiovascular responses to stress. The central hypothesis is that metabolically excessive cardiovascular responses to stress are caused by increased brain activation in areas associated with cardiovascular and autonomic control. In extension, the candidate will test whether altering brain function via neuromodulation will regulate downstream cardiovascular responses. Proposed are two independent studies. In Aim 1, we will newly examine the relationship between metabolically excessive cardiovascular and neural responses using a cross-sectional approach. In Aim 2, we will measure stressor-evoked metabolic and cardiovascular responses before and after neuromodulation in an experimental approach. Participants will engage in a novel, non-invasive neuromodulation technique, transcranial infrared laser stimulation (TILS), known to alter the brain by increasing oxygenation, and will be compared to an established control. This research plan will help the candidate develop essential skills for career development including cardiovascular and metabolic testing, machine learning and cross-validation methods for functional magnetic resonance imaging analyses, and utilizing a neuromodulation technique, TILS. The proposed Mentored Research Scientist Development Award will provide 5 years of training through a combination of research, classroom experiences, and mentoring to further the candidate in preparation for scientific independence. Specifically, the candidate will gain expertise in measuring metabolic activity, advance her computational neuroimaging analysis skills, become proficient in experimentally manipulating brain function, and develop necessary statistical skills. The project brings together a mentoring team of experts in their respective areas to provide the candidate with the necessary skills to continue on the trajectory to make a transformative contribution to the field of Cardiovascular Behavioral Medicine. This project will provide vital information regarding the pathways between psychological stress and CVD risk while at the same time providing training and mentoring for the candidate’s further career. PROJECT NARRATIVE Exaggerated physiological responses to psychological stress are commonly regarded as contributing to cardiovascular disease (CVD), nonetheless, we lack an understanding of the mechanisms by which psychological responses to threat are translated into cardiovascular responses that are excessive to the immediate physiological needs of the individual. The project will use both cross-sectional and experimental approaches to examine how the brain and cardiovascular system interact during psychological stress and will provide a a more comprehensive understanding of the role the brain plays in metabolically-excessive responses to stress. This research is relevant to public health because it is a crucial step in understanding how psychological stress relates to a risk factor for CVD and is necessary to develop appropriate brain- based approaches to CVD risk prevention and stratification.",Brain substrates for cardiovascular stress physiology,9986887,K01HL145021,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Area', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Base of the Brain', 'Behavioral Medicine', 'Biological', 'Blood Vessels', 'Brain', 'Brain Stem', 'Brain region', 'Calibration', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular Physiology', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Clinical Markers', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Energy Metabolism', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Insula of Reil', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lasers', 'Limbic System', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurable', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Mentored Research Scientist Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Pathway', 'Metabolic stress', 'Methods', 'Nature', 'Neuraxis', 'Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'Outcome', 'Oxygen Consumption', 'Participant', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Peripheral', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Preparation', 'Prevention', 'Professional Competence', 'Program Development', 'Psychological Stress', 'Public Health', 'Reaction', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk stratification', 'Role', 'Source', 'Stratification', 'Stress', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'biological adaptation to stress', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'career', 'career development', 'experience', 'neuroimaging', 'neurophysiology', 'neuroregulation', 'novel', 'pre-clinical', 'psychologic', 'relating to nervous system', 'research and development', 'response', 'skills', 'stressor', 'time use']",NHLBI,BAYLOR UNIVERSITY,K01,2020,152186,0.002813648280395946
"LEVERAGING PREDICTIVE ANALYTICS WITHIN SOCIAL NETWORKS TO MAXIMIZE DRUG ANDALCOHOL TREATMENT EFFICACY AND RELAPSE PREVENTION PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Sober Grid™ has developed a smartphone-based mobile application currently in use by over 120,000 individuals worldwide who are in, or seeking, recovery from drug and alcohol addiction. The “Grid”, as it is known, is a mobile-based, social recovery community providing rapid context- specific peer support, efficient help seeking, motivational enhancement exercises, and member ratings of support content – all aimed to prevent relapse. The overarching goal of this phase II project is to extend the current capabilities of the Sober Grid app to achieve a comprehensive social recovery support app featuring intelligent, context appropriate resource matching and 24/7 rapid response peer-coaching that is effective in reducing disordered substance use and is cost effective. We hypothesize that providing this functionality to high-risk members will be acceptable, feasible, increase access to and engagement with resources, and have a positive effect in increasing time to relapse and days of consecutive abstinence. The company’s priority commercial goal is to leverage the insights gained from its large database of information and behaviors recorded in its existing addiction recovery-focused social network, combined with its recently completed SBIR phase I work, to identify users at risk for relapse and deliver tailored lay and professional peer support, telehealth, and provider interventions prompted by near real-time automated risk indicators built into an Enhanced Sober Grid (ESG) solution. The specific goals of this proposed phase II project include: (1) implementing the relapse risk scoring algorithm successfully developed in phase I in a production environment, (2) developing a ML resource relevancy matching algorithm, and (3) using this system to pilot test the feasibility and acceptability as well as to estimate the effect on abstinence of providing peer-coaching and resource information to a national sample of Sober Grid members in recovery from non- alcohol/nicotine substances who are predicted to be at high risk for relapse. We will accomplish our objectives by: (Aim 1) Implementing an accurate, near real-time production risk prediction system; (Aim 2) Developing an enhanced, in-app substance-addiction recovery resource locator; and, (Aim 3) Determining the feasibility, acceptability and estimating the effect size of the proposed ESG among high relapse-risk participants in recovery from opioid, stimulant, or cannabis use. The expected impact of this project is to substantially enhance Sober Grid's ability to deliver effective and timely interventions to the right individuals, at the right time – including those high-need and underserved populations that would otherwise lack access to care and draw considerable resources from the healthcare system. This capability holds the promise to reduce drug and alcohol relapse and the associated negative health impacts at both an individual and societal level while reducing the total cost of providing treatment services. PROJECT NARRATIVE Sober Grid is combining near real-time risk prediction with automated phone-app messaging, peer-coaching, and resource visibility and transparency in order to dramatically improve support for recovery from substance abuse. The strategy is to provide continuously available responsive connection and support with simple and familiar ways to search, filter, sort, identify, and review/rate resource options in order to lower overall relapse rates within the population, enabling Sober Grid users to achieve improved health outcomes and institutional payers to reduce the total cost of achieving those outcomes. Over time, the innovations resulting from this project will significantly reduce costs for individuals, public and private payers, the healthcare system, and society at large.",LEVERAGING PREDICTIVE ANALYTICS WITHIN SOCIAL NETWORKS TO MAXIMIZE DRUG ANDALCOHOL TREATMENT EFFICACY AND RELAPSE PREVENTION,9897501,R44DA044062,"['Abstinence', 'Aftercare', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohol dependence', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Algorithms', 'Android', 'Back', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Cannabis', 'Caring', 'Cellular Phone', 'Characteristics', 'Client', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Cost Control', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Diagnostic', 'Drug Addiction', 'Drug usage', 'Enhancement Technology', 'Environment', 'Exercise', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Group Meetings', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Individual', 'Insurance', 'Intelligence', 'Intervention', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motivation', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nicotine', 'Opiate Addiction', 'Opioid', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Personality Traits', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Predictive Analytics', 'Privatization', 'Process', 'Production', 'Provider', 'Published Comment', 'Randomized', 'Recovery', 'Relapse', 'Reporting', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Services', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Social Network', 'Social support', 'Societies', 'Stream', 'Substance Addiction', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Support Groups', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Technology', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Underserved Population', 'Work', 'Writing', 'addiction', 'alcohol relapse', 'base', 'cloud based', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'design', 'disorder later incidence prevention', 'drug relapse', 'effective therapy', 'help-seeking behavior', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'machine learning algorithm', 'marijuana use', 'medication-assisted treatment', 'member', 'mobile application', 'mobile computing', 'new technology', 'opioid use', 'peer', 'peer coaching', 'peer support', 'phase 2 study', 'prediction algorithm', 'preference', 'prevent', 'provider intervention', 'relapse risk', 'response', 'satisfaction', 'sobriety', 'social', 'social media', 'stimulant use', 'success', 'telehealth', 'tool', 'treatment center', 'treatment program', 'treatment services']",NIDA,"SOBER GRID, INC.",R44,2020,471700,-0.027968301799977335
"Mammary and milk microbiomes and metabolomes - Understanding early variation and impacts on risk for mammary inflammation and mastitis PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Exclusive breastfeeding for at least 4 mo is considered the optimal form of nutrition for most newborns, yet many women experience substantial roadblocks in meeting this goal. One of the most common reason for  lactation cessation is mastitis (inflammation of the breast). Mastitis is also a significant concern for the US dairy industry because, not only does it represent a significant challenge to animal welfare, but it also decreases milk production and is the most common reason animals are treated with antibiotics. Despite decades of research, mastitis prevention and treatment are poorly understood in both species. One reason for this is that, although mastitis has historically been attributed to the presence of bacterial pathogens in the mammary gland, this dogma is now known to be incorrect. Modern advances in the use of DNA sequencing (rather than needing to grow bacteria in culture media) have resulted in a paradigm shift in this regard such that researchers now know that all milk produced by both healthy and mastitic cows and women contains a rich community of microbes. Experts now believe that a dysbiosis in these microbes or a shift in their metabolism causes mammary  inflammation. Consequently, we must now re-examine everything we thought we knew about the etiology and risk factors for this disease. Fundamental to filling this research gap is the rigorous characterization of the  microbiome in milk produced by healthy and mastitic women and cows; and identification of microbial community  “fingerprints” and metabolomic modifiers, thereof, that alter risk of mammary inflammation. In addition,  understanding the similarities and dissimilarities in mammary inflammation between cows and women will help  researchers understand whether the former can be used as a model for the latter (and vice versa). The overall objectives for this project are to 1) compare and contrast the milk microbiome, its functionality, immune  parameters, and inflammatory markers in healthy and mastitic women and cows, and 2) identify milk microbial  profiles and their functionality related to risk for mammary inflammation. Our central hypotheses are that  1) mammary inflammation in both species is associated with shifts in microbes and their function, concentrations of selected markers of immunity and mammary inflammation, and that 2) there exist detectable milk microbiome patterns (or functions) that predispose some women and cows to increased risk of inflammation, and these patterns are related to (and perhaps modified by) environmental and behavioral parameters, some of which are currently considered risk factors for mastitis. To test these hypotheses, we will compare healthy and mastitic cows and women (case-control design) during the first 6 wk postpartum (longitudinal, repeated-measures  design during a high-risk period in both species). Importantly, we will utilize a multi-omics approach and machine learning to understand complex relationships within and between species. The results of this work will lead to better understanding of how the microbiology of the lactating mammary gland is related to mammary  inflammation and will lay the groundwork for future studies to determine how this disease can be prevented and treated. PROJECT NARRATIVE Inflammation of the mammary gland (mastitis) is the leading cause for cessation of breastfeeding, considered the optimal form of nutrition for almost all newborns worldwide, and a major animal welfare and economic  burden for the dairy industry. Mastitis has been attributed to bacterial pathogens in the mammary gland, but new evidence demonstrates that all milk (healthy and mastitic) contains a community of microbes. Understanding the bacterial community in milk, and its function, with related host immune response will lead to a reduction in the risk of inflammation in dairy cows and women, support breastfeeding, and promote optimal health in  mothers and infants.",Mammary and milk microbiomes and metabolomes - Understanding early variation and impacts on risk for mammary inflammation and mastitis,9970508,R01HD092297,"['Address', 'Affect', 'American', 'Animal Welfare', 'Animals', 'Antibiotics', 'Bacteria', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Breast', 'Breast Feeding', 'Cattle', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Culture Media', 'DNA sequencing', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Economic Burden', 'Economics', 'Etiology', 'Exclusive Breastfeeding', 'Fingerprint', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Gland', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immunity', 'Industry', 'Infant', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Lactation', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Mammary gland', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Microbe', 'Microbiology', 'Milk', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Molecular', 'Mothers', 'Newborn Infant', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Postpartum Period', 'Prevention', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Woman', 'Work', 'bacterial community', 'case control', 'cost', 'design', 'dysbiosis', 'experience', 'high risk', 'inflammatory marker', 'inflammatory milieu', 'macromolecule', 'mastitis', 'mathematical model', 'meetings', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'microbial', 'microbial community', 'microbiome', 'milk microbiome', 'milk production', 'multiple omics', 'nutrition', 'offspring', 'pathogenic bacteria', 'prevent', 'protein metabolite', 'virtual']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF IDAHO,R01,2020,428679,0.008731928715271951
"A Health Equity Paradigm Shift:   Predictors of Healthy Pregnancy in African American Women ABSTRACT African-American women bear a disproportionate burden of maternal morbidity and mortality in the United States, regardless of socio-economic, educational, or marital status. Fortunately, maternal death rarely occurs without warning. Pregnancy complications, such as those that increase the risk of future cardiovascular disease (preterm birth, growth restriction, preeclampsia, and gestational diabetes), or severe maternal morbidity (SMM) can serve as sentinel events that herald the impending possibility of a mother's increased risk for maternal mortality (MM). Most health disparities studies to date have used a deficit-based model and have included white women as the reference group to identify detrimental factors. In this supplement, I propose to instead use a strength-based model that utilizes African-American women with healthy pregnancy outcomes as the reference group. I will compare them to African American women with pregnancy complications to identify protective factors because African American women with healthy pregnancies may provide key insight to inform future prevention strategies. The objective of this supplement is to identify environmental, systems, behavioral, medical, and biological constructs that predict a healthy, uncomplicated pregnancy in African- American women. The proposed supplemental study leverages a rich repository of clinical, survey and biospecimen data from a contemporary cohort of 852 African American women enrolled in an observational preterm birth study from 2017-2020, 549 (64%) of whom went on to have a healthy pregnancy, free from complications that predict future cardiovascular disease. I will use two complementary approaches, multi-level modeling and machine learning, to quantify the relative contributions of modifiable protective factors to a healthy pregnancy across multiple levels and domains of influence. Using an adaptation of the National Institute on Minority Health Disparities Research Framework, I will identify factors that protect African-American women from pregnancy complications that predict future cardiovascular disease (Aim 1.1), SMM (Aim 1.2), and a composite morbidity index combining the two (Aim 1.3). Finally, the work of interpreting the empirical findings from Aim 1, to develop potential interventions and policy changes, will begin in Aim 2. This aim is aspirational in nature, but included in this brief supplement to stress the importance of identifying actionable items from study findings of protective factors that are most amenable to targeting through interventions and/or health policy. A team of diverse stakeholders, including a Maternal Advisory Panel of African American Mothers, Clinicians, and Perinatal Researchers will use intervention mapping (a rigorous method that has been used to create behavioral health interventions) to review study findings, methodically think through ways to translate study findings into action, and make recommendations for future directions that are most likely to promote health equity for African American mothers. 1 NARRATIVE Most health disparities studies that have attempted to identify factors that explain the higher rates of severe maternal morbidity and mortality among African-American women have used a deficit-based model and included white women as the reference group to identify detrimental factors. In this supplement, I propose to instead use a strength-based model that utilizes African American women with healthy pregnancies as the reference group to identify protective factors that can be targeted through the design of future interventions to promote health equity. 1",A Health Equity Paradigm Shift:   Predictors of Healthy Pregnancy in African American Women,10200462,K23HD095075,"['Acute', 'African American', 'Area', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Clinical', 'Consult', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Discipline of obstetrics', 'Educational Status', 'Enrollment', 'Ensure', 'Event', 'Fetal Growth Retardation', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gestational Diabetes', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Health Policy', 'Health Promotion', 'Hematology', 'Institutes', 'Intervention', 'Kidney', 'Life Experience', 'Live Birth', 'Machine Learning', 'Marital Status', 'Maternal Mortality', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mothers', 'Nature', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Perinatal', 'Policies', 'Pre-Eclampsia', 'Predictive Factor', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Complications', 'Pregnancy Outcome', 'Premature Birth', 'Prevention strategy', 'Proxy', 'Race', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Secure', 'Sentinel', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Stress', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Trauma', 'United States', 'Ursidae Family', 'Woman', 'Work', 'adverse pregnancy outcome', 'base', 'behavioral health intervention', 'career development', 'cohort', 'design', 'early pregnancy', 'health disparity', 'health equity', 'health goals', 'healthy pregnancy', 'indexing', 'insight', 'maternal morbidity', 'maternal risk', 'minority health', 'multidisciplinary', 'multilevel analysis', 'pregnancy disorder', 'pregnant', 'protective factors', 'racism', 'repository', 'reproductive', 'respiratory', 'severe maternal morbidity', 'socioeconomics', 'theories', 'working group']",NICHD,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,K23,2020,162000,0.009693713542845676
"Multi-site External Validation and Improvement of a Clinical Screening Tool for Future Firearm Violence ABSTRACT  Interventions in clinical settings, such as the emergency department (ED), are an opportunity for interpersonal firearm violence prevention, particularly among youth, whom interpersonal firearm violence disproportionately affects. A crucial prerequisite to successful clinical interventions is an accurate gauge of risk, to ensure the judicious allocation of scarce resources; providing that missing prerequisite is the primary goal of the proposed work. Machine learning methods, in contrast to traditional inferential statistical models, are distinguished by their emphasis on prospective prediction, and have enhanced clinical prediction in several fields, including heart disease, cancer diagnosis and outcomes, PTSD, suicide risk, and substance use, among others. Yet, with the exception of the SAFETY score—developed by the current investigative team—machine learning methods have not been leveraged to prospectively predict firearm violence. In this proposed work our research objectives are two-fold: 1) Externally validate the SAFETY score by determining its ability to predict firearm violence involvement within the next year on a new data set; and 2) Improve the SAFETY score by conducting a comparative analysis of four powerful machine learning methods: elastic net penalized logistic regression, random forests, support vector machines, and boosting (ensemble) methods. In this way, we are responding to Objective One: Research to help inform the development of innovative and promising opportunities to enhance safety and prevent firearm-related injuries, deaths, and crime. This approach is innovative because it builds upon the only work to apply machine learning methods to firearm violence prediction, and it is a promising opportunity to prevent firearm injuries because it will a) provide an explicit gauge of future firearm violence risk; and b) characterize risk factor effects in terms of their prospective prediction ability, unlike any prior research. Thus this research will both identify individuals in most need of intervention, and also point to potentially modifiable predictive factors. Properly addressing this research question in a generalizable way requires a contemporary data set with 1) a focus on a high-need, yet broad, study population; 2) comprehensive baseline measures that provide a broad basis for prediction; and 3) geographic variability (Midwest, West Coast, and East Coast) that enhances generalizability. Thus, we will recruit 1,500 youth age 18-24 from urban EDs in three broadly different locales—Flint, Philadelphia, and Seattle—and administer a baseline survey covering several domains of potential risk factors for future violence, and follow up with those youth at 6- and 12-months to ascertain the primary outcome—firearm violence involvement (as victim or perpetrator)—as well as the secondary outcomes: high-risk firearm behaviors, non-firearm violence, and violent injury. Because this work requires a prospective longitudinal study, we are applying for Option B. This work will lay the ground for future research involving the development and testing of interventions for interpersonal firearm violence both by identifying potential high- leverage modifiable predictive factors, and by identifying youth most in need of intervention. PROJECT NARRATIVE  The purpose of the proposed work is to harness cutting-edge machine learning methods to optimize prediction of future firearm violence so that prevention resources can be allocated efficiently. In service to that goal, we will recruit participants age 18-24 from three urban emergency departments, administer a comprehensive assessment, and use the measurements taken there to predict firearm violence over the following year. The proposed work will provide generalizable knowledge on what factors are most predictive of future firearm violence, which will contribute to future intervention strategies both in terms of content and in terms of optimally determining which people require intervention.",Multi-site External Validation and Improvement of a Clinical Screening Tool for Future Firearm Violence,10162695,R01CE003294,[' '],NCIPC,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2020,649991,-0.02399619826113743
"Disparities in COVID Disease Severity and Outcomes in New York City PROJECT SUMMARY This application is being submitted in response to Notice Number: NOT-TR-20-011 to highlight the urgent need for research on the 2019 novel Coronavirus (COVID-19), and is an administration supplement to our parent grant. The outbreak of COVID-19 and the life-threatening acute respiratory syndrome caused by the virus (SARS-CoV-2/2019-nCoV) have led to a severe, global public health crisis, and economic disruption. Sadly, in this epidemic, NYC is the epicenter of epicenters. Some neighborhoods in NYC have been more exposed than others to COVID, and there seems to be clear correlation with the prevalence of COVID and its severity between certain ethnic and racial populations. Importantly, it is recognized that biology factors alone do not exclusively account for disease outcomes in those stricken with Covid-19. Social determinants have a significant impact on various health-related outcomes such as hypertension, diabetes, obesity, kidney and lung disease (1,2). Evidence also indicates that a myriad of social risk factors- such as low income, poor education, minority race or ethnic background- coupled with inadequate community housing and resources, together with limited health care access and decreased health utilization, results in poor health outcomes and increased susceptibility and severity to Covid-19 (3-14). For this study, we assembled a multidisciplinary team from Weill Cornell Medicine's Clinical Translational Science Center (CTSC); Englander Institute for Precision Medicine (EIPM), the Weill Cornell's Center for Health Equity. The initial study will be conducted with the New York Presbyterian (NYP) Hospital health care system database involving “hotspot” areas in NYC with COVID. The NYP network is the largest healthcare system by bed counts in New York City and is on the frontlines of the struggle against the COVID pandemic. By discerning the interaction/relationship of the biology with the Social Determinants of Health (SDoH), we will gain further insight into why certain racial and ethnic groups are more susceptible to Covid -19, and why they develop the more severe forms of the virus. Furthermore, if we are able to identify the especially vulnerable, and provide adequate isolation and early medical intervention in the disease process- then we can save lives. Protecting and providing preventive and early care for the vulnerable would also allow the remainder of society to interact in daily activities and prevent the economy from a major collapse. The less vulnerable who are out in society would on average develop mild coronavirus infections. Consequently, once the larger and mildly affected less vulnerable population recover and gain natural immunity, the risk to the most vulnerable would fall dramatically and the country would stabilize. NARRATIVE The overall goal of this research is to determine the biological and social determinants of health that collectively explain the marked racial/ethnic variations in COVID-19 severity and outcomes. Recent reports from the NYC Department of Health and elsewhere strongly suggest that underserved minority populations and especially African Americans and Hispanics have much higher COVID-19 fatality rate when compared to Caucasians and Asians (1-3). The reasons for such these disparities are not known. biological determinants and such as access to care, adequate housing, and occupation may represent major risk factors for acquiring Covid-19 and especially a more severe manifestation of Covid-19. We hypothesize that defining the biological factors and determining the interrelationship with Social Determinants of Health (SDoH) in combination with clinical factors will provide clarification as to why certain racial and ethnic groups are more susceptible to Covid -19, and to developing the more severe forms of the disease.",Disparities in COVID Disease Severity and Outcomes in New York City,10159057,UL1TR002384,"['2019-nCoV', 'Acute', 'Admission activity', 'Affect', 'African American', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Asians', 'Beds', 'Biological', 'Biological Factors', 'Biology', 'Blood', 'COVID-19', 'Caring', 'Caucasians', 'Center for Translational Science Activities', 'Chicago', 'Cities', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Communities', 'Coronavirus Infections', 'Country', 'Coupled', 'Cytometry', 'Database Management Systems', 'Databases', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Disease Outcome', 'Economics', 'Education', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemic', 'Equilibrium', 'Ethics', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Ethnic group', 'Exposure to', 'Fatality rate', 'Frequencies', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hispanics', 'Hospitals', 'Housing', 'Hypertension', 'Immune', 'Immune system', 'Immunologic Factors', 'Immunologics', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Inflammation', 'Institutes', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Intervention', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Life', 'Low income', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Natural Immunity', 'Neighborhoods', 'New York', 'New York City', 'Obesity', 'Occupations', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Presbyterian Church', 'Prevalence', 'Preventive', 'Process', 'Proteomics', 'Public Health', 'Race', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Severities', 'Severity of illness', 'Shapes', 'Societies', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Syndrome', 'Testing', 'Thrombosis', 'Unemployment', 'Variant', 'Virus', 'Virus Diseases', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'base', 'coronavirus disease', 'experience', 'falls', 'genetic signature', 'health care availability', 'health equity', 'high risk', 'hospitalization rates', 'insight', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'nutrition', 'pandemic disease', 'parent grant', 'patient stratification', 'polygenic risk score', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'racial and ethnic', 'racial and ethnic disparities', 'respiratory', 'response', 'social', 'social determinants', 'social health determinants', 'socioeconomics', 'supervised learning', 'underserved minority']",NCATS,WEILL MEDICAL COLL OF CORNELL UNIV,UL1,2020,749219,-0.012396401830490872
"Concussion and Driving Skills in the Young Driver PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Research Objectives. This prospective cohort study rigorously examines the neurocognitive impact of concussion on simulated and real-world driving performance among young drivers aged 16-24 years. Importance. Concussion impairs cognitive processing speed, attention, concentration and integration – skills which are also important for safe driving. Unlike new “Return to Learn” guidelines, there are no evidence-based “Return to Drive” guidelines for when individuals with concussion may be safe to return to driving. Objectives. Conduct a prospective matched cohort study to explore the risk of concussion in simulated and real-world driving conditions. We propose three specific aims and a fourth exploratory aim:  (i) Examine whether concussion negatively impacts simulated driving performance among young  drivers, relative to a cohort of young drivers without concussion.  (ii) Determine whether simulated driving task performance correlates with recovery from  concussion symptoms and signs in the month following concussion, relative to young drivers  without recent concussion.  (iii) Measure the impact of concussion and recovery on real-world driving exposure and performance.  (iv) [Exploratory] Examine whether concussion symptoms and neuropsychometric impairment are  associated with higher rates of driving citations or reported crashes. Study design. Prospective controlled matched cohort study. Setting/participants. 50 drivers with recent concussion; 50 age/gender matched controls aged 16-25 years. Study protocol. Concussion participants will be recruited within two weeks of concussion. Case and control participants will complete 1) driving risk survey; 2) neuropsychological testing an 3) simulated driving tasks at baseline and 1 month.

"Lifecourse CVD Risk and Midlife Cognitive Trajectories and Brain Aging: Implications for Alzheimer's and Dementia Prevention ABSTRACT Vascular health has emerged as one of the most important determinants of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias. Early adult and midlife cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors and subclinical disease may be important drivers of cognitive decline in midlife, a period that most likely is critical for influencing later life dementia risk. Yet, few studies have investigated early adulthood CVD risk exposures, including timing of exposure and whether subthreshold levels impact later life cognition. To accomplish these goals, we propose, to add cognitive testing to the Year 35 visit of the ongoing multisite Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study. At baseline, CARDIA enrolled 5,115 black and white participants (mean age 24) who have been carefully followed for 30 years and had cognitive testing at visit years 25 and 30. Cognitive evaluation at Year 35 will allow us to determine 10-year cognitive change (mean age 50 to 60) at a critical time point when cognitive decline starts to diverge and potentially impacts late-life dementia risk. Our specific aims are: 1) To determine, using a life-course approach, the independent associations of 10-year midlife cognitive decline with timing, level (both subthreshold and threshold) and trend in CVD risk factors including body mass index, blood pressure, and fasting glucose, assessed over 35 years from early adult to midlife; 2) To determine the association of 10-year midlife cognitive decline with novel subclinical CVD markers over time including carotid artery intima thickness, coronary artery calcification and cardiac function; 3) To determine whether CVD risk factors and subclinical CVD markers are associated with brain aging indices in midlife, derived by the application of machine-learning neuroimaging pattern analysis to brain MRI and diffusion tensor imaging data obtained on nearly 700 CARDIA participants at midlife; Exploratory) To assess black/white disparities in 10- year cognitive decline and determine the extent to which such disparities are explained by burden of CVD risk. Guided by strong preliminary data, our main hypothesis is that CVD risk factors begin to exert influence as early as the third decade of life and that subthreshold levels (eg systolic blood pressure ≥120 mm) are important drivers for this. In addition, we hypothesize that subclinical CVD measures (especially cardiac function and atherosclerosis) are associated with greater decline in midlife cognition and accelerated brain aging. No other study in the US has such comprehensive data on a wide array of early adult CVD risk factors that may influence cognitive aging. As an experienced multidisciplinary team using innovative statistical methods to analyze essentially unique longitudinal data on early adult and midlife CVD risk factors and subclinical disease, we have the opportunity to investigate the associations of these life-course exposures with cognitive decline and brain health in midlife. Identifying dementia risk factors early in the life-course may lead to interventions to help maintain healthy brain aging and prevent the onset of dementia. PROJECT NARRATIVE We propose to study how cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors such as high blood pressure, diabetes and obesity may influence cognitive function changes in midlife. We will apply a life-course approach to this investigation by carefully studying how CVD risk and preclinical markers beginning in early adulthood (20s and 30s) may affect midlife cognitive functioning and brain aging. In this way, the study has great public health value as it will inform ways to possibly prevent Alzheimer disease and vascular changes in the brain.",Lifecourse CVD Risk and Midlife Cognitive Trajectories and Brain Aging: Implications for Alzheimer's and Dementia Prevention,9991720,R01AG063887,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Atrophic', 'Blood Pressure', 'Blood Vessels', 'Body mass index', 'Brain', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Carotid Arteries', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive aging', 'Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults Study', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Disease Marker', 'Dose', 'Elderly', 'Enrollment', 'Evaluation', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hypertension', 'Impaired cognition', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pathologic', 'Pattern', 'Prevention', 'Prevention strategy', 'Public Health', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Science', 'Statistical Methods', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Time trend', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Visit', 'aging brain', 'black/white disparity', 'brain health', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'cognitive change', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive testing', 'cohort', 'coronary artery calcification', 'critical period', 'dementia risk', 'early life exposure', 'emerging adult', 'experience', 'fasting glucose', 'heart function', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'middle age', 'multidisciplinary', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'pre-clinical', 'prevent', 'racial difference', 'racial disparity', 'treatment strategy', 'trend', 'white matter', 'young adult']",NIA,NORTHERN CALIFORNIA INSTITUTE/RES/EDU,R01,2020,755657,-0.0022500200477100526
"Devaluing Energy-Dense Foods for Cancer Control: Translational Neuroscience 7. Abstract Obesity and intake of certain foods increases cancer risk, but the most common treatment (behavioral weight loss programs) rarely produces lasting weight loss and eating behavior change, apparently because caloric restriction increases the reward value of food and prompts energy-sparing adaptations. Interventions that reduce the implicit valuation of cancer-risk foods (e.g., red meats, refined sugar) may be more effective. Emerging data suggest that behavioral response training and cognitive reappraisal training reduce valuation of such foods, which leads to decrease intake of these foods and weight loss. Internalized incentive value is reflected in a ventromedial prefrontal/orbitofrontal cortex valuation system (“vmPFC”), which encodes the implicit reward value of food and is central to a reinforcement cycle that perpetuates unhealthy eating. Thus, the vmPFC valuation system is a promising target for intervention because changes to the system might disrupt the unhealthy reinforcement cycle. Interestingly, various interventions influence the vmPFC through distinct pathways. Behavioral training alters motor input to valuation regions, whereas cognitive training relies on lateral prefrontal “top-down” regions. The proposed translational neuroscience experiment will compare the efficacy with which two novel treatments cause lasting change in food valuation, and whether a composite of theory-based baseline individual differences in relevant processes (such as response tendencies and cognitive styles) moderate treatment effects. We will randomize 300 overweight/obese adults who are at risk for eating- and obesity-related cancers to behavioral response training toward healthy foods and away from cancer-risk foods, a cognitive reappraisal intervention focused on cancer-risk foods, or non–food inhibitory control training. Aim 1 compares the efficacy and mechanisms of action of these two interventions to reduce valuation of cancer-risk foods relative to the active control condition, using neural, behavioral, self-report, and physiological measures of the process and outcomes. Aim 2 is to establish the temporal pattern and durability of the effects across time ; food intake and habits , body fat, BMI, and waist-to-hip ratio will be measured pre, post, and at 3-, 6-, and 12-month follow-up. Aim 3 uses machine learning to build and validate a low-cost, easy-to-administer composite that predicts whether and for how long an individual is likely to respond to intervention, and to which treatment. We hypothesize that self-report measures specifically related to valuation (e.g., willingness-to-pay) and to intervention-specific pathways to valuation (e.g., behavioral response tendencies, cognitive style) will predict differential response. Discovering these individual differences will provide a practical, low-cost tool to help interventionists “match” a given person to an effective treatment for that person . This project is very innovative because no study has directly compared the distinct and common effects of these treatments on valuation, used brain imaging to study the mechanism of effects, tested whether these interventions produce a lasting change in food valuation and body fat, or built and validated a composite that moderates response . 8. Project Narrative Excessive eating of energy-dense and obesity are risk factors for a range of cancers. There are programs to reduce intake of these foods and weight loss, but the effects of the programs rarely last. This project tests whether altering the value of cancer-risk foods can create lasting change, and uses neuroimaging to compare the efficacy of two programs to engage the valuation system on a neural level. Results will establish the pathways through which the programs work and suggest specific treatments for individuals based on a personalized profile.",Devaluing Energy-Dense Foods for Cancer Control: Translational Neuroscience,9988193,R01CA211224,"['Adopted', 'Adult', 'Behavioral', 'Body Weight decreased', 'Body fat', 'Body mass index', 'Brain imaging', 'Caloric Restriction', 'Calories', 'Cancer Control', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive Therapy', 'Data', 'Dietary intake', 'Eating', 'Eating Behavior', 'Food', 'Food Habits', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Health Food', 'High-Risk Cancer', 'Incentives', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Informal Social Control', 'Intake', 'Intervention', 'Lateral', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Meat', 'Mediating', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Neurobiology', 'Obesity', 'Obesity associated cancer', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Overweight', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Physiological', 'Process', 'Process Measure', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Randomized', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Route', 'Stimulus', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Waist-Hip Ratio', 'Work', 'active control', 'adult obesity', 'arm', 'base', 'behavior change', 'behavioral economics', 'behavioral response', 'cancer risk', 'cognitive reappraisal', 'cognitive training', 'common treatment', 'comparative efficacy', 'cost', 'cost efficient', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'experimental arm', 'experimental study', 'follow-up', 'food consumption', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'intervention effect', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'obesity risk', 'personalized medicine', 'programs', 'recruit', 'reduced food intake', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sugar', 'theories', 'tool', 'translational neuroscience', 'treatment arm', 'treatment effect', 'weight loss program', 'willingness to pay']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF OREGON,R01,2020,771233,0.005006145873287825
"Using a Natural Experiment to Evaluate the Long-Term Effects of Neighborhood Deprivation on Alzheimer's Disease and Vascular Risk Factors ABSTRACT  The NIA has called for social science and community-based studies to clarify risk and protective factors for Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD), particularly among racial minorities who are disproportionately affected. Place, including both neighborhood of residence and region/state of birth, has consistently been correlated with ADRD, stroke, and impaired cognitive function. Yet it is unclear whether modifiable mechanisms explain this association, or whether the association is merely due to the selection of unhealthy individuals into poor regions. The goal of this study is to produce the first quasi-experimental evidence to understand the influence of neighborhood socioeconomic deprivation on ADRD and its vascular risk factors. We take advantage of a unique natural experiment, overcoming methodological challenges in the previous literature on neighborhood effects on ADRD. From 1986 to 1998, the Danish government actively dispersed roughly 76,000 incoming refugees across the country in a nearly randomized (“quasi-random”) fashion to avoid over-crowding in major cities. This cohort includes nearly 12,000 individuals who lived until at least age 60 in Denmark during the 30-year follow-up. Over 90% of families agreed to participate in the program, creating a natural experiment in which these individuals were quasi-randomly assigned to neighborhoods with different levels of deprivation. We will employ unique data spanning over 30 years from Denmark's population and clinical registers, which provide data on sociodemographics, clinical encounters, and prescriptions for all Danish residents. We identify cases of ADRD and its vascular risk factors among this racially diverse cohort via validated techniques using ICD codes and prescription data in clinical registers. We have successfully linked these registers to detailed geocoded data sources on eight measures of neighborhood socioeconomic deprivation. In Aim 1, our goal is to test the hypothesis that neighborhood deprivation increases the incidence of ADRD later in life. In Aim 2, we will examine the effects of neighborhood deprivation on vascular risk factors for ADRD, including highly prevalent conditions that occur across the life course. In Aim 3, we will identify vulnerable subgroups whose development of ADRD and vascular risk factors differs in response to neighborhood deprivation, taking advantage of the large sample size and complete register data available on all subjects. We will employ both hypothesis-driven and hypothesis-generating statistical techniques, including innovative machine learning methods that allow for more complex and robust subgroup identification. This will enable future interventions to be tailored to the most vulnerable individuals. Overall, the expected outcome of this research is to produce rigorous evidence on the effects of neighborhood characteristics on ADRD and vascular risk factors, overcoming the methodological challenges in previous work. This will directly inform the development of clinical, community, and policy strategies to address the neighborhood determinants of ADRD among vulnerable populations who are most at-risk. PROJECT NARRATIVE  The goal of this research is to examine the effects of neighborhood deprivation on Alzheimer's dementia and its vascular risk factors. We will examine the association of specific neighborhood characteristics with Alzheimer's and its risk factors, and we will assess whether specific subgroups may be more vulnerable to neighborhood deprivation.

"Leveraging a Natural Experiment to Estimate the Effects of School Racial Segregation on Cardiovascular Risk Factors among Youth and Young Adults ABSTRACT  Cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors disproportionately affect black adults, and these disparities are evident early in the life course. Genetic factors do not appear to explain this difference, and studies have increasingly implicated socioeconomic risk factors. Among the most prominent risk factors for racial disparities in CVD is educational attainment, which is strongly correlated with smoking, hypertension, and CVD over the life course. Yet it is unclear which aspects of schooling are most salient. One possible explanation for racial disparities in CVD is that black youth often attend highly racially segregated schools. Segregation is thought to be linked with CVD due to increased stress and discrimination; social norms and peer influence; and the constraining of socioeconomic opportunities that reduces income and healthcare access later in life. Yet despite the fact that school segregation has increased in recent years, there are no studies examining the effects of recent school segregation trends on CVD risk factors. The goal of this study is to provide this urgently needed evidence. In particular, we take advantage of a unique natural experiment, overcoming methodological challenges in the previous literature on the effects of education on CVD. Since 1990, numerous local court decisions have resulted in “resegregation” in school districts across the country. We link nationwide data on these court decisions and school district-level measures of school segregation with CVD outcome data from two large nationally representative U.S. cohort studies of affected youth: the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (Add Health, N≈90,000) and the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (N≈8,000). We employ the quasi-experimental technique of instrumental variables analysis, which reduces typical confounding by factors such as unobserved individual and family characteristics. In Aim 1, our goal is to estimate the short- term effects of school segregation on CVD risk factors—including smoking, physical activity, obesity, and mental health—among youth while they are still in school. In Aim 2, we will examine the long-term effects of school segregation in the decades that follow, with outcomes including those in Aim 1 in addition to objectively measured CVD biomarkers, diabetes, and hypertension. We will also undertake exploratory analyses to determine possible mediating pathways. In Aim 3, we will identify vulnerable subgroups whose development of CVD risk factors differs in response to school racial segregation. This will enable future interventions to be tailored to the most vulnerable individuals. We will employ both hypothesis-driven and hypothesis-generating statistical techniques, including innovative machine learning methods that allow for more complex and robust subgroup identification. Overall, the expected outcome of this research is to produce rigorous evidence on the effects of school racial segregation on CVD risk factors, helping to inform school-based, clinical, and community interventions to reduce persistent and inequitable racial disparities in CVD. PROJECT NARRATIVE  The goal of this research is to examine the short-term and long-term effects of school racial segregation on risk factors for heart disease. We will also assess whether specific subgroups may be more vulnerable to school segregation. This will inform the development of public health programs and school-based interventions to address black-white disparities in heart disease.",Leveraging a Natural Experiment to Estimate the Effects of School Racial Segregation on Cardiovascular Risk Factors among Youth and Young Adults,9943540,R01HL151638,"['Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Behavior', 'Biological Markers', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Chronic stress', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Cohort Studies', 'Complex', 'Counseling', 'Country', 'Court Decisions', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Desegregation', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Discrimination', 'Disease Outcome', 'Economics', 'Education', 'Family Characteristics', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health behavior', 'Heart Diseases', 'Hour', 'Hypertension', 'Income', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Life Stress', 'Light', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Logistics', 'Long-Term Effects', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mental Health', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'National Longitudinal Survey of Adolescent to Adult Health', 'Natural experiment', 'Obesity', 'Occupational', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Pathway interactions', 'Physical activity', 'Population', 'Preventive', 'Public Health', 'Race', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk Factors', 'Schools', 'Smoking', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Stress', 'Subgroup', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Work', 'Youth', 'base', 'black/white disparity', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'community intervention', 'data archive', 'design', 'disparity reduction', 'forest', 'health care availability', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'machine learning method', 'middle age', 'novel marker', 'panel study of income dynamics', 'peer influence', 'peer networks', 'physical inactivity', 'programs', 'psychologic', 'racial disparity', 'resilience', 'response', 'school district', 'segregation', 'social', 'social norm', 'socioeconomics', 'teenage fertility', 'theories', 'treatment effect', 'trend', 'young adult']",NHLBI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2020,808862,0.01630857469100209
"Prediction of Chronic Kidney Disease by Simulation Modeling to Improve the Health of Minority Populations Project Summary/Abstract Significant health disparities exist in chronic kidney disease (CKD), CKD progression, and end stage renal disease (ESRD) in ethnically diverse populations. African Americans (AAs) have ~25% higher prevalence of CKD, 3-fold higher rate of ESRD, and the highest risk of mortality among those with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) 45-95mL/min/1.73m2. The most significant traditional risk factors for CKD and ESRD are diabetes and hypertension accounting for >60% CKD and >70% of new ESRD cases, respectively. Non- traditional risk factors for CKD such as environmental, cultural-behavioral factors, geographic, education, insurance coverage, socioeconomic status and unequal access to optimal healthcare, disproportionately affect CKD health in ethnic minorities. The unique combination of these factors on CKD progression in the real world remains poorly defined. Identification of modifiable risk factors that may reduce CKD disparities would be invaluable to improve quality of life, life expectancy, and decrease economic burden. Simulation models have been successfully applied in other clinical domains, but are limited in CKD development and CKD progression, due to small datasets and the absence of modeling techniques using longitudinal observational health data. Further, no models have been tested in a real-world minority population to uncover the potential for interventional studies that would reduce CKD disparities on a larger scale. To our knowledge, we have created the largest, comprehensive database from electronic health records of >10 million individuals seen between 2006-2016 from a 2-year partnership between UCLA (1.8 million) and Providence St. Joseph Health (PSJH; 9.2 million) systems. From the UCLA Registry population, we identified significant differences in eGFR trajectory decline between AAs and non-AAs according to baseline eGFR, indicating a pattern shift from a higher to a lower, steeper eGFR trajectory suggesting there may be critical windows for interventions to reduce CKD disparities in AAs. Race/ethnicity differences from linear mixed models of all ethnic cohorts persisted even after controlling for demographic and clinical variables known to influence eGFR trajectories. We hypothesize that the use of ethnically diverse populations in the joint UCLA PSJH CKD/At-risk CKD Registry can identify a novel combination of CKD risk factors; and improve the performance of existing simulation models to predict CKD progression. The specific aims are to: 1) develop and test a machine learning-based simulation model for CKD and eGFR trajectories using the UCLA PSJH CKD/At-risk CKD Registry; and conduct internal validation of the models and comparisons with existing CKD risk models, 2) stratify and test simulation models based on different racial/ethnic groups, including external validation based on cross-institution comparisons, and 3) conduct focus groups with UCLA primary care physicians, who manage racial/ethnic patients, to elicit their perspectives on existing and designed simulation models to reduce CKD health disparities. These innovative approaches will facilitate our long-term goal to inform clinical decision support methods to reduce/eliminate CKD health disparities. Project Narrative Disparities in chronic kidney disease (CKD) disproportionately affect the development of CKD and CKD progression in ethnic minorities. The ability to use large datasets of patient information to reduce these disparities is greatly lacking. We will conduct simulation modeling to identify a unique set of risk factors that predict CKD and CKD progression, that can be targeted for individualized treatment in patients with highest risk of kidney function decline, with valuable input on the potential utility of this resource from focus groups consisting of primary care physicians.",Prediction of Chronic Kidney Disease by Simulation Modeling to Improve the Health of Minority Populations,9848452,R01MD014712,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Affect', 'African American', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Discipline', 'Disease Management', 'Disease Progression', 'Economic Burden', 'Education', 'Educational Background', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emergency Care', 'End stage renal failure', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Ethnic group', 'Focus Groups', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Geography', 'Glomerular Filtration Rate', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Planning', 'Health Policy', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'High Prevalence', 'Hypertension', 'Individual', 'Institution', 'Insurance Coverage', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Joints', 'Laboratories', 'Life Expectancy', 'Machine Learning', 'Medicare', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physical environment', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Population Statistics', 'Predictive Factor', 'Prevalence', 'Primary Care Physician', 'Quality of life', 'Race', 'Registries', 'Renal function', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Social Environment', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Urban Health', 'Validation', 'base', 'beneficiary', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical implementation', 'clinical translation', 'cohort', 'combinatorial', 'cost', 'data registry', 'design', 'disease registry', 'disorder risk', 'disparity reduction', 'ethnic difference', 'ethnic diversity', 'ethnic minority population', 'health data', 'health disparity', 'high risk', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'innovation', 'insight', 'large datasets', 'minority health', 'model development', 'models and simulation', 'modifiable risk', 'mortality risk', 'novel', 'population health', 'precision medicine', 'racial and ethnic']",NIMHD,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2020,389501,0.020912260425084938
"Obesity Prevention in Postpartum Women at High-Risk of Cardiovascular Disease PROJECT SUMMARY  Obesity is a significant risk factor for cardiovascular (CV) disease that affects 39% of adults in the U.S. Obesity rates are disproportionately rising among women and contribute to increasing rates of diabetes and CV mortality among women younger than 55 years. Pregnancy represents a life transition when many women gain excess weight. The effect of obesity is further magnified in women with preeclampsia, an independent and underappreciated risk factor for future CV disease. There is a pressing need to better understand predictors of excessive postpartum weight retention in order to deliver effective and scalable weight loss interventions during a period when women at highest risk may be particularly receptive to lifestyle change.  Social incentives, or the influences that impact behavior change based on relationships, are strong motivators of healthy behavior. The use of game design elements, such as goal-setting, has been successfully combined with social incentives to enhance healthy behavior in other disease settings. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that a behavioral intervention using these novel approaches, combined with an established behavioral weight loss program, will provide an effective, and scalable solution to reduce the incidence of postpartum obesity. This proposal will leverage mentorship of senior investigators (Drs. Michal Elovitz and Peter Groeneveld) and Penn’s mature research programs in cardiovascular medicine, maternal fetal medicine, and behavioral economics. Research will be conducted in an urban and racially diverse population since these women are most likely to benefit from interventions to reduce CV risk. Aim 1 will use robust statistical methods and machine learning to create a clinical prediction tool for postpartum weight retention in an existing electronic health record database enriched with neighborhood-level data. Aim 2 will use qualitative and mixed methods to identify strategies to enhance the design of a pilot intervention using patient feedback. Aim 3 will implement a 2-arm single site randomized clinical trial to achieve weight loss in women with preeclampsia or gestational hypertension participating in an online behavioral weight loss program using remote technology and social feedback from other postpartum women.  This proposal will identify women at an early stage in life who will benefit the most from intensive lifestyle changes and will test and refine interventions that are able to be disseminated to postpartum women remotely. Dr. Lewey is a general cardiologist trained in women’s health and population science with established expertise in pregnancy associated cardiovascular disorders. The training she proposes in advanced statistical methods, qualitative analysis, and behavioral clinical trial design will position her to become a leader in women’s cardiovascular health. By the conclusion of this program, she will be able to independently design, target, and evaluate behavioral interventions to prevent heart disease in women. The results of the proposed K23 will be invaluable pilot work for a planned R01-level application. PROJECT NARRATIVE The postpartum period represents a unique time in a women’s life when many women gain excess weight and make the transition to becoming overweight or obese. We propose to rigorously study predictors of postpartum obesity and evaluate an innovative approach to improve weight loss in the postpartum period using an online behavioral weight loss program and social feedback from a team of other postpartum women. By identifying women at an early stage in life who will benefit the most from intensive lifestyle changes and testing interventions that are low cost, sustainable, and remotely delivered, we hope to significantly improve cardiovascular health and reduce the burden of cardiovascular disease in women, which is a central mission of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI).",Obesity Prevention in Postpartum Women at High-Risk of Cardiovascular Disease,10040416,K23HL153667,"['Accountability', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Award', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Body Weight decreased', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Censuses', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Elements', 'Face', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health Sciences', 'Health behavior', 'Heart Diseases', 'High Risk Woman', 'Hypertension', 'Incentives', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Institution', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Life Style', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maternal-fetal medicine', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Mothers', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Nature', 'Neighborhoods', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Overweight', 'Patients', 'Pennsylvania', 'Perinatal', 'Persons', 'Physical activity', 'Physical environment', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Population Sciences', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Postpartum Period', 'Postpartum Women', 'Pre-Eclampsia', 'Pregnancy', 'Qualitative Methods', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rewards', 'Risk Factors', 'Site', 'Social Characteristics', 'Social Environment', 'Statistical Methods', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Weight', 'Weight Gain', 'Woman', 'Women&apos', 's Health', 'Work', 'arm', 'base', 'behavior change', 'behavioral clinical trial', 'behavioral economics', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'cardiovascular health', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'career', 'career development', 'cohort', 'cost', 'design', 'gestational weight gain', 'health care service utilization', 'healthy lifestyle', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'mortality', 'neighborhood disadvantage', 'novel strategies', 'obesity prevention', 'patient oriented', 'peer support', 'postpartum weight', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive tools', 'pregnancy disorder', 'pregnancy hypertension', 'prevent', 'programs', 'racial diversity', 'recruit', 'secondary outcome', 'skills', 'social', 'tool', 'weight loss intervention', 'weight loss program']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,K23,2020,175248,0.00801860399245822
"Robust Predictors of Mania and Psychosis PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  The purpose of the new funding opportunity announcement, RFA-OD-17-004 for Intensive Longitudinal Analysis of Health Behaviors: Leveraging New Technologies To Understand Health Behaviors (U01), is to establish a cooperative agreement network to collaboratively study factors that influence key health behaviors in the dynamic environment of individuals, using intensive longitudinal data collection and analytic methods. Importantly, progress has been slow and frustrating in translating knowledge of the brain to new and more effective treatments for human brain diseases such as severe mental disorders. In fact, severe mental disorders, which include psychotic disorders, are brain diseases that are not only devastating because they result in severe disruptions that occur early in life, but, for many, the course of illness is progressive, leading to chronic debilitation and early mortality. Thus the need to accelerate knowledge about the factors that trigger (or increase or decrease the likelihood) of manic and psychotic episodes, and to translate this knowledge to more effective treatment interventions, is critical. The primary goal of the proposed “Robust Predictors of Mania and Psychosis” is to identify biological, environmental, and social factors that trigger dangerous mental states, particularly mania and psychosis, in individuals known to be at risk for these conditions. The eventual goal of this work is to provide quantifiable and predictable information that can be used to scaffold biological observations and tailor intervention strategies to maximize efficacy at the individual level. We first develop models to predict conventional clinical measures specific to psychosis and mania using (1) digital, low- to-minimal burden interactions through smartphones and wearables (Aim 1), and (2) measures extracted from face and voice during in-person clinical interactions (Aim 2), work which leverages existing data we have already collected. We will next collect one hundred person-years of pseudo-continuous multivariate behavioral data from one hundred individuals with a psychotic disorder, to further test and validate our early observations in a wider array of individuals with affective and non-affective psychotic disorders, who are likely to experience illness fluctuations within a one-year timeframe, employing several strategies to optimize participant engagement (Aim 3). We will also perform, as a representative example, a study comparing sleep, energy expenditure, and mania symptoms over time, using data obtained in the first three aims, to quantify how the relationship between energy expenditure and energy perception varies across our study population in ways that could have important consequences for health behaviors (Aim 4). The main goals of this project are thus to acquire high quality, temporally dense behavioral, cognitive, and clinical data on an important cohort of young adult patients, not only to facilitate future investigations linking these behavioral change points to neurobiological processes but also as a precursor to more effective, targeted therapeutics, such as real-time interventions that could be delivered based on dynamic factors in an individual's environment. 8. PROJECT NARRATIVE The main goal of the proposed “Robust predictors of mania and psychosis” is to identify biological, environmental, and social factors that trigger dangerous mental states, particularly mania and psychosis, in individuals known to be at risk for these conditions by acquiring high quality, temporally dense, longitudinal behavioral data, and using machine learning approaches to iteratively identify factors that increase or decrease the likelihood of these conditions. We focus on early psychosis (both affective and non-affective psychosis), which is a critical time period when there are fewer confounds such as prolonged medication exposure and chronicity, and when early intervention strategies will be most effective, prior to the progression that often leads to debilitating and chronic illnesses, to great suffering, and to an enormous public health problem and economic burden. By developing predictors for mania and psychosis from smartphone, wearable, and audio- video data and then testing these predictors over 100 person-years in individuals with active psychotic disorders, the data collected will make it possible to identify specific factors in the physical, social, and/or built environment that facilitate or hinder healthy behaviors in early psychosis and bipolar disorder and lay the groundwork for tailored intervention strategies that fully account for these factors to maximize efficacy at the individual level.",Robust Predictors of Mania and Psychosis,9938687,U01MH116925,"['Acoustics', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Factors', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Categories', 'Cellular Phone', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Cognitive', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Dangerousness', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Collection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Early Intervention', 'Economic Burden', 'Energy Metabolism', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Event', 'Face', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding Opportunities', 'Future', 'Gestures', 'Goals', 'Health behavior', 'Hospitalization', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Manic', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medical Records', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Neurobiology', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Perception', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physical environment', 'Process', 'Prospective Studies', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Risk', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sleep', 'Social Environment', 'Symptoms', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translating', 'U-Series Cooperative Agreements', 'Visual', 'Voice', 'Work', 'Wrist', 'actigraphy', 'analytical method', 'base', 'built environment', 'case control', 'cohort', 'design', 'digital', 'disability', 'early onset', 'effective therapy', 'energy balance', 'experience', 'gaze', 'individual patient', 'longitudinal analysis', 'longitudinal design', 'mental state', 'mortality', 'new technology', 'phenotypic data', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive test', 'prospective', 'psychotic symptoms', 'scaffold', 'sensor', 'severe mental illness', 'social', 'social factors', 'study population', 'targeted treatment', 'theories', 'time use', 'wearable device', 'young adult']",NIMH,MCLEAN HOSPITAL,U01,2020,710639,-0.012039586732984981
"Understanding the Multilevel Drivers of Liver Cancer Disparities Project Summary/Abstract From 2000-2014, hepatocellular carcinoma, or HCC, incidence rates increased nearly 4% per year, while most cancers in the United States were on the decline. HCC disproportionately impacts minority racial/ethnic groups who are diagnosed at rates approximately twice that of non-Hispanic Whites. To inform primary prevention strategies that will reduce disparities in HCC risk, we need to determine the relative contribution of well- established and emerging (e.g., hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus, alcohol, smoking, cirrhosis, NAFLD, metabolic disorders, diabetes, HIV infection), and novel (e.g., medications, comorbidities, neighborhood attributes) risk factors to these disparities. To inform secondary and tertiary prevention strategies to reduce disparities in HCC burden, we need to understand the multilevel factors that contribute to HCC surveillance disparities. Answering these gaps in knowledge requires a robust high-quality study with a sample enriched for racial/ethnic minorities. Thus, we propose to leverage existing multi-disciplinary collaborations to develop an integrated dataset that includes electronic health records (EHR) data linked to population-based state cancer registry data and geospatial contextual data. This multilevel resource will include data on nearly 2.3 million individuals from three healthcare systems (mixed payer, integrated healthcare, federally qualified health centers) in California and Hawaii, thus providing diversity in healthcare settings and enrichment for racial/ethnic minorities: 59,400 are Black, 189,500 are Hispanic, and 441,700 are Asian American/Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander (AANHPI). With this resource, we specifically aim to: (1) assess the relative importance of established and emerging examine the extent to which these factors independently and jointly contribute to racial/ethnic disparities in HCC risk; (2) discover novel risk factors and assess their relative importance to HCC risk; and (3) assess racial/ethnic disparities in adherence with surveillance for HCC as well as examine the extent to which these disparities are attributable to modifiable individual-, clinician-, system-, and neighborhood factors (Aim 3). For Aim 1, using prospective data, we will assess the relative importance of risk factors and their contribution to racial/ethnic disparities in HCC risk with causal inference methods. For Aim 2, we will apply innovative machine learning methods to identify novel factors and validate their associations with HCC risk using modeling strategy from Aim 1. For Aim 3, we will use multilevel generalized linear regression to investigate the patient, clinician, institutional and geographic factors that contribute to disparities in HCC surveillance. Given the importance of sex and age/birth cohort for HCC risk, these social determinants will be considered together with race/ethnicity using an intersectional approach. By applying a multilevel framework to understand how biological, clinical, and social factors at multiple levels contribute to HCC disparities in incidence and surveillance, the proposed study will identify modifiable factors that can be translated to the clinical and community settings to collaboratively identify strategies to ameliorate racial/ethnic disparities in HCC. Project Narrative While most cancer incidence and mortality in the United States are declining, the burden of liver cancer is increasing; yet, we do not understand what causes 40% of these cancers. Furthermore, this cancer impacts racial/ethnic groups disproportionately, with minority racial/ethnic groups who are diagnosed at rates approximately twice that of non-Hispanic Whites. Therefore we propose to study the relative contribution of established and emerging risk factors, discover and validate novel risk factors, and to understand patient, clinician, healthcare system and geographic factors that influence surveillance; these findings can then be used to inform strategies in clinical and community settings to reduce the burden of liver cancer particularly for those at high risk.",Understanding the Multilevel Drivers of Liver Cancer Disparities,9997828,R01CA225478,"['Address', 'Adherence', 'Alcohols', 'Asian Americans', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Biological', 'Biological Factors', 'Biology', 'Biometry', 'Birth', 'California', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Cirrhosis', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Education', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemiologic Monitoring', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Ethnic group', 'Federally Qualified Health Center', 'Female', 'Fibrinogen', 'Future', 'Geographic Factor', 'Geography', 'HIV Infections', 'Hawaii', 'Health Insurance', 'Health Maintenance Organizations', 'Health Services Research', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hepatitis B', 'Hepatitis B Virus', 'Hepatitis C', 'Hepatitis C virus', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hispanics', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Institution', 'Insurance Coverage', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Linear Regressions', 'Link', 'Liver neoplasms', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of liver', 'Metabolic Diseases', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Native Hawaiian', 'Neighborhoods', 'Not Hispanic or Latino', 'Pacific Island Americans', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Prevention strategy', 'Preventive measure', 'Primary Prevention', 'Primary carcinoma of the liver cells', 'Race', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Studies', 'Secondary Prevention', 'Services', 'Shapes', 'Smoking', 'Social Sciences', 'System', 'Tobacco smoking behavior', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'United States', 'built environment', 'cancer epidemiology', 'cancer health disparity', 'chronic alcohol ingestion', 'cohort', 'community setting', 'comorbidity', 'data registry', 'disparity reduction', 'electronic data', 'ethnic minority population', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'health care settings', 'high risk', 'innovation', 'machine learning method', 'male', 'mortality', 'neoplasm registry', 'non-alcoholic fatty liver disease', 'nonalcoholic steatohepatitis', 'novel', 'population based', 'prospective', 'racial and ethnic', 'racial and ethnic disparities', 'racial minority', 'sex', 'social', 'social determinants', 'social disparities', 'social factors', 'socioeconomics', 'tertiary prevention']",NCI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2020,645058,0.017702553773692765
"Role of visceral adipose tissue in frailty among patients with Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT In this application for a 5-year K23 Career Development Award, I propose mentored research and career development leading to a career as an independent clinical and translational investigator in interstitial lung disease (ILD). The goal of this project is to identify the role of body composition in frailty among subjects with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). The prevalence of IPF is rising, currently affecting 1 in 200 older adults. There is no cure for IPF. The only available medications slow disease progression but do not reverse disease. Frailty affects up to 50% of IPF patients, and is characterized by decreased physiologic reserve and increased susceptibility to severe manifestations of acute insults. The most common causes of death in IPF are acute insults. Frailty is thus a potentially modifiable risk factor for morbidity and mortality in IPF. This proposal builds on my preliminary work showing that (1) greater visceral adipose tissue (VAT) is associated with increased frailty, (2) subjects with both sarcopenia and visceral obesity are at greater risk of frailty than those with sarcopenia alone, (3) there may be distinct endotypes of exercise limitation defined by high inflammation alone or low inflammation with high VAT, and (4) down-regulation of the growth hormone (GH) axis may link VAT and frailty. Under the mentorship of Dr. R Graham Barr, I propose to evaluate the roles of body composition by bioelectrical impedance assay (co-mentor Gallagher), inflammation, and neuroendocrine dysregulation associated with frailty risk using a machine-learning approach (co-mentor Valeri). I will also evaluate the role of growth hormone axis dysregulation in sarcopenia with visceral obesity in a rigorous overnight protocol (co-mentor Freda). I propose to perform this in two NHLBI-funded prospective cohorts: Dr. Garcia’s Families-At-Risk for ILD (R01HL103676) and Dr. Singer’s Advanced Lung Disease Lung Transplantation Study (R01HL134851). With guidance from my mentors, I have crafted a 5-year career development plan that includes training in body composition analysis (Dr. Gallagher), measurement of complex endocrine systems (Dr. Freda), clinical trials (Dr. Freda), biostatistics (Dr. Valeri), aging in interstitial lung disease (Dr. Garcia), and epidemiology (Dr. Barr). In the last two years of this award, I will apply for R01 funding and transition to independence. The proposed activities will prepare me to conduct patient-oriented research to evaluate the role of body composition in outcomes in ILD. I will also acquire the skills and training required to design and conduct clinical trials targeting novel pathways to prevent and treat frailty in ILD. PROJECT NARRATIVE Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is an increasingly prevalent chronic lung disease with no available cure; frailty affects 50% of IPF patients, and is associated with increased severity of illness in response to acute insults, which are the most common cause of death in IPF. We identified that visceral adipose tissue is a risk factor for frailty and propose to investigate potential mechanisms linking visceral adipose tissue and frailty, as modifiable risk factors for morbidity and mortality in this growing patient population. Our findings may lead to novel therapies and clinical trials evaluating the role of existing medications in the prevention and treatment of frailty in IPF.",Role of visceral adipose tissue in frailty among patients with Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis,10055250,K23HL150280,"['Acute', 'Adipose tissue', 'Adrenal Cortex Hormones', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Aging', 'American', 'Arrhythmia', 'Award', 'Biolectric Impedance', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Biometry', 'Body Composition', 'Body mass index', 'Cause of Death', 'Central obesity', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic lung disease', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Conduct Clinical Trials', 'Data', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Down-Regulation', 'Elderly', 'Endocrine system', 'Enrollment', 'Epidemiology', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Exercise', 'FDA approved', 'Family', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'HIV', 'High Prevalence', 'Hormone secretion', 'Hospitalization', 'Inflammation', 'Infrastructure', 'Injury', 'Insulin-Like Growth Factor I', 'Interleukin-1 Receptors', 'Interleukin-1 beta', 'Interleukin-6', 'Interstitial Lung Diseases', 'Intramuscular', 'Investigation', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Link', 'Lung Transplantation', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Myocardial Ischemia', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Neurosecretory Systems', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Pilot Projects', 'Pneumonia', 'Predisposition', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Prospective cohort', 'Prospective cohort study', 'Protocols documentation', 'Pulmonary Fibrosis', 'Research', 'Research Priority', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Selection Criteria', 'Series', 'Serum', 'Severity of illness', 'Skeletal Muscle', 'Societies', 'Somatotropin', 'Somatotropin-Releasing Hormone', 'Steroids', 'Structure of parenchyma of lung', 'Subgroup', 'Syndrome', 'TNF gene', 'Testing', 'Testosterone', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapy Clinical Trials', 'Training', 'Transplantation', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor', 'Variant', 'Visceral', 'Work', 'androgenic', 'career', 'career development', 'circulating biomarkers', 'cohort', 'design', 'frailty', 'growth hormone deficiency', 'health related quality of life', 'hormone analog', 'human old age (65+)', 'idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis', 'modifiable risk', 'mortality', 'muscle form', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'patient oriented', 'patient oriented research', 'patient population', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'pulmonary rehabilitation', 'reduced muscle mass', 'research and development', 'respiratory', 'response', 'sarcopenia', 'sarcopenic obesity', 'skills training', 'targeted treatment', 'therapeutic target', 'translational approach', 'translational scientist']",NHLBI,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,K23,2020,170856,-0.033447509659063505
"Evolution of Psychosis in Youth: Multimodal Risk and Resilience Markers PROJECT SUMMARY Efforts at early identification of individuals at risk for psychosis are propelled by the realization that psychosis is neurodevelopmental, with brain and behavioral abnormalities anteceding diagnosis of schizophrenia (SZ) by years. As longer duration of untreated psychosis portends poor outcome, early identification is important to bend the developmental trajectory in a favorable direction. Since most current studies of psychosis risk are based on help-seeking samples, there is a gap in knowledge on how psychosis unfolds in diverse community samples. While it is generally recognized that genomic and environmental factors (GxE) contribute to risk for psychosis, there is a paucity of complementary integrative studies that can chart causal pathways. Genomic “case-control” GWAS studies of SZ identified multiple common alleles permitting calculation of a polygenic risk score (PRS). Recently, increased attention has been given to childhood adversity related to SZ. The goal of the proposed R01 is to build on our genotyped ~10,000 Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort (PNC) of 8 to 21 years old youths studied in 2009-2011, where we are following those who meet criteria or are at risk for psychosis (PS) and typically developing (TD) participants, whose current age range is 15-30 years. Available multi-level “deep phenotyping” includes clinical, neurocognition and multi-modal neuroimaging on a subsample of ~1600. We have developed a preliminary environmental risk score (ERS) and will use it to dissect GxE. The proposed followup design will recruit PS and TD participants with the highest and lowest scorers (quartile) on the ERS, and within each of these four cells we will examine 120 individuals, 60 males and 60 females (total N=480). This sample will be examined clinically, neurocognitively and with multimodal neuroimaging. We will test the hypothesis that genomic vulnerabilities, based on PRS and family history, and environmental adversity, based on ERS, updated longitudinally, affect onset and course of PS by altering brain development in temporolimbic regions affecting fronto-limbic connectivity that underlies social functioning. We will augment current data with information on risk and resilience and multimodal brain-behavior parameters to establish developmental trajectories during this critical period of brain maturation when psychosis emerges. Our aims are: 1. Examine effects of ERS on PS clinical features and progression in relation to PRS. 2. Investigate brain- behavior parameters that bridge from genetic and environmental factors to clinical manifestations. 3. Establish developmental trajectories for PS features, associated brain parameters and neurocognitive deficits, and apply novel computational models to enable an adaptive “risk and resilience calculator”. The proposed study will produce the data absent for a diverse US community sample but needed to move psychiatry into the precision medicine era. The project will inform on genomic and environmental risk and resilience indicators, offering an essential rung in the ladder toward individualized prediction, a part of implementation science. As with the PNC, data and associated algorithms will be a resource shared with the scientific community. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed R01 aims to bridge genomic, environment and phenotypic brain-behavior measures to advance the understanding of risk and resilience to psychosis. We will build on informative samples of the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort and integrate multidimensional behavioral measures of psychosis and cognition, multimodal neuroimaging parameters of brain structure, function and connectivity, environmental parameters, and genomic variations in risk for schizophrenia. Computational modeling will aim at developing risk and resilience predictors, essential for early identification and intervention during a dynamic period of brain maturation.",Evolution of Psychosis in Youth: Multimodal Risk and Resilience Markers,9978131,R01MH119219,"['21 year old', 'Address', 'Affect', 'African American', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'Attention', 'Behavioral', 'Benign', 'Brain', 'Cells', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical assessments', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Computer Models', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Evaluation', 'Evolution', 'Family', 'Family history of', 'Female', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Lead', 'Linear Regressions', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Modeling', 'Neurocognition', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurocognitive Deficit', 'Neurosciences', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Philadelphia', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Public Domains', 'Race', 'Recording of previous events', 'Resource Sharing', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Severities', 'Sex Differences', 'Social Functioning', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Update', 'Work', 'Youth', 'aged', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'behavioral phenotyping', 'brain behavior', 'case control', 'childhood adversity', 'cohort', 'critical period', 'data anonymization', 'design', 'early adolescence', 'emerging adult', 'follow-up', 'genome wide association study', 'genomic variation', 'help-seeking behavior', 'high risk', 'implementation science', 'improved', 'innovation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'machine learning method', 'male', 'multidisciplinary', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'personalized predictions', 'polygenic risk score', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive test', 'psychiatric genomics', 'recruit', 'resilience', 'sex', 'social']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2020,787558,0.015525963373960098
"Phase II - HazPrep Worker Training - Community Risk Profile PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT A worker's personal hazard profile (PHP) is a function of hazards present and his/her exposure level to those hazards. Workers with an elevated level of risk are those who can be engaged in activities related to - or working around - hazardous materials, waste generation, removal, containment, transportation, and emergency response. inXsol’s Phase I feasibility study verified appeal and effectiveness of a new form of crowdsourced social learning platform. Our approach using cloud technology creates a dynamically growing library of incidents/scenarios, highly personalized (occupation/task/geo) risk profile and generates learning activities to train on risk awareness and mitigation techniques. The Phase II proposal includes implementation of an innovative use of big data algorithms for community profiles and fusion with PHP allowing for targeted and personalized training completing the HazPrep prototype developed and exercised by our beta test team in Phase I.

"SCH: Prediction of Preterm Birth in Nulliparous Women Program Director/Principal Investigator (Last, First, Middle): Salleb-Aouissi, Ansaf Summary Prediction of Preterm Birth (PTB) has been an exceedingly challenging problem, predom- inantly due to the inherent complexity of its multifactorial etiology and the lack of approaches capable of integrating and interpreting large multidisciplinary data. It is a major long-lasting public health problem with heavy emotional and ﬁnancial consequences to families and society [ , ]. PTB is the leading cause of mortality and long-term disabilities among neonates. Most studies to date have examined 7 20 individual risk factors through univariate analyses of their coincidence with PTB.  Our previous work [NSF Eager 1454855, 1454814] developed predictive models for PTB based on non-genetic maternal attributes [ , 30 29 ]. A particularly challenging population to determine PTB risk is ﬁrst time mothers (nulliparous women) due to the lack of prior pregnancy history. An important question is to know whether factors other than history of PTB can be used to identify a nullipara patient at risk. Speciﬁc aims of the original project Our basic speciﬁc aims are as follows: (1) Longitudinal Preterm Birth Prediction: We will ﬁrst build a series of accurate prediction models for PTB using the nuMoM2b dataset. Such models will handle the challenges common to medical datasets including (a) imbalance in the classes, (b) missing data, and (c) disparity in data collection. We will achieve this by designing an objective function for Support Vector Machines that captures and corrects for these issues. Second, by leveraging the availability of patient future data, our Learning Under Privileged Infor- mation (LUPI)-based approach [ ] will signiﬁcantly increase the rate of convergence of the algorithms 22 and improve prediction with less data. Our transformative approach is well-suited for medical datasets that are both limited by the number of patients and inherently include the challenges mentioned above. (2) Combining clinical and genetic features for risk prediction: In this aim we tackle questions of causality between the genetic information and its various forms of phenotypic implications by leveraging the phenotypically rich nuMoM2b dataset. We will ﬁrst apply standard GWAS analysis to apply new insight regarding the changing patterns of genetic association as additional phenotypic data is accumu- lated as well as serve as a baseline. We will then seek to develop improved analysis of involvement of genetic contributions in PTB. (3) Clinical and social impact: We plan to assess the effectiveness of the methods in clinical practice by: (a) testing the effectiveness of the longitudinal models produced in objective 1 and 2 on existing clinical data at the New York Presbyterian Hospital. (b) building a sequential decision making model; this includes optimizing the scheduling of patient visits and diagnostic testing tailored for different classes of patients. Speciﬁc aims for this NIH Supplement We will extend the original aims to the following: (1) Interpret- ing PTB prediction models: we propose to explore the interpretability of our best performing models in an effort to understand “PTB mechanisms.” Our approach is to probe the most accurate models to assess which risk factor or feature are the most important and how they combine to lead to the PTB outcome. We will explore characteristic rules, along with inﬂuence functions to identify the instances that are driving prediction, (2) NetWAS Analysis for PTB: we will integrate NetWAS analysis into the study of PTB mechanisms and genetics. We will focus on the uterine expression levels available for automated NetWAS analysis from the uterus, and uterine cervix/endometrium, and integrate NETWAS- computed expression levels as features to the prediction models, and (3) Studying dynamic treatment regimes for PTB: We will investigate models that use reinforcement learning and causal reasoning to learn appropriate dynamic treatment policies in the context of confounding bias in the nuMoM2b data. This will in turn affect scheduling of tests and visits based on the individualized patient proﬁle. Broader Impact Over 26 billion dollars are spent annually on the delivery and care of the 12% of infants who are born preterm in the United States. A crucial challenge is to identify women who are at the highest risk for very early preterm birth and to develop interventions. Equally important, would be the ability to identify women at the lowest risk to avoid unnecessary and costly interventions. Our project has the potential to advance knowledge about this long-lasting public health problem. We will recruit female and minority students to this project. Research results will be disseminated through courses, conference and journal papers, and through undergraduate research and graduate students' theses.

"SCH: Prediction of Preterm Birth in Nulliparous Women Preterm Birth (PTB) is a major long-lasting public health problem being the leading cause of mortality and long-term disabilities among neonates, with heavy emotional and financial consequences to families and society. Prediction of PTB risk has been an exceedingly challenging problem, in particular for first time mothers (nulliparous women) due to the lack of prior pregnancy history. Most studies to date have examined individual risk factors, genetic, environmental, or behavioral, through univariate analyses of their association with PTB, including GWAS identifying modest contribution of common variants across six gene regions. The challenge of improving PTB prediction is due to the inherent complexity of its multifactorial etiology and the lack of approaches capable of integrating and interpreting large multidisciplinary data. Our previous work [NSF Eager 1454855, 1454814] developed predictive models for PTB based on non-genetic maternal attributes. An important question is to know whether factors other than history of PTB can be used to identify a nullipara patient at risk. We plan on devising longitudinal risk prediction methods for PTB that integrate every piece of available data. We will address three important gaps in current literature as our three project objectives: a focused study of nulliparous women and their risk for PTB; combining genetic factors with other clinical factors to determine risk ; and using longitudinal data and models to optimize scheduling of patient visits, testing and treatment. We will focus on a recently released NIH-NICHD dataset called nuMoM2b, which is a prospective cohort study of a racially/ethnically/geographically diverse  population of10 ,038 nulliparous women with singleton gestation . Our aims are as follows: (1) Longitudinal Preterm Birth Prediction ; (2) Combining clinical and genetic features for risk prediction ; (3) Assessing the effectiveness of the methods in clinical practice. RELEVANCE (See instructions) . Over 26 billion dollars are spent annually on the delivery and care of the 12% of infants who are born preterm in the United States. A crucial challenge is to identify women who are at the highest risk for early preterm birth and to develop interventions. Equally important, would be the ability to identify women at the lowest risk to avoid unnecessary and costly interventions. Our project has the potential to advance knowledge about this long-lasting public health problem. n/a",SCH: Prediction of Preterm Birth in Nulliparous Women,10018949,R01LM013327,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Behavioral', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Effectiveness', 'Emotional', 'Etiology', 'Family', 'Female', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Geography', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Instruction', 'Intervention', 'Journals', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Medical', 'Medical Genetics', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mothers', 'National Institute of Child Health and Human Development', 'New York', 'Nulliparity', 'Paper', 'Patient Schedules', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Histories', 'Premature Birth', 'Presbyterian Church', 'Prospective cohort study', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Series', 'Social Impacts', 'Societies', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'Visit', 'Woman', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'design', 'disability', 'effectiveness testing', 'genetic association', 'genetic information', 'genome wide association study', 'graduate student', 'high risk', 'improved', 'insight', 'intervention cost', 'minority student', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'neonate', 'non-genetic', 'phenotypic data', 'predictive modeling', 'racial and ethnic', 'recruit', 'support vector machine', 'symposium', 'undergraduate research']",NLM,COLUMBIA UNIV NEW YORK MORNINGSIDE,R01,2020,252561,0.02814735808181138
"5/5 CAPER: Computerized Assessment of Psychosis Risk Summary Research suggests that if we can identify individuals at-risk for these disorders early, we may be able to improve the course of illness and hopefully prevent illness onset all together. A first generation of studies suggest that the approach of identifying those at clinical high-risk (CHR), through the use of specialized interviews with help-seeking individuals (with attenuated psychosis symptoms) is a promising strategy for exploring mechanisms associated with illness progression, understanding etiology, and identifying new treatment targets. This work has two major limitations: 1) interview methods have limited specificity as only 15-20% of CHR individuals convert to psychosis, and 2) the expertise needed to make CHR diagnosis is only accessible in a handful of metropolitan centers, and requires extensively trained staff. Here, we aim to lay the foundation for a new approach to CHR assessment that will increase accessibility, and positive predictive value. We propose to develop a new psychosis symptom domain sensitive (PSDS) battery, prioritizing tasks that show correlations with the symptoms that define psychosis (actively tapping into psychotic disorder-specific processes, rather than to trait vulnerability signs) and relatedly, that are tied to the neurobiological systems and computational mechanisms implicated in these symptoms. To promote accessibility, we utilize inexpensive behavioral tasks that could be administered over the internet; this will set the stage for later research testing widespread screening in help-seeking as well as non-help seeking populations, that would identify those most in need of in-depth assessment. Before this can be accomplished however, it is necessary to determine which tasks are effective for predicting illness course and how this strategy compares to the first-generation prediction methods. We propose to recruit 500 CHR participants, 500 help-seeking individuals, and 500 healthy controls across 5 sites and in Aim 1, develop a PSDS battery risk calculator based on measures that prove to be most sensitive to imminent conversion. Further, the inclusion of a help-seeking comparison group is critical for translating the PSDS calculator into clinical practice, where the goal is to differentiate those at greatest risk for developing a psychotic disorder from others forms of psychopathology. In Aim 2, we will compare the sensitivity and specificity of the PSDS risk-calculator to the North American Prodromal Study (NAPLS) risk-calculator (a gold-standard first-generation tool) in the prediction of psychosis conversion over a 2 year- period. Last, in Aim 3, the study will determine if the PSDS predicts functional outcomes over the course of 2 years. Predicting diagnosis is important but being able to provide early intervention to limit the disability characteristic of psychosis is a priority. This project will answer the preliminary questions necessary for a next-generation CHR battery, tied to illness mechanisms and powered by cutting-edge computational methods, that can be used to facilitate the earliest possible detection of psychosis risk. Narrative Early detection of young people at clinical high risk for psychosis offers a critical opportunity for early intervention to improve the course of illness, and perhaps even prevent onset entirely. Current interview- based methods for psychosis risk detection lack specificity, and are only available in a handful of research centers in the United States. The proposed study aims to improve accessibility and broaden impact of high risk screening by testing brief computerized measures, ultimately able to be administered on the internet, and to improve prediction by focusing on tasks specific to underlying mechanisms driving emerging psychotic symptoms.",5/5 CAPER: Computerized Assessment of Psychosis Risk,9984613,R01MH120089,"['Address', 'American', 'Attenuated', 'Automobile Driving', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Etiology', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Human Resources', 'Individual', 'Internet', 'Intervention Trial', 'Interview', 'Joints', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurobiology', 'Onset of illness', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Primary Prevention', 'Process', 'Psychopathology', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Role', 'Sample Size', 'Secondary Prevention', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Severities', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Translating', 'United States', 'Work', 'Youth', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'cognitive testing', 'comparison group', 'computerized', 'design', 'disability', 'disorder risk', 'follow-up', 'functional decline', 'functional outcomes', 'help-seeking behavior', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'improved', 'machine learning method', 'metropolitan', 'new therapeutic target', 'next generation', 'novel strategies', 'prevent', 'psychotic symptoms', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'screening', 'social', 'tool', 'trait']",NIMH,YALE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,572946,0.020395221604859775
"Reducing Drug-Related Mortality Using Predictive Analytics: A Randomized, Statewide, Community Intervention Trial PROJECT SUMMARY Overdose deaths have skyrocketed in the United States since 1999. The epidemic has prompted widespread federal and state actions, yet the number of people who die of an overdose continues to increase. In light of the accelerating and rapidly evolving overdose epidemic, new strategies are needed to identify communities most at risk, and to utilize resources more effectively to curb overdose deaths. To address these public health priorities, we will develop a forecasting tool to predict overdose deaths before they occur, and then conduct a randomized, statewide, community-level intervention to evaluate resource targeting based on these predictions. The study will take place in Rhode Island, a state with the 10th highest rate of overdose fatality in 2016. The study has two phases. First, we will develop a predictive analytics model that forecasts future overdose mortality at the neighborhood-level, using publicly available information and data from a multicomponent overdose surveillance system. This tool, called PROVIDENT (Preventing Overdose using Information and Data from the Environment) will be used to predict the likelihood of magnitude of future overdose deaths in every neighborhood across Rhode Island. Next, we will conduct a randomized policy experiment to evaluate whether targeting overdose prevention interventions to neighborhoods at highest risk reduces overdose morbidity and mortality. The state's department of health will receive PROVIDENT model predictions for half of the 39 cities/towns in Rhode Island. Within these cities/town, the health department will work with stakeholders to target overdose prevention interventions to neighborhoods with the highest probability of future overdose deaths. Interventions include efforts to: (1) prevent high-risk prescribing (through academic detailing and other educational efforts); (2) expand access to opioid agonist therapy, including buprenorphine and methadone; (3) increase naloxone distribution (through community and pharmacy-based efforts); and (4) expand street-based peer recovery coaching and referrals. Control cities/town will continue to receive these interventions, but without targeting to specific neighborhoods. Fatal and non-fatal opioid overdose rates in the control cities/towns will be compared to those that received the PROVIDENT model predictions. To achieve these aims, we will leverage a unique partnership between an academic institution and a state's health department, which allows for unprecedented access to and sharing of population-based overdose surveillance data. Our results will improve public health decision-making and inform resource allocation to communities that should be prioritized for evidence-based prevention, treatment, recovery, and overdose rescue services. If found to be effective, the PROVIDENT forecasting model will be disseminated to other states, which could adapt the tool to guide resource allocation and maximize public health impact. In sum, this project is highly responsive to a top research priority of the National Institute on Drug Abuse, and directly addresses one of the nation's most challenging public health crises. PROJECT NARRATIVE The objectives of this project are to leverage surveillance data to predict future overdose outbreaks, and to evaluate the impact of a randomized, statewide, community-level intervention trial to target overdose prevention programs to neighborhoods at highest risk of future overdose deaths. This study develops and tests an opioid overdose forecasting tool, which will allow other states to identify and deploy interventions to communities at highest risk of opioid-related death. This results study will significantly improve the allocation of resources to curb the opioid overdose epidemic in the United States.","Reducing Drug-Related Mortality Using Predictive Analytics: A Randomized, Statewide, Community Intervention Trial",10026087,R01DA046620,"['Academic Detailing', 'Address', 'Admission activity', 'American', 'Area', 'Buprenorphine', 'Censuses', 'Cities', 'Classification', 'Communities', 'Community Pharmacy', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Dose', 'Emergency medical service', 'Environment', 'Epidemic', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Priorities', 'Hospitals', 'Institution', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Community Trial', 'Intervention Trial', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Methadone', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Naloxone', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'Neighborhoods', 'Overdose', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Predictive Analytics', 'Prevention', 'Prevention program', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Probability', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Randomized', 'Recording of previous events', 'Records', 'Recovery', 'Research Priority', 'Resource Allocation', 'Resources', 'Rhode Island', 'Risk', 'Services', 'Source', 'Strategic Planning', 'Sum', 'System', 'Testing', 'United States', 'Visit', 'Work', 'addiction', 'base', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'high risk', 'improved', 'indexing', 'machine learning method', 'mortality', 'novel', 'opioid agonist therapy', 'opioid misuse', 'opioid mortality', 'opioid overdose', 'opioid policy', 'opioid use disorder', 'overdose death', 'overdose prevention', 'overdose risk', 'peer', 'population based', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'prescription opioid', 'prevent', 'primary outcome', 'programs', 'public health priorities', 'referral services', 'resource guides', 'response', 'spatiotemporal', 'surveillance data', 'tool', 'treatment arm']",NIDA,BROWN UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,654124,0.0033961843014658293
"Electronic Health Record-based Surveillance of Diabetes by Type in Young Adults in Pennsylvania 1 Currently there are 4.6 million young adults (18 to 44 years of age) with diabetes in the US and the incidence  2 and prevalence are increasing in this age group. However, due to limitations of traditional surveillance  3 strategies, it remains unknown whether these increases are in type 1 or type 2 diabetes. Electronic health  4 record (EHR)-based surveillance is a relatively simple, sustainable, and timely alternative to more traditional  5 methods. Recognizing the attributes of EHR-based surveillance, the Centers for Disease Control and  6 Prevention (CDC) has funded efforts to develop, evaluate, and deploy EHR-based surveillance of diabetes,  7 including the SEARCH for Diabetes in Youth (SEARCH) study and the Diabetes in Young Adults (DiYA) Study.  8 However, the geographic coverage of these studies has been limited. The geographical gaps in these studies  9 are problematic, as there are known geographic disparities in diabetes prevalence and incidence. Moreover, 10 little is known about how the methods applied in these studies will perform in other regions of the country, in 11 rural communities, and in other health systems. The proposed study will use more than two decades of EHR 12 data and administrative claims data to develop and implement EHR-based surveillance of type 1 and type 2 13 diabetes among young adults in a large region of Pennsylvania, the state with the 5th highest prevalence of 14 diabetes in this age group. This information is essential to informing public health strategies, assessing disease 15 burden, and prioritizing type-specific health services. We will use EHR data from Geisinger, a health system 16 serving a large and diverse region of Pennsylvania, to expand the geography of existing surveillance of 17 diabetes subtypes in young adults to the Middle Atlantic, an area without prior EHR-based diabetes 18 surveillance estimates. This region includes a combination of rural and urban communities, enabling us to 19 evaluate differences in the performance of EHR-based algorithms for case ascertainment by community type. 20 In the first phase of the study, we will evaluate the validity; simplicity; and consistency of EHR-based 21 algorithms for identifying diabetes subtypes. This work will build on previously developed algorithms from the 22 SEARCH and DiYA studies. We will use manual review of clinician notes as the gold standard to determine the 23 positive predictive value, sensitivity, and specificity of these algorithms. We propose to use an innovative, 24 efficient, and rigorous validation approach that incorporates natural language processing of clinician notes. We 25 will use a secondary data source, administrative claims data, to assess data completeness and our ability to 26 distinguish between incident and prevalent cases. In the second phase, we will use the best performing 27 algorithms to report on the annual incidence and prevalence of diabetes, by type, in young adults, between 28 2014 and 2024 in 38 Pennsylvania counties. All analyses will be stratified by age, sex, race/ethnicity, insurance 29 status, and community type (rural/urban). Finally, we will coordinate with CDC and other sites to conduct joint 30 analyses of aggregated data, greatly expanding the population under study. Narrative Currently there are 4.6 million young adults (18 to 44 years of age) with diabetes in the US and the incidence and prevalence estimates in this age group have been increasing. However, due to limitations of traditional surveillance strategies, it remains unknown whether these increases are in type 1 or type 2 diabetes.

"AI-powered social entrepreneurship training and community-opportunities matching platform for women enrolled in drug treatment programs. The Opioid drug crisis in US increases at an alarming rate with 68% of the more than 70,200 drug overdose deaths in 2017 involved an opioid, averaging 130 Americans dying every day from opioid overdose (CDC, 2013). Remarkably, between 1999 and 2010, overdose deaths from prescription painkillers increased more than 400% among women, astonishing 1.7 times higher than that of men; and heroin use among women between 2002 and 2013 increased 100%, 2 times higher than among men (CDC, 2013). There is a call for gender-focused drug abuse interventions (OWH, 2016; NIH, 2018). Adverse social conditions, including economic insecurity, have been identified as risk factors for opioid use among women and reasons for relapse. Addressing addiction problems in conjunction with vocational rehabilitation and, specifically, entrepreneurial skills training has been suggested (SAMHSA, 2000). Furthermore, a good behavioral strategy should include community involvement, as it helps to maintain successful addictive behavioral change (NDCI, 2014). Unfortunately, only a handful of recovery centers offer entrepreneurial skills training and help women to engage in volunteer work or offer them employment opportunities, due to the lack of financial and human resources (SAHMSA, 2000). ​The objective of this Phase I grant application is to establish technical and commercial feasibility of Gooddler AI-powered, online social entrepreneurship training platform that aims to provide recovery centers with a cost-effective option that will address entrepreneurial skills training and match women with open job or volunteer opportunities at local non-profit organizations.​ To accomplish this objective, we plan to execute the following specific aims: 1) demonstrate commercial feasibility of Gooddler social entrepreneurship training curriculum with three recovery centers in San Francisco Bay Area; and 2) demonstrate the technical feasibility of Gooddler platform to match women in recovery with appropriate volunteering and/job opportunities at local non-profit organizations. We will establish the technical feasibility by developing community-opportunities matching model that will address the specifications of the Minimum Viable Product (MVP). The commercial feasibility will be demonstrated by helping women to gain skills and knowledge for meaningful engagement (job, volunteering, entrepreneurship). Success will move us closer to our long-term goal of providing drug recovery centers with a tool to help 430,000 women, entering US drug treatment programs every year, to get on the path of productive social involvement in communities of their choice. Gooddler, Inc. proposes to develop and validate an AI-powered social entrepreneurship training and community-opportunities matching platform, targeting 430,000 women in US enrolled in drug treatment programs annually, to give them the necessary knowledge and skills to ensure a productive social involvement in chosen communities after they complete the treatment. Our highly experienced team will be able to successfully execute the project in this $100M market and expand the offering to other settings. It can be easily adapted to be included in programs for incarcerated women, extended to be offered to men and/or to be offered as a stand-alone vocational skills training course.",AI-powered social entrepreneurship training and community-opportunities matching platform for women enrolled in drug treatment programs.,9985318,R43DA051061,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Address', 'Aftercare', 'American', 'Analgesics', 'Applications Grants', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavioral', 'Budgets', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Drug Rehabilitation Centers', 'Drug abuse', 'Drug usage', 'Economics', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Effectiveness', 'Employment Opportunities', 'Enrollment', 'Ensure', 'Entrepreneurship', 'Evaluation', 'Feedback', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Human Resources', 'Imprisonment', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Modeling', 'Nonprofit Organizations', 'Occupations', 'Opioid', 'Outcome', 'Overdose', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phase', 'Policies', 'Recovery', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Research Subjects', 'Risk Factors', 'San Francisco', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Social Conditions', 'Surveys', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'United States Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration', 'Vocational rehabilitation', 'Weight', 'Woman', 'Work', 'addiction', 'base', 'community involvement', 'cost effective', 'design', 'experience', 'heroin use', 'men', 'opioid overdose', 'opioid use', 'overdose death', 'programs', 'research and development', 'skills', 'skills training', 'social', 'social engagement', 'success', 'tool', 'treatment center', 'treatment program', 'volunteer']",NIDA,"GOODDLER, INC",R43,2020,225000,-0.03480556656715781
"Advanced Risk Adjusters and Predictive Formulas for ICD-10 Based Risk Adjustment Diagnosis-based risk adjustment is widely used in the US and abroad for health plan payment, notably for Medicare Parts C and D, for commercial contracting and quality assessment, and in numerous state Medicaid programs. Yet the risk adjustment technology used for payments has not kept up with improved classification systems, larger patient datasets, improved estimation algorithms or recent theoretical and clinical developments. Our work will take advantage of the richer ICD-10-CM classification system, in use since October 2015, with over 5 times as many diagnoses as ICD-9-CM Codes. ICD-10 codes now recognize: left vs. right side for thousands of conditions, distinguish between initial, subsequent and sequela diagnoses, and incorporate hundreds of new clinical, demographic and biometric variables. Based on the ICD-10, more exact models can leverage increased diagnostic coding accuracy to reduce opportunities for gaming or discriminating against patients with conditions who are predicted to be unprofitable. Led by two of the three developers of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Hierarchical Condition Category (CMS-HCC) existing classification system, our team of physicians, public policy experts, statisticians and economists will comprehensively improve the accuracy of risk adjustment and predictive models using larger sample sizes, clinical judgment and state-of-art economic and statistical modeling. We will also expand the conventional regression methods explored, to include machine learning algorithms, constrained regression, and LASSO estimation. We will calculate a new “appropriateness to include” (ATI) score that captures diagnostic vagueness, discretion and suitability for use in risk adjustment models, and use this score to inform which variables are included in plan payment formulas. Selection incentives remain of concern in public US health plan payments formulas and may be costing Medicare over $5 billion per year (NBER 2017). Prediction and payment models from this project can reduce overpayment and offset plan incentives to skimp on services that attract sick people. To ensure that these models and formulas are useful for enrollees of all ages, they will initially be calibrated and tested on large commercially-insured claims data, covering ages 0 to 64. They will then be validated and refined for Medicare, Medicaid, and state employees using data from All-Payer Claims Data from five states and a second large commercial dataset. We will make development steps, statistical programs, and full details of the classification system and prediction formulas publicly available for comment, refinement, and use by health care delivery system researchers, payers and providers. Project Narrative This project will develop new classification systems and new prediction and payment models that take advantage of the fivefold increase in diagnostic codes available with the October 2015 change from ICD- 9-CM to ICD-10-CM. Using data from two national claims datasets and five state all-payer claims datasets that collectively cover over 75 million enrollees, we will identify new, underutilized ICD-10 capabilities, create new clusters of diagnoses useful for prediction, develop new algorithms for using these clusters, and estimate formulas that predict spending, utilization and diverse health care outcomes for all ages. Methods and results will be publicly described and software posted on the web for use in risk adjustment and diverse clinical, financial, policy evaluation, and quality assessment outcomes by health care delivery system researchers, payers and providers.",Advanced Risk Adjusters and Predictive Formulas for ICD-10 Based Risk Adjustment,9965911,R01HS026485,[' '],AHRQ,BOSTON UNIVERSITY (CHARLES RIVER CAMPUS),R01,2020,399950,0.0041279807256919005
"Effects of Functional Food Diets on Cardiometabolic and Metabolomics Profiles in Minority Youth PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT This proposal outlines a career development plan to help Dr. Jaapna Dhillon complete her postdoctoral training and establish an independent research program focused on personalized dietary interventions to reduce cardiometabolic risk in minority populations. Her training will be conducted in a multidisciplinary group of scientists with research expertise in nutrition science, health disparities, molecular cell biology, metabolomics and computational biology. Her advisory team will provide an outstanding training environment that will allow her to fill critical gaps in her toolkit needed to use an integrative and personalized approach to nutrition. This award will enhance her knowledge in developing culturally sensitive nutrition interventions and cardiovascular physiology, and provide advanced training in metabolomics and computational biology. During the training phase of this award, she will strengthen her scholarly activities, establish important collaborations, and acquire critical data that will ensure her successful transition to independence. Rational: The incidence of diet-related cardiometabolic disorders is increasing at an alarming rate in racial/ethnic minority groups such as Asians and Hispanics, and are much higher than Non-Hispanic Whites in the United States. [8]. However, whether improvements in diet quality will influence minority groups at high risk of cardiometabolic diseases differentially than Whites at high risk is not well understood. Functional foods such as nuts, whole grains and vegetables can help ameliorate cardiovascular disease and reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes. However, most studies on functional foods and health have been overwhelmingly performed in middle-aged to older non-Hispanic White adults, with young minority populations being greatly neglected. Adapting a functional food diet at earlier life stages may prevent or ameliorate metabolic disorders later in life in minority populations that are at greater risk for developing chronic metabolic diseases. Our central hypothesis is that adapting a personalized functional food diet at earlier life stages will have greater beneficial effects on carbohydrate and lipid regulation pathways in minority youth at risk for developing cardiometabolic disorders compared to White youth at risk. Design: The mentored phase study will 1) examine the effects of almonds on blood glucose regulation pathways using metabolomics techniques and 2) provide preliminary data for the development and testing of a model that can predict effects of almonds on metabolic consequences in minority youth. The independent phase study will evaluate the long term effects of a personalized diet rich in functional foods on pathways of carbohydrate and lipid regulation in relation to the gut microbiome and cardiovascular outcomes in minority youth at high risk for cardiometabolic disorders. Relevance: The proposed studies will provide an initial evidence base for the health benefits of personalized functional food interventions in minority youth.

"Risk Assessment of Cerebral Aneurysm Growth with 4D flow MRI PROJECT SUMMARY The goal of this project is to determine the contribution of hemodynamic factors to risk assessment of unruptured intracranial aneurysms (UIAs) and calculate these factors from enhanced in vivo 4D flow MRI data. Even though most UIAs are stable, the majority of UIA patients are offered interventional treatment due to the grave risk presented if an aneurysm ruptures. Previous studies indicated that in addition to clinical (e.g., age, sex, comorbidities) and morphological (e.g., location and size) factors, UIA progression is affected by local blood flow dynamics. Hemodynamic factors associated with UIA growth can be obtained from computational and experimental models or from 4D flow MRI measurements; however, each approach has limitations. The previous NIH-funded project focused on developing image-based computational methods for predicting postoperative flow following interventions. The goal of this renewal is to use the developed framework to improve risk stratification of UIAs using image-based flow analysis. The proposed project will develop multi-parametric predictive models that combine clinical and morphological factors with hemodynamic factors calculated from augmented 4D flow MRI data. The UIA growth predicted by different models will be compared to outcomes observed in longitudinal imaging studies. The aims of the proposed project are, therefore, to: (1) determine the probability of UIA growth by utilizing morphological and clinical factors together with hemodynamic factors obtained from computational and experimental flow models by a) performing statistical analysis based on morphological and clinical factors obtained from longitudinal imaging, and b) extending statistical model by including hemodynamic factors computed from patient-specific models; (2) Enhance 4D flow MRI data by a) determining 4D flow reproducibility and variability with in vitro studies, and b) applying advanced data augmentation methods to improve the accuracy of calculated hemodynamic factors affecting aneurysm growth; (3) determine the probability of UIA growth based on multi-parametric analysis utilizing hemodynamic factors calculated from enhanced 4D flow MRI. Successful completion of the project will resolve the controversy regarding how hemodynamic factors affect aneurysm growth and establish 4D flow MRI as a diagnostic tool for UIA risk stratification. This collaborative project engages the cardiovascular engineering group at Purdue University and neurosurgeons, neuroradiologists and MRI physicists at Northwestern University, University of California San Francisco and Barrow Neurological Institute. This cross-disciplinary team will bring together experts in neurovascular surgeries, MRI velocimetry, patient-specific flow computations, experimental fluid mechanics and statistical analysis. Retrospective and prospective UIAs data obtained from these superb clinical centers will be used in this study. The outstanding engineering resources available at Purdue and world-class imaging resources at Northwestern, UC San Francisco and Barrow, as well as existing the data sharing agreements between these institutions and ongoing collaborations between the PIs, will ensure the project's success. PROJECT NARRATIVE The majority of brain aneurysms are treated, despite the fact that most of them have very low risk or rupture. Studies indicated that brain aneurysm risk factors include a range of clinical (e.g., patient’s age, sex, family history) and anatomical (e.g., aneurysm location, size and shape) parameters, as well as local blood flow dynamics. The proposed studies will determine the specific contribution of blood flow variables for improving the risk assessment of brain aneurysms and examine whether these variables can be reliably calculated from flow velocities measured with phase-contrast magnetic resonance imaging.",Risk Assessment of Cerebral Aneurysm Growth with 4D flow MRI,10052679,R01HL115267,"['4D MRI', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Agreement', 'Anatomy', 'Aneurysm', 'Angiography', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Blood flow', 'Brain Aneurysms', 'California', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cerebral Aneurysm', 'Cerebrovascular Circulation', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computer Models', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Deposition', 'Diagnostic', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Experimental Models', 'Family', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Guidelines', 'Hypertension', 'Image', 'In Vitro', 'Institutes', 'Institution', 'Intervention', 'Intracranial Aneurysm', 'Liquid substance', 'Location', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Morphology', 'Multiparametric Analysis', 'Neurologic', 'Neurosurgeon', 'Noise', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Physics', 'Postoperative Period', 'Probability', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk stratification', 'Role', 'Rupture', 'Ruptured Aneurysm', 'San Francisco', 'Shapes', 'Site', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Models', 'Techniques', 'Thrombus', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Velocimetries', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical center', 'clinical risk', 'comorbidity', 'data sharing', 'enhancing factor', 'follow-up', 'hemodynamics', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'indexing', 'mortality', 'neurovascular', 'novel strategies', 'particle', 'predictive modeling', 'prospective', 'residence', 'serial imaging', 'sex', 'shear stress', 'success', 'tool']",NHLBI,PURDUE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,707635,0.001518843297071815
"Prediction of imminent sudden cardiac death based on warning signs Sudden cardiac arrest (SCA), a sudden catastrophic loss of the pulse, affects >350,000 in the US annually. Most will suffer sudden cardiac death (SCD) within 10 minutes of presentation, yielding a mortality rate >90%. Based on our recent work, we have proposed a novel paradigm for SCD called “near-term prevention”. SCA is often not as sudden as one might expect. At least 50% of individuals will have warning symptoms at some time in the 4 weeks prior to SCD, but these can be non-specific, so are often not acted upon. The overall goal of this proposal is to refine the identification of the symptomatic individual at high-risk of SCD, during this 4-week window of opportunity. We propose that a simultaneous examination of symptoms, clinical factors and biomarkers may identify individuals at highest risk of imminent SCD, which could enable prediction and pre-emptive management, thereby preventing SCD. We are proposing to develop a comprehensive risk score from two population-based studies founded by the PI. The Portland, Oregon Sudden Unexpected Death Study (Oregon-SUDS, catchment area ≈ 1 million) is now in its 17th year and the Ventura, California PRESTO study (Prediction of Sudden Death in Multi-Ethnic Communities, catchment area ≈ 850,000) is in its 5th year. The resulting combined databank contains information on >7500 SCD cases and controls, with detailed clinical phenotyping and a biobank of plasma samples. From Oregon-SUDS, we recently reported that 51% (n=430) of 839 individuals who suffered SCD presented with at least one symptom within the 4 weeks prior to their lethal event. The main symptom was chest pain, but dyspnea, fatigue, syncope and palpitations were also recorded. Warning signs could represent an opportunity for near-term prediction of SCD. While these symptoms are common and may be non-specific for SCD, we hypothesize that a combination of specific symptoms and clinical profile could facilitate the identification of patients at high risk of impending SCA. In addition, the discovery of novel plasma biomarkers for SCD could have additional utility for risk stratification. We therefore hypothesize that biomarkers, when combined with specific symptoms and clinical profile, will maximize the likelihood of identifying symptomatic subjects at highest risk of SCD, allowing for early intervention. SCD remains a major public health problem with a critical need for novel prediction and prevention. Development of this user-friendly risk score for imminent SCD in those with warning symptoms would represent a practical and clinically meaningful advance for triage of patients for optimal care. Sudden cardiac death (SCD) is a public health problem of substantial magnitude and at least fifty percent of affected individuals have warning signs in the four weeks preceding their event. The overall goal of this proposal is to develop a comprehensive risk prediction score for imminent SCD in those that have warning signs, in order to improve the effectiveness of SCD prevention.",Prediction of imminent sudden cardiac death based on warning signs,9916644,R01HL147358,"['911 call', 'Affect', 'Archives', 'Biological Markers', 'California', 'Caring', 'Catchment Area', 'Cessation of life', 'Chest Pain', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Control Groups', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Development', 'Dyspnea', 'Early Intervention', 'Effectiveness', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Event', 'Family', 'Fatigue', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Heart Arrest', 'Hour', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Lipids', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Oregon', 'Palpitations', 'Patient Triage', 'Patients', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Plasma', 'Population', 'Population Study', 'Prevention', 'Proteomics', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Risk', 'Risk stratification', 'Sampling', 'Subgroup', 'Sudden Death', 'Survivors', 'Symptoms', 'Syncope', 'Time', 'Tissue Sample', 'Wireless Technology', 'Woman', 'Work', 'base', 'biobank', 'case control', 'circulating biomarkers', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinical risk', 'common symptom', 'community living', 'data warehouse', 'design', 'high risk', 'improved', 'men', 'mortality', 'mortality risk', 'novel', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'response', 'sex', 'specific biomarkers', 'sudden cardiac death', 'user-friendly']",NHLBI,CEDARS-SINAI MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2020,816401,-0.026360124013194586
"Development of Mucosal and Systemic Immunity and Risk of Food Allergy The microbiome plays a critical role in the development of the immune system and alterations in the microbiome diversity almost certainly play an important role in the surge of allergic and autoimmune diseases in developed nations that began in the 1950's and continues today. Living on farms, avoiding antibiotics, vaginal delivery, and other environmental factors leading to greater diversity in the microbiome have been associated with a major reduction in the risk of atopic diseases. Understanding the development of the immune system in populations at low risk for allergy compared to high-risk populations, developing biomarkers for “protective” immune development, and assessing immune responses to the microbiome are fundamental for designing and assessing future interventions. In this proposal, we will compare the Old Order Mennonites (OOM) with a very low risk for food allergies (<1%), other allergic diseases and asthma and a lifestyle associated with a diverse microbiome (e.g. growing up on a farm, consumption of raw milk, large families, home deliveries, low rate of antibiotic use), and neonates born to families with food-allergic children with a very high risk for developing atopic diseases, e.g. a 15-20% risk of food allergy in the first year of life. We hypothesize that accelerated development of IgA mucosal immunity will be a biomarker for “protective” immune development. Abundant IgA-coated fecal bacteria are seen in early life and data from animal models indicate the importance of microbial diversity in the induction of this secretory IgA. Early studies suggest that the predisposition to the development of IgE antibodies (“atopy”) is associated with a slow development of IgA responses, e.g. our own data shows a delay in development of specific IgA in cow's milk-allergic infants. Exciting new discoveries further support the role for specific IgA come from trials of orally induced tolerance in established food allergy. Because there is an intimate reciprocal development of gut microbial communities with the IgA repertoire, we hypothesize that mucosal exposure to a diverse and immunogenic microbiome accelerates the development of IgA secretory immunity, counteracts development of IgE responses, and protects from allergic diseases.  We will assess how B cell subsets, immunoglobulin repertoire and somatic mutation rates (Aim 1), and gut microbiome and IgA antibody responses to microbiome develop in cohorts of high- and low-risk for allergy (Aim 2), and how these B cell biomarkers and gut microbiome relate to the development of food and other allergic diseases and humoral responses to allergens (Aim 3). In summary, this proposal will determine whether accelerated development of IgA responses is a biomarker for “protective” immune development, identify fecal bacteria inducing IgA responses, and assess the association of specific IgA immune responses with clinical tolerance, i.e. protection from early-onset food allergy and eczema. NARRATIVE The microbiome plays a critical role in the development of the immune system, and alterations in the microbiome diversity almost certainly play an important role in the surge of allergic and autoimmune diseases in developed nations. A major gap is our understanding of how the microbiome prevents allergic diseases. In this proposal, we will evaluate the development of infant immune system in populations at high risk and those at low risk for food allergy and other allergic diseases. The Old Order Mennonites (OOM) have a very low risk for allergic diseases and asthma and a lifestyle associated with a diverse microbiome; high-risk population includes families with food allergic children. These studies of immune system development in a population “protected” from allergic diseases will provide critical new knowledge about the development of the mucosal and systemic immunity, and lay the groundwork for future studies of prevention of allergic diseases in childhood.",Development of Mucosal and Systemic Immunity and Risk of Food Allergy,9895622,U01AI131344,"['16S ribosomal RNA sequencing', 'Age-Months', 'Allergens', 'Allergic', 'Allergic Disease', 'Allergy to peanuts', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Antibiotics', 'Antibodies', 'Antibody Response', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'B-Cell Development', 'B-Lymphocyte Subsets', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Bacteria', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth', 'Cattle', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Childhood Asthma', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cohort Studies', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Defect', 'Developed Countries', 'Development', 'Diet', 'Disease', 'Eczema', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Exhibits', 'Exposure to', 'Extrinsic asthma', 'Family', 'Farming environment', 'Feces', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Food', 'Food Hypersensitivity', 'Future', 'Genomics', 'Germ-Free', 'Home environment', 'Hypersensitivity', 'IgE', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immune system', 'Immunity', 'Immunoglobulin A', 'Immunoglobulin Class Switching', 'Immunoglobulin G', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region', 'Immunoglobulins', 'Immunology', 'Infant', 'Infant Development', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Life Style', 'Measures', 'Memory B-Lymphocyte', 'Mennonite', 'Milk', 'Mucosal Immunity', 'Mucous Membrane', 'Neonatal', 'Oral', 'Outcome', 'Plasma Cells', 'Play', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Prevention', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Saliva', 'Secretory Immunoglobulin A', 'Serum', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Sorting - Cell Movement', 'Systems Development', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Training', 'Transcript', 'Umbilical Cord Blood', 'Vaginal delivery procedure', 'animal data', 'atopy', 'base', 'cohort', 'design', 'early onset', 'food allergen', 'gut microbiome', 'gut microbiota', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'immunogenic', 'immunogenicity', 'infancy', 'microbial', 'microbiome', 'microorganism antigen', 'mucosal site', 'neonate', 'peripheral blood', 'postnatal', 'prevent', 'response', 'support vector machine']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF ROCHESTER,U01,2020,449434,-0.016838160468538928
"Digital Phenotyping for Computational Models of Relapse Prediction in Early Course Psychosis Project Summary  The candidate requests support for a four-year program of training and research to better understand how smartphone based digital phenotyping and computational methods can predict relapse and create digital phenotypes of symptoms and clinical outcomes in early course psychosis.  In the proposed training plan, the candidate will build upon his previous experiences in engineering, clinical informatics, and clinical psychiatry to perform a multidisciplinary project at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. His training plan includes training in: 1) statistical methods for multivariate longitudinal analysis and predictive inference 2) the neuropsychiatric assessment of schizophrenia 3) longitudinal clinical research methodology with a focus on mobile technologies, and 4) the responsible conduct of research.  Even with appropriate care, relapse is common in early course psychosis and each episode is associated higher costs of care, poorer lifetime outcomes, and chronicity of the disease. There is a need to learn more about the personal factors associated with relapse for individual patients in order to improve risk predictions, ensure appropriate early interventions, and support coordinated specialty care services for schizophrenia. This study proposes that smartphones sensors eg (GPS, accelerometer), wearable devices like smartwatches collecting physiology, and smartphone based surveys and cognitive tests, when combined with appropriate statistical methods, can capture digital biomarkers, refereed to here as digital phenotypes, of early course psychosis that can offer personalized relapse prediction and augment population level risk factors.  This candidate's research plan seeks to: 1) propose digital phenotypes and relapse models of early course psychosis captured in an affordable and scalable manner from subject's personal smartphones as well as a wearable sensor in order to automatically collect self-report of symptoms, behaviors, cognition, and physiology 2) and evaluate the accuracy of digital phenotypes and the relapse prediction models.  This study proposes to address this hypothesis by utilizing smartphone based digital phenotyping methods, primarily through running the Beiwe app on subjects' own smartphones, to capture longitudinal data on symptoms, behaviors, cognition, and physiology across subjects' natural environments. These studies will be performed across 3.5 years in subjects with early course psychosis and range between 6 to 12 months.  The broader aim of this research is to understand the systems and processes, both personal and environmental, which contribute to relapse in early course psychosis. An understanding of the computational basis of relapse will inform better nosology, allow development of biomarkers of illness that may offer better targets for biological research, inform development of personalized interventions for psychotic illnesses, and help support early interventions for schizophrenia. Schizophrenia is a chronic and disabling disorder that is characterized by episodes of relapse, and  is thought to impact ~1.5% of the population.  Our current treatments and ability to predict  relapse early are limited by our understanding of the longitudinal course, environmental factors,  and variability of clinical presentation. This study seeks to model this complexity using  computational methods and digital phenotyping so that we may design more effective early  interventions for this disease.",Digital Phenotyping for Computational Models of Relapse Prediction in Early Course Psychosis,9898476,K23MH116130,"['Accelerometer', 'Address', 'Anxiety', 'Award', 'Awareness', 'Back', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Caregiver Burden', 'Caring', 'Cellular Phone', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Effectiveness', 'Emergency department visit', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Event', 'Feedback', 'Goals', 'Health Sciences', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Hospitalization', 'Human', 'Impaired cognition', 'In Situ', 'Individual', 'Interview', 'Israel', 'Learning', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical center', 'Medicine', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Moods', 'Nature', 'Outcome', 'Ownership', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Physical activity', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Process', 'Productivity', 'Prospective Studies', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Quality of life', 'Relapse', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Running', 'Schizophrenia', 'Science', 'Severity of illness', 'Sleep', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Treatment Cost', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'biological research', 'biomarker development', 'care costs', 'care systems', 'clinical heterogeneity', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinically relevant', 'cognitive testing', 'computational basis', 'cost effective', 'data modeling', 'design', 'digital', 'disease classification', 'economic cost', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'fitbit', 'functional disability', 'functional outcomes', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'individual patient', 'longitudinal analysis', 'longitudinal course', 'mHealth', 'machine learning method', 'medical specialties', 'mobile computing', 'multidisciplinary', 'neural circuit', 'neuropsychiatry', 'neurotoxic', 'open source', 'personalized intervention', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'primary outcome', 'relapse prediction', 'relapse risk', 'responsible research conduct', 'secondary outcome', 'sensor', 'severe mental illness', 'smart watch', 'social', 'tool', 'wearable device', 'wearable sensor technology']",NIMH,BETH ISRAEL DEACONESS MEDICAL CENTER,K23,2020,191000,0.015842669544742317
"Improving the Accuracy of ASCVD Risk Estimation Using Population-Level EHR and Genetic Data SUMMARY Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in the United States. Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASVD) is the primary mechanism for the development of CVD and is largely considered preventable by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention. Lipid-lowering therapy is the current mainstay of preventative treatment for ASCVD and guidelines for pharmacotherapy rely on the 2013 Pooled Cohort Equations (PCE) for estimating 10-year risk. While these equations have been validated at a population level they have significant shortcomings that impact real-world patient-level effectiveness. These include implementation (i.e. time and effort for clinicians to enter patient data into a phone or web-based calculator), therapy changing sensitivity to highly variable inputs (e.g single time point blood pressure), paradoxical risk estimation for some patient subgroups that are an artifact of linear modeling (e.g. women smokers), blunt treatment of race (i.e. separately derived equations for black patients), and poor calibration for modern cohorts (i.e. resulting in the overestimation of risk). This project will attempt to address these shortcomings. First, portable tools for analyzing electronic health records found within the Rhode Island Health Information Exchange (HIE) will be developed for the extraction of PCE risk factors to enable the automated calculation of ASCVD risk. PCE risk factor extraction permutations (e.g. last vs mean blood pressure) will be optimized and the equations will be calibrated for the population. Next, EHR-system agnostic tools for extracting additional risk factors available within the medical record including symptom development, social determinants of health, and family history will be developed. PCE and non-PCE risk factors will be used for artificial neural network and dynamic Bayesian network modeling of ASCVD risk phenotype clusters to augment PCE risk prediction. Finally, a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotype data derived ASCVD genetic risk score will be integrated with the HIE derived risk factors to demonstrate the potential clinical implications of implementing an omics-integrated learning healthcare system. The project will serve as foundational training for the principal investigator towards pursuing a career as a physician-scientist in the field of biomedical informatics. Hypothesis: Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk estimation is central to current lipid-lowering therapy guidelines. This project will test the hypothesis that population-level data-driven methods will improve the accuracy of risk calculators. Aim 1: Determine the Predictive Performance of PCE Risk Factors Derived from Longitudinal HIE Data Aim 2: Define Population-Based ASCVD Risk Phenotype Clusters Aim 3: Demonstrate HIE-Omics-Integrated Learning Healthcare System with Direct-to-Consumer Sequencing NARRATIVE Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are the leading cause of death and the most significant contributor to disability-adjusted life years in the United States. Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) is the primary mechanism for the development of CVD and ten-year risk estimation is the foundation of current lipid-lowering therapy guidelines.

"A comparison of firearm-related intimate partner homicide in Texas and Maryland: Prevalence, identification of those at risk, and the effect of firearm regulations Intimate partner homicide (IPH) accounts for one-fifth of U.S. homicides, with the majority of IPH and nearly all (91.6%) of intimate-partner related homicide-suicides (IPH-S) committed by firearms. While much is known about the frequency by which IPH is committed by firearms, research is far more limited regarding how victim/perpetrator firearm access, ownership, and behaviors affect IPH and IPH-S risk. We propose a case-control study in two states (Maryland and Texas) chosen to provide robust interstate firearm comparisons, as well as demographic, geographic and relevant law diversity. We will collect case file (medical examiner, police, prosecutor) and interview data to compare the histories of IPH victims (cases) to those of a random sample of individuals who experienced non-fatal physical IPV in the past two years (controls). The study will accomplish the following: (1) Obtain a count of firearm-related IPH and IPH-S across multiple subgroups through triangulation of data from multiple sources; (2) Describe the context of IPH and IPH-S, including precipitating events, relationship history, and perpetrator characteristics such as prior suicidality and prior substance abuse; (3) Assess the strength of firearm access, ownership, and/or use as risk factors for IPH and IPH-S, attending to intersections with risk factors at the family (e.g., abuse history), community (e.g., community violence), social and environmental levels (e.g., state firearm policies, accessibility of social services); (4) Identify differential patterns of risk between firearm-related and non-firearm related IPH, and between firearm-related IPH and IPH-S; (5) Examine patterns of gun ownership behaviors and attitudes in relation to IPH and IPH-S. We will create a database that will combine data across current data collection endeavors, creating a foundation for future funding. Findings will inform future evidence-based, multiple-level prevention interventions and allow policy makers and practitioners to develop and refine risk-informed approaches to reduce and prevent lethal IPV outcomes.

"Shape up! Kids Project Summary/Abstract Of all markers of pediatric health, the most intuitive is body shape. Human and animal studies indicate that weight loss/gain correlates closely with increasing/decreasing insulin sensitivity, respectively. Anthropometry and regional composition measures such as waist circumference, waist to hip ratio (WHR), and visceral adipose tissue area are better predictors of obesity-related diseases and mortality risk than pediatric body mass index Z-score. Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry can quantify regional adiposity in more detail than these measures but is underutilized for many reasons including the sensitivity to children to ionizing radiation, cost, and training. A study is needed to take advantage of rapid technological developments in optical technology to better describe phenotypes of pediatric body shape and its relation to metabolic risks (obesity, “failure to thrive”) and bone density and size. If successful, sophisticated obesity phenotype profiles could be constructed to clarify the underlying associations of body composition with disease, genetics, lifestyle exposures, metabolomics, and be highly assessable using self-assessment technology. The long term goal of the Shape Up! Kids Study is 1) to provide pediatric phenotype descriptors of health using body shape, and 2) to provide the tools to visualize and quantify body shape in research, clinical practice, and personal health assessment. Our overall approach is to first derive predictive models of how body shape relates to regional and total body composition (subcutaneous fat, visceral fat, muscle mass, lean mass, and percent fat) and bone mineral density (BMD) over a wide range of ages (5 to 18 years), weights and heights, stratified by sex, and ethnicity. Our central hypothesis is that optical estimates with shape classification of soft tissue composition and bone density better predict fracture and metabolic risk factors than anthropometry (WC, WHR, and BM) alone. The Investigators will highly leverage existing data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey and Bone Mineral Density in Children Study. Our specific aims are: 1) Identify the unique associations of body shape to body composition and bone density indices in a pediatric population that represents the variance found in the US population, 2) Describe the precision and accuracy of optical scans to monitor change in body composition, bone density, 3) Estimate the level of association of optical scans to common health indicators including metabolic risk factors. Our exploratory aim is to investigate holistic, high-resolution descriptors of 3D body shape as direct predictors of body composition and metabolic risk using statistical shape models and Latent Class Analysis. By the end of this study, we expect to have models of the shape and composition suitable for self-assessment technologies that are capable of representing over 95% of the shape variance in the US pediatric population, and to define how these models relate to important metabolic status indicators. The positive impact of these outcomes will be the immediate applicability to other researcher studies and clinicians using the automated tools and models developed here for 3D optical images. PROJECT NARRATIVE  The proposed research is relevant to public health because they have the potential to provide a better understanding of what children are at high risk of metabolic consequences of obesity. Thus, the advances proposed are expected to have a high impact to the health and wellbeing of all US citizens because metabolic diseases, such as obesity and its complications, are currently the number one killers of adults, and are becoming epidemic in children as well.

"Optical Body Composition and Health Assessment ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):1 Of all markers of human health, the most intuitive is body shape but based on quantitative evidence.  2 Anthropometry and regional composition measures such as waist circumference (WC), waist to hip ratio  3 (WHR), and visceral adipose tissue area (VAT) are better predictors of obesity-related diseases and mortality  4 risk than body mass index (BMI). Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) can quantify regional adiposity in  5 more detail than the above measures but is underutilized for many reasons including potential harm from  6 ionizing radiation, cost, and training. A study is needed to take advantage of rapid technological developments  7 in the ""quantified self movement"" to better describe phenotypes of body shape and its relation to metabolic  8 risks. The candidate developed in this proposal is 3D optical whole body scanning. If successful, sophisticated  9 obesity phenotype profiles could be constructed to clarify the underlying associations of body composition with 10 disease, genetics, lifestyle exposures, metabolomics, and be highly assessable using self-assessment 11 technology. Whole body 3D imaging technology is already so accessible that it can be done with video games 12 such as the Microsoft Xbox Kinect, and consumer cameras. 13 The long term goal of the Optical Body Shape and Health Assessment Study is 1) to provide phenotype 14 descriptors of health using body shape, and 2) to provide the tools to visualize and quantify body shape in 15 research, clinical practice, and personal health assessment. Our overall approach is to first derive predictive 16 models of how body shape relates to regional and total body composition (subcutaneous fat, visceral fat, 17 muscle mass, lean mass, and percent fat), and then show how our 3DO body composition estimates are 18 associated to important metabolic risk factors. Our central hypothesis is that 3DO measures of body 19 composition with shape classification better predict metabolic risk factors than anthropometry or DXA body 20 composition alone. Our specific aims are: 1. Identify the unique associations of body shape to body 21 composition indices in a population that represents the variance of sex, age, BMI, and ethnicity found 22 in the US population; 2. Describe the precision and accuracy of 3DO scans to monitor change in body 23 composition and metabolic health interventions; and 3. Estimate the level of association of 3DO to 24 common health indicators including metabolic risk factors by gender, race, age, and BMI. In an 25 exploratory aim, we investigate holistic, high-resolution descriptors of 3D body shape as direct 26 predictors of body composition and metabolic risk using statistical shape models and Latent Class 27 Analysis.

"Infrared Eyes(iREyes) Infrared Eyes Abstract Eden Medical, Inc. is pleased to resubmit this Phase 2 SBIR proposal to develop the “Infrared Eyes” (iREyes) imager system, an affordable and powerful mobile health (mHealth) tool for healthcare. The hand-held iREyes system will acquire both thermal and visible spectrum imagery to quantify healing via thermal indexing methodology. The iREyes will offer a user-friendly product with automated categorization. Diabetic foot wounds are common, complex and costly. Foot areas that are likely to ulcerate are associated with increased local skin temperature due to inflammation and enzymatic autolysis of tissue. Inflammation is characterized by the cardinal signs including redness, swelling, and heat. In addition to identifying inflammation associated with healing, the iREyes will also identify hot spots associated with repetitive stress to reduce ulceration and re-ulceration risk for people in diabetic foot remission. The iREyes will directly quantify inflammation pathophysiology implementing a powerful revised two-part strategy: wound healing via regional foot index analysis and ulcer reoccurrence risk through temperature asymmetry threshold analysis. The combined thermal indexing for healing existing wounds and asymmetry predictive analysis represents a significant breakthrough over current practice.

"Optimizing prediction of preschool psychopathology from brain: behavior markers of emotion dysregulation from birth: A computational, developmental cognitive neuroscience approach PROJECT SUMMARY: Internalizing/externalizing psychopathologies are identifiable by age 3, with neurodevelopmental risk markers evident in infants. Despite powerful implications for prevention, clinical impact has been minimal. We use innovative computational and epidemiologic data science methods to accelerate clinical translation of neurodevelopmental discovery during infancy towards generalizable risk prediction for preschool psychopathology. Our main objective is generating a pragmatic clinical risk calculator for public health use, the Mental Health Risk Calculator for Young Children (MHRiskCalc-YC). To achieve necessary power and precision, we create the Mental Health, Earlier Synthetic Cohort (MHESC), pooling multiple extramural cohorts at Washington University and Northwestern University to form the first clinically- enriched “synthetic” neuroimaging cohort for generation of neurodevelopmentally-based clinical risk algorithms (N=1,020, followed from birth-54 mos.). To maximize the risk calculator's clinical and research utility and cost effectiveness, we will generate a series of risk algorithms tailored to envisioned end-users, incorporating input from clinical stakeholders. Algorithms will also establish added value of pre-postnatal environmental factors in risk prediction, a crucial but understudied RDoC element. Aim 1 optimizes clinical feasibility and cost effectiveness by generating an MHRiskCalc-YC algorithm derived solely from commonly used survey data to optimize feasibility for future use in primary care settings. Aim 2 optimizes precision of prediction by establishing statistical and clinical incremental utility of more intensive assessment for future use in mental health specialty settings. This algorithm sequentially tests the added predictive value of methods of intermediate-high intensity (from direct assessments to EEG to MRI) for most precise, least burdensome risk prediction. The Aim 3 algorithm is optimized for future clinical research use in neurodevelopmental consortia, modeling the added value of MRI data to the Aim 1 algorithm. This mirrors “common” protocols of neuroimaging consortia and will also generate an empirically-derived best practices guide for consortia to optimize timing/ number of neuroimaging assessments. External validity will be established in the Baby Connectome Project (BCP). The MHESC capitalizes on an unprecedented, time-sensitive opportunity to accelerate scientific and clinical impact of multiple extramural activities that have been extensively pre-aligned. The public health impact of an infancy-based clinical risk prediction tool for preschool psychopathology has transformative potential for altering standard of care in early identification and prevention of mental disorders. PROJECT NARRATIVE: Mental disorders are often early-onset chronic diseases, with brain and behavioral risk markers of common internalizing/externalizing problems evident in infancy. To accelerate translation, we will use multi-method imaging, behavioral and data science innovations to generate an infant mental health risk calculator for pragmatic public health use, derived from a clinically enriched “Mental Health Earlier-Synthetic Cohort” of 1,020 infants using established study samples (characterized from birth-54 months). Clinical prediction algorithms will deliver broadly useful tools for earlier prediction and prevention of mental disorder and parameters to inform when imaging methods will be most informative in large-scale neurodevelopmental studies.","Optimizing prediction of preschool psychopathology from brain: behavior markers of emotion dysregulation from birth: A computational, developmental cognitive neuroscience approach",10056737,R01MH121877,"['Age', 'Algorithms', 'Assessment tool', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Child', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognitive', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Electroencephalography', 'Elements', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemiology', 'Extramural Activities', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Height', 'Infant', 'Interview', 'Longevity', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neuronal Plasticity', 'Nursery Schools', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Predictive Value', 'Prevention', 'Primary Health Care', 'Properdin', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychopathology', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Marker', 'Sampling Studies', 'Science', 'Series', 'Site', 'Standardization', 'Survey Methodology', 'Surveys', 'Testing', 'Time', 'To specify', 'Translations', 'Uncertainty', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Washington', 'affective neuroscience', 'base', 'brain behavior', 'clinical risk', 'clinical translation', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'cohort', 'connectome', 'cost effectiveness', 'deep learning', 'early childhood', 'early onset', 'emotion dysregulation', 'epidemiologic data', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'infancy', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'medical specialties', 'mental disorder prevention', 'multidisciplinary', 'multimodality', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural correlate', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuroimaging', 'postnatal', 'prediction algorithm', 'primary care setting', 'protective factors', 'relating to nervous system', 'sound', 'standard of care', 'tool', 'visual tracking']",NIMH,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R01,2020,1858980,-0.004448700972731906
"Multi-Parametric Spatial Assessment of Bone with HR-pQCT ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Osteoporosis is a skeletal disorder characterized by compromised bone strength predisposing a person to an increased risk of fracture. In the U.S. today, 10 million individuals are estimated to already have the disease and almost 34 million more are estimated to have low bone density, placing them at increased risk for osteoporosis and broken bones. Currently, determination of fracture risk, aging effects, and therapeutic efficacy is primarily based on bone mineral density (BMD) measured by areal or volumetric X-ray-based imaging techniques. BMD can predict bone strength and fracture risk to some extent, however, studies have shown that BMD only explains about 70%-75% of the variance in strength, while the remaining variance has been attributed to the cumulative and synergistic effect of other factors such as bone structure, topology, geometry, tissue composition, microdamage, and biomechanical factors. High-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography (HR-pQCT) is a noninvasive in-vivo imaging technique which depicts many of these features, including density, geometry, structure, topology, and mechanics of cortical and trabecular bone in the distal radius and distal tibia. To date HR-pQCT imagery has been analyzed using conventional quantitative approaches that average bone features over large regions of interest. The individual quantification of average bone features (uni-parametric) or their statistical combination (multi-parametric) disregard how these three-dimensional (3D) features synergistically contribute to bone strength. As a result the traditional methods fail to capture the spatial patterning of the effect being studied, which is key to understanding the underlying biology. Bone is a 3D organ experiencing constant adaptation through remodeling, and should therefore be analyzed with 3D techniques that reflect the complementary and interdependent nature of different bone features. Statistical parametric mapping (SPM) is a technique that enables 3D spatial comparisons of multi-parametric maps between groups of subjects. Instead of measuring summary properties for arbitrary or subjective volumes of interest, this data-driven process identifies regions significantly associated with a variable of interest through valid statistical tests, thus generating 3D statistical and P-value maps that facilitate the visualization and consequently the interpretation of comparisons between target populations. The ultimate goal of this proposal is to establish a framework to automatically identify relevant bone sub-regions and features in specific populations for the targeted quantitative assessment of the spatial distribution and prediction of bone strength using HR-pQCT. For this purpose, specialized SPM techniques have been developed for HR-pQCT. To evaluate the potential of SPM in clinical science, we propose to apply SPM to image data from three existing in-vivo HR-pQCT studies investigating: a) regional variations in bone structure related to gender and age; b) differences due to fracture of the forearm; and c) longitudinal effects of two osteoporosis treatments.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  We propose a population-based framework to automatically identify relevant bone sub-regions and features in specific populations for the targeted quantitative assessment of the spatial distribution and prediction of bone strength using HR-pQCT. To demonstrate the potential of this framework in clinical science, we apply it to existing HR-pQCT studies to identify bone sub-regions and features significantly associated with age, gender, fracture status and response to osteoporosis treatment in post menopausal women; identify spatial associations between the central and distal skeleton with respect to treatment response; and improve fracture discrimination, and the prediction and understanding of the effects of osteoporosis treatment. This framework could improve the development of innovative, more active and safer drugs and therapies, and directly benefit patients suffering osteoporosis and other bone disorders since based on HR-pQCT maps of parameters estimating bone density and quality, a treatment offering the most clinical benefits to them could be prescribed.            ",Multi-Parametric Spatial Assessment of Bone with HR-pQCT,9911975,R01AR068456,"['3-Dimensional', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Biology', 'Biomechanics', 'Bone Density', 'Bone Diseases', 'Bone structure', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Distal', 'Elderly', 'Etiology', 'Exercise', 'Forearm Fracture', 'Fracture', 'Gender', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Hip region structure', 'Hormonal', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Information Distribution', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Nature', 'Organ', 'Osteoporosis', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Peripheral', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Population', 'Postmenopause', 'Process', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Radial', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Role', 'Screening procedure', 'Skeleton', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Target Populations', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Variant', 'Vertebral column', 'Visualization', 'Woman', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'age effect', 'base', 'bone', 'bone quality', 'bone strength', 'cortical bone', 'cost', 'density', 'experience', 'fracture risk', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'in vivo imaging', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'osteoporosis with pathological fracture', 'patient response', 'population based', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'skeletal', 'skeletal disorder', 'spatial relationship', 'substantia spongiosa', 'tibia', 'treatment response']",NIAMS,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,R01,2020,276227,0.0016970178473665917
"Indiana University clinical Center for acute pancreatitis and diabetes clinical research network PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Pancreatogenic diabetes, or type 3c diabetes (T3cDM), is a known complication of acute pancreatitis (AP). Recent data suggest that T3cDM occurs more commonly than previously recognized and exhibits a spectrum of defects including features that overlap aspects of both type 1 and type 2 diabetes. At present, the extent to which immune activation, β cell dysfunction, and insulin resistance occur following AP and the genetic, metabolic and imaging correlates of these phenotypes have not been characterized. To address these knowledge gaps, we have assembled a multidisciplinary team with expertise in pancreatitis and exocrine pathophysiology, diabetes, β cell biology, diabetes genetics, and pancreatic imaging at the Indiana University School of Medicine. The IU Clinical Center will work with other members of the Type 1 Diabetes in Acute Pancreatitis Consortium to test the hypothesis that T3cDM encompasses a heterogeneous combination of metabolic and potentially immunologic phenotypes that are determined by distinct underlying pathophysiologies. We propose the following specific aims (SA) to meet the goals of this RFA. SA #1: To perform an observational study of robustly characterized adults with AP in order to address knowledge gaps in the natural history and incidence of autoantibody-positive diabetes (AAb+), impaired glucose tolerance (IGT)/impaired fasting glucose (IFG), and diabetes occurring subsequent to AP. Enrolled participants will be longitudinally characterized with emphasis on identifying genetic, immunological, metabolic, and clinical risk factors for the development of AAb+, IGT/IFG, or T3cDM. We will use state-of-the-art immunologic phenotyping and measurements of pancreatic β cell function to define the physiologic basis for metabolic dysregulation in T3cDM after AP. In tandem, a biorepository will be developed for undertaking translational, mechanistic and biomarker investigations and ancillary studies. SA#2: The Imaging Morphology of Pancreas in Diabetic Patients following Acute Pancreatitis (IMMINENT) study aims to utilize novel quantitative magnetic resonance imaging techniques as a non-invasive biomarker to identify patients at risk for the development of post-AP T3cDM. This longitudinal study will evaluate pancreatic parenchymal morphologic and pathophysiologic changes following AP in AAb+, euglycemic, IGT and DM individuals. Imaging phenotypes will be correlated with the metabolic, genetic and immunological phenotypes established in SA#1. SA#3: To perform a nested case control study using state-of-the-art techniques to define the underlying pathophysiology of endocrine and exocrine function in the subgroup of AAb+ individuals with AP-associated metabolic dysfunction relative to those who remain normoglycemic. We will undertake detailed metabolic phenotyping to evaluate islet cell responses (i.e. β and alpha cell function) in parallel with arginine-augmented hyperglycemic clamp methodology to measure functional β cell mass, and endoscopic assessment to define the relationship between impaired exocrine and endocrine function in AAb+ T3cDM. We will utilize 25 individuals with AAb+ and IGT or T3cDM and compare findings to results in 25 normoglycemic individuals with negative autoantibodies from SA#1. PROJECT NARRATIVE While diabetes is a known complication of acute pancreatitis (AP), a full understanding of the underlying etiology of this disorder is lacking. To address this gap in knowledge, we have assembled a multidisciplinary team at Indiana University, with expertise in exocrine pancreas pathophysiology, diabetes, β cell biology, genetics, and pancreatic imaging. As part of the newly formed Type 1 Diabetes in Acute Pancreatitis Consortium, members of the Indiana University Clinical Center will collaborate with other consortium members to undertake studies focused on the comprehensive clinical, epidemiological, biological and imaging characterization of diabetes occurring after AP.",Indiana University clinical Center for acute pancreatitis and diabetes clinical research network,10127104,U01DK127382,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Alpha Cell', 'Ancillary Study', 'Arginine', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Autoantibodies', 'Autoimmunity', 'Beta Cell', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Cell Death', 'Cell physiology', 'Cellular Stress', 'Cellular biology', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Closure by clamp', 'Complication', 'Data', 'Defect', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diabetes autoantibodies', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Duodenum', 'Endocrine', 'Enrollment', 'Epidemiology', 'Etiology', 'Evolution', 'Exhibits', 'Exocrine pancreas', 'Exocrine pancreatic insufficiency', 'Extracellular Matrix', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Functional disorder', 'Genetic', 'Genomic DNA', 'Glucagon', 'Glucose', 'Glucose Intolerance', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hyperglycemia', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Immune', 'Immunologics', 'Impaired fasting glycaemia', 'Impairment', 'Incidence', 'Indiana', 'Individual', 'Infiltration', 'Insulin', 'Insulin Resistance', 'Insulin deficiency', 'Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Investigation', 'Islet Cell', 'Knowledge', 'Liquid substance', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Elastography', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic dysfunction', 'Methodology', 'Monitor', 'Morphology', 'Motion', 'Natural History', 'Nested Case-Control Study', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'OGTT', 'Observational Study', 'Pancreas', 'Pancreatic Function Tests', 'Pancreatitis', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Perfusion', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Plasma', 'Population', 'Relaxation', 'Reporting', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk Marker', 'Secretin', 'Signal Transduction', 'Structure of beta Cell of islet', 'Subgroup', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Universities', 'Urine', 'Work', 'acute pancreatitis', 'biobank', 'biomarker development', 'clinical center', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinical risk', 'contrast enhanced', 'diabetes mellitus genetics', 'diabetic patient', 'endocrine pancreas development', 'extracellular', 'genetic analysis', 'glucose tolerance', 'immune activation', 'impaired glucose tolerance', 'insulin secretion', 'insulin sensitivity', 'islet', 'medical schools', 'member', 'metabolic imaging', 'metabolic phenotype', 'multidisciplinary', 'non-diabetic', 'novel', 'pancreas imaging', 'polygenic risk score', 'prospective', 'radiomics', 'repository', 'response']",NIDDK,INDIANA UNIV-PURDUE UNIV AT INDIANAPOLIS,U01,2020,278416,-0.022662437871010337
"Refining and Validating Borderline Personality Disorder Phenotypes Through Factor Mixture Modeling The proposed research seeks to clarify the symptomatic heterogeneity of borderline personality disorder (BPD) by examining BPD phenotypes through advanced latent variable modeling. A second, innovative aim is to validate these findings through intensive longitudinal assessment in daily life. BPD is associated with high rates of emergency room visits and costly healthcare service utilization, affecting 10-20% of psychiatric outpatients and 20-40% of psychiatric inpatients. BPD also contributes to impaired social and occupational functioning and significant suicide risk, with 1 in 10 individuals with BPD completing suicide. Recent research has aimed to enhance treatment effectiveness for BPD by identifying prototypical patterns of symptom manifestation that may suggest ideographic treatment targets. However, no research has simultaneously included: a) a sufficiently large patient sample; b) ecologically sound validation of results; and c) use of appropriate statistical techniques. The proposed project builds on this research through two aims. Aim 1: Utilize a model comparison approach to identify BPD phenotypes in a large psychiatric outpatient sample assessed via semi-structured diagnostic interviews (Study 1). Aim 2: Validate the results of Study 1 by applying phenotype classification algorithms produced in Study 1 to a smaller sample of patients who have completed 21 days of momentary surveys on symptoms and clinical outcomes (Study 2). To address Aim 1, factor mixture modeling (FMM)—a novel, flexible, and integrative latent variable modeling approach—will be compared to standard factor analysis and latent class analysis in order to evaluate the dimensional and categorical structure of BPD. We expect a single-factor, multi-class FMM will best explain heterogeneity in BPD, over and above other sources of heterogeneity (e.g., gender, comorbidity). To address Aim 2, we will use a prototype-matching approach to algorithmically assign patients in the validation sample to phenotypes identified in Aim 1 and determine their predictive validity in terms of daily clinical outcomes. Results of this project will provide empirically grounded personalized prediction tools for BPD intervention and treatment development, in line with the NIMH’s goal of “developing, testing, and refining tools and methodologies… for personalized risk and trajectory prediction and intervention.” This fellowship will allow the applicant to receive tailored consultation from experts in methodology, data analysis, and BPD theory and assessment, as well as advanced statistical training and grantsmanship courses and workshops. This training will be enhanced by the resource-rich environment and explicit support of student research and funding provided by the Pennsylvania State University, as well as the support of Dr. Kenneth Levy and his lab. This promising young researcher will gain training in computational modeling, proficiency in working with “big data,” increased understanding of conceptual and nosological models of BPD, and further skills in disseminating research findings through publication and presentation, as vital steps towards an independent research career in translational clinical science.

"Dementia Risk Prediction Pooling Project PROJECT SUMMARY  Alzheimer's Disease and related dementias (ADRD) are a major public health problem which is increasing worldwide. Currently, over 5.8 million Americans are living with Alzheimer's or other dementias and as our population continues to age this number will increase to over 13.8 million by 2050. Great strides are being made in targeted therapies which may be able to reduce the risk for dementia. However, identifying which patients should receive these prevention interventions is currently unknown and has been identified by NINDS and experts in the field as a critical area of research. Research done by our group and others has demonstrated that risk factor levels as early in life as the 20's influence an individual's future risk for dementia. Early intervention to prevent the accumulation of risk and targeted interventions for those at high risk could help to reduce dementia risk. Risk prediction methods can be used to accurately predict who is at high risk for developing dementia and target interventions; however, current risk prediction models for dementia have several critical limitations and none have taken into account longitudinal risk factor trajectories, a critical step to implementing precision prevention approaches to identify individuals at high risk for dementia.  In this study we propose to develop the Dementia Risk Pooling Project (DRPP) by pooling and rigorously harmonizing 12 prospective observational cohorts of middle and older age adults, multiple in-person assessments of clinical, genetic and behavioral risk factors, follow-up of greater than 10 years and adjudicated dementia ascertainment. The DRPP will be completed and made available to researchers via a cloud-based computing platform as part of the R61 phase of this proposal meeting specific Go/No-Go Criteria outlined in the grant. Then, within the R33 phase of this project we will use the DRPP to develop and validate an accurate and personalized, dynamic dementia risk prediction model which incorporates longitudinal risk factor measurements and easily updates as new measurements are accrued. This tool can be used clinically to guide treatment decisions and will be made available to clinicians. The aims of this project are important and timely, they will provide a risk stratification tool for targeted intervention/prevention for high risk individuals. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Alzheimer's Disease and related dementias (ADRD) are a major public health problem.

"Predicting the Risk of Severe Hypoglycemic and Hyperglycemic Events in Adults with Diabetes PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Dr. McCoy is an endocrinologist and primary care physician specializing in the care for patients with diabetes and other chronic health conditions. Her long-term goal is to become an independent researcher and leader in evaluating, improving, and individualizing diabetes care through effective use of big data completed by qualitative insights from patients and those involved in their care. The short-term training goals of this proposal are to acquire: 1) proficiency in statistics and data science; 2) experience in qualitative research; 3) skills in clinical trial design; and 4) communication and leadership skills to lead multi-disciplinary research. The proposal's research will be conducted at Mayo Clinic, which has a strong history of training physician scientists and a well-developed infrastructure for education and research. Dr. McCoy has access to an ideal set of data assets, the OptumLabs Data Warehouse and the Kaiser Permanente Northern California Diabetes Registry, and the support of an exceptional team of mentors and advisors who are national leaders in diabetes outcomes and health care delivery research, shared decision-making, qualitative research, and data science. Optimization of glycemic control, while avoiding severe hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia, is the cornerstone of diabetes management. Severe hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia are often preventable, yet continue to incur substantial morbidity, psychological distress, impaired quality of life, and economic burden. There are no validated tools to predict these events and as a result clinicians lack a practical and reliable means to identify high risk patients. The goal of Dr. McCoy's work is to address this critical gap in diabetes management. In Aim 1, she will use large database analysis and novel analytic methods to characterize the patterns of severe hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia among adults with diabetes in the U.S. In Aim 2, she will build on Aim 1 to develop and validate computationally efficient concurrent risk prediction models for severe hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia that could be used in clinical encounters. In Aim 3, she will directly engage patients and their clinicians in conversation about severe hypoglycemia /hyperglycemia risk in order to better understand how information about severe hypoglycemia/ hyperglycemia risk is perceived, interpreted, and used. These studies will serve as foundation for two R01 applications to be submitted during Years 4 and 5, and will advance the science and practice of personalized diabetes care through integration of data science and qualitative methods for the purpose of understanding, predicting, and ultimately preventing severe hypoglycemic/hyperglycemic events. Dr. McCoy has a proven track record of scientific productivity and innovation, and a strong foundation in using secondary data for health services and outcomes research in diabetes. In summary, the training, mentoring, and research proposed here are essential for Dr. McCoy's career development as she develops research independence and expertise in the crucial interface between patients and their clinical teams, evidence-based medicine, and big data. PROJECT NARRATIVE Severe hypoglycemic and hyperglycemic events in the management of diabetes mellitus continue to incur high morbidity, psychological distress, and economic costs; yet, these events may be prevented with individualization of treatment goals and regimens if high risk patients are identified prospectively. The proposed research will leverage big data analytics and qualitative research to 1) characterize the epidemiology of severe hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia in the U.S.; 2) develop and validate concurrent risk prediction models for severe hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia; and 3) enrich the understanding of severe hypoglycemia/ hyperglycemia risk and risk model utilization through qualitative patient and clinician engagement.",Predicting the Risk of Severe Hypoglycemic and Hyperglycemic Events in Adults with Diabetes,9983016,K23DK114497,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Big Data', 'Big Data Methods', 'Calibration', 'California', 'Caring', 'Chronic', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Communication', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Discrimination', 'Economic Burden', 'Endocrinologist', 'Epidemiology', 'Event', 'Evidence Based Medicine', 'Face', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hospitalization', 'Hyperglycemia', 'Hypoglycemia', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Interview', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Learning', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Outcomes and Health Services Research', 'Patient Care', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physicians', 'Primary Care Physician', 'Productivity', 'Qualitative Methods', 'Qualitative Research', 'Quality of life', 'Recording of previous events', 'Regimen', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Proposals', 'Research Training', 'Risk', 'Risk Estimate', 'Risk Factors', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Self Care', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Protocols', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical care', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical encounter', 'data integration', 'data registry', 'data warehouse', 'diabetes management', 'disease phenotype', 'economic cost', 'education research', 'experience', 'glycemic control', 'health care delivery', 'health data', 'high risk', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'individualized medicine', 'innovation', 'insight', 'large datasets', 'machine learning algorithm', 'member', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'patient oriented', 'point of care', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'psychologic', 'psychological distress', 'risk prediction model', 'shared decision making', 'skills', 'social', 'statistics', 'support tools', 'tool']",NIDDK,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,K23,2020,169005,-0.007077362319150515
"Epigenetic Age Measures to Predict COVID-19 Symptom Progression and Severity PROJECT SUMMARY  The risk of fatality and/or severe complications due to COVID-19 infection is strongly age dependent. Data from the CDC suggests that those ages 85 and older have predicted mortality rates that is 100-fold higher than for those under the age of 50 and currently, 8 out of 10 COVID-19 deaths in the United States were in adults age 65 or older. While the exact etiology underlying this age disparity is unknown, evidence suggests that vulnerability may be due to changes that occur as a function of the aging process. This is further evidenced by the pattern of increased vulnerability among persons with pre-existing diseases of aging—cardiovascular disease, diabetes, COPD, chronic kidney disease, liver disease—suggesting that it isn't just chronological age that determines risk, but rather, biological age.  In recent years, our group has helped develop some of the most robust biomarkers available, namely the epigenetic clocks. These measures estimate biological age in a sample based on DNA methylation levels at hundreds to thousands of CpG sites across the genome. Not only do epigenetic clocks track with age in diverse tissues and cell types, but discrepancies between epigenetic age and actual age have also been shown to predict risk of mortality and incidence of major chronic disease, including those which appear to be major risk factors for COVID-19. However, in order for these measures to be informative for assessing COVID-19 risk clinically, or in the general population, 1) they need to be re-optimized to capture the aspects of biological aging specific to COVID-19 susceptibility, and 2) advances in technology need to be made to ensure lower costs and rapid turnaround.  This proposal aims to build on our team's multidisciplinary strengths to develop and validate a targeted, lab-developed, readily-available test to predict COVID-19 symptomology and mortality risk. If successful, this test will have widespread applications—from informing triage and treatment decisions in the clinic, to guiding social and pollical decisions when it comes to lifting “stay-at-home” orders for certain individuals. PROJECT NARRATIVE The risks associated with COVID-19 infection are highly age and health dependent, suggesting that biological aging may be a major determinant for symptom severity and mortality risk. Based on our previous work in developing biomarkers of aging, we propose to develop and validate a novel, rapid, and affordable COVID-19 test to predict long-term response to infection, based on DNA methylation.",Epigenetic Age Measures to Predict COVID-19 Symptom Progression and Severity,10158592,R00AG052604,"['Admission activity', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Alleles', 'Biological', 'Biological Aging', 'Biological Markers', 'COVID-19', 'COVID-19 pandemic', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cells', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic Disease', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Chronology', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'DNA Methylation', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Ensure', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Etiology', 'Future', 'General Population', 'Genome', 'Geroscience', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Heart Diseases', 'High Prevalence', 'Home environment', 'Hybrids', 'Hypertension', 'Immunocompetence', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Infection', 'Lifting', 'Liver diseases', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'Molecular', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Nature', 'Organism', 'Pathogenicity', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Population Research', 'Predisposition', 'Process', 'Proxy', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk stratification', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Severities', 'Site', 'Speed', 'Support System', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Triage', 'United States', 'Ventilator', 'Virus', 'Virus Diseases', 'Work', 'age related', 'base', 'bisulfite', 'cell type', 'clinical application', 'clinical risk', 'coronavirus disease', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'genome-wide', 'human very old age (85+)', 'molecular marker', 'mortality', 'mortality risk', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'older patient', 'predictive marker', 'preservation', 'resilience', 'response', 'social', 'transmission process', 'trend']",NIA,YALE UNIVERSITY,R00,2020,139448,-0.0084251153663118
"Impact of Cognition on Balance and Gait Markers for FXTAS Abstract:  The primary objective of this K01 application is to provide research training and mentorship to the candidate to enable her to become an independent medical rehabilitation researcher. The candidate has clinical experience in Physical Therapy and doctoral training in basic neurobiology and is transitioning to a new clinical research area investigating balance and gait in a neurodegenerative disorder called Fragile X Tremor and Ataxia Syndrome (FXTAS) which occurs in some premutation (PM) carriers of the Fragile X (FMR1) gene. The short term goals are to develop an early detection model for FXTAS and identify additional molecular risk factors for developing this disorder. The plan has 3 aims: 1) To identify quantitative markers of balance and gait impairments in PM carriers with and without FXTAS, 2) To determine the impact of executive function and cognitive interference on balance and gait function in PM carriers with and without FXTAS, and 3) to determine the relationship between age, sex, executive function, and FMR1 molecular variables and the presence and severity of balance and gait impairment in PM carriers with and without FXTAS. The candidate’s long term scientific goal is to become a leading independent research scientist in movement neuroscience and neurological disorders and in the precise identification of balance and gait dysfunction in FXTAS from the earliest stage. In order to reach these goals the candidate needs to develop expertise in patient outcomes and neuroepidemiology research. The candidate’s short term goals which form the basis for this five year K development plan include training in 1) large scale subject recruitment, data management and advanced biostatistics, 2) balance and gait analysis and application to clinical trials in movement disorders, 3) design, implementation and analysis of large scale epidemiological studies and 4) introduction to rehabilitation intervention and clinical trial research methodology. Results of this research will help clarify neurological mechanisms underlying balance and gait deficits in FXTAS, establish reliable and quantitative outcomes measures of motor impairment, and provide data for future clinical rehabilitation trials. This research will be the first step in characterizing the longitudinal history of motor dysfunction in FXTAS from its earliest stages, thus paving the way for establishing disease monitoring and modifying strategies in premutation carriers. This proposal is relevant to the NIH Research Plan on FXS and Associated Disorders which includes the following goals: 2.2 validation of quantitative instruments to detect early clinical signs of FXTAS and its progression, 2.3 identification of molecular and clinical risk factors in individuals associated with penetrance of FXTAS, and 2.5 defining genotype, including FMR1 molecular factors, and clinical phenotype relationships in FXTAS. Over one million people in the US carry a premutation expansion in the Fragile X gene. A significant portion of these individuals will experience debilitating symptoms of a neurodegenerative disorder known as fragile X- associated tremor ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) including balance deficits, falls and progressive disability. This proposal addresses a critical need to identify early indicators of FXTAS onset in order to provide earlier intervention, including preventative and rehabilitative treatments, to delay disease progression, reduce the morbidity associated with falls and functional disability, and improve quality of life. This research will also provide quantitative outcome measures that may be used in future clinical trials.",Impact of Cognition on Balance and Gait Markers for FXTAS,9963329,K01HD088762,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alleles', 'Area', 'Biometry', 'CGG repeat', 'CGG repeat expansion', 'Cerebellar Ataxia', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Counseling', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Defect', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Elderly', 'Equilibrium', 'Executive Dysfunction', 'FXTAS', 'Family', 'Fragile X Gene', 'Fragile X Syndrome', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Gait', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Trial', 'Length', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Mental Retardation', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Movement Disorders', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neuroepidemiology', 'Neurologic', 'Neurosciences', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Penetrance', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Physical therapy', 'Posture', 'Predictive Factor', 'Quality of life', 'Recording of previous events', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk Marker', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Severities', 'Statistical Models', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Tremor', 'Tremor/Ataxia Syndrome', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Walking', 'Woman', 'X Chromosome', 'base', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinical risk', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive task', 'computerized', 'data management', 'design', 'disability', 'disabling symptom', 'epidemiology study', 'executive function', 'experience', 'falls', 'functional disability', 'gait examination', 'improved', 'instrument', 'male', 'men', 'motor disorder', 'motor impairment', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'recruit', 'sensor', 'sex']",NICHD,RUSH UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,K01,2020,128408,0.010003034491225846
"A Cognitive Risk Calculator and Screening tool for Primary Care Settings PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The number of people with Alzheimer’s disease is expected to exceed 88 million by 2050. Early detection of Alzheimer’s disease and related disorders symptoms are imperative for efforts to develop disease modifying therapies or interventions, and are important for optimal patient care. The objective of this proposal is to provide an accurate, feasible, and low-cost process to facilitate cognitive screening in population health. The aims of the R61 project are to develop and validate two complementary, automated tools to identify and screen patients at high risk for cognitive decline. The first is a risk calculator that uses routine clinical data to estimate patients’ risk for cognitive decline. Patients 60 years and older will undergo formal cognitive testing, and five prior years of routinely-collected electronic health record data will be used to model cognitive status. The Cognitive Risk Calculator will be validated in two historical samples and integrated into the electronic medical record to help providers identify vulnerable patients. The second tool is a validated iPad-based screening tool, the Brief Assessment of Cognitive Health (BACH) that patients can complete independently before, during, or after their doctor appointment. Patients will complete the BACH, the Montreal Cognitive Assessment Test (a paper-and-pencil screening tool), and formal neuropsychological testing at two time points. We hypothesize the BACH will be more sensitive to cognitive change over time than the established screening tool. The BACH is already integrated into the Epic electronic medical record platform; cognitive score and screening results for depression, stress, and sleep disruption are automatically recorded in the patient’s medical record for providers to document and act upon. The R33 project is a Phase IV pragmatic clinical trial to gauge the uptake and utility of these tools in primary care practices. Six internal medicine clinics will be randomized over time to the active study arm (Risk Calculator and BACH). This will permit comparisons of standard of care screening practices with screening activities following introduction of the Cognitive Risk Calculator and BACH. We will use a mixed-methods approach to determine optimal implementation strategies across a variety of practice models. Impact: The EHR risk-calculator and BACH have the capacity to improve detection of cognitive decline on a population health scale. The project also examines how regional differences in socioeconomic advantage relate to health disparities measured in terms of cognitive risk as well as screening attitudes and behaviors on the part of both providers and patients. PROJECT NARRATIVE Population health protocols lack efficient and effective methods to screen cognitive health.

"The initial care of younger adults with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes PROJECT SUMMARY Dr. Anjali Gopalan, MD, MSHP is a board-certified Internist at the Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC) Oakland Medical Center and a Research Scientist I (equivalent to Assistant Professor) at the KPNC Division of Research (DOR). With the proposed K23 mentored career development award, Dr. Gopalan will gain the advanced training and expertise necessary to become an independent investigator who can develop and implement tailored interventions for patients with early-onset type 2 diabetes (EOT2D). By focusing on adults with EOT2D, she seeks to address the comparatively poor micro- and macrovascular outcomes in this population that may result partly from inadequate management of hyperglycemia and other cardiovascular disease risk factors. Dr. Gopalan’s research premise posits that it is particularly critical for newly diagnosed patients with EOT2D to achieve early disease control, since tighter glycemic control during the year following diagnosis confers long-lasting micro- and macrovascular benefits. In support of the premise, the Research Aims of this K23 are to: 1) use electronic health record [EHR] data to identify EOT2D patient subgroups at highest risk of inadequate early disease control, 2) identify barriers to and facilitators of initial EOT2D management, and 3) examine prospective associations between patient-reported factors (e.g., disease-related distress, health literacy) and inadequate early disease control. The proposed research will be supported by experienced mentors and advisors, as well as advanced training in the following areas: 1) the use of advanced statistical modeling, 2) qualitative data analysis to inform intervention development, 3) the role of social determinants in health, and 4) implementation science. KPNC and DOR are ideal environments for the proposed work. KPNC is an integrated learning healthcare delivery system with a diverse membership of 4.2 million people (>350,000 with diabetes). DOR has a long track record of effectively training early stage investigators and has well-established internal research programs and collaborative relationships with nearby institutions that provide the infrastructure needed for career development. This environment, along with the proposed Research and Training Plans and an outstanding mentorship team, will enable Dr. Gopalan to continue to build the skills and generate the foundational data needed to submit an R01-level proposal during the final years of the proposed award period. In this planned R01, Dr. Gopalan will refine and implement an intervention (with a design based on the results of the three K23 Research Aims) to improve early care for newly diagnosed EOT2D patients and evaluate its impact on early outcomes in this growing, high-risk population. In summary, the proposed K23 award will support the career development of Dr. Gopalan and is vital to her acquiring the skill set and expertise required to become a successful, independent investigator. PROJECT NARRATIVE Adults diagnosed with type 2 diabetes at a younger age have higher rates of complications than those diagnosed later in life. Given the lasting benefit conferred by early disease control, the initial care provided to this growing, high-risk population is particularly crucial. With this proposed career development award, Dr. Gopalan will acquire the research skills necessary to identify patients at highest risk for inadequate early disease control, define barriers to initial disease management, and develop an intervention designed to improve the care of adults (ages 21-44) with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes.",The initial care of younger adults with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes,10001486,K23DK116968,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Area', 'Award', 'California', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Complications of Diabetes Mellitus', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Reporting', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Distress', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Face', 'Familiarity', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Sciences', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hyperglycemia', 'Hyperlipidemia', 'Hypertension', 'Infrastructure', 'Institution', 'Integrated Health Care Systems', 'Internist', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Latino', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical center', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pharmacy facility', 'Population', 'Population Characteristics', 'Provider', 'Qualitative Research', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Resources', 'Retrospective cohort', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk Management', 'Risk Reduction', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Smoke', 'Statistical Models', 'Stress', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Trees', 'United Kingdom', 'Work', 'barrier to care', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'career', 'career development', 'cohort', 'comparative', 'design', 'diabetes education', 'diabetes management', 'disorder control', 'eHealth', 'early onset', 'ethnic diversity', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'glycemic control', 'health care delivery', 'health literacy', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'implementation science', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'individual patient', 'insight', 'literacy', 'macrovascular disease', 'member', 'older patient', 'patient population', 'patient subsets', 'professor', 'programs', 'prospective', 'protective effect', 'racial and ethnic', 'skills', 'social determinants', 'social stigma', 'therapy design', 'therapy development', 'young adult']",NIDDK,KAISER FOUNDATION RESEARCH INSTITUTE,K23,2020,192914,-0.0052235697346386814
"eMERGE Phase IV Clinical Center at Partners HealthCare Abstract: To enable the application of PRS development and implementation, our eMERGE IV proposal from Partners HealthCare leverages a large biobank (>105,000 consented with genotype data on 40,000), clinical data in the electronic health records (EHR) for >4 million patients from the largest integrated health care provider in New England, advanced bioinformatics expertise, prior leadership in PRS development and state- of-the-art genetic analysis, established expertise in returning genomics results, and experience using information technology to transform clinical processes and assessing outcomes. We propose to build on our expertise to accomplish the specific aims: Aim 1 (Discovery): Hypothesis: Polygenic risks scores will allow us to stratify eMERGE subjects based on genetic risk for common complex traits. Using the largest available genomic data resources, we will calculate and validate new PRS for coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, type 2 diabetes, colorectal cancer and major depression across diverse ancestries. We will 1) compare and benchmark the performance of existing PRS construction methods in different ancestral groups, 2) develop novel statistical methods for robust trans-ethnic PRS prediction, and integrate PRS with established clinical risk factors and family history. We will obtain PRS from our network colleagues for an additional 15-e- phenotypes (total 20) with a goal of identifying high-risk individuals, e.g., top 2% of PRS risk Aim 2 (RiskInsight Report/ELSI): We will develop a “Risk Insight Report” with clinical risk factors, family history, and PRS with evidence-based recommendations for high risk participants (top 2% of phenotype specific PRS distribution) for electronic clinical implementation. We will assess risk communication formats in our ELSI Sub-Aim 1: To test the impact and interpretability of two mock RiskInsight Reports summarizing PRS as either (a) dichotomous (defining the patient as high-risk vs intermediate/low risk) or (b) quantitative (providing a numerical estimate of the percentile of risk for the patient), with linked clinical recommendations in both cases. We will then assess, through surveys of diverse HCPs and patients, the extent to which the mock reports are understood by both HCPs and patients. Aim 3 (Outcomes): Hypothesis: Physicians will alter their surveillance and treatment of patients based on eCDS of RiskInsight Reports. Among HCPs for high-risk subjects, we will see at least one change in clinical care after disclosure discussions with subjects. We will recruit 2500 participants for implementation of clinical PRS in RiskInsight Reports using a SMART on FHIR app for eCDS integrated with the EHR. The primary outcome will be whether any HCP took any action within 12 months after receipt of e-CDS defined by ordering screening tests, prescribing a preventive medication, or providing lifestyle advice. We will conduct analyses of the effect of disclosing results to high risk participants to determine how personalized results changed patient outcomes in laboratory values, risk reduction behaviors, or health care utilization. PROJECT NARRATIVE The discovery and clinical use of polygenic risk scores (PRS) for complex traits promises to dramatically change the practice of medicine. Our eMERGE IV grant will leverage a large Biobank and a rich electronic medical record to define the clinical impact of PRS derived from diverse populations and the clinical impact of returning these results along with family history and clinical risk information to participants and their healthcare providers.",eMERGE Phase IV Clinical Center at Partners HealthCare,9988785,U01HG008685,"['Algorithms', 'All of Us Research Program', 'Asians', 'Atrial Fibrillation', 'Benchmarking', 'Bioinformatics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Consent', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disclosure', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Electronic Medical Records and Genomics Network', 'Family', 'Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Glycosylated hemoglobin A', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Harm Reduction', 'Health Personnel', 'Healthcare', 'Hispanics', 'Individual', 'Information Technology', 'Intervention', 'Japan', 'Laboratories', 'Leadership', 'Life Style', 'Link', 'Low-Density Lipoproteins', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Mental Depression', 'Methods', 'New England', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physical activity', 'Physicians', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Predictive Value', 'Preventive', 'Preventive therapy', 'Process', 'Recommendation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk Reduction Behavior', 'Risk stratification', 'Statistical Methods', 'Surveys', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine', 'Veterans', 'Visit', 'base', 'behavioral outcome', 'biobank', 'clinical care', 'clinical center', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical implementation', 'clinical practice', 'clinical research site', 'clinical risk', 'data resource', 'design', 'economic outcome', 'evidence based guidelines', 'exome', 'experience', 'genetic analysis', 'genome wide association study', 'genomic data', 'health care service utilization', 'high risk', 'insight', 'machine learning algorithm', 'novel', 'polygenic risk score', 'portability', 'primary outcome', 'programs', 'psychiatric genomics', 'recruit', 'screening', 'support tools', 'trait']",NHGRI,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,U01,2020,1216161,-0.005659944056251978
"The initial care of younger adults with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes PROJECT SUMMARY Dr. Anjali Gopalan, MD, MSHP is a board-certified Internist at the Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC) Oakland Medical Center and a Research Scientist I (equivalent to Assistant Professor) at the KPNC Division of Research (DOR). With the proposed K23 mentored career development award, Dr. Gopalan will gain the advanced training and expertise necessary to become an independent investigator who can develop and implement tailored interventions for patients with early-onset type 2 diabetes (EOT2D). By focusing on adults with EOT2D, she seeks to address the comparatively poor micro- and macrovascular outcomes in this population that may result partly from inadequate management of hyperglycemia and other cardiovascular disease risk factors. Dr. Gopalan’s research premise posits that it is particularly critical for newly diagnosed patients with EOT2D to achieve early disease control, since tighter glycemic control during the year following diagnosis confers long-lasting micro- and macrovascular benefits. In support of the premise, the Research Aims of this K23 are to: 1) use electronic health record [EHR] data to identify EOT2D patient subgroups at highest risk of inadequate early disease control, 2) identify barriers to and facilitators of initial EOT2D management, and 3) examine prospective associations between patient-reported factors (e.g., disease-related distress, health literacy) and inadequate early disease control. The proposed research will be supported by experienced mentors and advisors, as well as advanced training in the following areas: 1) the use of advanced statistical modeling, 2) qualitative data analysis to inform intervention development, 3) the role of social determinants in health, and 4) implementation science. KPNC and DOR are ideal environments for the proposed work. KPNC is an integrated learning healthcare delivery system with a diverse membership of 4.2 million people (>350,000 with diabetes). DOR has a long track record of effectively training early stage investigators and has well-established internal research programs and collaborative relationships with nearby institutions that provide the infrastructure needed for career development. This environment, along with the proposed Research and Training Plans and an outstanding mentorship team, will enable Dr. Gopalan to continue to build the skills and generate the foundational data needed to submit an R01-level proposal during the final years of the proposed award period. In this planned R01, Dr. Gopalan will refine and implement an intervention (with a design based on the results of the three K23 Research Aims) to improve early care for newly diagnosed EOT2D patients and evaluate its impact on early outcomes in this growing, high-risk population. In summary, the proposed K23 award will support the career development of Dr. Gopalan and is vital to her acquiring the skill set and expertise required to become a successful, independent investigator. PROJECT NARRATIVE Adults diagnosed with type 2 diabetes at a younger age have higher rates of complications than those diagnosed later in life. Given the lasting benefit conferred by early disease control, the initial care provided to this growing, high-risk population is particularly crucial. With this proposed career development award, Dr. Gopalan will acquire the research skills necessary to identify patients at highest risk for inadequate early disease control, define barriers to initial disease management, and develop an intervention designed to improve the care of adults (ages 21-44) with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes.",The initial care of younger adults with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes,10226398,K23DK116968,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Area', 'Award', 'California', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Complications of Diabetes Mellitus', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Reporting', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Distress', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Face', 'Familiarity', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Sciences', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hyperglycemia', 'Hyperlipidemia', 'Hypertension', 'Infrastructure', 'Institution', 'Integrated Health Care Systems', 'Internist', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Latino', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical center', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pharmacy facility', 'Population', 'Population Characteristics', 'Provider', 'Qualitative Research', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Resources', 'Retrospective cohort', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk Management', 'Risk Reduction', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Smoke', 'Statistical Models', 'Stress', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Trees', 'United Kingdom', 'Work', 'barrier to care', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'career', 'career development', 'cohort', 'comparative', 'design', 'diabetes education', 'diabetes management', 'disorder control', 'eHealth', 'early onset', 'ethnic diversity', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'glycemic control', 'health care delivery', 'health literacy', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'implementation science', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'individual patient', 'insight', 'literacy', 'macrovascular disease', 'member', 'older patient', 'patient population', 'patient subsets', 'professor', 'programs', 'prospective', 'protective effect', 'racial and ethnic', 'skills', 'social determinants', 'social stigma', 'therapy design', 'therapy development', 'young adult']",NIDDK,KAISER FOUNDATION RESEARCH INSTITUTE,K23,2020,54000,-0.0052235697346386814
"Methods to Test Lifestyle, Vaginal Microenvironment, and Genitourinary Symptoms across Menopause Transition Over 50% of postmenopausal women are affected by the genitourinary syndrome of menopause (GSM), which includes vaginal atrophy, vaginal dryness, and sexual dysfunction. Symptoms worsen if untreated and are associated with stress and depression. Estrogen decline in menopause is thought to lead to reduced glycogen accumulation in the vaginal epithelium and is associated with low vaginal Lactobacillus spp. levels in 50-80% of women. Lactobacillus spp. protect the urogenital tract from pathogens in part by producing lactic acid and for their anti-inflammatory properties, but whether lactobacilli are a marker for estrogen levels or play a functional role in GSM is unknown. Available treatments for vulvovaginal GSM symptoms have limitations. Some women are contraindicated for hormonal therapy or are concerned with side effects. Vaginal lubricants provide some relief, but they may be toxic to the vaginal epithelium, reduce lactobacilli, and raise urogenital infection risk. New therapies are needed. Vaginal microbiota are a plausible approach to treatment, however, probiotics alone have not proven effective. Vaginal microbiota co-vary with metabolite and immune profiles, and it is unknown how these molecular features relate to GSM. We hypothesize that core vaginal microenvironment biomarkers (VMB; e.g., microbial, metabolite, and immune profiles) reflect vaginal biological aging (V-BA) that is increased by menopause but may also be modifiable by other factors, such as lifestyle. Longitudinal studies are needed to identify core age-related VMB and determine how they relate to GSM. To accomplish this task, we will develop new statistical methods to combine complex longitudinal epidemiologic data with high- dimensional compositional data. We will leverage 2,301 archived cervicovaginal samples collected as part of a cohort of 812 women aged 35-60 years with visits every six months for two years (R01-CA123467). Specific Aims are to 1) quantify V-BA using VMB; 2) evaluate the longitudinal relationship between V-BA and GSM; 3) longitudinally assess the relationship of lifestyle factors on V-BA and VMB; 4) quantify longitudinal mediation by V-BA and VMB between lifestyle and GSM. Microbiota are already profiled by 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing (R21-AI107224). Along with clinical, demographic, and behavioral surveys, we will 1) use cervical secretions and multiplexed bead-based immune-assays to quantify concentrations of 70 immune markers (cytokines, chemokines, growth factors); 2) profile metabolites from vaginal swabs (GC/LC-MS). This proposal is focused on developing and validating new statistical methods that refine and adapt modern structural modeling and microbiota compositional analyses. The novel statistical approaches will allow identification of vaginal microenvironment features which may lead to development of new and effective GSM treatments. These methods will also provide a new framework to handle missing data and confounding that has limited prior microbiome studies. Our team has the multidisciplinary expertise in biostatistics, epidemiology, aging, gynecology, genomics, microbiology, and immunology required for a new systems-biology approach to GSM. Over 50% of postmenopausal women report genitourinary symptoms which result in detriments to their quality of life. Changes in the normal and protective vaginal bacteria (termed vaginal microbiota) accelerate in menopause transition for some women and have been associated with a higher burden of urogenital symptoms; therefore, we aim to determine how vaginal bacterial, metabolite, and immune profiles relate to genitourinary symptoms over time in a large study. The public health impact is to identify molecular targets of intervention which will improve postmenopausal vaginal health and lengthen women's healthspan, a key NIA mission.","Methods to Test Lifestyle, Vaginal Microenvironment, and Genitourinary Symptoms across Menopause Transition",10229293,R56AG068673,"['16S ribosomal RNA sequencing', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Anaerobic Bacteria', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents', 'Archives', 'Atrophic', 'Bacteria', 'Behavioral', 'Biochemical', 'Biogenic Amines', 'Biological', 'Biological Aging', 'Biological Markers', 'Biometry', 'Body mass index', 'Cells', 'Cervical', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Development', 'Dryness', 'Epidemiology', 'Epithelial', 'Epithelium', 'Estrogen Therapy', 'Estrogens', 'Funding', 'Genitourinary System Infection', 'Genitourinary system', 'Genomics', 'Glycogen', 'Goals', 'Growth Factor', 'Gynecology', 'Health', 'Human Papillomavirus', 'Immune', 'Immunologic Markers', 'Immunology', 'Immunology procedure', 'Inflammaging', 'Intervention', 'Kynurenine', 'Lactic acid', 'Lactobacillus', 'Lead', 'Life Style', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Lubricants', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Menopausal Symptom', 'Menopausal Syndrome', 'Menopause', 'Mental Depression', 'Methods', 'Microbiology', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Target', 'Multiomic Data', 'National Institute on Aging', 'Outcome', 'Perimenopause', 'Play', 'Postmenopause', 'Prevotella', 'Probiotics', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Sex Behavior', 'Sex Functioning', 'Sexual Dysfunction', 'Smoking', 'Source', 'Specimen', 'Statistical Methods', 'Streptococcus', 'Stress', 'Structural Models', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'Swab', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Taurine', 'Testing', 'Thinness', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vagina', 'Visit', 'Woman', 'age related', 'aged', 'analytical method', 'base', 'cervicovaginal', 'chemokine', 'cohort', 'cytokine', 'dietary supplements', 'epidemiologic data', 'healthspan', 'high dimensionality', 'hormonal contraception', 'hormone therapy', 'improved', 'infection risk', 'innovation', 'lifestyle factors', 'microbial', 'microbiome', 'microbiome research', 'microbiota', 'microbiota metabolites', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'novel therapeutics', 'pathogen', 'preservation', 'repository', 'side effect', 'statistics', 'urogenital tract', 'vaginal dryness', 'vaginal lactobacilli', 'vaginal microbiota', 'vaginal mucosa']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND BALTIMORE,R56,2020,795662,-0.018359703444168905
"Chronic Inflammation and Type 2 Diabetes: A Multi-omics Approach ABSTRACT The etiology of type 2 diabetes (T2D) likely involves a complex interaction of polygenic, metabolic, and environmental factors including diet. Accumulating experimental, epidemiological, and clinical evidence supports a pathogenic role of chronic inflammation in T2D development. However, the precise mechanisms underlying these findings are largely unknown, and current evidence on the causal relationships between specific inflammatory pathways and T2D risk is inconclusive. Advances in omics technologies have led to the identification of genes and metabolites associated with T2D risk, but data on mechanisms and causality are still very limited. Multi-omics integration in the framework of systems epidemiology may provide new avenues to enhance our understanding of disease mechanisms. To systematically investigate the relation between chronic inflammation and T2D, I propose to examine 3 Specific Aims by leveraging the rich resources in the UK Biobank, Nurses’ Health Studies (NHS), Health Professional Follow-up Study (HPFS), Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos (SOL), and Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx). In Aim 1 [K99], I will integrate existing genomic data from the UK Biobank, NHS/HPFS, SOL, and transcriptomic data in the GTEx to examine shared genetic architectures between systemic inflammatory markers and T2D and whether polygenic susceptibility to chronic inflammation confers T2D risk. Meanwhile, I will receive extensive training in T2D systems biology and cutting-edge high-dimensional data analytics and bioinformatics. In Aim 2 [R00], I will integrate dietary and metabolomic data to examine metabolomic profiles mediating the association between dietary inflammatory potentials and T2D risk in the prospective NHS/HPFS and the SOL. In Aim 3 [R00], I will conduct plasma proteomic profiling in a nested case-control study within the NHS to identify inflammatory protein networks in relation to T2D risk, and as a Secondary Aim, integrate findings from Aim 1-3 to explore T2D-related pathways co-regulating at multiple biological dimensions. Findings from this project may improve the understanding of inflammatory mechanisms underlying T2D and identify novel targets/pathways suitable for early detection and prevention. I will be mentored/advised by an interdisciplinary team that includes Dr. JoAnn Manson (diabetes epidemiologist), Dr. Liming Liang (expert in statistical omics methodologies), Dr. Frank Hu (nutritional epidemiologist), Dr. Peter Kraft, (statistical geneticist), Dr. Qibin Qi (genetic epidemiologist), Dr. Towia Libermann (expert in proteomics), and Dr. Clary Clish (expert in metabolomics). The outstanding training opportunities with key leaders in these areas will provide me advanced knowledge and skills, positioning me for a successful, independent career as a diabetes epidemiologist with expertise in systems biology and integrated-omics. This project aligns with the NIDDK’s goal of integrating multi-omics technologies into diabetes research. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project seeks to systematically examine the relationship between chronic inflammation and type 2 diabetes (T2D) by incorporating multi-omics data from several large prospective cohort studies. The proposed research will yield novel evidence on the biological mechanisms underlying the relationship between chronic inflammation and T2D risk.

"Hypertensive Disorders of Pregnancy and Subsequent Risk of Vascular Dementia, Alzheimer's Disease, or Related Dementia: A Retrospective Cohort Study Taking into Account Mid-Life Mediating Factors. PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT This is an application for a K01 award for Dr. Karen Schliep, a tenure-line Assistant Professor of Public Health at the University of Utah. Dr. Schliep is establishing herself as a young investigator in women’s life-course epidemiology, specifically in a novel area of aging research—to improve our understanding of women’s increased risk of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and related dementias (RD) and create women-specific interventions to mitigate risk and improve outcomes. This award will allow Dr. Schliep to achieve her goal of research independence by providing her support to accomplish the following training aims: 1) develop expertise in biomedical informatics and population-based research methods; 2) gain experience in the conduction of clinical cognitive health assessments; 3) enhance knowledge of modifiable factors affecting women’s mid- and late-life cognitive health; and 4) expand skills to independently lead and manage a successful research program. Dr. Schliep has assembled a mentoring team comprising a primary mentor, Dr. Michael Varner, an obstetrician and nationally renowned maternal-fetal medicine investigator with expertise in pregnancy complications including hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP), and two co-mentors: Dr. Norman Foster, a cognitive neurologist and geriatric neurologist and recognized leader in dementia research, and Dr. Ken Smith, an internationally known expert in population-based analyses and genetic/family epidemiology. Dr. Schliep has five advisors with expertise in classification modeling, ADRD neuropsychology, mid-life women’s health, longitudinal and survival data analysis, and chronic disease epidemiology.  Little is known regarding the association between HDP, estimated to complicate 2–8% of all pregnancies, and long-term adverse maternal neurological outcomes with similar inflammatory vascular etiologies, including ADRD. An estimated 5.4 million Americans currently suffer from ADRD, two-thirds of whom are women. As the US aging population increases, prevalence of dementia is expected to approach 13.2 to 16.0 million cases by 2050. Why ADRD disproportionately affects women is not known. Dr. Schliep’s research objective is to develop classification models for the various dementia subtypes (including AD, vascular dementia, Lewy body dementia, and frontotemporal dementia) to analyze longitudinal, individual-level data to better understand how HDP may increase a woman’s risk for ADRD. Dr. Schliep will accomplish this through the following research aims: 1) increase accuracy of ADRD diagnoses within health administrative databases; and 2) investigate the association between HDP and ADRD, and mid-life mediating factors. The proposal’s expected outcomes include 1) a novel method to accurately capture dementia cases within large linked health administrative databases; 2) clarity on how HDP may be linked with specific dementia subtypes; and 3) skills, experience, and preliminary data for Dr. Schliep to support future studies identifying other sex-specific risk factors for dementia and mediating factors amenable to interventions. PROJECT NARRATIVE Women have a two-fold higher lifetime risk for Alzheimer Disease (AD), vascular dementia, and related dementias (RD) compared to men. Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, including preeclampsia, eclampsia, and gestational hypertension, may contribute to sex differences in ADRD, with midlife experiences such as depression influencing the magnitude of risk. We propose to 1) create a model that can identify AD and related dementias in a large health administrative database; and 2) test the link (and mediating factors) between hypertensive disorders of pregnancy and ADRD, which will serve as the first step towards creating women’s tailored intervention that can mitigate ADRD risk for women.","Hypertensive Disorders of Pregnancy and Subsequent Risk of Vascular Dementia, Alzheimer's Disease, or Related Dementia: A Retrospective Cohort Study Taking into Account Mid-Life Mediating Factors.",9892855,K01AG058781,"['Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease care', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'American', 'Applications Grants', 'Area', 'Award', 'Blood Vessels', 'Chronic Disease', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Cohort Studies', 'County', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Dementia', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Eclampsia', 'Elderly', 'Epidemiology', 'Etiology', 'Family', 'Fertility', 'Fostering', 'Frontotemporal Dementia', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Health Status', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Inflammatory', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Lewy Body Dementia', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Life course epidemiology', 'Link', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Maternal-fetal medicine', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Medical Records', 'Memory', 'Menopause', 'Mental Depression', 'Mentored Research Scientist Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurologic', 'Neurological outcome', 'Neurologist', 'Neuropsychology', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Population', 'Population Database', 'Population Research', 'Population Study', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Pre-Eclampsia', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Complications', 'Prevalence', 'Principal Investigator', 'Psychosocial Factor', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Records', 'Reproductive Health', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Retrospective cohort study', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Sex Differences', 'Social Environment', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Utah', 'Validation', 'Vascular Dementia', 'Woman', 'Women&apos', 's Health', 'administrative database', 'aging population', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'career', 'clinical diagnostics', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'cost', 'dementia risk', 'epidemiology study', 'experience', 'family genetics', 'health assessment', 'health difference', 'high risk', 'hypertension treatment', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'lifetime risk', 'men', 'middle age', 'mortality risk', 'normotensive', 'novel', 'population based', 'predictive modeling', 'pregnancy disorder', 'pregnancy hypertension', 'prevent', 'professor', 'programs', 'prospective', 'reproductive', 'sex', 'skills', 'sociodemographics']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,K01,2020,124188,-0.06351496279485647
