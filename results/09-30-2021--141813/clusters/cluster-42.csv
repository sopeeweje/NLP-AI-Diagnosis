"Blending deep learning with probabilistic mechanistic models to predict and understand the evolution and function of adaptive immune receptors Project Summary Scientific understanding of adaptive immune receptors (i.e. antibodies and T cell receptors) has the potential to revolutionize prophylaxis, diagnosis, and treatment of disease. High‐throughput DNA sequencing and functional experiments have now brought the study of adaptive immune receptors into the big‐data era. To realize this potential of these data they must be matched with appropriately powerful analytical techniques. Existing probabilistic and mechanistic models are insufficient to capture the complexities of these data, while a naïve application of machine learning cannot leverage our profound existing knowledge of the immune system. The goal of this project is to blend deep learning with mechanistic modeling in order to predict and understand the evolution and function of adaptive immune receptors. Aim 1: Develop generative models of immune receptor sequences that capture the complexity of real adaptive immune receptor repertoires. These will combine deep learning along with our knowledge of VDJ recombination, and provide a rigorous platform for detailed repertoire comparison. Aim 2: Develop quantitative mechanistic models of antibody somatic hypermutation that incorporate the underlying biochemical processes. Estimate intractable likelihoods using deep learning to infer important latent variables, and validate models using knock‐out experiments in cell lines. Aim 3: Develop hybrid deep learning models to predict binding properties from sequence data, combining large experimentally‐derived binding data with even larger sets of immune sequences from human immune memory samples. Incorporate structural information via 3D convolution or distance‐based penalties. These tools will reveal the full power of immune repertoire data for medical applications. We will obtain more rigorous comparisons of repertoires via their distribution in a relevant space. These will reveal the effects of immune perturbations such as vaccination and disease, allowing us to pick out sequences that are impacted by these perturbations. We will have a greater quantitative understanding of somatic hypermutation in vivo, and statistical models that appropriately capture long‐range effects of collections of mutations. We will also have algorithms that will be able to combine repertoire data and sparse binding data to predict binding properties. Put together, these advances will enable rational vaccine design, treatment for autoimmune disease, and identification of T cells that are promising candidates for cancer immunotherapy. Project Narrative Adaptive immune receptors (i.e. antibodies and T cell receptors) enable our body to fight off disease, “remember” pathogens, and train the immune system through vaccination. Immunologists have learned via high‐throughput sequencing that adaptive immune receptors have a truly remarkable diversity. In this proposal, we develop machine‐learning methods for these sequence data, which will allow us to predict the maturation, statistical distribution, and binding properties of adaptive immune receptors, and thus to better design vaccinations, autoimmune disease treatment, and immunotherapy treatment for cancer.",Blending deep learning with probabilistic mechanistic models to predict and understand the evolution and function of adaptive immune receptors,9800752,R01AI146028,"['3-Dimensional', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Model', 'Antibodies', 'Antibody Affinity', 'Antigens', 'Architecture', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Automobile Driving', 'Big Data', 'Binding', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemical Process', 'Categories', 'Cell Line', 'Characteristics', 'Collection', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dependence', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Entropy', 'Evolution', 'Exposure to', 'Foundations', 'Gene Conversion', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'High-Throughput DNA Sequencing', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immune system', 'Immunoglobulin Somatic Hypermutation', 'Immunologic Memory', 'Immunologic Receptors', 'Immunological Models', 'Immunologics', 'Immunologist', 'Immunology', 'Immunotherapy', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Knock-out', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Mutation', 'Pathway interactions', 'Population', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Property', 'Prophylactic treatment', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Statistical Distributions', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'T-Cell Receptor', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'T-cell receptor repertoire', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Update', 'V(D)J Recombination', 'Vaccination', 'Vaccine Design', 'Vaccines', 'Validation', 'Work', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'biochemical model', 'cancer immunotherapy', 'cancer therapy', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'deep sequencing', 'design', 'experimental study', 'fighting', 'functional group', 'in vivo', 'insertion/deletion mutation', 'learning strategy', 'markov model', 'pathogen', 'progenitor', 'receptor', 'repaired', 'response', 'success', 'three dimensional structure', 'tool']",NIAID,FRED HUTCHINSON CANCER RESEARCH CENTER,R01,2019,632498,-0.007822641814889352
"Deep learning based antibody design using high-throughput affinity testing of synthetic sequences Project Summary We will develop and apply a new high-throughput methodology for rapidly designing and testing antibodies for a myriad of purposes, including cancer and infectious disease immunotherapeutics. We will improve upon current approaches for antibody design by providing time, cost, and humane benefits over immunized animal methods and greatly improving the power of present synthetic methods that use randomized designs. To accomplish this, we will display millions of computationally designed antibody sequences using recently available technology, test the displayed antibodies in a high-throughput format at low cost, and use the resulting test data to train molecular dynamics and machine learning methods to generate new sequences for testing. Based on our test data our computational method will identify sequences that have ideal properties for target binding and therapeutic efficacy. We will accomplish these goals with three specific aims. We will develop a new approach to integrated molecular dynamics and machine learning using control targets and known receptor sequences to refine our methods for receptor generalization and model updating from observed data (Aim 1). We will design an iterative framework intended to enable identification of highly effective antibodies within a minimal number of experiments, in which our methods automatically propose promising antibody sequences to profile in subsequent assays (Aim 2). We will employ rounds of automated synthetic design, affinity test, and model improvement to produce highly target-specific antibodies. (Aim 3). ! Project Narrative We will develop new computational methods that learn from millions of examples to design antibodies that can be used to help cure a wide variety of human diseases such as cancer and viral infection. Previous antibody design approaches used a trial and error approach to find antibodies that worked well. In contrast our mathematical methods will directly produce new antibody designs by learning from large-scale experiments that test antibodies for function against disease targets. !",Deep learning based antibody design using high-throughput affinity testing of synthetic sequences,9664620,R01CA218094,"['Affinity', 'Animals', 'Antibodies', 'Antibody Affinity', 'Antigens', 'Architecture', 'Binding', 'Biological Assay', 'Budgets', 'Classification', 'Cloud Computing', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Computing Methodologies', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Fc Receptor', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Immunize', 'Immunotherapeutic agent', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Machines', 'Oligonucleotides', 'Output', 'Performance', 'Phage Display', 'Property', 'Randomized', 'Research', 'Services', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Specificity', 'Statistical Models', 'Technology', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Thinness', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Update', 'Virus Diseases', 'Work', 'base', 'cloud based', 'commercialization', 'computing resources', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'design', 'experimental study', 'human disease', 'improved', 'iterative design', 'learning strategy', 'mathematical methods', 'molecular dynamics', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'outcome prediction', 'predictive test', 'receptor']",NCI,MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2019,573396,0.026470134697052745
"Reproducible Analytics for Secondary Analyses of ImmPort Vaccination-Related Cytometry Data Project Summary The immunology database and analysis portal (ImmPort, http://immport.niaid.nih.gov) is the NIAID-funded public resource for data archive and dissemination from clinical trials and mechanistic research projects. Among the current 291 studies archived in ImmPort, 114 are focused on vaccine responses (91 for influenza vaccine responses), which is the largest category when organized by research focus. As the most effective method of preventing infectious diseases, development of the next-generation vaccines is faced with the bottleneck that traditional empirical design becomes ineffective to stimulate human protective immunity against HIV, RSV, CMV, and other recent major public health threats. This project will focus on three important aspects of informatics approaches to secondary analysis of ImmPort data for influenza vaccination research: a) expanding the data analytical capabilities of ImmPort and ImmPortGalaxy through adding innovative computational methods for user-friendly unsupervised identification of cell populations, b) processing and analyzing a subset of the existing human influenza vaccination study data in ImmPort to identify cell-based biomarkers using the new computational methods, and c) returning data analysis results with data analytical provenance to ImmPort for dissemination of derived data, software tools, as well as semantic assertions of the identified biomarkers. Each aspect is one specific research aim in the proposed work. The project outcome will not only demonstrate the utility of the ImmPort data archive but also generate a foundation for the Human Vaccine Project (HVP) to establish pilot programs for influenza vaccine research, which currently include Vanderbilt University Medical Center; University of California San Diego (UCSD); Scripps Research Institute; La Jolla Institute of Allergy and Immunology; and J. Craig Venter Institute (JCVI). Once such computational analytical workflow is established, it can be applied to the secondary analysis of other ImmPort studies as well as to support the user-driven analytics of their own cytometry data. Each of the specific aims contains innovative methods or new applications of the existing methods. The computational method for population identification in Aim 1 is a newly developed constrained data clustering method, which combines advantages of unsupervised and supervised learning. Cutting-edge machine learning approaches including random forest will be used in Aim 2 for the identification of biomarkers across study cohorts, in addition to the traditional statistical hypothesis testing. Standardized knowledge representation to be developed in Aim 3 for cell-based biomarkers is also innovative, as semantic networks with inferring and deriving capabilities can be built based on the machine-readable knowledge assertions. The proposed work, when accomplished, will foster broader collaboration between ImmPort and the existing vaccine research consortia. It will also accelerate the deployment of up-to-date informatics software tools on ImmPortGalaxy. Project Narrative Flow cytometry (FCM) plays important roles in human influenza vaccination studies through interrogating immune cellular functions and quantifying the immune responses in different conditions. This project will extend the current data analytical capabilities of the Immunology Database and Analysis Portal (ImmPort) through adding novel data analytical methods and software tools for user-friendly identification of cell populations from FCM data in ImmPort influenza vaccine response studies. The derived data and the knowledge generated from the secondary analysis of the ImmPort vaccination study data will be deposited back to ImmPort and shared with the Human Vaccines Project (HVP) consortium for dissemination.",Reproducible Analytics for Secondary Analyses of ImmPort Vaccination-Related Cytometry Data,9724345,UH2AI132342,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Address', 'Archives', 'Back', 'Biological Markers', 'California', 'Categories', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cohort Studies', 'Collaborations', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Cytomegalovirus', 'Cytometry', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Analytics', 'Databases', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Failure', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Genetic Transcription', 'HIV', 'Human', 'Hypersensitivity', 'Imagery', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immune system', 'Immunity', 'Immunology', 'Incidence', 'Influenza', 'Influenza vaccination', 'Informatics', 'Institutes', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri', 'Maps', 'Measles', 'Medical', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Mumps', 'Names', 'National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease', 'Outcome', 'Play', 'Poliomyelitis', 'Population', 'Population Statistics', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention strategy', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Readability', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Institute', 'Research Project Grants', 'Respiratory Syncytial Virus Vaccines', 'Respiratory syncytial virus', 'Role', 'Secondary to', 'Semantics', 'Smallpox', 'Software Tools', 'Source', 'Standardization', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Universities', 'Vaccination', 'Vaccine Design', 'Vaccine Research', 'Vaccines', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'base', 'biomarker discovery', 'biomarker identification', 'catalyst', 'cohort', 'comparative', 'computer infrastructure', 'computerized tools', 'data archive', 'data mining', 'data portal', 'data resource', 'design', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'immune function', 'improved', 'influenza virus vaccine', 'information organization', 'innovation', 'neoplastic', 'news', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'novel vaccines', 'prevent', 'programs', 'public-private partnership', 'random forest', 'response', 'response biomarker', 'secondary analysis', 'statistics', 'success', 'supervised learning', 'tool', 'unsupervised learning', 'user-friendly', 'vaccine development', 'vaccine response', 'vaccine trial', 'vaccine-induced immunity']",NIAID,"J.

"Development and Evaluation of a Machine Learning Approach to Interpret Optical Coherence Tomography Images of the Middle Ear to Improve Antibiotic Management PROJECT SUMMARY Introduction: PhotoniCare, Inc. is a medical device company developing the TOMi Scope, a handheld, optical imaging device for improved diagnosis of middle ear health. The purpose of this proposal is to establish and evaluate a machine learning approach to interpret TOMi Scope depth-resolved images using a set of ear models with human middle ear effusion (MEE; fluid) to enable improved diagnostic accuracy and, ultimately, antibiotic stewardship for ear health. Significance: Ear infections affect 95% of all children, yet they are one of the most poorly diagnosed and managed diseases in all of medicine, resulting in high antibiotic over-prescription and antibiotic resistance development. Correctly identifying the absence or presence/type of MEE through the non-transparent eardrum is critical to accurate diagnosis, and the limited current diagnostic tools suffer poor diagnostic accuracy (50- 70%) due to inherent subjectivity and dependence on user experience. Therefore, objective image classification metrics to enable improved diagnostic accuracy is sorely needed to finally provide children afflicted by this disease with the correct treatment the first time. Hypothesis: Applying a machine learning approach to TOMi Scope image classification of a set of ear models with human MEE will facilitate detection of the presence or absence of effusion (≥90% accuracy), as well as classification by the type of effusion samples (≥80% accuracy), regardless of user experience. Specific Aims: (1) Collect robust datasets of ex vivo human MEE, sufficient for machine learning image analysis. (2) Develop a neural network model based on the MEE dataset and apply the model to a representative test clinical dataset to determine classification feasibility. Commercial Opportunity: The TOMi Scope will provide physicians with new, objective information, enabling better decision-making for antibiotic prescription and surgical intervention. This has the potential to impact the standard of care for ~1B children worldwide that experience ear infections, representing a multi-billion-dollar commercial opportunity. PROJECT NARRATIVE Ear infections (otitis media) are highly prevalent in the pediatric population and represent a significant clinical challenge due to the limitations of the gold-standard diagnostic tools, resulting in high antibiotic prescription but also antibiotic resistance development. Accurate detection and classification of effusion (fluid) in the middle ear is a critical element for this diagnosis, and for making informed medical treatment decisions, particularly regarding antibiotic stewardship. The long-term goal of this work is to reduce antibiotic resistance and healthcare costs through improving patient outcomes by addressing the low diagnostic accuracy and user experience dependence of current subjective methods, with a novel, non-invasive imaging tool capable of quantitative depth-resolved measurements to not only visualize the underlying infection behind the eardrum, but also, with automated machine learning image analysis algorithms, minimize user experience dependence and variability.",Development and Evaluation of a Machine Learning Approach to Interpret Optical Coherence Tomography Images of the Middle Ear to Improve Antibiotic Management,9847606,R43DC017422,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Algorithms', 'Antibiotic Resistance', 'Antibiotic Therapy', 'Antibiotics', 'Bacteria', 'Biological', 'Biomechanics', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Controlled Environment', 'Data', 'Data Quality', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Dependence', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Ear', 'Elements', 'Evaluation', 'Family suidae', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging Device', 'Imaging technology', 'Infection', 'Intestines', 'Liquid substance', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Device', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Optics', 'Otitis Media', 'Otitis Media with Effusion', 'Otoscopy', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Patient observation', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Pythons', 'Resistance development', 'Safety', 'Sampling', 'Serous', 'Sterility', 'Surface', 'Technology', 'TensorFlow', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Tympanic membrane', 'Work', 'accurate diagnosis', 'base', 'convolutional neural network', 'deep learning', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'digital', 'ear infection', 'effusion', 'ex vivo imaging', 'experience', 'hearing impairment', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'middle ear', 'neural network', 'non-invasive imaging', 'novel', 'optical imaging', 'pediatric patients', 'standard of care', 'tool']",NIDCD,"PHOTONICARE, INC.",R43,2019,223899,-0.0028813693025556376
"New approaches to optimizing the application and measuring the impact of community-based tuberculosis interventions PROJECT SUMMARY Globally, tuberculosis (TB) kills more people each year than any other infectious disease, but around 40% of TB cases go undiagnosed each year. This leads to continued transmission and a slow rate of decline in global TB incidence. Community-based TB screening interventions are one strategy for increasing the early diagnosis and treatment of people with tuberculosis. Knowledge is lacking on when community-based TB screening interventions are likely to be fruitful and on the impact of these interventions on TB transmission. This study addresses the first of these knowledge gaps by identifying epidemiologic signals that predict high yields for community-based TB screening, and by assessing barriers to optimal implementation of community-based screening programs. It addresses the second knowledge gap by measuring transmission within communities that receive TB screening interventions, and by identifying potential sites of transmission both within and outside the community. Aim 1 applies random forest regression to data from a community-based screening program to create a decision tree that uses information about past TB patients to predict whether a commnity is likely to have high levels of undiagnosed TB in the present. Aim 2 is a mixed-methods study focusing on people who were missed by TB screening interventions, which will help understand the barriers to successful implementation. Aim 3 uses whole-genome sequencing of clinical isolates to determine the proportion of TB cases attributable to recent transmission within intervention communities, using this metric to evaluate the impact of screening interventions on transmission. Aim 4 uses social network analysis to identify sites of transmission within and outside intervention communities. The long-term goal of this work is to reduce global TB morbidity through improved community-based screening. PROJECT NARRATIVE This study seeks to understand (a) when community-based tuberculosis screening interventions are likely to be fruitful and (b) the impact these interventions have on tuberculosis transmission. This knowledge will improve community-based tuberculosis screening interventions and thus contribute to the reduction of global tuberculosis morbidity.",New approaches to optimizing the application and measuring the impact of community-based tuberculosis interventions,9781984,DP2MD015102,"['Address', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Decision Trees', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Epidemiology', 'Goals', 'Incidence', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Patients', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Social Network', 'Tuberculosis', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical sequencing', 'community intervention', 'improved', 'novel strategies', 'random forest', 'screening', 'screening program', 'transmission process', 'whole genome']",NIMHD,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,DP2,2019,2353629,-0.004064033695666752
"Identifying individuals at risk of progression to active tuberculosis Project Summary Almost 2 billion people are infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), the causative agent of tuberculosis (TB). Approximately 10% of these individuals will progress to active TB disease over their lifetimes, but there is currently no clinical test to distinguish those that will progress to active TB disease, from those that will not. If we are to realize the World Health Organization's (WHO) goal of a world free of TB by 2035, the massive reservoir of TB infection must be addressed with a cost-effective, ethical therapy for preventing progression, based on treating only those most likely to progress. A diagnostic test that can accurately predict the risk of progression is critical for treating these high-risk individuals and the eradication of TB. Our goal is to develop such an assay. Our central hypothesis is that five independent host immune biomarkers, combined into a single multimetric signature will predict progression from latent to active TB with at least 90% sensitivity and specificity. We will test this hypothesis and achieve our goal by implementing the following specific aims: Aim 1: Compile a comprehensive dataset of biomarkers in a prospective cohort of individuals who are at risk of progressing to active TB. Working with the Moldova Ministry of Health's National TB Program, we will enroll 3,685 close contacts of active TB cases. All participants will be followed for two years to determine who progresses to active TB. We expect to identify ≥ 140 progressors. We will assess three previously established blood-based predictors of active TB progression, and two novel assays. We will verify the performance of previously published biomarkers in this population to discriminate progressors from non-progressors and identify new candidate biomarkers using RNA-Seq of antigen stimulated PBMC and detection of Mtb-peptides by NanoDisk MS. Aim 2: Use a discovery set of samples to develop predictive models of progression to active TB. Using data from 140 progressors and 140 non-progressors from Aim 1 we will (1) Verify the performance of existing biomarkers, (2) Use a cross-validation to identify new candidate biomarkers, and (3) derive predictive models using logistic regression and machine learning methods to identify optimal biomarker signatures that best predict progression to active TB within 12 months. Aim 3: Verify the ability of the model to predict progression to active TB disease. Using the same approach as Aim 1, we will enroll a new set of 1,340 household contacts of active TB and identify at least 60 progressors and 60 matched non-progressors and verify clinically the sensitivity/specificity of our models and biosignatures (Aim 2) to predict progression to active disease. A combined host biomarker signature that can predict TB progression from a small blood volume will have significant impact on the WHO End TB Program. PROJECT NARRATIVE Almost 2 billion people are infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the causative agent of tuberculosis (TB). Approximately 10% of these individuals will progress to active TB disease over their lifetimes, but there is currently no test to distinguish those that will progress from those that will not. We propose to develop a multimetric signature of host biomarkers that together will have a sensitivity and specificity of ≥ 90% for predicting progression to active TB in one year, a critical first step to developing cost-effective and ethical treatment plans in order to reach the World Health Organization goal of Ending TB by 2035.",Identifying individuals at risk of progression to active tuberculosis,9654700,R01AI137681,"['Address', 'Antigens', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood Volume', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Sensitivity', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Enrollment', 'Ethics', 'Event', 'Filtration', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Foundations', 'Freezing', 'Frequencies', 'Gender', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Household', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immunologic Markers', 'Individual', 'Interferons', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Lymphocyte', 'Machine Learning', 'Modeling', 'Moldova', 'Mycobacterium tuberculosis', 'Mycobacterium tuberculosis antigens', 'National Health Programs', 'Organizational Objectives', 'Outcomes Research', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Peptide Fragments', 'Peptides', 'Performance', 'Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell', 'Plasma', 'Population', 'Procedures', 'Production', 'Prospective cohort', 'Proteins', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'RNA', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Specificity', 'T cell response', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Testing', 'Tuberculosis', 'Validation', 'World Health Organization', 'age group', 'base', 'biobank', 'biomarker performance', 'biosignature', 'blood-based biomarker', 'candidate marker', 'classification algorithm', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'cohort', 'cost effective', 'deep neural network', 'enzyme linked immunospot assay', 'falls', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'monocyte', 'nanodisk', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive test', 'prevent', 'programs', 'random forest', 'research clinical testing', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transmission process', 'treatment planning']",NIAID,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2019,715056,0.0434325364802885
"Digital High Resolution Melt and Machine Learning for Rapid and Specific Diagnosis in Neonatal Sepsis Project Summary Blood culture sensitivity in neonates is poor but is the “Gold Standard” for the diagnosis of sepsis. Universal genotyping of pathogen genomic sequences using High Resolution Melt (U-HRM) provides a simple, low cost, rapid, and modern alternative to blood culture testing. By measuring the fluorescence of an intercalating dye as PCR-amplified pathogen DNA fragments are heated and disassociate, sequence defined melt curves are generated with single-nucleotide resolution in a closed-tube reaction. We have advanced U- HRM into a digital PCR format (U-dHRM), where DNA sequences that are present in mixtures are individually amplified and identified as is needed for polymicrobial infections. We have also established unique signature melt curves for 37 bacterial species that commonly infect older children and adults and automatically identify them using machine learning technology. With the goal of creating an accurate and valid test for the timely diagnosis of neonatal sepsis, we will advance this technology to identify unique fungal, viral, and bacterial HRM signatures along with antibiotic resistance genes with an accuracy of 99-100% on minimal blood volume (1mL). Our aims are: Aim 1. Optimize and assess the U-dHRM platform for neonatal bacteremia diagnosis by expand our bacterial database (13 additional bacteria) to detect causes of >99% of neonatal bacterial infections, expand our antibiotic resistance gene database to include five clinically actionable genes, and assessing the performance of the system for bacteremia diagnosis in mock and clinical whole blood samples; Aim 2. Advance the U-dHRM platform for simultaneous detection of fungal and viral pathogens by upgrading our optical system to enable expansion to fungal and viral detection in a high-throughput format, multiplexing the assay to expand to viral and fungal pathogens causing >99% non-bacterial infections, and conducting analytical validation of the multiplexed platform using mock whole blood samples; and Aim 3.

"The Environmental and Human Factors that Determine Ixodes scapularis-borne Diseases Incidence Project Summary Vector-borne diseases (VBDs) are the most common types of emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases in the world. VBD epidemics have been increasing over recent decades, with tickborne diseases having doubled in the last decade in the United States. Despite the increase in public health burden, over 80% of vector-control organizations lack preventative capabilities. Understanding the interplay between the environment, vectors, pathogens, and humans that expedite disease spread remains a challenge. The overarching goal of this project is to identify the key environmental and human drivers that have led to the emergence of VBDs. Current models that predict tickborne disease risk have oversimplified the process by focusing only on the vector, i.e. risk of tick exposure. A human’s risk of infection is not only a function of entomological risk but also of factors inherent to the individual including behavior or characteristics that increase susceptibility to disease. This project proposes a novel approach to tickborne disease prediction by developing a comprehensive model that incorporate pathogen population dynamics and human factors to predict disease risk. This study will investigate several pathogens vectored by the black-legged tick (Ixodes scapularis): Borrelia burgdorferi (Lyme disease), Anaplasma phagocytophilum (human granulocytic anaplasmosis), and Babesia microti (babesiosis). The central hypothesis is that the prediction of tickborne disease risk can be improved by using sophisticated statistical methods to identify environmental drivers that impact pathogen population dynamics while incorporating human demographic characteristics. The hypothesis will be addressed in the following aims: (1) Determine the current and historical population dynamic patterns of pathogens vectored by I. scapularis to predict pathogen distribution; (2) Determine the association between human characteristics and tick-borne disease risk in order to develop an improved spatial disease risk model. This model will allow the identification and quantification of factors that are associated with the emergence of tickborne diseases in New York State, which is geographically advantageous because it is representative of much of the natural environment that ticks encounter in the northeastern US including rapid and recent changes in climate and landscapes. The results of this project will be used to develop a public disease warning system that will use contemporary and future climate forecasts to monitor tick populations and predict potential disease outbreaks for areas with vulnerable populations. With climate forecasts predicting an increase in 2-3°C in temperature by 2100, there is uncertainty in how diseases will shift and a warning system will allow preparation accordingly. At the completion of the proposed research project, the applicant will have acquired the following skillsets through intensive, interdisciplinary mentorship: big data analysis, advanced statistics including Bayesian and machine learning methods, spatial analyses, and risk analysis. This will enable the applicant to succeed as an independent investigator to address the challenges posed by emerging infectious diseases. Project Narrative Vector-borne diseases are the most common types of emerging infectious diseases in the world and constitute major threats to public health. My project uses advanced statistical methods to uncover how interactions between environmental factors affecting pathogen population dynamics and human demographic characteristics determine human risk for three tick-borne diseases: Lyme disease, human granulocytic anaplasmosis, and babesiosis. The results of my project will be used to create a risk map to predict the spatial and temporal occurrence of tickborne diseases, which can inform public health strategies in order to mitigate disease burden.",The Environmental and Human Factors that Determine Ixodes scapularis-borne Diseases Incidence,9758579,F31AI133871,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Affect', 'Anaplasma phagocytophilum', 'Anaplasmosis', 'Area', 'Award', 'Babesia microti', 'Babesiosis', 'Bayesian Analysis', 'Bayesian learning', 'Behavior', 'Big Data', 'Big Data Methods', 'Bite', 'Black-legged Tick', 'Borrelia burgdorferi', 'Characteristics', 'Climate', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Contracts', 'Dangerousness', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Decision Trees', 'Disease', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Ecological Change', 'Ecology', 'Emerging Communicable Diseases', 'Entomology', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemic', 'Epidemiological trend', 'Future', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Human Characteristics', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Linear Regressions', 'Link', 'Lyme Disease', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'New York', 'Pattern', 'Population', 'Population Dynamics', 'Predisposition', 'Preparation', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Statistical Methods', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Temperature', 'Tick-Borne Diseases', 'Tick-Borne Infections', 'Ticks', 'Time', 'Training', 'Uncertainty', 'United States', 'Variant', 'Vector-transmitted infectious disease', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'anthropogenesis', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'cost effective', 'decision tree learning', 'demographics', 'disorder risk', 'environmental change', 'geographic population', 'granulocyte', 'human disease', 'human pathogen', 'improved', 'infection risk', 'learning strategy', 'model design', 'novel strategies', 'pathogen', 'pathogen exposure', 'predictive modeling', 'regression trees', 'spatial temporal variation', 'statistics', 'tick-borne pathogen', 'trend', 'vector', 'vector control', 'vector transmission']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,F31,2019,45016,0.01754175273569207
"Genome Based Influenza Vaccine Strain Selection  using Machine Learning ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Influenza A virus causes both pandemic and seasonal outbreaks, leading to loss of from thousands to millions of human lives within a short time period. Vaccination is the best option to prevent and minimize the effects of influenza outbreaks. Rapid selection of a well-matched influenza vaccine strain is the key to developing an effective vaccination program. However, this is a non-trivial task due to three major challenges in influenza vaccine strain selection: labor an time intensive virus isolation and serology-based antigenic characterization, poor growth of selected strains in chicken embryonic eggs during production, and biased sampling in influenza surveillance. Each year, many scientists worldwide, including thousands from the United States, are working altogether to select an optimal vaccine strain. However, incorrect vaccine strains have still been frequently chosen in the past decades.  Recent advances in genomic sequencing allow us to rapidly and economically sequence influenza genomes from the isolates and from the clinical samples. Sequencing influenza genomes has become a routine and important component in influenza surveillance. The objectives of this project are to develop a sequence-based strategy for influenza antigenic variant identification and to optimize vaccine strain selection using genomic data. To achieve these aims, we will develop machine learning based computational methods to estimate antigenic distances among influenza viruses by directly using their genome sequences. We will then identify the key residues and mutations in influenza genomes affecting influenza antigenic drift events. Such information will allow us to select most promising virus strains as candidates for vaccine production. Since economical virus production requires the selected virus strains to grow easily in chicken embryonic eggs, we also propose the development of a machine learning based method that can predict the growth ability of a virus strain based on its sequence information. This integrated genome based influenza vaccine strain selection system will be developed for detecting antigenic variants for influenza A viruses.  This project will help us provide fundamental technology that employs genomic signatures determining influenza antigenicity and growth ability in chicken embryonic eggs, which are the two key issues for efficient and effective influenza vaccine strain development. The resulting genome based vaccine strain selection strategy will significantly reduce the human labor needed for serological characterization, decrease the time required to select an effective strain that will grow well in eggs, and increase the likelihood of correct influenza vaccine candidate selection. Thus, this project will lead to significant technological advances in influenza prevention and control. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:     This study is to develop and validate a genome based strategy for influenza vaccine strain selection, and it will lead to significant technological advances in influenza prevention and control.",Genome Based Influenza Vaccine Strain Selection  using Machine Learning,9610628,R01AI116744,"['Affect', 'Africa', 'Algorithms', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Area', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological Assay', 'Chickens', 'Clinical', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Effectiveness', 'Embryo', 'Epidemic', 'Event', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Head', 'Hemagglutination', 'Hemagglutinin', 'Human', 'Immunology procedure', 'Influenza', 'Influenza A virus', 'Influenza prevention', 'Infrastructure', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mutagenesis', 'Mutation', 'Phenotype', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Production', 'Proteins', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Biases', 'Scientist', 'Seasons', 'Serologic tests', 'Serological', 'Ships', 'Site', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Surveillance Program', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States', 'Vaccination', 'Vaccine Production', 'Vaccines', 'Variant', 'Viral', 'Virus', 'Work', 'base', 'candidate selection', 'egg', 'experimental study', 'genome sequencing', 'genomic data', 'genomic signature', 'improved', 'influenza outbreak', 'influenza surveillance', 'influenza virus vaccine', 'influenzavirus', 'learning strategy', 'multi-task learning', 'multitask', 'new technology', 'novel', 'pandemic disease', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'receptor binding', 'vaccine candidate']",NIAID,MISSISSIPPI STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,224899,0.01980651705795075
"Using data science to measure the impact of opioid agonist therapy in patients admitted with Staphylococcus aureus bloodstream infections PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT This career development award will provide early career support for investigation of the management of infec- tious diseases in the setting of addiction in hospitals. The award will provide support for the candidate to develop expertise in the following areas: 1) addiction science research; 2) natural language processing; 3) machine learn- ing; 4) professional development; and 5) responsible conduct of research. For this, Dr. Goodman-Meza will be mentored by a multidisciplinary, cross-institutional team with expertise in addiction, infectious diseases, and data science. His primary mentor, Dr. Steve Shoptaw, has an extensive track record in addiction-related research and training of future independent investigators. His co-mentors include Dr. Alex Bui and Dr. Matthew B. Goetz. Dr. Bui is an expert in biomedical data science and heads NIH training programs in this field. Dr. Goetz has broad experience of productive infectious diseases clinical research within the Veterans Health Administration (VHA). The current opioid epidemic in the United States has been associated with an increase in infections, in particular hepatitis C and bacterial infections. Bacterial infections are the leading infectious diagnosis leading to hospitali- zation in individuals with an opioid use disorder (OUD), and incur significant healthcare expenditures. Despite the availability of opioid agonist therapy (OAT) in the form of methadone or buprenorphine, less than 20% of people with OUD actually receive OAT. Hospitalization for a bacterial infection may be an ideal time to initiate OAT, but the benefits of this practice are unknown. In this proposal, the candidate will assess the impact of initiating OAT in people who inject opioids admitted to the VHA due to a Staphylococcus aureus blood stream infection (bacteremia) – the most common bacterial pathogen among people who inject opioids. Using data already collected for 36,868 cases of S. aureus bacteremia (SAB) from the VHA electronic data repository, the candidate will address three research questions: 1) is a natural language processing algorithm (NLP) more ac- curate than a standard International Classification of Diseases (ICD) code-based approach at screening records to correctly identify individuals who inject opioids in a cohort of patients admitted with SAB; 2) what are the temporal and geographic trends of SAB in people who inject opioids and those who receive OAT at the facility- level; and 3) using a machine learning framework, what are the estimated impacts of OAT on patient centered outcomes – death, readmissions, leaving against medical advice, and subsequent outpatient engagement in OAT. These formative data will help the candidate to establish a productive early career as a physician-scientist and advise development of an OAT-delivery strategy to mitigate infectious complications of injection opioid use. Through this award, Dr. Goodman-Meza will establish himself as an expert physician-scientist at the intersection of infectious disease and addiction, poised to make significant contributions to this important area of medicine. PROJECT NARRATIVE Serious, life-threatening bacterial infections in people who inject drugs are increasing with the current national opioid epidemic. Hospitalization of people who use opioids for treatment of infectious complications may be an ideal time to initiate opioid agonist therapy (OAT), an evidence-based practice that has been historically underuti- lized. This project will use innovative data science methods to estimate the impact of initiating OAT in the hospital for patients with a history of opioid injection admitted for treatment of blood stream infections caused by Staph- ylococcus aureus in the Veterans Health Administration.",Using data science to measure the impact of opioid agonist therapy in patients admitted with Staphylococcus aureus bloodstream infections,9721752,K08DA048163,"['Acute suppurative arthritis due to bacteria', 'Address', 'Admission activity', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Award', 'Bacteremia', 'Bacteria', 'Bacterial Infections', 'Behavior', 'Blood', 'Brain', 'Buprenorphine', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical Research', 'Coagulation Process', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease Outcome', 'Distant', 'Drug usage', 'Economic Burden', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Embolism', 'Endocarditis', 'Epidemic', 'Equipment', 'Evidence based practice', 'Future', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'HIV risk', 'Head', 'Health', 'Health Expenditures', 'Heart', 'Hepatitis C', 'Hepatitis C Transmission', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Immunosuppression', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Injecting drug user', 'International Classification of Disease Codes', 'Investigation', 'Joints', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Kidney', 'Life', 'Location', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Methadone', 'Methods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Practice Guidelines', 'Predisposition', 'Recording of previous events', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Sepsis', 'Services', 'Staphylococcus aureus', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stream', 'Testing', 'Thrombus', 'Time', 'Training Programs', 'Travel', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Veterans', 'Water', 'Work', 'addiction', 'base', 'blood treatment', 'career', 'classification algorithm', 'cohort', 'data format', 'data warehouse', 'efficacy testing', 'electronic data', 'experience', 'health administration', 'heroin use', 'hospital readmission', 'improved', 'injection drug use', 'innovation', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'opioid agonist therapy', 'opioid epidemic', 'opioid injection', 'opioid misuse', 'opioid use', 'opioid use disorder', 'overdose death', 'pathogenic bacteria', 'pathogenic virus', 'prescription opioid', 'responsible research conduct', 'screening', 'skin microbiota', 'time interval', 'treatment services', 'trend', 'viral transmission']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,K08,2019,203040,0.039508245625350616
"Accelerating phage evolution and tools via synthetic biology and machine learning Summary Phages, which are the naturally evolved predators of bacteria, may hold the key to combating bacterial pathogens, including the looming threat of multidrug resistant bacteria. Phages are viruses which while harmless to humans and have been successfully engineered as tools to separate, concentrate, and detect their bacterial hosts. Additionally, phages have been used as therapeutic agents to treat patients infected with pathogens resistant to known antibiotics. While the potential benefits of phages are numerous, certain limitations must be addressed in order to fully employ them. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that both top-down and bottom-up approaches can be utilized to design and synthesize novel phages, through a combination of synthetic biology and machine learning. This will result in phage-based tools with increased functionality and customizable host ranges. The rationale for the proposed research is that as the threat of bacterial infections including those with multi-drug resistance continues to grow, phages, which have evolved to efficiently recognize and kill bacteria, will become indispensable tools. Therefore, the ability to rapidly design and engineer new phages for biosensing and therapeutics will be a critical advantage to human health. The proposal contains three specific aims which are supported by preliminary data and cited literature. Aim 1: Site-directed conjugation for advanced phage-based biosensors and therapeutics. Under this aim, phages will be modified with alkyne-containing unnatural amino acids allowing their direct conjugation to 1) azide decorated magnetic nanoparticles, and 2) azide terminated polyethylene glycol. The modifications will allow the development of magnetic phages for bacteria separation and detection, and phages that are more effective therapeutics due to their ability to avoid a patient’s innate immune response, respectively. Aim 2: Decoding phage biorecognition elements using machine learning. In this aim, machine learning will be used to model the binding of phages and their bacterial hosts. The model will enable the prediction of host interactions as well as allow the design and synthesis of novel phage tail fibers which can target specific bacterial isolates. Aim 3: Repurposing phage biorecognition for a broader host ranges. Under the final aim, phage-binding proteins will be replaced with those known to recognize conserved regions of the bacterial LPS, resulting in a phage with a much broader host range. This approach is innovative because it uses top-down characterizations for bottom-up design and synthesis of novel phages. Traditional phage screening methods will be replaced with the rapid synthesis of phages, which are optimized for a particular bacterial isolate. Following the successful completion of the specific aims, the expected outcome is the design and synthesis of phages that can be used to target a selected group of bacteria within Enterobacteriaceae for advanced biosensing and therapeutics. A publically available computer model will allow rapid design of custom phage biorecognition elements which can be added to functionalized phages. These technologies will allow researchers to tip the scales of the co-evolutionary arms race between phage and bacteria. Narrative The project is relevant to public health because it accelerates the development of phage-based tools for the rapid detection of bacterial pathogens in human, food, and environmental samples, and the treatment of diseases from multidrug resistant bacteria by integrating machine learning and synthetic biology. Thus, it is specifically relevant to part of NIH's mission that pertains to the diagnosis, prevention, and cure of human diseases.",Accelerating phage evolution and tools via synthetic biology and machine learning,9714883,R01EB027895,"['Acinetobacter baumannii', 'Address', 'Alkynes', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Antibiotic Resistance', 'Antibiotic Therapy', 'Antibiotics', 'Azides', 'Bacteria', 'Bacterial Genome', 'Bacterial Infections', 'Bacteriophage T4', 'Bacteriophages', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Biosensing Techniques', 'Biosensor', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'Capsid', 'Chemistry', 'Clinical', 'Computer Simulation', 'Consumption', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Drug resistance', 'Elements', 'Engineering', 'Enterobacteriaceae', 'Environment', 'Escherichia coli', 'Evolution', 'Family', 'Fiber', 'Food', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Infection', 'Innate Immune Response', 'Innate Immune System', 'Intervention', 'Life', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic nanoparticles', 'Magnetism', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Multi-Drug Resistance', 'Multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter', 'Multiple Bacterial Drug Resistance', 'Natural Immunity', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Polyethylene Glycols', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Race', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Sampling', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'Surface', 'System', 'Tail', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Viral', 'Virus', 'arm', 'base', 'combat', 'design', 'human disease', 'innovation', 'next generation', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'pathogenic bacteria', 'rapid detection', 'receptor', 'resistance mechanism', 'screening', 'synthetic biology', 'tool', 'unnatural amino acids']",NIBIB,CORNELL UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,666637,0.028843073151187365
"Statistical methods for real-time forecasts of infectious disease: dynamic time-series and machine learning approaches PROJECT SUMMARY The past decade of biomedical research has borne witness to rapid growth in data and computational methods. A fundamental challenge for the scientific community in the 21st century is learning how to turn this deluge of data into evidence that can inform decision-making about improving health and preventing illness at the individual and population levels. The emerging field of real-time infectious disease forecasting is a prime example of a research area with great potential for leveraging modern analytical methods to maximize the impact on public health. Infectious diseases exact an enormous toll on global health each year. Improved real- time forecasts of infectious disease outbreaks can inform targeted intervention and prevention strategies, such as increased healthcare staffing or vector control measures. However we currently have a limited understanding of the best ways to integrate these types of forecasts into real-time public health decision- making. The central research activities of this project are (1) to develop and validate a suite of robust, real-time statistical prediction models for infectious diseases, (2) we will develop and evaluate an ensemble time-series prediction methodology for integrating multiple prediction models into a single forecast, and (3) to develop a collaborative platform for dissemination and evaluation of predictions by different research teams. Additionally, we will develop a suite of open-source educational modules to train researchers and public health officials in developing, validating, and implementing time-series forecasting, with a focus on real-time infectious disease applications.

"Engineering a diagnostic platform for rapid breath-based respiratory pathogen identification and treatment monitoring Project Summary Acute respiratory infections (ARIs) are caused by a number of bacterial, viral, and fungal pathogens and pathogen identification is needed to administer the correct treatment. However, due to the lagtime in standard biochemical assays and antimicrobial susceptibility testing, clinicians have come to depend on broad-spectrum, empirical treatment which contributes to both drug resistance and patient death. The goal of this project is to develop a breath test for rapid pathogen identification and treatment monitoring in ARI to facilitate more immediate, targeted treatment in the clinic. The current proposal is focused on bacterial pathogen identification with future goals to expand to viral and fungal pathogens. Substrate cleavage assays are currently used to query bacterial protease activity and can be used to rapidly and accurately classify bacteria down to the species level. Leveraging the protease-responsive nanosensor platform in the Bhatia lab, the goal of this proposal is to develop inhalable multiplexed nanosensors that release volatile reporters into the breath in response to infection- associated proteases in the lung. From there, we can generate breath “fingerprints” for pathogens common in ARIs such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) (P. aeruginosa, S. aureus, K. pneumoniae, E. coli, S. pneumoniae, and H. influenzae). Furthermore, changes in proteolytic activity after the start of antimicrobial treatment can be used to generate a “good response” and “poor response” breath signature for more timely evaluation of drug efficacy. To this end, the specific aims of this project are the following: (1) establish a volatile- barcoding system for peptide substrates (2) build and validate an inhalable multiplexed system of protease nanosensors for pathogen identification and (3) investigate use of multiplexed protease nanosensors for monitoring response to antibiotic treatment. Aim 1 will be completed by identifying volatile reporter candidates that can be attached to peptide substrates without deleterious effects on cleavage kinetics, protease specificity, and breath signal. Once identified, volatile reporters will be isotope-labeled to create a panel of reporters with similar volatility differing only by mass. Peptides with orthogonal susceptibility to host and pathogen proteases will then be identified in Aim 2 by screening a peptide library against bacterial culture supernatants and bronchioalveolar lavage from infected mice. Peptides will then be barcoded using the VOC mass labels designed in Aim 1 and then formulated into inhalable nanosensors by attachment to a nanoparticle core. The resulting nanosensor panel will be delivered via intratracheal injection into mice infected with one of the six VAP pathogens. Machine learning will be used to generate a statistical classifier to identify pathogens based on reporter levels in breath and will be used to further identify reporter signatures for good and poor response to antibiotic treatment. Successful completion of these aims would result in a diagnostic platform that can potentially be expanded for rapid identification of an exhaustive list of respiratory pathogens, including viral and fungal pathogens. Rapid identification of the cause of respiratory infection is necessary to prescribe the correct drugs for treatment. In the following work, we propose to develop tiny, inhalable bacteria sensors for a breathalyzer test that would enable rapid identification of infectious bacteria in the lung. This would allow the correct drugs to be prescribed and prevent antibiotic overuse which contributes to the growing problem of drug resistance.",Engineering a diagnostic platform for rapid breath-based respiratory pathogen identification and treatment monitoring,9805608,K99EB028311,"['Acute respiratory infection', 'Aftercare', 'Animals', 'Antibiotic Therapy', 'Antibiotics', 'Antimicrobial susceptibility', 'Bacteria', 'Bacterial Pneumonia', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Assay', 'Blinded', 'Blood', 'Breath Tests', 'Breathalyzer Tests', 'Bronchoalveolar Lavage', 'Cessation of life', 'Chemicals', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Drug Evaluation', 'Drug resistance', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Engineering', 'Enzymes', 'Escherichia coli', 'Esters', 'Fingerprint', 'Fluorocarbons', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Haemophilus influenzae', 'Hydroxyl Radical', 'Immune response', 'In Vitro', 'Infection', 'Inhalation', 'Injections', 'Isotope Labeling', 'Kinetics', 'Klebsiella pneumonia bacterium', 'Label', 'Leukocyte Elastase', 'Libraries', 'Ligands', 'Liposomes', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Mus', 'Patients', 'Peptide Hydrolases', 'Peptide Library', 'Peptides', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Predisposition', 'Property', 'Pseudomonas aeruginosa', 'Randomized', 'Reporter', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Respiratory Tract Infections', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specificity', 'Sputum', 'Staphylococcus aureus', 'Streptococcus pneumoniae', 'Survival Rate', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Validation', 'Work', 'antimicrobial', 'antimicrobial drug', 'base', 'biomaterial compatibility', 'classification algorithm', 'cohort', 'design', 'drug efficacy', 'exhaustion', 'extracellular', 'in vivo', 'mouse model', 'nanoparticle', 'nanosensors', 'outcome forecast', 'pathogen', 'pathogenic bacteria', 'pathogenic fungus', 'pathogenic virus', 'portability', 'pressure', 'prevent', 'random forest', 'resistant strain', 'respiratory', 'response', 'screening', 'sensor', 'targeted treatment', 'thioester', 'urinary', 'vapor', 'ventilator-associated pneumonia', 'volatile organic compound']",NIBIB,MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,K99,2019,87484,0.03661391424997521
"Identifying Risk Factors for Antibiotic Resistance via Integration of Epidemiology and Metagenomics PROJECT SUMMARY Given the growing burden of antimicrobial resistance (AR) and lack of effective therapies for multi-drug resistant organisms, the development of new tools or models which risk-stratify patients for colonization and infection by AR bacteria is of paramount importance, particularly in high-risk populations. The significance of the gut microbiome in mediating colonization resistance against drug resistant pathogens as well as the role of microbiota-depleting antibiotics in the development of AR infections is being increasingly appreciated. However, there is currently a deficiency of methods integrating microbiome and antibiotic factors into AR- predictive algorithms. Thus, the overall objective of the proposed research is to improve understanding of the factors driving the epidemiology of AR-colonization and infection by incorporating metagenomic and antibiotic administration data of a well-defined clinical cohort. In this proposal, we focus on patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (from whom we have already collected extensive longitudinal stool samples and performed 16S rRNA gene sequencing) because of the high rates of AR pathogen colonization and severe risk for infection. The overarching hypothesis that will be tested is that the baseline presence of a limited number of key bacterial species and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) are critical for the risk of colonization and/or infection with an AR pathogen when combined with the administration of specific antimicrobials. We will begin our research by comprehensively determining the epidemiology of AR pathogen colonization and AR infection in our cohort via culture based stool sample analyses and clinical chart review, respectively. Using shotgun metagenomics, we will establish whether the baseline intestinal microbiome species and resistome characteristics are associated with the acquisition of AR pathogens colonizing or causing infection. Similarly, we will ascertain the relationship between antimicrobial exposure, microbiome disruption, and subsequent AR emergence. The data from these studies will be integrated into Decision Tree (DT) and Random Forest (RF) models to improve the prediction of AR pathogen colonization and AR infection outcomes. The proposed career development award, which utilizes the expertise of a superlative mentorship team and a uniquely designed research and training plan, will enable me the opportunity to build upon my current expertise in microbiology, genomics, and molecular epidemiology by adding advanced training in shotgun metagenomic analyses, bioinformatics, and biostatistical modeling. Moreover, the numerous resources and support provided by my institution and mentoring team will ensure my successful transition to an independent investigator as well as establish a strong foundation for my long-term goals of understanding and mitigating the impact of antimicrobial resistance in human health via integration of multiple –omics platforms and provision of personalized genomic-based medicine. PROJECT NARRATIVE Antibiotic resistant (AR) infections are one of the most serious public health threats and a leading cause of morbidity and mortality, particularly in immunocompromised patients. The proposed research will use a combination of culture-based techniques and high-throughput approaches to determine the epidemiology of colonization and infectious events by AR-pathogens, characterize the gut microbiome, and mine clinical data of acute leukemia patients receiving chemotherapy in order to identify microbial species, antibiotic resistance genes, patient features, and antibiotic administration factors that affect the risk for colonization and/or infection with an AR pathogen. The ultimate goal of the proposed research is to exploit metagenomics as an epidemiological tool for understanding susceptibility to AR outcomes and to build predictive risk models which can be potentially incorporated into prevention and intervention strategies to mitigate AR infection events in high-risk patients.",Identifying Risk Factors for Antibiotic Resistance via Integration of Epidemiology and Metagenomics,9717421,K01AI143881,"['16S ribosomal RNA sequencing', 'Acute Myelocytic Leukemia', 'Acute leukemia', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Anti-Infective Agents', 'Antibiotic Resistance', 'Antibiotics', 'Antimicrobial Resistance', 'Area', 'Automobile Driving', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biometry', 'Blood Circulation', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Decision Trees', 'Development', 'Elements', 'Ensure', 'Epidemiology', 'Event', 'Foundations', 'Freezing', 'Future', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hematologic Neoplasms', 'Human', 'Immunocompromised Host', 'Infection', 'Infection Control', 'Institution', 'Intestines', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Longitudinal cohort study', 'Mediating', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Metadata', 'Metagenomics', 'Methods', 'Microbiology', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Epidemiology', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Prevention', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Public Health', 'ROC Curve', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Resistance to infection', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Studies', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Shotguns', 'Source', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Trees', 'Validation', 'Weight', 'antimicrobial', 'bacterial resistance', 'base', 'career', 'chemotherapy', 'cohort', 'colonization resistance', 'commensal microbes', 'drug resistant pathogen', 'effective therapy', 'emerging antimicrobial resistance', 'genomic epidemiology', 'gut microbiome', 'gut microbiota', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'improved', 'infection risk', 'leukemia', 'metagenomic sequencing', 'microbial', 'microbiome', 'microbiota', 'mortality', 'multi-drug resistant pathogen', 'multiple omics', 'pathogen', 'patient stratification', 'patient subsets', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'rRNA Genes', 'random forest', 'resistance gene', 'skills', 'stool sample', 'tool']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF TX MD ANDERSON CAN CTR,K01,2019,110387,0.07579682747475547
"Seroepidemiologic methods to identify hotspots of trachoma and predict future infection Project Summary / Abstract Background: Trachoma, caused by ocular infection with Chlamydia trachomatis, is the leading cause of infectious blindness worldwide and has been targeted for global elimination as a public health problem by 2020. This goal will be achieved in many countries, but some regions in Ethiopia maintain persistently high levels of infection despite >10 years of intensive control activities. A small proportion of the population likely harbors the majority of trachoma infections, with foci of infection (“hotspots”) at or below the village scale; the operational challenge is accurately predicting where they are with existing data. Advances in machine learning and spatial data science have demonstrated marked improvements in the spatial resolution of predictions for diseases like malaria. Among available biomarkers of trachoma, IgG antibody responses in children could enable more accurate predictions because they integrate exposure over time and reflect recent transmission. Aims: The principal aims of this study are to evaluate whether antibody measurements can identify stable hotspots of trachoma infection, and whether a novel machine learning approach can accurately predict village- level trachoma infection forward in time (up to 3 years). We hypothesize that infection will be concentrated in the population and that hotspots of infection will be at the village level. We further hypothesize that antibody measurements in young children will provide a stable source of information about trachoma transmission that will enable us to accurately predict villages with high levels of future C. trachomatis infection. Methods: To test our hypotheses, we will draw on measurements from a well characterized population across 40 villages enrolled in a NIH-funded cluster randomized trial in Ethiopia’s Amhara Region (U10-EY023939). The three-year trial is designed to measure the effect of improved water, sanitation, and handwashing (WASH) on trachoma infection in the absence of azithromycin treatment. The trial has collected clinical and biomarker measurements from approximately 2,400 children ages 0-9 years at enrollment and in annual visits over 3 years. We will characterize the spatial scale of transmission using the !-statistic, which equals the relative risk of infection within different distances of cases. We will use a permutation-based, spatial scan statistic to identify hotspots using IgG antibody and PCR measures in each year, and will determine if they are stable over time. Using geospatial ensemble machine learning, we will predict trachoma seroprevalence as a function of remotely sensed, geospatial information and limited enrollment characteristics. We will rank order villages by predicted seroprevalence, and will assess the proportion of PCR C. trachomatis infections in top-ranked villages 1, 2, and 3 years later. We will repeat the analysis using predicted clinical symptoms as a comparator. The development of methods to make accurate, fine-scale predictions of future C. trachomatis infection will lay the groundwork for a future adaptive randomized trial that preferentially allocates more intensive intervention to villages predicted at enrollment to have high future levels of infection. Project Narrative / Lay Language Description Trachoma is the leading cause of infectious blindness worldwide and has been targeted for global elimination as a public health problem by 2020. Trachoma control programs target and monitor activities at the level of districts, but it is likely that infection hotspots are concentrated at much smaller scales and could be missed in district-level averages. We propose to combine antibody-based measures of exposure with state-of-the-art machine learning to develop predictions of trachoma infection at the scale of individual villages in the Amhara region of Ethiopia, which would represent a substantial increase in the resolution of information available to guide control and monitoring efforts.",Seroepidemiologic methods to identify hotspots of trachoma and predict future infection,9805550,R03AI147128,"['Age', 'Antibiotics', 'Antibodies', 'Antibody Response', 'Area', 'Azithromycin', 'Biological Markers', 'Blindness', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Chlamydia trachomatis', 'Cholera', 'Clinical', 'Cluster randomized trial', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Enrollment', 'Ethiopia', 'Eye Infections', 'Face', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Handwashing', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hygiene', 'Immunoglobulin G', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Intervention', 'Language', 'Machine Learning', 'Malaria', 'Masks', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Public Health', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Relative Risks', 'Resolution', 'Sanitation', 'Scanning', 'Serological', 'Seroprevalences', 'Source', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Trachoma', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Visit', 'Water', 'Work', 'World Health Organization', 'base', 'clinical biomarkers', 'clinical predictors', 'design', 'high risk population', 'improved', 'infection risk', 'learning strategy', 'method development', 'novel', 'population based', 'programs', 'randomized trial', 'remote sensing', 'sample collection', 'sex', 'transmission process']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,R03,2019,1299,0.03198358969481502
"Point-of-care antimicrobial susceptibility testing based on simultaneous tracking of multi-phenotypic features of single bacterial cells ABSTRACT Antibiotic resistance has become a significant public health threat. To combat the problem, a rapid pathogen identification (ID) and antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) technology is needed to provide timely diagno- sis of resistant infections and delivery of accurate antibiotic treatment at primary health-care settings, includ- ing hospitals and point-of-care (POC). The present project aims to develop a point-of-care AST (POCASTTM) technology based on a large-image-volume microscopy technique that enables direct detection of individual bacterial cells in clinical samples without culturing or pathogen isolation, and a machine-learning model that allows fast determination of pathogen and susceptibility. To establish the technology, the project will focus on urinary tract infections (UTIs). UTIs affect millions of people annually, and the pathogens that usually cause UTIs are the organisms that pose the highest threat of antimicrobial resistance, including carbapenem- resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) and extended spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Enterobacteri- aceae. This project will focus on: 1) developing the large-image-volume microscopy and machine learning model for simultaneous tracking of multi-phenotypic features of single bacterial cells directly in patient urine sample, and performing rapid automatic pathogen ID and AST for UTIs; 2) building prototype instrument, and 3) validating the instrument for UTIs using large scale clinical samples. Successful development and validation of the tech- nology will enable precise antibiotic prescription on the same day of patient visit. The project will be carried out by a multidisciplinary team with expertise in biosensors (Biodesign Center for Bioelectronics and Biosensors, ASU), microbiology and infectious diseases (Biodesign Center for Immuno- therapy, Vaccines and Virotherapy, ASU), biomedical instrument development and production (Biosensing Instrument Inc.), and clinical testing (Clinical Microbiology Laboratory, Mayo Clinic). ! PROJECT NARRATIVE This project will develop a culture-independent technology for point-of-care diagnosis of antimicrobial-resistant bacteria in urinary tract infections within 3 hours, by imaging urine samples directly with an innovative large- image-volume imaging technique and analyzing the data with a machine-learning model. Successful devel- opment of the technology will enable precise antibiotic prescriptions and accurate treatment of the patient on the same day of visit. !",Point-of-care antimicrobial susceptibility testing based on simultaneous tracking of multi-phenotypic features of single bacterial cells,9748417,R01AI138993,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Antibiotic Resistance', 'Antibiotic Therapy', 'Antibiotics', 'Antimicrobial Resistance', 'Antimicrobial susceptibility', 'Arizona', 'Bacterial Infections', 'Biosensing Techniques', 'Biosensor', 'Blood Cells', 'Care Technology Points', 'Categories', 'Cells', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Microbiology', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Computer software', 'Crystallization', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Device or Instrument Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Enterobacteriaceae', 'Extended-spectrum β-lactamase', 'Face', 'Growth', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Immunotherapy', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Microbiology', 'Microscope', 'Microscopy', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Motion', 'Optics', 'Organism', 'Pathogen detection', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Pilot Projects', 'Predisposition', 'Primary Health Care', 'Production', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Specificity', 'Speed', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Urinary tract infection', 'Urine', 'Vaccines', 'Validation', 'Virotherapy', 'Visit', 'Work', 'antimicrobial', 'bacterial resistance', 'base', 'carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinically relevant', 'combat', 'density', 'design', 'health care settings', 'image processing', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'light scattering', 'machine learning algorithm', 'multidisciplinary', 'pathogen', 'point of care', 'prototype', 'research clinical testing', 'technology development', 'technology validation']",NIAID,ARIZONA STATE UNIVERSITY-TEMPE CAMPUS,R01,2019,991540,0.055476258874413945
"High-Resolution Inference for Correlates of Vaccine Protection Project Summary/Abstract Statisticians play in a key role in quantifying the uncertainty in ﬁndings from clinical trials, observational studies, and other data sources, thereby enabling rational decision making based on the ﬁndings and protecting against the human tendency to see signal in noise. Ideally the validity of the uncertainty quantiﬁcation, also known as statistical inference, will be agnostic in the sense that it avoids reliance on implausible assumptions, thereby improving the interpretability and credibility of the resulting ﬁnd- ings. There has been much progress over the last several decades in obtaining agnostic inference of population-level quantities, such as (i) the percent reduction in infection in vaccinees compared to place- bos or (ii) the average treatment effect if the entire population receives treatment versus control. There has been relatively little progress, on the other hand, in obtaining agnostic inference of higher-resolution quantities, such as (i) the percent reduction in the probability of infection in vaccinees compared to place- bos, conditional on a continuous measure of immune response or (ii) the average treatment effect for an individual based on a high-dimensional set of observed covariates. These high-resolution quantities are function-valued in the sense that they are respectively deﬁned as functions of immune response and subject covariates. While inference for high-resolution quantities can be obtained when one is willing to commit to strong assumptions on the observed data distribution, these methods are plagued by the same deﬁciencies of poor interpretability and damaged credibility faced by non-agnostic inferential procedures for population-valued quantities. In contrast to the limited progress on obtaining inference for more reﬁned quantities, there has been considerable progress towards obtaining inference-free point estimates of (i) the percent reduction in infection probability conditional on immune response markers and (ii) the average treatment effect conditional on covariates. This progress has come from several ﬁelds, including statistics, machine learning, and computer science. This proposal outlines a uniﬁed methodology for obtaining inference for high-resolution quantities, where the proposal draws inspiration from a framework developed for population-level quantities, namely targeted minimum loss-based estimation, but features highly original developments that enable inference for higher-resolution, function-valued quantities. This work has the potential to make a major impact on the identiﬁcation of individual-level variables that correlate with vaccine efﬁcacy, including in identifying individuals who will be harmed by the only licensed dengue vaccine and in identify vaccine-induced immune responses that correlate with prevention in two ongoing HIV vaccine efﬁcacy trials. The potential for broad impacts to other areas of biomedical research, including precision medicine, are also described. Project Narrative The statistics and machine learning communities have made remarkable progress in developing highly ﬂexible data mining procedures that, for example, enable (i) the identiﬁcation of potentially protective vaccine-induced immune responses and (ii) the prediction of the optimal treatment for a given individual. Despite this progress, there has been little progress in quantifying the uncertainty in the output of these ﬂexible procedures without making implausible assumptions on the mechanism that generated the data, where the likely failure of these assumptions renders it difﬁcult to make (i) informed vaccine development decisions based on the identiﬁed immune response or (ii) treatment decisions based on the predicted optimal treatment. The proposed work develops a uniﬁed methodology for quantifying the uncertainty in estimates obtained using these data mining techniques, thereby enabling informed decision making.",High-Resolution Inference for Correlates of Vaccine Protection,9774603,DP2LM013340,"['Area', 'Biomedical Research', 'Breathing', 'Clinical Trials', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Decision Making', 'Dengue Vaccine', 'Development', 'Failure', 'HIV vaccine', 'Human', 'Immune response', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Noise', 'Observational Study', 'Output', 'Placebos', 'Play', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Probability', 'Procedures', 'Resolution', 'Signal Transduction', 'Techniques', 'Uncertainty', 'Vaccines', 'Work', 'base', 'computer science', 'data mining', 'efficacy trial', 'flexibility', 'high dimensionality', 'immune function', 'improved', 'learning community', 'optimal treatments', 'precision medicine', 'response biomarker', 'statistics', 'treatment effect', 'vaccine development', 'vaccine efficacy']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,DP2,2019,2332500,0.00346101313251867
"Precision immunoprofiling to reveal diagnostic biomarkers of latent TB infection PROJECT SUMMARY  Tuberculosis (TB) is among the leading causes of mortality worldwide with an estimated 2 billion individuals currently infected. Latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) is the most common form of TB infection affecting 13 million Americans. While many with LTBI remain asymptomatic, an estimated 10% of immunocompetent patients with LTBI will reactivate to active TB, and will become infectious. LTBI is treatable with a prolonged antibiotic treatment; however, potential side effects motivate the development of new diagnostic approaches that can identify with high specificity patients at the highest risk of reactivation, for who therapy would be most beneficial.  The tuberculin skin test (TST) and interferon-γ release assays (IGRAs) are commonly used for TB and LTBI screening. Both tests provide good measures of TB exposure; however, neither is effective at diagnosing LTBI (positive predictive values <5%). Moreover, neither provide any prognostic stratification based upon reactivation risk. Both the TST and IGRAs probe immunological memory to TB-related antigen challenges and we hypothesize that a more nuanced and personalized approach to monitoring immune responses to both TB- specific and non-specific antigens might reveal new approaches to LTBI diagnosis and patient stratification.  Enabling a new, individualized approach to LTBI diagnostics, we propose to combine high throughput, multiplexed inflammatory biomarker detection strategies and powerful bioinformatics tools that allow for the identification of previously obscured multi-marker diagnostic signatures of LTBI status and reactivation risk. Silicon photonic microring resonators are an enabling technology for biomarker analysis due to their intrinsic scalability and multiplexing capabilities. Applied to the detection of cytokine panels, this technology supports the rapid immune profiling of individual samples under both TB-specific and non-specific antigen stimulation conditions. Machine learning algorithms will be utilized to analyze the resulting dense data streams to facilitate selection of key diagnostic signatures forming the basis for predictive model development and deployment. This powerful analytical combination is supplemented by deep expertise in clinical diagnosis and treatment of TB and LTBI, and an enabling collaboration and connection to subjects from an international location with high TB burden and exposure in a healthcare worker population subjected to regularly-scheduled and repeated LTBI screening.  The resulting diagnostic workflow and machine learning feature selection approaches will reveal multiplexed biomarker signatures that have strong positive predictive correlation with LTBI status (+ or -). This approach will also further stratify LTBI+ subjects on the basis of reactivation potential, thus providing a fundamentally new approach to identifying subjects that are most likely to benefit from therapeutic intervention. The end result of this project will be a new precision medicine-based diagnostic strategy that is vastly superior to the current state-of-the-art and offers the potential to transform current clinical practice. PROJECT NARRATIVE Tuberculosis (TB) affects an estimated one third of the world’s population and an asymptomatic latent state of tuberculosis infection (LTBI) is extremely common. Unfortunately, there are not any good clinical tests that can definitely diagnose LTBI, making it difficult to identify patients that should be treated to prevent reactivation to active TB, which is infectious. We will integrate cutting edge measurement technologies and machine learning bioinformatic approaches to identify and test multiplexed biomarker signatures that will transform clinical TB management by enabling personalized diagnosis of LTBI and the stratification of individuals with the highest potential for reactivation.",Precision immunoprofiling to reveal diagnostic biomarkers of latent TB infection,9819449,R01AI141591,"['Affect', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Antibiotic Therapy', 'Antibiotics', 'Antigens', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Cytokine Network Pathway', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Eligibility Determination', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health Personnel', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immunocompetent', 'Immunologic Markers', 'Immunologic Memory', 'Immunologic Monitoring', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Inflammatory', 'Informatics', 'Interferons', 'International', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Patients', 'Peripheral', 'Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell', 'Plasma', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Prevention strategy', 'Regimen', 'Residual state', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Schedule', 'Silicon', 'Specificity', 'Stratification', 'Stream', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Translations', 'Tuberculin Test', 'Tuberculosis', 'Whole Blood', 'antigen challenge', 'base', 'bioinformatics tool', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinical practice', 'cytokine', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'high risk', 'immune function', 'immunoregulation', 'improved', 'individual variation', 'latent infection', 'machine learning algorithm', 'model development', 'monocyte', 'mortality', 'novel diagnostics', 'novel strategies', 'patient stratification', 'personalized approach', 'personalized diagnostics', 'photonics', 'precision medicine', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'prognostic', 'prospective', 'response', 'screening', 'side effect', 'targeted treatment', 'tool', 'treatment strategy', 'tuberculosis treatment']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2019,754111,0.04797789291304337
"Integrated Microbial Screening and Antimicrobial Susceptibility Test on Microfluidic Digital Array for Diagnosis of Urinary Tract Infections Abstract COMBiNATi will work with Stanford University to bring the world’s first integrated ID+AST UTI diagnostic platform to the market by combining COMBiNATi’s “one-click” cost-effective dPCR platform with Stanford’s pathogen identification (ID) HRMA algorithm for broad detection, deep characterization and absolute quantification of UTI pathogens. By the end of the Phase 1 project, we will deliver the prototype instrument for ID and AST, scale-ready consumables for dPCR + HRM and culture + qPCR, machine-learning software algorithm for melt curve analysis, and prove the feasibility by identifying and quantifying the top two urinary tract infection bacteria. We will first develop two consumables: an 100k partition ID chip and a 32-lane, 10k partition per lane AST plate based on the micro-injection molding design rules established by COMBiNATi. An integrated system with thermal control and imaging capability will then be developed for HRM and qPCR processes. The prototype system will then be transferred to Stanford University where mock samples including both isolated bacteria and contrived urine samples will be tested on the platform for integrated pathogen ID and AST determination. Narrative Urinary Tract Infection (UTI) is one of the most common community-acquired bacterial infection. However, like other bacterial infections, standard culture-based diagnosis of UTI requires at least 2-3 days from sample acquisition to result reporting. Despite technological advancements, the process remains time- consuming and requires significant technical expertise. Automated instruments remain bulky and still require clonal isolation of the pathogens from the body fluid samples prior to AST. Additionally, the lack of definitive microbiological diagnosis that is rapid enough to achieve evidence-based treatment has driven the over- and misuse of broad-spectrum antibiotics. We believe the proposed integrated ID + AST platform has the potential to enable deep genetic analyses of clinical samples to provide rapid precision UTI triage and MIC determination in a timely and cost-efficient manner to positively impact patient care as well as promote the use of narrow spectrum antibiotics to favorably impact antibiotic resistance profiles.",Integrated Microbial Screening and Antimicrobial Susceptibility Test on Microfluidic Digital Array for Diagnosis of Urinary Tract Infections,9777415,R41AI145604,"['Algorithmic Analysis', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Ampicillin', 'Antibiotic Resistance', 'Antibiotic susceptibility', 'Antibiotics', 'Antimicrobial susceptibility', 'Bacteria', 'Bacterial Infections', 'Biological Assay', 'Body Fluids', 'Ceftriaxone', 'Cell Separation', 'Cells', 'Ciprofloxacin', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Escherichia coli', 'Evidence based treatment', 'Genomic DNA', 'Gentamicins', 'Growth', 'Individual', 'Injections', 'Klebsiella pneumonia bacterium', 'Laboratories', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Microbiology', 'Microfluidics', 'Minimum Inhibitory Concentration measurement', 'Modality', 'Molds', 'Molecular', 'Patient Care', 'Performance', 'Perfusion', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reagent', 'Reporting', 'Resistance profile', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Small Business Technology Transfer Research', 'System', 'Technical Expertise', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Triage', 'Trimethoprim-Sulfamethoxazole', 'Universities', 'Urinary tract infection', 'Urine', 'Uropathogen', 'Work', 'base', 'cost effective', 'cost efficient', 'design', 'digital', 'genetic analysis', 'imaging capabilities', 'instrument', 'melting', 'microbial', 'operation', 'pathogen', 'prototype', 'response', 'scale up', 'screening', 'success']",NIAID,"COMBINATI, INC.",R41,2019,224658,0.059009472704740815
"Interactions between Gut Microbiome Natural Products and Intestinal Helminths Project Summary / Abstract This project will identify the molecular mechanisms through which the gut microbiome interacts with infectious intestinal helminths. Intestinal helminthic parasites present one of the most pressing global health problems due to the abundance of infection, a limited understanding of etiology, and increasing drug resistance. Prior work has established that the gut microbiome can influence infection, but the specific mechanisms through which it does so are unknown. We hypothesize that the gut microbiome produces anti-helminthic metabolites that can prevent and control infection. We propose a series of experiments that integrate multi'omics data and machine learning techniques to discover natural products of the gut microbiome that predict infectious burden or associate with infection control. Our studies leverage a high-throughput zebrafish model of infection to precisely resolve these factors. Additionally, we will develop bioinformatic methods that (1) connect natural products to the genetic pathways and microbiota that produce them, and (2) impute the presence of these natural products in the human gut. Consequently, this project will produce novel anti-helminthic drug leads that can be efficiently isolated and tested, and will clarify the role of gut microbiome natural products in the etiology of infection. Project Narrative Intestinal helminthic infections are a pressing global health problem due to the number of infected individuals, a limited understanding of disease mechanisms, and an increase in resistance to anti-helminthic drugs. This project will discover gut microbiota, their genes, and their metabolites that are linked to the prevention and control of parasitic infection. The long-term goals of this project are to determine if the gut microbiome is a factor in the etiology of helminthic intestinal infection, and to identify microbiome-sourced candidates for the discovery of novel anti-helminthic drugs. !",Interactions between Gut Microbiome Natural Products and Intestinal Helminths,9701928,R21AI135641,"['Animals', 'Anthelmintics', 'Bioinformatics', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Drug resistance', 'Etiology', 'Exposure to', 'Fishes', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Growth and Development function', 'Helminths', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Infection Control', 'Inflammation', 'Informatics', 'Intestinal parasite', 'Intestines', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mammals', 'Measurement', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Microscopic', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Natural Products', 'Outcome', 'Parasites', 'Parasitic infection', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Probiotics', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Resistance', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Sample Size', 'Series', 'Source', 'Taxonomy', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Work', 'Zebrafish', 'base', 'enteric infection', 'expectation', 'experimental study', 'global health', 'gut microbes', 'gut microbiome', 'gut microbiota', 'helminth infection', 'infection risk', 'inquiry-based learning', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'metabolome', 'metagenome', 'microbial', 'microbiome', 'microbiota', 'neglected tropical diseases', 'novel', 'prevent']",NIAID,OREGON STATE UNIVERSITY,R21,2019,183750,0.013523993951046705
"Estimating Cholera Burden with Cross-sectional Immunologic Data Project Summary/Abstract Cholera is an acute dehydrating diarrheal disease caused by infection with Vibrio cholerae. It is endemic in over 50 countries, affecting up to 3 million people and causing more than 100,000 deaths annually. A renewed global effort to fight cholera is underway, catalyzed by the large on-going epidemic in Haiti and now aided by new generation oral cholera vaccines. Identifying key populations at high risk of cholera is essential to guide these activities. Current methods to estimate cholera burden are largely based on clinical reporting with infrequent microbiological confirmation. These methods are limited by the sporadic nature of outbreaks, poor surveillance infrastructure, and fundamental uncertainties in the number of asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic cases. Improved methods of detecting cholera exposure and risk are urgently needed. Detection of immune responses in serum (serosurveillance) can provide a new avenue for rapid and accurate estimates of cholera exposure and risk. We currently do not understand what immunological and clinical parameters are most predictive of recent exposure, nor whether immune responses in areas with different levels of endemicity are similar. In preliminary studies, we have used machine learning methods on antibody response data from cholera patients in Bangladesh to classify whether individuals had been exposed in the previous 30-, 90-, or 360-days with high sensitivity and specificity. In this application, we propose to use longitudinal antibody response kinetics, from populations with diverse genetic and epidemiologic profiles, paired with novel statistical and machine learning approaches to provide generalizable tools to estimate the incidence of exposure to Vibrio cholerae from cross sectional serosurveys. In Aim 1, we will develop models to estimate the time since exposure to Vibrio cholerae and exposure incidence from cross-sectional antibody profiles and demographic data using previously collected data from a cohort in Bangladesh. These results will allow us to identify the antibodies and demographic factors that are most useful for prediction of time-since-exposure. In Aim 2, we will collect longitudinal antibody data from a cohort of cholera cases and household contacts in Haiti to develop models for estimating exposure incidence from cross-sectional serosurveillance. This cohort will also enable us to compare the models developed for moderate/severe cases and mild/asymptomatic cases. In Aim 3, we will optimize and validate field-adapted methods to measure cholera-specific antibodies, including the use of dried blood spot and lateral flow assays. We will conduct a proof-of-concept cross-sectional serosurvey using these methods in rural Haiti. Upon the completion of these aims, we will have provided a number of new tools for measure of susceptibility to cholera in a population. These tools will have the potential to transform cholera control efforts from the current reactive strategies to proactive ones, with the potential to contribute to disease elimination. Project Narrative Cholera is a diarrheal disease affecting millions of people worldwide each year, with the majority of deaths due to cholera occurring in places with poor disease surveillance infrastructure. To optimize cholera control efforts, accurate estimates of cholera exposure and risk are needed. We propose studies using computational methods to determine how antibody decay data may help us estimate cholera exposure incidence.",Estimating Cholera Burden with Cross-sectional Immunologic Data,9703882,R01AI135115,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Africa', 'Antibodies', 'Antibody Response', 'Area', 'Bangladesh', 'Bangladeshi', 'Biological Assay', 'Blood', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Cholera', 'Cholera Vaccine', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Country', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Demographic Factors', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diarrhea', 'Disease', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Disease Surveillance', 'Enrollment', 'Epidemic', 'Epidemiology', 'Exposure to', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Haiti', 'Haitian', 'Health care facility', 'Health system', 'Household', 'Immune response', 'Immunologics', 'Immunology', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Infrastructure', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Kinetics', 'Laboratories', 'Lateral', 'Link', 'Logistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Microbiology', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Oral', 'Patients', 'Population', 'Populations at Risk', 'Predisposition', 'Reporting', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Rural', 'Sanitation', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Serological', 'Serum', 'Specificity', 'Spottings', 'Standardization', 'Surveillance Methods', 'System', 'Time', 'Translations', 'Uncertainty', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vibrio cholerae', 'Vibrio cholerae O1', 'Vibrio cholerae infection', 'Water', 'age related', 'base', 'cohort', 'diarrheal disease', 'disorder risk', 'fighting', 'high risk', 'improved', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'predictive modeling', 'statistics', 'tool']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,R01,2019,687902,0.021470059069470655
"Enhanced Detection System for Healthcare-Associated Transmission of Infection ABSTRACT Despite recent progress in reducing the incidence of healthcare-associated infections (HAIs), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimated that 722,000 HAIs occurred in U.S. acute care hospitals in 2011, resulting in 75,000 deaths. Current methods for detecting outbreaks in hospitals are rudimentary and likely to miss some outbreaks altogether and result in substantial delays in detection of others. There are two major developments in healthcare that have the potential to revolutionize how healthcare associated outbreaks of bacterial pathogens are identified and controlled in hospitals. First, the Affordable Care Act mandates use of the electronic medical record (EMR), which has led to its widespread use in healthcare. Second, the costs of bacterial whole genome sequencing (WGS) have declined substantially, which is making its use by infection programs increasingly feasible. In this application, we propose to establish and evaluate the impact of the Enhanced Detection System for Healthcare Association Transmission (EDS-HAT) at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC). EDS-HAT uses a combination of WGS and analysis of the EMR for enhanced outbreak detection. Our specific aims are to 1a): Determine the utility of EDS-HAT to identify HAT that is not identified through routine infection prevention practice, 1b): Improve the efficiency and reduce the cost of EDS-HAT by using the EMR to restrict the use of WGS, 2a): Measure reductions in HAIs following implementation of EDS-HAT, and 2b): Estimate the number of infections and deaths prevented and healthcare costs averted by EDS-HAT. For Aim 1a, EDS-HAT will be performed retrospectively while routine infection prevention practice (requests for molecular typing when an outbreak is suspected) continues, thus allowing a direct comparison of the two approaches. For Aim 1b, we will improve the efficiency and reduce the cost of EDS-HAT by using machine learning and data mining of the EMR to select isolates for WGS. For Aim 2a, we will monitor changes in HAI rates both before and after implementation of EDS-HAT in real time, which will occur at the beginning of year 3. Finally, for Aim 2b, we will perform clinical and budget impact analyses to determine the overall impact of EDS-HAT. To accomplish these aims, we have assembled a team with expertise in infectious diseases, outbreak investigation, infection prevention, microbial genomics and genomic epidemiology, machine learning and data mining, economic analysis and modeling, epidemiology, and biostatistics. EDS-HAT will likely lead to substantial reductions in infections, deaths, and healthcare costs and can serve as a model for how HAT is detected in hospitals. PROJECT NARRATIVE Outbreak detection in most hospitals uses outdated methods. The declining costs of whole genome sequencing (WGS) of bacterial pathogens and the wide-spread use of the electronic medical record (EMR) provide a unique opportunity to enhance outbreak detection in hospitals and therefore reduce the number of infections. Accordingly, we propose to establish the Enhanced Detection System for Healthcare Association Transmission (EDS-HAT), which uses routine WGS of bacterial pathogens and machine learning and data mining of the EMR to dramatically increase capacity to detect healthcare-associated outbreaks.",Enhanced Detection System for Healthcare-Associated Transmission of Infection,9765031,R01AI127472,"['Acinetobacter baumannii', 'Acute', 'Affordable Care Act', 'Bacterial Infections', 'Biometry', 'Budgets', 'Caring', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Cessation of life', 'Charge', 'Clinical', 'Clostridium difficile', 'Code', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Cost Savings', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Economics', 'Enterobacter aerogenes bacterium', 'Enterobacter cloacae', 'Enterococcus faecalis', 'Enterococcus faecium', 'Epidemiology', 'Escherichia coli', 'Event', 'Exposure to', 'Extended-spectrum β-lactamase', 'Genomics', 'Geographic Locations', 'Health Care Costs', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hospitals', 'Incidence', 'Infection', 'Infection prevention', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Investigation', 'Klebsiella pneumonia bacterium', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Microbiology', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Nosocomial Infections', 'Patients', 'Period Analysis', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Presbyterian Church', 'Prevention', 'Prevention program', 'Procedures', 'Pseudomonas aeruginosa', 'Records', 'Research', 'Source', 'Time', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Vancomycin resistant enterococcus', 'bacterial genome sequencing', 'base', 'cost', 'data mining', 'enteric pathogen', 'foodborne outbreak', 'genome analysis', 'genome sequencing', 'genomic epidemiology', 'health care settings', 'healthcare-associated infections', 'improved', 'innovation', 'meetings', 'methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus', 'microbial', 'pathogen', 'pathogenic bacteria', 'prevent', 'programs', 'prospective', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'virtual', 'whole genome']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2019,728162,0.047270506818474146
"Rapid and broad pathogen profiling system for infection in newborn Abstract Worldwide, infectious disease remains the leading cause of neonatal mortality and results in one million newborn deaths each year. Rapid and precise profiling of pathogens is the key to targeted and effective clinical management of infectious disease. However, current diagnostic methods are slow, limited in breadth of detection, and often unreliable. Further, they have limited ability to detect polymicrobial infection and suffer from poor specificity due to an inability to distinguish clinically relevant from non-pathogenic DNA. Genotyping of pathogen genomic sequences using High Resolution Melt (HRM) provides a simple, rapid, and modern alternative to blood culture testing. HRM generates sequence specific melt curves in a closed-tube reaction as PCR-amplified DNA fragments are heated and disassociate. Our team has advanced this technology through the proof-of-concept stage, demonstrating that a novel digital PCR format for HRM can achieve accurate universal genotyping and quantification of DNA targets in under 3 hours. DNA sequences present in mixtures are individually amplified and identified using the principles of microfluidic sample partitioning and machine learning to enable sensitive specific polymicrobial detection of all the targets present in the DNA mixture. However, for clinical integration, critical innovations are needed. This includes optimization of our upstream processing steps to selectively capture, load, and detect DNA sequences from only viable pathogen cells from a small-volume (≤ 1mL) neonatal blood sample. Further, methods to establish linkages between pathogen identity and antibiotic resistance are needed at the single cell level to fully characterize and accurately quantitate the resistance profile of the pathogen population for precise targeted treatment. In phase I of this proposal, we will focus on refining sample preparation steps to (1) maximize our sensitivity and (2) enable co-localization of resistance markers with identified microbes. We hypothesize that we can efficiently capture pathogen load from blood, reducing interference from human cell contents and enable single cell analysis and quantitation of only viable pathogens while linking species identification and resistance. The processes and tests developed in this proposal will provide: 1) high negative predictive value to rule out bloodstream infection; and 2) specific identification and quantitation of pathogens along with co-localization of relevant antibiotic resistance genes for the targeted treatment of true infections while limiting influence from contaminants or environmental microbes of no clinical significance. In Phase II, the system will be developed to its beta form for testing in a clinical environment. Melio’s goal is to ultimately deliver a low-cost, small-footprint benchtop device compatible with the clinical workflow. Narrative We propose the development of a culture-independent molecular diagnostic test that will enable the rapid and precise detection of infections in newborns. This test uniquely combines the cutting-edge technologies of machine learning, microfluidic partitioning of samples for digital interrogation, and High-Resolution Melting of nucleic acids to create unique pathogen fingerprints for all high-risk bacterial, fungal, and viral pathogens and associated resistance marker(s) present in small-volume blood samples in under 3 hours. Such a timely and accurate test is needed for effective antimicrobial therapy in newborns suspected of infection to reduce antibiotic use in non-infected patients while aggressively treating those in need with narrow spectrum antibiotics targeted towards the offending pathogens.",Rapid and broad pathogen profiling system for infection in newborn,9778646,R43AI145567,"['Algorithms', 'Antibiotic Resistance', 'Antibiotics', 'Asses', 'Asthma', 'Bacteria', 'Biological Assay', 'Blood', 'Blood Circulation', 'Blood Volume', 'Blood specimen', 'Cells', 'Chemistry', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Conserved Sequence', 'Custom', 'Cytolysis', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence', 'DNA amplification', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Drug resistance', 'Emerging Technologies', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Fingerprint', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genome', 'Genomic DNA', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Hypersensitivity', 'Immune response', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Methods', 'Microbe', 'Microfluidics', 'Modernization', 'Molecular Diagnostic Testing', 'Neonatal', 'Neonatal Intensive Care Units', 'Neonatal Mortality', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Newborn Infant', 'Noise', 'Nucleic Acids', 'Obesity', 'Organism', 'Outcome', 'Pathogen detection', 'Pathogenicity', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Preparation', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reaction', 'Reproducibility', 'Resistance', 'Resistance profile', 'Resolution', 'Respiratory distress', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Sepsis', 'Specificity', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technology', 'Temperature', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tube', 'United States', 'Whole Blood', 'Work', 'antimicrobial', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'clinically significant', 'cost', 'design', 'digital', 'genome sequencing', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'instrumentation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'melting', 'microbial', 'microbiome research', 'neonatal sepsis', 'neonate', 'next generation', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'pathogen genome', 'pathogen genomics', 'pathogenic bacteria', 'pathogenic fungus', 'pathogenic virus', 'plasmid DNA', 'premature', 'prevent', 'resistance mechanism', 'single cell analysis', 'targeted treatment', 'whole genome']",NIAID,MELIOLABS INC.,R43,2019,299734,0.05898634169054065
"Optimization of efflux avoidance and inhibition for antibiotic development Project Summary Failures of antibiotic therapy occur with increasing frequency in clinics due to the spread of multidrug resistant bacterial pathogens. The major challenge are infections caused by Gram-negative bacteria that are protected from antibiotics by the concerted action of multidrug efflux pumps and the low permeability barrier of outer membranes. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, an opportunistic human pathogen responsible for a variety of infectious diseases, is notorious for its antibiotic impermeability. A handful of clinical antibiotics used against this pathogen are beginning to fail due to the emergence of multidrug resistant strains. New antibiotics are needed to address this growing threat. Decades of antibiotic discovery and optimization perfected empirical approaches for improvement of antibiotic action and avoidance of class-specific resistance mechanisms. The current critical challenge is to develop approaches that will enable antibiotic penetration across non-specific permeability barriers of Gram-negative bacteria, which present an urgent and serious threat to public health. This project responds to this challenge and proposes the development of a new technology for optimization of efflux avoidance and inhibition in clinical and investigational antibacterial agents that will be effective against Gram-negative bacteria. The proposed approach targets simultaneously the multidrug efflux mechanism of P. aeruginosa and its outer membrane barrier and combines cutting edge technologies in experimental analyses of efflux inhibition and drug penetration, kinetic modeling of drug accumulation, computer simulations of drug efflux and transmembrane diffusion, synthetic chemistry and machine learning analyses. The central objective of the proposal is to create a mechanism-based predictive model that integrates physicochemical properties of compounds, kinetics of their intracellular accumulation and transmembrane diffusion, and a molecular level description of the interaction of efflux transporters with their substrates and inhibitors. The model will be validated by focused medicinal chemistry efforts to generate antibacterial agents that combine the traits of effective antibiotics and potent efflux pump inhibitors or avoiders. This multi-disciplinary approach is enabled by the collaborative efforts of PIs on the project: Helen Zgurskaya (biochemistry of drug uptake and efflux), Valentin Rybenkov (kinetic modeling), Paolo Ruggerone (computational biophysics of efflux), Gnanakaran (computational simulations of membrane permeation) and John Walker (medicinal chemistry). Narrative This project addresses a current critical challenge in the discovery and development of antibiotics effective against multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa. These studies will create a new powerful technology for accelerated antibiotic development targeting diverse bacteria and give rise to new families of antibiotics.",Optimization of efflux avoidance and inhibition for antibiotic development,9644008,R01AI136799,"['Address', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents', 'Antibiotic Resistance', 'Antibiotic Therapy', 'Antibiotics', 'Area', 'Bacteria', 'Biochemistry', 'Biophysics', 'Cells', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Computational Biology', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diffusion', 'Drug Efflux', 'Drug Modelings', 'Failure', 'Family', 'Frequencies', 'Gram-Negative Bacteria', 'Infection', 'Kinetics', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Measures', 'Membrane', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Multi-Drug Resistance', 'Nature', 'Outcome', 'Penetration', 'Permeability', 'Pharmaceutical Chemistry', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Property', 'Pseudomonas aeruginosa', 'Public Health', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Role', 'Structure', 'Synthesis Chemistry', 'Technology', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Walkers', 'antibiotic efflux', 'base', 'cell envelope', 'clinical investigation', 'efflux pump', 'experience', 'experimental analysis', 'human pathogen', 'improved', 'industry partner', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'molecular dynamics', 'molecular modeling', 'multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa', 'new technology', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'pathogenic bacteria', 'predictive modeling', 'resistance mechanism', 'resistant strain', 'success', 'tool', 'trait', 'uptake']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF OKLAHOMA NORMAN,R01,2019,1056326,0.02642230756781565
"Predictive Models for Small-Molecule Accumulation in Gram-Negative Bacteria PROJECT SUMMARY Predictive Models for Small-Molecule Accumulation in Gram-Negative Bacteria. Antibiotic-resistant Gram-negative bacterial infections are increasing in incidence and novel antibiotics are urgently needed to combat this growing threat to public health. A major roadblock to the development of novel antibiotics is our poor understanding of the structural features of small molecules that correlate with bacterial penetration and efflux. As a result, while potent biochemical inhibitors can often be identified for new targets, developing them into compounds with whole-cell antibacterial activity has proven challenging. To address this critical problem, we propose herein a comprehensive, multidisciplinary approach to develop quantitative models to predict small-molecule penetration and efflux in Gram-negative bacteria. We have pioneered a general platform for systematic, quantitative evaluation of small-molecule accumulation in bacteria, using label-free LC-MS/MS detection and multivariate cheminformatic analysis. We have also developed unique isogenic strain sets of wild-type, hyperporinated, efflux-knockout, and doubly-compromised E. coli, P. aeruginosa, and A. baumannii that allow us to dissect the individual contributions of outer/inner membrane penetration and active efflux to net accumulation, using a kinetic model that accurately recapitulates available experimental data. Moreover, we have developed machine learning and neural network approaches to QSAR (quantitative structure–activity relationship) modeling of pharmacological properties that will now be used to develop predictive cheminformatic models for Gram-negative accumulation, penetration, and efflux. This project will be carried out by a multidisciplinary SPEAR-GN Project Team (Small-molecule Penetration & Efflux in Antibiotic-Resistant Gram-Negatives, “speargun”) involving the labs of Derek Tan (MSK, PI), Helen Zgurskaya (OU, PI), Bradley Sherborne (Merck, Lead Collaborator), Valentin Rybenkov (OU, Co-I), Adam Duerfeldt (OU, Co-I), Carl Balibar (Merck, Collaborator), and David McLaren (Merck, Collaborator), comprising extensive combined expertise in organic and diversity-oriented synthesis, biochemistry, microbiology, high- throughput screening, mass spectrometry, biophysical modeling, cheminformatics, and medicinal chemistry. Herein, we will design and synthesize chemical libraries with diverse structural and physicochemical properties; analyze their accumulation in the isogenic strain sets in both high-throughput and high-density assay formats; extract kinetic parameters for penetration and efflux from the resulting experimental datasets; develop and validate robust QSAR models for accumulation, penetration, and efflux; and demonstrate the utility of these models in medicinal chemistry campaigns to develop novel Gram-negative antibiotics against three targets. This project will provide a major advance in the field of antibacterial drug discovery, providing powerful enabling tools to the scientific community to address this major threat to public health. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Predictive Models for Small-Molecule Accumulation in Gram-Negative Bacteria. Antibiotic-resistant Gram-negative bacteria pose a growing threat to public health in the U.S. and globally. A major obstacle to the development of new antibiotics to combat such infections is our poor understanding of the chemical requirements for small molecules to enter Gram-negative cells and to avoid ejection by efflux pumps. The proposed comprehensive, multidisciplinary research program aims to develop predictive computational tools to identify such molecules by carrying out large-scale, quantitative analyses of the accumulation of diverse small molecules in Gram-negative bacteria. These tools will then enable medicinal chemistry campaigns to develop novel antibiotics.",Predictive Models for Small-Molecule Accumulation in Gram-Negative Bacteria,9761970,R01AI136795,"['Acinetobacter baumannii', 'Address', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents', 'Antibiotic Resistance', 'Antibiotics', 'Architecture', 'Bacteria', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemistry', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Availability', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Effectiveness', 'Escherichia coli', 'Gram-Negative Bacteria', 'Gram-Negative Bacterial Infections', 'Human', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Kinetics', 'Knock-out', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Mammalian Cell', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Membrane', 'Microbiology', 'Modeling', 'Oral', 'Partner in relationship', 'Penetration', 'Pharmaceutical Chemistry', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Property', 'Pseudomonas aeruginosa', 'Public Health', 'Quantitative Evaluations', 'Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Role', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Variant', 'analog', 'base', 'biophysical model', 'cell envelope', 'cheminformatics', 'combat', 'computerized tools', 'density', 'design', 'drug discovery', 'efflux pump', 'high throughput screening', 'improved', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'lead optimization', 'learning network', 'multidisciplinary', 'neural network', 'novel', 'off-label use', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'screening', 'small molecule', 'small molecule libraries', 'success', 'tool']",NIAID,SLOAN-KETTERING INST CAN RESEARCH,R01,2019,1212566,0.00361189279585225
"Merging Temporal Changes in Clinical Informatics, Transcriptomics, and Cytokine Profiles to Understand the Host Response to Bacteremia As an ICU physician and an immunologist, I have devoted my research career to understanding sepsis,  a disease that affects nearly 2 million people annually in the USA. Sepsis is a life-threatening  condition that arises when the body's response to infection injures its own tissues. Great strides  have been made towards improving the clinical care of the septic patient, but the mortality rate  remains >20% for several reasons: First, each sepsis-causing pathogen, be it bacterial, viral, or  fungal, carries its own virulence factors that affect the host response, but unfortunately, much  research has focused on studying septic patients as a group, rather than distinguishing patients  based on microbiologic cause. Second, researchers often study patients once they manifest  sepsis-induced organ failure yet many people sustain infections due to common sepsis  pathogens, like Staphylococcus aureus, but never develop sepsis; understanding the ""appropriate""  response to a pathogen is critical to understanding the ""inappropriate"" response of  sepsis. Finally, much sepsis research occurs in silos; clinician researchers focus on the  electronic medical record, while basic scientists analyze biologic data. Too often, these  groups do not collaborate to share information, even though understanding the biologic  significance of clinical data may be of great value. To address these issues, I propose a unique  approach to understand the host response to infection that incorporates both biologic data and  clinical electronic medical record (EMR) data from patients with S. aureus bacteremia.  By limiting analysis of the host response to infections caused by a single pathogen at a single  site, we can control for the variability induced by pathogen-specific factors. In addition,  by studying all patients with S. aureus bacteremia, and not simply those patients with  sepsis, we can understand both the appropriate host response as well as the inappropriate host  response that characterizes the development of sepsis. With our bank of samples collected from S.  aureus bacteremia patients we will analyze both cellular mRNA transcripts and plasma  protein/cytokine levels, collected at different time points from each patient. We will  combine the results of these analyses with clinical data found in the EMR to provide a correlation  between the biology of the host response and its clinical manifestations. Our per-patient  data, then, will have unprecedented granularity which we can then use to apply machine learning  techniques to identify multi-faceted endotypes that predict outcomes (such as mortality). Once we  have built these endotype models, we will validate them using pilot data collected from newly  enrolled patients with either S. aureus or E. coli bacteremia. This approach will allow  us to identify factors common to the dysregulated host response across all infections, as well as  those that may be specific to the type of infection. Understanding both the  appropriate and the inappropriate host response to infection, and understanding which  aspects of the host response are pathogen-specific (and which are not) will allow development  of novel therapies for this devastating disease. The mortality rate due to severe sepsis exceeds 20%, yet in spite of 3 decades of research, we  still have a very limited understanding of the dysregulated host response that drives  this mortality. I will use my experience as a PhD-trained immunologist and ICU physician to  study the host response to the two most common causes of bacteremia in hospitalized patients, S.  aureus and E. coli. Understanding both appropriate and dysregulated host responses to infections as  manifested in both biological and clinical data will allow me to develop precision therapy to treat  this deadly disease.","Merging Temporal Changes in Clinical Informatics, Transcriptomics, and Cytokine Profiles to Understand the Host Response to Bacteremia",9807677,R03HL148295,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Allergic', 'Award', 'Bacteremia', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Blood', 'Blood specimen', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Comorbidity', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Consent', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Enrollment', 'Escherichia coli', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression', 'Goals', 'Hour', 'Immune', 'Immune Targeting', 'Immune response', 'Immunologist', 'Infection', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Leukocytes', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Messenger RNA', 'Microbiology', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Organ', 'Organ failure', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Plasma', 'Plasma Proteins', 'Precision therapeutics', 'Proteins', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Sepsis', 'Site', 'Staphylococcus aureus', 'Subgroup', 'Supportive care', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Transcript', 'Validation', 'Viral', 'Virulence Factors', 'Work', 'base', 'biobank', 'career', 'clinical care', 'clinically significant', 'cytokine', 'experience', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'injured', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'mortality', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'outcome prediction', 'pathogen', 'patient subsets', 'personalized therapeutic', 'prospective', 'response', 'septic', 'septic patients', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics']",NHLBI,KAISER FOUNDATION RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R03,2019,79000,0.025470375834198155
"Mobile-phone integrated rapid diagnostic tests to improve antibiotic stewardship PROJECT SUMMARY  An estimated 1.4 billion antibiotic prescriptions were filled in the US from 2000-2010. Despite a national antibiotic education campaign, approximately 30% of antibiotic prescriptions are unnecessary. As a result of the over-prescription of antibiotics, there is a current and pressing public health need for improved antibiotic stewardship. Compounding this problem are new modalities of healthcare like telemedicine that, while meeting patient demand for convenience, have been shown to have higher antibiotic prescription rates. As a result, there is a pressing need for a tool that these remote providers can use to distinguish between bacterial infections, where antibiotics can be effective, and viral infections where antibiotics are unneeded.  In this research, we propose the development of Barcode Embedded Rapid Diagnostics (BERDs) as a point-of-care test to measure a host biomarker signature in response to an infection in blood. These tests have novel spatial patterning of reagents that allows them to automatically and quantitatively be analyzed by a mobile phone application. Once the biomarkers have been analyzed on the test, a clinical decision support engine developed in this proposal will provide a confident diagnosis.  We have assembled an interdisciplinary consortium that consists of biomedical engineering, point-of-care device, and software development expertise through PragmaDx, Inc., and biomarker assay development in the Department of Chemistry at Vanderbilt University. To meet our shared goals, our specific aims will: optimize manufacturing conditions of BERDs, develop and evaluate a machine learning clinical decision support engine, and rigorously compare the performance of BERDs to standard clinical laboratory methods using de-identified patient specimens.  A successful outcome of this Phase I STTR will be the development of a diagnostic test and clinical decision support engine that is capable of measuring multiple biomarkers in blood to differentiate the etiology of an infection at the point-of-care, with accuracy comparable to standard clinical laboratory assays. Upon completion of this effective demonstration, the platform will be ready for a large-scale clinical evaluation that will be the subject of a Phase II application. PROJECT NARRATIVE  An estimated 30% of antibiotic prescriptions are unnecessary. As a result, antibiotic resistance has developed into a major public health concern.

"The Antibody Registry: A Community Authority for Antibody Research Resource Identifiers Project Summary  One of the most glaring yet easily addressable gaps in our current scientific workflow and publication system is improving the way that methods are reported, in particular, the lack of key methodological details necessary for interpreting and reproducing a study. Most authors continue to cite the name of the reagent, like an antibody using the vendor, and the city where the vendor is located, but omit the catalog and lot number making antibodies very difficult to track down, thereby reducing reproducibility of the paper. The Resource Identification, RRID, Initiative has successfully implemented a solution to this lack of identification, by asking authors to include a persistent unique identifier (RRID) for each antibody along with a standard syntax that includes the lot information. This syntax is now required in about 100 journals and accepted in at least 400, was accepted into the EQUATOR network of standards and is under consideration by the JATS committee, the NISO standard for journal article metadata. For antibodies, RRIDs are assigned by the AntibodyRegistry.org, which accepts full catalogs from antibody companies and individual antibody records from authors, who are unable to locate the record for the antibody that they used in a study or one which they created in their lab. This process should be made as easy as possible for authors, and through text analysis we have devised a set of tools that should help authors create better records with less work.  The AntibodyRegistry.org was created as part of an academic project and it has successfully incorporated millions of antibody records, thousands of which have now been cited in scientific papers using the RRID syntax. The use of RRID is growing, and in order to support the longer term sustainability of the AntibodyRegistry.org, a core community authority for RRIDs, this resource needs to be enhanced to align with the available commercial and non-commercial funding sources. We propose the addition of features, valuable to antibody companies and journals, to improve market intelligence and reporting around antibodies. We also propose to auto-generate antibody entries for authors and curators when submitting/curating an antibody to decrease the time it takes to complete the task, thereby reducing the barrier to entry and cost. Project Narrative The AntibodyRegistry.org is a catalog of antibodies used in research and serves as the antibody identifier source for the Research Resource Identifier (RRID) initiative. The use of these identifiers improves rigor and transparency in compliance with both journal and NIH standards. As the RRID initiative grows, the AntibodyRegistry.org is becoming an increasingly well-used and valuable resource; requiring increased attention from curation staff. Improvements to the AntibodyRegistry.org are needed to increase commercial value and thereby its sustainability, decrease curation cost, and provide a higher level of service to the scientific community.",The Antibody Registry: A Community Authority for Antibody Research Resource Identifiers,9680073,R41GM131551,"['Adopted', 'Antibodies', 'Asia', 'Attention', 'Award', 'Businesses', 'California', 'Catalogs', 'Cities', 'Cloud Computing', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Databases', 'Electronic Mail', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Europe', 'Feedback', 'Funding', 'Funding Agency', 'Generations', 'Glare', 'Goals', 'Individual', 'Intelligence', 'International', 'Journals', 'Machine Learning', 'Marketing', 'Metadata', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Names', 'Neurosciences', 'Paper', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Publications', 'Reagent', 'Records', 'Registries', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Science', 'Services', 'Small Business Technology Transfer Research', 'Source', 'System', 'Text', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Vendor', 'Work', 'authority', 'base', 'cost', 'improved', 'information framework', 'journal article', 'syntax', 'text searching', 'tool']",NIGMS,"SCICRUNCH, INC.",R41,2019,149373,0.019951160744354858
"Predictive Personalized Public Health (P3H): A Novel Paradigm to Treat Infectious Disease Challenge, Innovation and Impact: In recent years, we have demonstrated that it is feasible to predict epidemic disease outbreaks from retrospective seasonal and geographical case data and to show that we can take climate factors into account in our predictive models. We are moving closer to real-time prediction at the population level. But we have never used prediction at point-of-care for treating the individual patient.  Presently, personalized medicine uses delayed results of laboratory testing of individuals. For infectious disease, most of such testing has targeted the pathogen in the host-pathogen interaction. The role of laboratory testing is to modify therapy after a variable period of time delay. Personalized medicine today is reactive. Complicating matters further, many infectious epidemic diseases are strongly dependent on environmental factors and climate. Lastly, we want to name the pathogens we are fighting, but we really need to know the resistance characteristics to select therapy for patients effectively. Both speciation and resistance can now be determined from molecular data, which can be integrated into point-of-care treatment predictions.  We here propose a radically different approach to the treatment of infectious diseases. Our hypothesis is that the alternative to time-delayed and expensive laboratory analysis of specimens from individual patients, is to use predictive modeling to forecast point-of-care treatment. Time-delayed personalized testing can be conducted as surveillance, and that data used for real-time prediction to guide point-of-care treatment.  We will introduce predictive personalized public health (P3H) policy at the individual patient level, with the potential to substantially improve patient outcomes compared with our present reactive approaches. Our key rationale is to expand population infectious disease predictive modeling in order to achieve prediction for treatment at point-of-care. Our primary insight is that we can reposition the delayed reactive personalized testing from the urgent medical decision-making process, and into a predictive modeling framework. The gaps and opportunities in technology that we will address are four-fold. First, we will employ individual case geospatial mapping at a fine scale to take into account infection spread and environmental factors. Second, our ability to perform pan-microbial analysis using molecular techniques is now feasible. Third, modeling our novel fusion of data has no simple low-dimensional solution – but machine learning technologies are now capable of handling such big data assimilation, model discovery and prediction. Fourth, our proposal is not an academic exercise. We have a partnership with the economic planners within a developing country to design and implement our new methods. We will prospectively tune and validate our algorithms in real-time. Our deliverable will be an open-source framework ready for clinical trials testing and adaptation to the public health infrastructure in any country. Project Narrative We have made substantial progress in our abilities to track and predict infectious disease epidemics at the population level, but prediction has never been used at the individual level to guide treatment at point-of-care. The individual treatment for all infectious disease syndromes at point-of-care is presently empirical, because laboratory testing is reactive and time delayed. We here propose a novel framework to use rigorous prediction strategies to guide point-of-care treatment for infectious diseases, and to validate this approach under real-world conditions.",Predictive Personalized Public Health (P3H): A Novel Paradigm to Treat Infectious Disease,9776462,R01AI145057,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Antigens', 'Assimilations', 'Bacterial Meningitis', 'Bacteriology', 'Big Data', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Cholera', 'Climate', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Complex', 'Country', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Developed Countries', 'Developing Countries', 'Diagnostic', 'Diarrhea', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Economics', 'Engineering', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemic', 'Equilibrium', 'Exanthema', 'Exercise', 'Fever', 'Frequencies', 'Genus staphylococcus', 'Geography', 'HIV', 'Hand', 'Health Policy', 'Hospitals', 'Hybrids', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Infection', 'Infrastructure', 'Investments', 'Laboratories', 'Leadership', 'Leptospirosis', 'Machine Learning', 'Malaria', 'Measles', 'Medical', 'Medical emergency', 'Melioidosis', 'Meningitis', 'Methods', 'Microbiology', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Names', 'Newborn Infant', 'Paralysed', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Preventive', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Reaction', 'Resistance', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Sepsis', 'Specimen', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Uganda', 'Work', 'acute infection', 'antimicrobial', 'authority', 'climate data', 'cost', 'cost outcomes', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'fighting', 'flu', 'global health', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'infectious disease model', 'infectious disease treatment', 'innovation', 'insight', 'microbial', 'mortality', 'neonatal infection', 'novel', 'open source', 'pathogen', 'personalized medicine', 'personalized predictions', 'point of care', 'predictive modeling', 'prospective', 'resistance gene', 'spreading factor', 'surveillance data']",NIAID,PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIV HERSHEY MED CTR,R01,2019,1606082,0.03837620758696576
"A pipeline for prioritizing and evaluating multidrug regimens for Mycobacterium abscessus PROJECT SUMMARY Mycobacterium abscessus complex (MABSC) is a group of closely related nontuberculous mycobacteria, which primarily cause infections in persons with underlying lung disease, compromised immunity or other risk factors. MABSC organisms are intrinsically resistant to many antibiotics and treatment requires many months of multiple antibiotics, often with significant toxicity and low cure rates. One of the difficulties in optimizing the treatment of MABSC infections is the lack of a robust pipeline for the identification of multidrug regimens that may be more efficacious than the current standard of care. A strategy for prioritizing multidrug regimens is necessary, because the number of combinations to test can be overwhelming. For example, with even just 12 drugs to select from there are 220 potential 3 drug combinations. This project proposes to develop INDIGO (INferring Drug Interactions using chemo-Genomics and Orthology), a machine learning modeling approach, to identify drug combinations with strong potential synergistic activity against MABSC and to test these regimens in an animal model. The specific aims of this project are: 1) Build and refine an INDIGO-MABSC model through the collection of transcriptomic data from drug treated MABSC cultures, subsequent experimental verification of antibiotic synergy and antagonism followed by model refinement with iterative rounds of model building and testing; 2) Assess the efficacy of top predicted synergistic multidrug regimens in a zebrafish model for MABSC infection. INDIGO modeling is modular, so as new agents become available they may be incorporated into the model to make predictions for how these agents may be best combined into multidrug regimens. The overall goal of this project is to provide a streamlined pipeline for identifying regimens that can be pushed into advanced pre-clinical and clinical trials for treatment of MABSC infections. PROJECT NARRATIVE Bacteria from the Mycobacterium abscessus group cause lung and other infections in persons with underlying medical comorbidities, which are incredibly difficult to treat due to the bacteria's intrinsic resistance to many antibiotics. This project uses gene expression profiling, computer modeling, and a zebrafish infection model to identify new combination antibiotic regimens that may be more effective against Mycobacterium abscessus. Results from these studies could prompt future clinical trials to test these regimens in humans for efficacy.",A pipeline for prioritizing and evaluating multidrug regimens for Mycobacterium abscessus,9727503,R21AI144536,"['Adjuvant', 'American', 'Amikacin', 'Animal Model', 'Antibiotic Therapy', 'Antibiotics', 'Bacteria', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Models', 'Bronchiectasis', 'Caring', 'Chest', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collection', 'Combined Antibiotics', 'Comorbidity', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Cystic Fibrosis', 'Data', 'Drug Antagonism', 'Drug Combinations', 'Drug Interactions', 'Drug Synergism', 'Drug resistance', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Escherichia coli', 'Exhibits', 'Exposure to', 'Fishes', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'High Prevalence', 'Human', 'Imipenem', 'Immunity', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Injections', 'Label', 'Larva', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Macrolides', 'Medical', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mycobacterium Infections', 'Mycobacterium abscessus', 'Mycobacterium avium Complex', 'Mycobacterium tuberculosis', 'New Agents', 'Organism', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Population', 'Preclinical Testing', 'Predisposition', 'Prevalence', 'Regimen', 'Resistance', 'Risk Factors', 'Societies', 'Testing', 'Toxic effect', 'Training', 'Treatment-related toxicity', 'Triage', 'Triplet Multiple Birth', 'Tuberculosis', 'Veins', 'Vertebral column', 'Work', 'Zebrafish', 'cystic fibrosis patients', 'data registry', 'design', 'drug candidate', 'drug testing', 'high risk', 'improved outcome', 'in vitro activity', 'in vivo', 'in vivo Model', 'model building', 'non-tuberculosis mycobacteria', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'patient screening', 'pre-clinical', 'preclinical trial', 'predictive modeling', 'resistant strain', 'response', 'standard of care', 'success', 'synergism', 'tool', 'transcriptomics', 'transmission process', 'treatment optimization']",NIAID,SEATTLE CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,R21,2019,280873,0.012781321353713638
"New Serological Measures of Infectious Disease Transmission Intensity ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Candidate: Benjamin Arnold    I am an epidemiologist at the University of California, Berkeley. I completed my MA in Biostatistics and a PhD in Epidemiology from UC Berkeley in 2009. Since then, I have worked as an epidemiologist in Professor Jack Colford's group. The opportunity to work as the coordinating epidemiologist for a touchstone, multi-country cluster randomized trial - combined with the addition of two children to my family - led me to delay my academic career. I am now ready to restart my career progress toward independent investigator status.     My long-term career goal is to become a leader in the application of novel statistical methods to target and evaluate interventions that reduce the burden of enteric infections and neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) in low-income countries. This research focus and career objective build from my experience and from a growing collaboration with Dr. Patrick Lammie at the US Centers for Disease Control (CDC) that started in 2013 and has introduced me to seroepidemiologic research. My background in epidemiologic methods, biostatistics, and international field research makes me uniquely qualified to make significant contributions to infectious disease epidemiology at the interface between recent advances in statistical methodology and serological assays.    Environment: University of California, Berkeley    To achieve my career goal, I have developed a training and mentoring plan that focuses on recent advances in statistics (semi-parametric estimation theory and machine learning) and on infectious disease immunology. These are two areas where additional training will open up significant and unique opportunities for me to make meaningful contributions to seroepidemiologic research, and will enable me to launch an independent career as a productive faculty member at UC Berkeley.    I have assembled a multidisciplinary mentoring team of senior investigators in biostatistics and immunology to support my training, research, and career objectives. Mark van der Laan (primary mentor, biostatistics) will guide my training in semi-parametric methods and machine learning. Alan Hubbard (co-mentor, biostatistics) will guide my translation of the methodology to applications for enteric pathogens and NTDs. Patrick Lammie (co-mentor at CDC, immunology) will guide my immunology training and research with his expertise in the immunology of enteric pathogens and NTDs    Research: New Serological Measures of Infectious Disease Transmission    Background: Recent advances in multiplex antigen assays have led to the development of low-cost and sensitive methods to measure enteric pathogens and neglected tropical diseases (NTDs). There have not been commensurate advances in the statistical methods used to derive measures of transmission intensity from antibody response. Translating antibody response into metrics of transmission intensity is a key step from a public health perspective because it enables us to target intervention programs to the populations most in need and then measure the effectiveness of those programs.     Aims and Methods: The overarching goal of this research is to develop a methodologic framework to translate antibody response measured in cross-sectional surveys into measures of transmission intensity for enteric pathogens (7 included in the study, e.g., Cryptosporidium parvum, enterotoxigenic E. coli) and neglected tropical diseases (principal focus: lymphatic filariasis). We approach this goal from two novel perspectives. In Aim 1, we draw on the ""peak shift"" phenomenon for infectious diseases, and hypothesize that changes in transmission will be detectable in the age-specific antibody response curve. At lower transmission, antibody levels should decline across all ages due to fewer and less frequent active infections, leading to an overall shift in the age-specific response curve. We will evaluate the approach by comparing antibody response curves for young children with different exposures (improved vs. unimproved drinking water for enteric pathogens; pre- versus post- mass drug administration for lymphatic filariasis) in large, well characterized cohorts in Kenya, Tanzania, and Haiti.     In Aim 2, we will develop semi-parametric methods to estimate the force of infection (seroconversion rate) from seroprevalence data for pathogens where seroreversion is possible, using lymphatic filariasis as an example. Our new approach marks a significant advance over previous work in this area by making few modeling assumptions and by allowing for the flexible control of confounding between comparison groups. We will evaluate the approach in Haiti by measuring the effect of mass drug administration on the force of infection for lymphatic filariasis For all of the methods, we will create user-friendly, open source software to accelerate translation to applied research.     The Future: This mentored training and research plan represents a natural next step for me on a productive and collaborative path to independence at UC Berkeley. It will set the stage for a broader R01-level research portfolio that applies the newly developed methods to primary research studies that evaluate the impact of interventions on enteric infections, and help target and monitor global elimination efforts for NTDs. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Antibodies measured in blood provide a sensitive measure of infection for many infectious diseases. Statistical methods that enable us to measure disease transmission intensity at the population level from blood antibody levels are an important tool for public health efforts because they help identify populations in greatest need of intervention and help measure the effectiveness of interventions designed to reduce transmission. No statistical tools like this exist for enteric pathogens (those that cause diarrhea) and neglected tropical diseases, which together cause an immense health burden among the world's poorest people, and so we propose to develop new methods to measure population-level transmission intensity of these diseases based on antibodies measured in blood from children in Kenya, Tanzania, and Haiti.",New Serological Measures of Infectious Disease Transmission Intensity,9700030,K01AI119180,"['Age', 'Antibodies', 'Antibody Response', 'Antigens', 'Applied Research', 'Area', 'Biological Assay', 'Biometry', 'Blood', 'California', 'Campylobacter', 'Caregivers', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Child', 'Cluster randomized trial', 'Collaborations', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Computer software', 'Country', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Cryptosporidium', 'Cryptosporidium parvum', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Diarrhea', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Entamoeba histolytica', 'Environment', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Epidemiologist', 'Epidemiology', 'Faculty', 'Family', 'Filarial Elephantiases', 'Future', 'Giardia', 'Goals', 'Haiti', 'Handwashing', 'Health', 'Immune response', 'Immunologist', 'Immunology', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Infectious Disease Epidemiology', 'Infectious Disease Immunology', 'Infectious Diseases Research', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Kenya', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measles', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Mumps', 'Outcome', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Play', 'Population', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Rubella', 'Running', 'Salmonella', 'Sanitation', 'Serological', 'Seroprevalences', 'Source', 'Spottings', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Survival Analysis', 'Tanzania', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Universities', 'Vibrio cholerae', 'Viral', 'Water', 'Work', 'base', 'career', 'cohort', 'comparison group', 'cost', 'disease transmission', 'drinking water', 'effectiveness measure', 'enteric infection', 'enteric pathogen', 'enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'high risk population', 'improved', 'intervention effect', 'intervention program', 'low income country', 'member', 'multidisciplinary', 'neglected tropical diseases', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'open source', 'pathogen', 'professor', 'programs', 'public health intervention', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'response', 'semiparametric', 'seroconversion', 'seropositive', 'skills', 'statistics', 'theories', 'therapy design', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'user-friendly']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,K01,2019,26919,0.05286467334922849
"Serum antibody biomarkers of myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome Chronic fatigue syndrome is a disabling condition for 2.5 million Americans associated with  prolonged fatigue, post-exertional malaise, and sleep disturbances. The cause of CFS remains  unknown, and there are currently no available diagnostic tests to confirm disease. However, a  substantial number of immune features have been measured in CFS. Given this problem, the objective  of this project is to identify a panel of distinct antibody epitopes that can be used to identify  cases of CFS using a blood test. In Aim 1, we will apply serum epitope repertoire analysis to  determine the antibody epitope repertoires within a cohort of 200 CFS patients and 175  controls. Antibody epitopes occurring in CFS sera, and not controls will be identified   using bioinformatics methods. A panel of motifs will be downselected using machine  learning to optimize sensitivity and specificity within the discovery set. The performance of  the panel will be measured in an independent set of specimens to determine sensitivity and  specificity, and identify potential CFS subgroups. We will determine whether individual  markers, or sets of markers, correlate with various clinical features of CFS. Infections with a variety of pathogens have been associated with the development of fatigue lasting  one year or longer, and post-infection fatigue patients typically meet clinical criteria for CFS.  Given the potential for heterogeneous infectious etiology, we hypothesize that CFS patients may  exhibit increased rates of seropositivity for a broad set of infectious agents associated with  fatigue. Using serum epitope repertoire analysis, we will determine whether IgG seropositivity for  20 infections (as a group) differs between CFS patients and controls. The proposed project may  identify antibody biomarkers suitable for development of diagnostic immunoassay for CFS, and may  elucidate whether prior or ongoing infections are associated with CFS. Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), also known as myalgic encephalitis (ME), is a disabling condition  affecting an estimated 2.5 million people in the United States. The cause of CFS  remains unknown, and there are no objective laboratory diagnostic tests to  confirm disease. Consequently, diagnosis of CFS remains exceptionally difficult, requiring the  exclusion of a wide variety fatiguing illnesses. This project aims to apply advanced molecular  discovery tools and computation to identify patterns of circulating antibodies that can be   used to diagnose and monitor CFS patients using a blood test. This project also holds the  potential to associate prior infections with the development of CFS.",Serum antibody biomarkers of myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome,9778480,R43AI145696,"['Academy', 'Adrenergic Agents', 'Affect', 'American', 'Antibodies', 'Antigens', 'Arthralgia', 'Autoantibodies', 'Binding', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Tests', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes', 'Caregivers', 'Cell physiology', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Cholinergic Receptors', 'Chronic Fatigue Syndrome', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Cost of Illness', 'Coxiella', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Encephalitis', 'Epitopes', 'Etiology', 'Exclusion', 'Exertion', 'Exhibits', 'Facilities and Administrative Costs', 'Fatigue', 'Feeling', 'Fever Chills', 'Gene Expression', 'Health Personnel', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Human Herpesvirus 4', 'Immune', 'Immunoassay', 'Immunoglobulin G', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Infectious Agent', 'Infectious Mononucleosis', 'Inflammatory', 'Laboratories', 'Laboratory Research', 'Longitudinal prospective study', 'Machine Learning', 'Malaise', 'Measurable', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Muscarinics', 'Myalgia', 'Natural Killer Cells', 'Nuclear Antigens', 'Organism', 'Pain', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Proteins', 'Psyche structure', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Seroprevalences', 'Serum', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sleep disturbances', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Societies', 'Sore Throat', 'Specificity', 'Specimen', 'Subgroup', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'United States', 'acute infection', 'base', 'biobank', 'biomarker discovery', 'candidate marker', 'cohort', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'flu', 'immune activation', 'interest', 'lymph nodes', 'pathogen', 'pathogenic bacteria', 'pathogenic virus', 'seropositive', 'sleep abnormalities', 'tool', 'trend']",NIAID,"SERIMMUNE, INC.",R43,2019,224975,0.037623194013156606
"Microscopy-Based Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (MAST) Antibiotic resistance is compromising our ability to treat bacterial infections. Clinical microbiology laboratories guide appropriate treatment through antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) of patient bacterial isolates. However, increasingly, pathogens are developing resistance to a broad range of antimicrobials, requiring AST of less commonly used or recently introduced agents for which no commercially available or FDA-cleared testing methods exist. Agar and broth dilution are gold standard methods for AST that can be used to test any antimicrobial; however, labor and technical complexity precludes their use in hospital-based clinical laboratories. Therefore, bacterial isolates often must be sent to a reference laboratory with a 4-6 day delay in results. Furthermore, even standard methods require overnight incubation prior to readout. Therefore, there exists a significant AST testing gap in which current methodologies cannot adequately address the need for rapid results in the face of unpredictable susceptibility profiles. Our laboratory has recently verified inkjet printer-based digital dispensing technology as a novel platform to facilely perform reference AST for any antimicrobial at will. In this proposal, we aim to combine this methodology with advanced microscopy to leapfrog traditional AST capabilities through: (1) development of a method for microscopic imaging of bacterial replication on a solid-phase, 384-well microplate AST format, thereby allowing determination of susceptibility for any drug at will in 4 hours and (2) development and application of advanced image analysis for automated susceptibility calls. This new platform is designated MAST for microscopy-based antimicrobial susceptibility testing. The clinical diagnostic performance of the platform will be optimized against an AST reference method for accuracy and precision using a large panel of well-characterized clinical isolates. We anticipate establishing a prototype platform that will address the AST testing gap and thereby help our health system more effectively address the antimicrobial resistance threat. With the emergence of multi-drug resistant bacteria, it is no longer possible to accurately predict which antimicrobials will be effective against life-threatening bacterial illness. Testing bacteria directly for response available therapies may take several days. Therefore, a new technology platform called MAST is proposed to allow us to determine which antibiotics can treat a bacteria infection in a matter of hours and thereby address our current, clinically unacceptable antimicrobial testing gap.",Microscopy-Based Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (MAST),9697702,R21AI130434,"['Address', 'Agar', 'Algorithms', 'Antibiotic Resistance', 'Antibiotics', 'Antimicrobial Resistance', 'Antimicrobial susceptibility', 'Bacteria', 'Bacterial Infections', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Microbiology', 'Development', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Growth', 'Health system', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Laboratories', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Microscopic', 'Microscopy', 'Monitor', 'Multiple Bacterial Drug Resistance', 'Nutrient', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Predisposition', 'Printing', 'Regimen', 'Resistance', 'Resistance development', 'Solid', 'Surface', 'Technology', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'antimicrobial', 'automated image analysis', 'base', 'biomaterial compatibility', 'clinical diagnostics', 'convolutional neural network', 'digital', 'direct application', 'microscopic imaging', 'new technology', 'next generation', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'performance tests', 'prototype', 'response', 'supervised learning']",NIAID,BETH ISRAEL DEACONESS MEDICAL CENTER,R21,2019,223354,0.029998092892597625
"Successful Clinical Response In Pneumonia Therapy (SCRIPT) Systems Biology Center Overall Project Summary: This innovative integrated systems biology application seeks to delineate the complex host/pathogen interactions occurring at the alveolar level that lead to unsuccessful response to therapy in serious pneumonia. To achieve this objective, we will leverage our unique access to alveolar fluid collected as part of routine clinical care in mechanically ventilated patients with suspected pneumonia in our medical intensive care unit. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid will be obtained serially from well characterized mechanically ventilated patients with Pseudomonas or Acinetobacter pneumonia. Both of these CDC- designated serious hazard level pathogens have clinical failure rates as high as 50%. A robust clinical definition will allow comparison of both host and pathogen signatures associated with failure of therapy vs. success. These clinical specimens and extensive patient phenomics will anchor two mutually supportive and iterative research projects. Project One will deploy robust tools for flow sorting macrophage and lymphocyte subset populations, isolating RNA from these populations, and performing transcriptomic and epigenomic analysis to compare successful and unsuccessful host responses to infection. Project Two will focus on both specific pathogen genomic profiles associated with unsuccessful outcome. Changes in microbiome communities will be comprehensively assessed by shotgun deep sequencing to detect bacteriophage, other virus, and fungal DNA, in addition to bacterial. The Technology Core will perform cell sorting of NBBAL macrophage and lymphocyte subsets, RNA sequencing, and whole genome methylation, and perform parallel studies in a unique humanized alveolar macrophage mouse model. A Data Management and Bioinformatics Core will develop tools to reduce the dimensionality of these large comprehensive datasets, including the clinical phenomics, and provide them to the Modeling Core. The Modeling Core will then use innovative modeling approaches including a model of the alveolus during pneumonia as an ecosystem out of balance combined with unique machine learning tools and neural networks to generate biomarkers of host, pathogen and/or microbiome patterns predictive of successful pneumonia outcome. Predictive biomarkers developed in the Modeling Core will then be validated in a prospective confirmatory cohort of patients in whom analogous data will be generated. The Administrative Core will perform the outward-facing role of education and outreach to the community and sponsor, as well as regularly exchanging datasets, analytic tools, and specimens with NIH-sponsored/approved repository sites.

"Repurposing pyronaridine as a treatment for Chagas disease Summary Neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) are a diverse group of diseases with distinct characteristics that thrive mainly among the poorest populations of the world. There are 17 NTDs prioritized by the World Health Organization which are endemic in 149 countries and affect more than 1.4 billion people globally, which costs these developing economies billions of dollars annually. The neglected tropical diseases result from four different causative pathogens: protozoa, bacteria, helminth and virus. The majority of the diseases lack effective treatments. For example, 6 to 7 million people in Latin America are infected with the eukaryotic parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, the causative agent of Chagas disease. This disease is gaining recognition as an emerging infection in the United States where an estimated 300,000 people may be infected. Chagas disease has a serious economic impact on the United States and the world. The cost of treatment in the United States alone, where the disease is not indigenous, is estimated to be $900 million annually, which includes hospitalization and medical devices such as pacemakers. The global cost is estimated at $7 billion. Unfortunately, there are no FDA approved treatments for Chagas disease and the two available treatments used outside the U.S. have toxic side effects. New therapeutics for Chagas disease and the other NTDs are desperately needed. Using a machine learning model based on published data for compounds tested against T. cruzi we have identified the EU-approved antimalarial pyronaridine as particularly active in vitro and in vivo with statistically significant efficacy in a 4-day mouse model of infection with a T. cruzi strain expressing firefly luciferase. Pyronaridine demonstrated 85.2% parasite reduction after 4 days treatment, and is known to have a long half-life in humans (13.2 days), promising toxicity profile (less toxic than chloroquine in malaria treatment) and may suggest a drug repurposing opportunity for further study. We propose in this project to determine the minimum effective dose (treatment regimen) for pyronaridine in the acute model of Chagas disease. We will also determine efficacy in the chronic phase of Chagas disease (sterile cure). We will pursue combination therapy DMPK profiling as well as performing combination therapy in vivo efficacy in chronic model of Chagas disease. The results will enable us to assess whether this EU approved drug is worthy of a clinical trial for Chagas disease in the UH3 stage. If successful we will design a clinical study and recruit patients for a phase II trial. This grant represents a unique opportunity to partner the Center for Discovery and Innovation in Parasitic Diseases (www.cdipd.org) at UCSD and the University of Sao Paulo in Brazil with Collaborations Pharmaceuticals Inc. Narrative Approximately 6 to 7 million people in Latin America are infected with the eukaryotic parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, the causative agent of the deadly Chagas disease. This disease is gaining recognition as an emerging infection in the United States where an estimated 300,000 people may be infected and there is no FDA approved treatment. The antimalarial pyronaridine was recently identified by our groups using computational Bayesian repurposing methods and was confirmed as active when tested in vitro and in vivo in the acute mouse model of Chagas disease. We now propose in the UH2 stage to determine: the minimum effective dose in the acute model of Chagas disease and efficacy in the chronic phase while also assessing potential for combination therapy.

paradigm is strikingly narrow and homogenous: MIC/MBC testing in standardized bacteriologic media. We  have shown that this drug evaluation paradigm is inadequate, even misleading, as changes in the media  conditions of the procedure lead to dramatically different results. A more holistic definition of antibiotic therapy  that centers on understanding antibiotic activity in synergy with host innate immune factors such as cationic  antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), serum and phagocytic cells (e.g. neutrophils) reveals therapeutic options  unrecognized in standard testing. The proposed U01 program represents a groundbreaking approach to use  systems biology approaches and inform more effective antibiotic utilization in the context of host innate  immunity. We propose to: 1) build an iterative systems biology workflow that integrates multiple experimental  and computational approaches to give a comprehensive assessment of AR; and 2) apply this workflow to high  priority pathogens to systematically elucidate AR mechanisms and their condition­dependency. The iterative  workflow includes: (i) omics and physiological data generation.  Clinically isolated strains of the selected  pathogens will be grown under conventional testing (bacteriologic media) and more physiologic conditions  (tissue culture media, serum, and in presence of AMPs and neutrophils) to probe for advantageous gain of  activity.  The omics data types collected are: DNA resequencing, RNAseq, and metabolomics.  (ii)  Bioinformatics and data modeling analysis involves three approaches: big data analysis for data set  dimensionality and coarse grained variable dependencies assessment, genome­scale modeling for  mechanistic elucidation and analysis, and machine learning that uses AR­related metadata to classify the  overall biological functions. This analysis will lead to understanding of AR mechanisms.  (iii) Multi­scale  validation from animal models, to laboratory evolution, to cytology, to gene expression alteration, to structural  protein analysis of putative targets. The validation thus ranges from host behavior to atomistic detail of  ligand­target interactions. The iterative loop then closes, comparing computational prediction to experimental  outcomes. False­negative and false­positive predictions are then algorithmically analyzed by a hypothesis  generating family of algorithms that then makes suggestions about what conditions to use in the next iteration  of the loop.  The pathogens that we will focus on are methicillin­resistant ​Staphylococcus aureus ​(MRSA), the  carbapenem­resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) Klebsiella ​pneumoniae ​and ​Acinetobacter baumannii,​ and  Pseudomonas aeruginosa​. The team of investigators has made the foundational observations and led the  development of the technologies on which the iterative workflow is based. A multi­ and genome­scale methods  of systems biology fulfills requirements of RFA­AI­14­064 to which it responds.              Narrative    The current evaluation of antibiotic drug candidates in drug discovery and in clinical medicine is conducted in  laboratory media that ignores the actual physiologic conditions in the host and the host immune system.  We  have discovered potent antimicrobial activities of existing antibiotics against highly “drug­resistant superbugs”

"Optimized identification of therapeutic bacterial strains in ulcerative colitis PROJECT SUMMARY Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic gut inflammatory condition thought to be caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Therapeutic options are only partially effective in inducing and maintaining remission, and there is currently no cure for UC. Recent studies have found the microbiome of UC patients is distinct compared to that of healthy controls, suggesting that the microbiome could be a promising therapeutic target. Fecal microbiota transplant (FMT) has been extremely successful in the treatment of colitis caused by Clostridium difficile infection, further demonstrating the potential for bacterial therapeutics. The recently completed FOCUS (Faecal Microbiota Transplantation in Ulcerative Colitis) trial has demonstrated that FMT from healthy donors can induce clinical remission in 27% of UC patients compared to only 8% in the placebo group. However, we still lack an understanding of the exact mechanisms by which FMT is able to modulate disease pathogenesis. The overarching hypothesis of this proposal is that UC remission after FMT is induced by specific bacteria, and that accurate identification of bacterial strains will be paramount to develop microbial therapeutics for UC. To test this hypothesis, we will first develop a novel ensemble method to identify bacterial species and strains from deep metagenomic data. This method combines software tools using a voting algorithm that is weighted based on the accuracy of each tool. The accuracy of this method will be tested using microbial culture collections from UC patients, in silico simulations, and a bacterial mock community as gold standards. We will then apply this approach to metagenomic data generated from the FOCUS study in order to identify bacterial strains that are associated with UC remission. This will be performed by using established supervised learning techniques, as well as through a novel method based on co- occurrence network analysis that identifies clusters of bacteria that act synergistically. Based on these results, we will finally validate our findings using a gnotobiotic model of colitis. The prophylactic and/or therapeutic potential of candidate bacteria will be tested by inoculating them to gnotobiotic mice colonized with the microbiota of UC patients and with colitis induced through the transfer of naïve T cells. Our proposal will be the first to address the question of how specific bacteria modulate disease progression in a randomized trial of FMT in UC through the development of more sensitive and accurate methods for strain characterization that can be experimentally validated. The rational design of our strategy to identify therapeutic bacteria will produce highly translational results that can be used to guide future clinical trials in UC. PROJECT NARRATIVE Finding novel approaches to prevent and treat ulcerative colitis (UC) is a pressing clinical need. This project investigates the role of bacterial strains as predictors of UC remission after fecal microbiota transplant, and presents novel methods to identify therapeutic strains that will be tested in a mouse model of colitis.",Optimized identification of therapeutic bacterial strains in ulcerative colitis,9781704,R01DK114038,"['Achievement', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Bacteria', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clostridium difficile', 'Colitis', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Disease remission', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Etiology', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Gnotobiotic', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Immune response', 'Incidence', 'Infection', 'Inflammatory', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Metagenomics', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Onset of illness', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Patients', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Probiotics', 'Property', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Shotguns', 'Societies', 'Software Tools', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Ulcerative Colitis', 'United States', 'Voting', 'bacterial community', 'base', 'clinical remission', 'cohort', 'design', 'fecal transplantation', 'improved', 'learning network', 'learning strategy', 'metagenome', 'metagenomic sequencing', 'method development', 'microbial', 'microbiome', 'microbiota', 'mouse model', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'outcome prediction', 'placebo group', 'potential biomarker', 'predicting response', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'probiotic therapy', 'prophylactic', 'randomized trial', 'response', 'simulation', 'supervised learning', 'therapeutic target', 'tool']",NIDDK,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R01,2019,254179,0.020206014286094014
"Molecular Signatures of Early-Onset Neonatal Sepsis in Umbilical Cord Blood PROJECT SUMMARY Early-onset sepsis (EOS) due to invasive bacterial infection is a leading cause of morbidity in infants and disproportionately affects those born preterm. Accurate diagnosis of EOS remains inadequate. The low sensitivity and delayed time to culture results combined with the poor predictive values of available laboratory markers leads to our inability to rule-out EOS. Thus, infants are exposed to extended duration broad-spectrum empiric antibiotics, which have serious associated adverse consequences such as necrotizing enterocolitis, antibiotic resistant infections, and an altered microbiome. The proposed research will apply proteomics to identify gestational age-specific umbilical cord blood markers toward development of a proposed diagnostic tool with strong negative risk prediction for EOS. Cord blood is promising to identify EOS as it reflects the intrauterine environment where infection originates in preterm birth. In previous work, we found that inflammatory proteins serum amyloid A, C-reactive protein and haptoglobin are substantially elevated in cord blood of preterm infants with culture-confirmed EOS. These data inform our hypothesis that a combination of cord blood proteins provides a signature to differentiate impending EOS and uninfected states. Archived cord blood from infants in an existing longitudinal cohort will be used in a nested case-control design. Aim 1 will measure the cord blood proteome of uninfected infants (controls) across gestational ages using an untargeted proteomics approach to characterize the developmental spectrum. Aim 2(a) will then determine the cord blood proteome signatures of infants with confirmed EOS (cEOS) and culture-negative presumed sepsis (PS). cEOS will be compared to matched controls to identify differentially expressed proteins and candidate markers. PS proteomes will be analyzed to help delineate true infection versus inflammatory subtypes in this heterogeneous group. Bioinformatics pathway analysis may provide novel insights into fetal immune response. Aim 2(b) will determine the best combination of markers to exclude EOS through machine learning decision analysis of proteomics data. Paired placental proteomics in Aim 2(c) will explore origins of fetal inflammation. Aim 3(a) will quantify candidate proteins by an orthogonal immunoassay method. In a validation set of new subjects, Aim 3(b) will measure candidate markers by targeted proteomics and test application of the proposed diagnostic tool. With formal didactics and a mentorship team at Northwestern University with expertise in prematurity, sepsis, biomarker discovery, biostatistics, and decision modeling led by Patrick Seed MD Ph.D., the candidate will gain advanced translational research experience and skills in perinatal research study design, advanced immunology, proteomics, and bioinformatics to further her research agenda. The proposed research and career development will be fundamental towards achieving the candidate’s career goals to: 1) lead a clinical-translational research program on the pathophysiology and host responses of perinatal infection and 2) bring new, reliable sepsis diagnostics to clinical practice, to improve neonatal outcomes through targeted treatment of EOS and antibiotic stewardship. PROJECT NARRATIVE Invasive bacterial infections in newborns carry a high risk of complications and death, yet current diagnostic methods are inaccurate, resulting in the harmful overuse of antibiotics. The proposed work will develop a multi- factor diagnostic model for early-onset neonatal sepsis using umbilical cord blood proteins as biomarkers and enhance our understanding of fetal immune response.

"Identifying determinants of human immunity against influenza: a multiscale approach Project Summary Seasonal influenza is a significant public health concern, yet it is not clear why individuals and populations differ in their protection against influenza infection. The factors underlying protection can act at multiple scales, and thus building a more complete understanding of protection requires an approach that integrates data at the population, individual, and molecular levels. What factors influence population and individual risk of influenza infection? How different are the antibody responses of individuals against influenza and what factors drive those differences? Here, I propose to identify the relative influence of past infection, vaccination, and antigenic evolution on determining both individual and population susceptibility by quantitatively modeling high-resolution epidemiological and immunological data. In particular, I aim to determine the role of past influenza infection in shaping the susceptibility of different age groups, identify the specific targets of the human antibody response against influenza, and infer the relative importance of infection history, vaccination, and epitope immunogenicity on antibody specificity. This work will have a significant impact on our ability to predict future influenza infection and allow us to target interventions toward the most at-risk populations. Success of this project requires training in advanced computational and statistical methods and state-of-the-art immunological techniques by members of the Departments of Ecology & Evolution and Medicine at the University of Chicago. This interdisciplinary and collaborative training environment will provide a strong foundation for gaining more complete understanding of the interactions between influenza and the human immune system. Project Narrative Influenza infection is a significant public health concern resulting in thousands of deaths annually. Here, I propose to systematically identify how exposure history, vaccination, and other factors affect individual susceptibility to influenza infection. These insights will improve our ability to identify populations most at-risk for infection as well as allow us to tailor intervention and prevention efforts to more effectively combat seasonal influenza.",Identifying determinants of human immunity against influenza: a multiscale approach,9760507,F32AI145177,"['Affect', 'Affinity', 'Amino Acid Substitution', 'Antibodies', 'Antibody Avidity', 'Antibody Response', 'Antibody Specificity', 'Binding', 'Birth', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Chicago', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Ecology', 'Effectiveness', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Epitopes', 'Evolution', 'Exposure to', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Glycoproteins', 'Hemagglutinin', 'Hospitalization', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immune system', 'Immunity', 'Immunologic Techniques', 'Immunologics', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Influenza', 'Intervention', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Medicine', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Neuraminidase', 'Pattern', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Populations at Risk', 'Predisposition', 'Prevention', 'Preventive measure', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Seasons', 'Shapes', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'Statistical Methods', 'Surface Antigens', 'Testing', 'Training', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Vaccination', 'Variant', 'Virus', 'Work', 'adaptive immune response', 'age group', 'base', 'cohort', 'combat', 'design', 'immunogenicity', 'imprint', 'improved', 'individual response', 'infection risk', 'influenzavirus', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'member', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'seasonal influenza', 'success', 'universal influenza vaccine']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,F32,2019,65304,0.039732871909672875
"Neurovirulent HSV-1 Recombinants for vQTL Analysis Abstract Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) is a significant human pathogen and is the leading cause of sporadic encephalitis in the USA. Strains of virus display virulence phenotypes ranging from avirulent to highly pathogenic. There are indications that the virulence of a given strain of virus is actually determined by the “constellation” of genes carried by the virus and how they interact with each other; a phenomenon termed epistasis. Traditional methods for analyzing the function of viral genes are difficult to apply to studying epistatic interactions in virulence. Recently we described a novel approach, vQTLmap, that has allowed us to identify contributions of multiple genes to peripheral disease phenotypes. To date we have analyzed four quantitative phenotypes, blepharitis, stromal keratitis, corneal neovascularization, and weight loss. Surprisingly, there are distinct differences in the viral genes that appear to be driving each of these phenotypes. In order to carry out vQTLmap using quantitative measures of neurovirulence, we need to isolate additional neurovirulent recombinants between the OD4 and CJ994 parental viruses. The goals of this proposal are to generate the reagents (e.g., neurovirulent recombinants) needed to analyze neurovirulence genes driving HSV-1 encephalitis and identify epistatic interactions and carry out vQTLmap analysis of percent mortality, percent ataxia, percent head tilt, and percent limb paralysis. At the completion of this project, we will be able to submit an R01 application to carry out vQTLmap on features such as percent mortality, brain titers of virus, localization of the infection in the brain, and neuroinvasiveness. A better understanding of how viral genes work together to promote disease has the potential to identify novel targets that could assist antiviral drug or vaccine development efforts. Narrative The role played by viral genes in determining the outcome of infection is poorly understood, particularly for Herpes simplex virus, which is an important pathogen. We have validated a novel approach involving generating recombinant viruses, determining the sequence of their genomes, and using novel statistical methods to map viral genes that affect the severity of the infection. In order to extend the analysis to neurovirulence (encephalitis), we need to isolate more neurovirulent recombinants. The goal of this application is to isolate additional HSV-1 recombinants so we can identify genetic drivers of encephalitis in the HSV-1 genome. The project ultimately has the potential to identify novel therapeutic targets for drug or vaccine development.",Neurovirulent HSV-1 Recombinants for vQTL Analysis,9666459,R21AI137280,"['Affect', 'Animal Model', 'Antiviral Agents', 'Ataxia', 'Automobile Driving', 'Blepharitis', 'Blindness', 'Body Weight decreased', 'Brain', 'Central Nervous System Infections', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Corneal Neovascularization', 'Corneal Ulcer', 'Data', 'Digestion', 'Disease', 'Encephalitis', 'Eye Infections', 'Female', 'Focal Infection', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Epistasis', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Herpesvirus 1', 'Infection', 'Keratitis', 'Limb structure', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Mus', 'Nature', 'Outcome', 'Paralysed', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pattern', 'Peripheral', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Probability', 'Publishing', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Reagent', 'Recombinants', 'Role', 'Severities', 'Simplexvirus', 'Statistical Methods', 'Testing', 'Vero Cells', 'Viral Genes', 'Viral Physiology', 'Virulence', 'Virus', 'Work', 'disease phenotype', 'drug development', 'human pathogen', 'innovation', 'male', 'mortality', 'neurovirulence', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'pathogen', 'recombinant virus', 'vaccine development']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R21,2019,191250,-0.0023088221350978763
"Omics for TB:  Response to Infection and Treatment Abstract – Overview With about 10 million new cases of active disease and 1.8 million deaths annually, TB is a global health emergency. A distinguishing feature of TB disease is its biological heterogeneity, which manifests at the clinical level chiefly in 2 forms: disease progression and treatment response. The premise of this Program is that the heterogeneous outcomes of TB infection and treatment are determined by the interplay of competing regulatory networks between the pathogen and the host. Our primary goal is to apply systems biology approaches to elucidate the biological control underlying the variability of disease outcome and response to treatment. Our first specific aim is to define novel host regulators of TB disease progression in vivo, and the innate and adaptive networks they control. We will also seek to define novel Mtb regulators of TB treatment response, and the Mtb regulatory networks that they control. This work will allow us to produce and validate host and Mtb models of TB disease progression and treatment response. Altogether, this program addresses key unanswered questions that stymie efforts to combat the TB pandemic. Our team has perfected the required platforms and scientific approaches to execute this ambitious research plan in a timely and cost- effective manner. All the participating investigators have strong records of interacting productively, and of disseminating their data and reagents to the scientific community. Project Narrative - Omics for TB: Response to Infection and Treatment Mycobacterium tuberculosis causes ~10 million new cases of active disease and 1.8 million deaths each year, and our tools to combat tuberculosis (TB) disease are universally outdated and overmatched.

"Neutralization Fingerprinting Analysis of Polyclonal Antibody Responses against HIV-1 Project Summary HIV-1 poses a substantial health and economic burden, with more than 30 million people currently infected worldwide. The search for an effective HIV-1 vaccine remains a top priority, and a deeper understanding of how the immune system recognizes HIV-1 can help inform vaccine design. Lately, much effort has focused on understanding the antibody responses to HIV-1 infection. However, the polyclonal neutralizing antibody responses in an individual are very complex. Standard methods for mapping such responses include various experimental techniques, but more recently, computational methods were also developed. These computational methods, which we call NFP (neutralization fingerprinting), are based on analysis of serum neutralization data that is typically obtained in the very first stages of donor sample characterization, and are therefore an efficient technology for accurately mapping antibody specificities in polyclonal responses. The NFP algorithms have already become an important tool in the HIV field and are being used extensively by laboratories throughout the world, including Duke CHAVI-ID, CAPRISA, NIH VRC, and MHRP.  Here, we propose to develop next-generation NFP algorithms and apply them to address biological questions with important implications for understanding the interactions between HIV-neutralizing antibodies and the virus. Specifically, we will develop and apply novel algorithms for: (1) Antibody specificity prediction with significantly improved accuracy and reliability. These algorithms will immensely improve the utility of the NFP approach for prospective identification of antibody specificities in polyclonal sera. (2) Mapping broadly neutralizing antibody responses against novel epitopes on HIV-1 Env. We will use epitope- structural analysis and computational search algorithms to identify novel Env epitopes, and will screen donor samples for the presence of related NFP signals. Promising signals for novel antibody specificities will be characterized further through collaborations. (3) Population-level analysis of broadly neutralizing antibody responses to HIV-1. We will analyze large collections of samples from diverse HIV infection cohorts in order to determine common antibody specificities elicited in response to HIV-1, as well as patterns of potential association between features of the infecting virus sequence and the elicited epitope specificities.  The proposed NFP algorithms will be made available to the public, and will be useful in a number of high-impact areas in the HIV field, including mapping of antibody specificities in previously uncharacterized samples, identification of novel Env epitopes, and large-scale analysis of broadly neutralizing antibody responses within a cohort, or at a population level. Overall, this work will lead to a better understanding of the neutralizing antibody responses against HIV-1 and will build a more complete picture of the epitopes on Env. The proposed algorithmic framework should be generalizable to other important viruses, such as influenza and hepatitis C, and therefore has the potential for a far-reaching impact on public health.

This program follows directly from our significant body of preliminary data (the largest available for these families of viruses), therapeutics in hand, multidisciplinary expertise, and demonstrated collaborative success. Included in the proposed CETR portfolio are: (1) the only available immunotherapeutics against endemic Lassa virus, with reversal of late-stage disease and complete survival in infected non-human primates, (2) novel Ebola and pan- ebolavirus therapeutics that also completely protect non-human primates from disease, and that were built by the paradigm-shifting and comprehensive analysis of a global consortium, and (3) much needed, first-in-class therapeutics against the re-emerging alphaviruses that have tremendous epidemic potential in the United States and around the globe. These multidisciplinary studies, founded upon pioneering structural biology of the antigen targets, include innovations such as agnostic, high-throughput Fc profiling and optimization, coupled with Fv evolution to enhance potency and developability, as well as a sophisticated statistical and computational analysis core to evaluate thresholds and correlates of protection across the major families of pathogens. Together, we aim to understand what findings represent general rules and what data are specific to each virus family. We also aim to provide streamlined systems for antibody choice and optimization that do not yet exist, and to build a broadly applicable platform for mAb discovery and delivery against any novel pathogen as they emerge. The recent resurgence of Lassa, the epidemic nature of Ebola virus and other re-emerging filoviruses, as well as the major population at risk by global movement of mosquito-borne alphaviruses together demonstrate the tremendous global need for immunotherapeutics developed and advanced by this program. NARRATIVE Three major families of emerging viruses (Lassa and other arenaviruses, Ebola and other filoviruses, and mosquito-borne alphaviruses) threaten human health worldwide, but lack approved therapeutics or vaccines. The proposed multidisciplinary consortium, an academic-industry partnership, will advance safe and effective, fully human, monoclonal antibody therapies against these viruses, using candidate therapies that confer complete protection in non-human primates as our starting point. Our collaborative databases, multivariate analyses and innovative antibody optimization strategies will establish platforms for discovery and delivery of much-needed treatments against these and other infectious diseases.",Consortium for Immunotherapeutics against Emerging Viral Threats,9676860,U19AI142790,"['Address', 'Alphavirus', 'Antibodies', 'Antigen Targeting', 'Arenavirus', 'Arthritogenic', 'Biological Assay', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Coupled', 'Culicidae', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Developed Countries', 'Developing Countries', 'Disease', 'Ebola virus', 'Epidemic', 'Evolution', 'Family', 'Filovirus', 'Fostering', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Health', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immunotherapeutic agent', 'Lassa virus', 'Machine Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Mediating', 'Monoclonal Antibodies', 'Monoclonal Antibody Therapy', 'Movement', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Nature', 'Populations at Risk', 'Primate Diseases', 'Reagent', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resources', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'System', 'Talents', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Monoclonal Antibodies', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'United States', 'Vaccines', 'Viral', 'Virus', 'Virus Diseases', 'base', 'biodefense', 'chikungunya', 'clinical development', 'design', 'experience', 'human monoclonal antibodies', 'improved', 'industry partner', 'innovation', 'insight', 'mosquito-borne', 'multidisciplinary', 'nonhuman primate', 'novel', 'pandemic disease', 'pathogen', 'programs', 'research study', 'structural biology', 'success', 'synergism', 'tool']",NIAID,LA JOLLA INSTITUTE FOR IMMUNOLOGY,U19,2019,7168390,0.026757757864546435
"Mapping host-microbe-metabolite interactions in 3D to find diet-derived enhancers of immunity Project Summary Antimicrobial resistance is an increasing problem, and current drug pipelines are not keeping pace with the rise of antimicrobial resistance. An alternative strategy is to boost host immunity. An often overlooked side-effect of the vitamin and mineral supplementation projects of the 1940s is that these supplements greatly reduced infectious disease burden. Recent work has shown that further gains may be possible, especially in adding phytochemicals back to highly processed diets typically consumed in the United States. However, we lack a fundamental understanding of how these components are processed by the microbiome, and how diet-derived molecules, microbiome and host immune system work together to resist infectious disease. A key barrier preventing us from making these discoveries is that each individual assay (microbiome, host gene expression metabolome, dietary compounds) is expensive and highly multivariate. Three key insights that enable the current project are the miniaturization of DNA and RNA sequencing assays on advanced nanoliter- scale liquid handling robots, greatly reducing the cost, the combination of untargeted and targeted mass spectrometry on the same samples in high throughput to enable discovery of a much greater chemical space, and the ability to use explicitly spatial maps on multiple scales to integrate the dataset throughout the body and enable both visual analytics and deep learning approaches based on spatial data. These breakthroughs will provide a fundamentally new understanding of how dietary metabolites promote disease resistance, and will allow us to develop a new infrastructure to integrate results from many investigators in different laboratories studying various aspects of these systems. Additionally, the results will allow us to choose biomaterials and biomarkers in human subjects that provide maximum information about internal nutritional and immune status. Results will be tested against the NHANES and American Gut cohorts. The results of this project will therefore be: 3D maps of mouse models showing how the microbiome, diet, and host gene expression produce immunity; an infrastructure for creating and sharing these maps; and a preliminary test of whether the results extend to large human populations. Project Narrative The public health relevance of this proposal is that it will provide an infrastructure for analyzing impacts of dietary components and microbiomes throughout the body. The analysis of these maps will help us identify dietary components that improve resistance to infectious disease.",Mapping host-microbe-metabolite interactions in 3D to find diet-derived enhancers of immunity,9785812,DP1AT010885,"['3-Dimensional', 'American', 'Antimicrobial Resistance', 'Back', 'Biocompatible Materials', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Chemicals', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Consumption', 'DNA sequencing', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diet', 'Dietary Component', 'Disease Resistance', 'Enhancers', 'Gene Expression', 'Human', 'Immune system', 'Immunity', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Laboratory Study', 'Liquid substance', 'Maps', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Metabolite Interaction', 'Microbe', 'Minerals', 'Miniaturization', 'National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey', 'Nutritional status', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phytochemical', 'Population', 'Process', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Robot', 'Sampling', 'Supplementation', 'System', 'Testing', 'United States', 'Visual', 'Vitamins', 'Work', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'cohort', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'human subject', 'immunological status', 'improved', 'insight', 'metabolome', 'microbiome', 'mouse model', 'nanolitre scale', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'side effect', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NCCIH,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",DP1,2019,1085000,0.0059054770395107516
"Structure-Based Design of a Broadly Protective Group A Streptococcal Vaccine The overall goal of this project is to develop a safe, broadly effective, and affordable vaccine to prevent group A streptococcal infections. Antibodies against the N-terminal hypervariable region (HVR) of surface M (Emm) proteins of GAS are opsonic and are associated with protection against infection. Immunity has classically been described as “type-specific”, leading to the assumption that natural immunity confers protection against only one of the more than 200 different emm types of GAS. We now have new information that calls into question this classic view and serves as the basis for an entirely different approach to GAS vaccine design and development. A recent comprehensive sequence analysis of M proteins from a global collection of 175 emm types of GAS resulted in a new emm cluster typing system that classified 96.2% of all contemporary GAS isolates into 48 emm clusters containing structurally and functionally related M proteins. Moreover, 117 emm types contained in 16 clusters accounted for 94.4% of GAS infections in the world. Indeed, preclinical studies indicated that a multivalent vaccine containing N-terminal peptides from 30 prevalent M types cross-opsonized a significant number of non-vaccine emm types of GAS that co-localized in clusters with vaccine emm types. The frequency of cross-opsonic antibodies, combined with the emm cluster data, prompted us to conclude that there is a need for a paradigm shift away from the concept of “type-specific” immunity against GAS infections to one of “cluster-specific” immunity. Our overall hypothesis is that immunity to GAS infections is the result of both type-specific and cross-reactive antibodies against the N-terminal regions of M proteins and that a new approach employing computational predictions of peptide structures will result in a multivalent vaccine that will induce broadly protective immunity in populations throughout the world. Our preliminary results indicate the feasibility of using structure-based design to predict the antigenic relatedness of M peptides within a cluster. The specific aims of this proposal are to: 1) Apply computational structure-based design in an iterative process with immunological data from Aim 2 to predict the minimal number of M peptide sequences that are most representative of the structural and physicochemical properties of the peptides in one emm cluster containing 17 GAS emm types, 2) determine the cross-reactive immunogenicity of the selected peptides with all seventeen emm types of GAS in the cluster, and apply the results to refine the computational design predictions in Aim 1, 3) apply the refined computational parameters from Aims 1 and 2 to analyze the remaining epidemiologically important emm clusters, select a comprehensive panel of peptides representing all emm types, construct four multivalent recombinant vaccine proteins, and assess potential cross-protective immunogenicity using in vitro bactericidal assays against all 117 emm types of GAS, and 4) determine the protective immunogenicity of the final multivalent vaccine in unique transgenic mice expressing human C4BP and factor H that will be immunized and then challenged with multiple emm types of GAS. The world needs an effective, safe and affordable vaccine to prevent group A streptococcal (GAS) infections. Although most GAS infections are mild, there are more than 18 million people with a chronic complication of a severe GAS disease worldwide, over 15 million of whom have rheumatic heart disease, another 2 million cases of severe disease occur each year and a total of 517,000 deaths annually are estimated to be due to this organism.

"Computational and Experimental Resources for Virome Analysis in Inflammatory Bowel Disease (CERVAID) SUMMARY  While the role of the bacterial microbiome in human health and disease is well established, few studies have evaluated the contribution of the virome. Recently, we demonstrated that alterations in the enteric virome in adulthood are associated with diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and AIDS. In a cross- sectional comparison of IBD cases and household controls, a significant expansion of the Caudovirales, an order of phages, and anelloviruses, a family of eukaryotic DNA viruses, was observed. Advancing understanding of the IBD virome beyond this finding is limited by: (1) A lack of well defined longitudinal human cohorts to enable discovery of temporal associations of the virome with health and disease; (2) The challenge of viral “dark matter”. Dark matter refers to the typically >50% of the sequences present in purified virus preparations cannot be classified due to a lack of statistically significant alignment to known reference sequences. Thus, current virome studies effectively assess < 50% of the virome, thereby compromising our ability to detect important associations between the virome and disease; (3) Inadequate experimental systems to manipulate the virome. Although sequencing has identified many novel eukaryotic viruses, there are only cell culture systems for a limited number of viruses; moreover, there are no small animal infection models for newly described viruses. In addition while a tremendous diversity of phage has been identified, only a tiny fraction have known hosts and an even smaller fraction has been cultured. Thus, there are significant barriers that must be overcome to be able to experimentally test the impact of either eukaryotic viruses or phages in murine IBD models. These barriers to understanding the role of the IBD virome will be addressed as follows: Aim 1 will define the enteric virome and bacterial microbiome in a longitudinal cohort of IBD patients and household controls and identify virome associations with IBD. In Aim 2 novel computational tools to identify and characterize viruses present in enteric viromes will be developed, including approaches to classify dark matter. In Aim 3 novel experimental systems for functional virome analysis, including novel cultures of both eukaryotic viruses and phages as well as animal infection models, will be developed with the end goal of evaluating causal roles for the viruses and phage in existing muring IBD models. Together, these Aims will not only address significant barriers in understanding of IBD, but will provide a wealth of tangible computational and experimental resources to advance the general field of virome studies.   NARRATIVE The overall goal of this project is to develop novel computational and experimental tools to address challenges in understanding the role of viruses in inflammatory bowel disease. These tools will facilitate studies of not only inflammatory bowel disease, but also broader studies of the relationship of the human virome to other diseases.  ",Computational and Experimental Resources for Virome Analysis in Inflammatory Bowel Disease (CERVAID),9707307,RC2DK116713,"['Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Bacteria', 'Bacterial Infections', 'Bacteriophages', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biology', 'Caudovirales', 'Cell Culture System', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer software', 'DNA Viruses', 'Databases', 'Defect', 'Development', 'Digestive System Disorders', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Enteral', 'Family', 'Feces', 'Genome', 'Gnotobiotic', 'Goals', 'Health', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Household', 'Human', 'Immune system', 'Infection', 'Inflammatory Bowel Diseases', 'Longitudinal cohort', 'Machine Learning', 'Metabolic Diseases', 'Metadata', 'Metagenomics', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases', 'Norovirus', 'Open Reading Frames', 'Parasitic infection', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Play', 'Population', 'Preparation', 'Resource Development', 'Resources', 'Ribosomal RNA', 'Role', 'System', 'Taxonomy', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Viral', 'Viral Genes', 'Viral Genome', 'Virus', 'Virus Diseases', 'bacterial resistance', 'bacteriome', 'base', 'case control', 'cohort', 'computerized tools', 'contig', 'dark matter', 'early childhood', 'experimental analysis', 'genome annotation', 'gut microbiome', 'human virome', 'improved', 'metagenome', 'microbial', 'molecular sequence database', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'phenomenological models', 'protein function', 'software development', 'stool sample', 'tool', 'virology', 'virome']",NIDDK,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,RC2,2019,1872216,0.002249912336062263
"Network modeling and robust estimation of the intraclass correlation coefficient to inform the design and analysis of cluster randomized trials for infectious diseases 7. Project Summary/Abstract There is an urgent need to support research that generates high-quality evidence to inform clinical decision making. Cluster randomized trials (CRTs) achieve the highest standard of evidence for the evaluation of community-level effectiveness of intervention strategies against infectious diseases. However, there is a need to develop new methods to improve the design and analysis of CRTs because unique and complicated analytical challenges arise in such settings. One such issue relates to the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), the degree to which individuals within a community are more similar to one another than to individuals in other communities. Design and analysis of CRTs must take into account the ICC. Lack of accurate information on the ICC jeopardizes the power of CRTs, leads to suboptimal choices of analysis methods and complicates the interpretation of study results. However, reliable information on the ICC is difficult to obtain. A robust and efficient approach for estimating ICCs is based on the second-order generalizing estimating equations. However, its use has been limited by considerable computational burden and poor convergence rates associated with the existing algorithms solving these equations. The first aim addresses these computational challenges. Missing data are ubiquitous and can lead to bias and loss of efficiency. The second aim proposes to develop novel robust and efficient methods for estimating ICCs in the presence of informative missing data. For infectious diseases, the underlying contact/transmission networks give rise to complicated correlation structure. The third aim is to develop network and epidemic models to project the ICC. User-friendly software will be developed to facilitate the implementation of new methods. An immediate application of the proposed methods is their application to the Botswana Combination Prevention Project to improve the estimation of intervention effect and to generate reliable ICC estimates for designing future CRTs in the same population. The proposed methods can be applied to other ongoing and future CRTs, and more broadly, to longitudinal studies and agreement studies where ICCs are also of great interest. The proposed research is significant, because success in addressing these issues will improve the ability to design efficient and well-powered CRTs and the precision in estimating the effects of intervention strategies. Innovation lies in the development of improved computing algorithms adapting approaches from deep learning, the use of semiparametric efficiency theory, and the integration of network modeling, epidemic modeling and statistical inference. The results of the proposed research will benefit both ongoing and future CRTs, permit more efficient use of the resources, and ultimately expedite the control of infectious diseases. 8. Project Narrative The proposed research is relevant to public health because improved methodologies for the design and analysis of cluster randomized trials will benefit both ongoing and future studies, permit more efficient use of the resources, and ultimately improve public health response intended to control the spread of infectious diseases. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to the part of NIAID’s mission that pertains to conducting and supporting research to prevent infectious diseases and to respond to emerging public health threats.",Network modeling and robust estimation of the intraclass correlation coefficient to inform the design and analysis of cluster randomized trials for infectious diseases,9785367,R01AI136947,"['AIDS prevention', 'Accounting', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Americas', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Botswana', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Cluster randomized trial', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Contracts', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Ebola virus', 'Effectiveness', 'Effectiveness of Interventions', 'Epidemic', 'Equation', 'Evaluation', 'Future', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Individual', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease', 'Nosocomial Infections', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Prevention strategy', 'Probability', 'Public Health', 'Publications', 'Randomized', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Research Support', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Running', 'Science', 'Societies', 'Structure', 'System', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'clinical decision-making', 'collaboratory', 'deep learning', 'design', 'experience', 'high standard', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'intervention effect', 'mathematical model', 'network models', 'novel', 'prevent', 'response', 'semiparametric', 'success', 'systems research', 'theories', 'transmission process', 'user friendly software']",NIAID,"HARVARD PILGRIM HEALTH CARE, INC.",R01,2019,247413,0.02745922735931247
"Immune response to Zika infection at the primate maternal-fetal interface ABSTRACT Infection with Zika virus (ZIKV), first linked with an increased incidence of microcephaly in Brazil, is now associated with a spectrum of fetal and postnatal malformations and developmental disorders. Our previous studies with rhesus macaques have demonstrated that, like the human population, severe fetal outcomes are uncommon, but they have also revealed that vertical transmission of ZIKV to the fetus may more common than is currently appreciated, with 100% transmission to fetuses when dams were inoculated in the first or third trimester. Additional neurological deficits from intrauterine infection are now becoming revealed in postnatal life, thus a better understanding of the correlates of vertical transmission at the maternal-fetal interface is critical. Investigators at the University of Wisconsin-Madison are funded to conduct a study to define the viral persistence and distribution in maternal tissues of pregnant rhesus macaques at staged intervals following infection with ZIKV. That study specifically will evaluate maternal tissues, but does not support concurrent evaluation of the maternal-fetal interface. We hypothesize that the antiviral response in the decidua and placenta can determine the risk for vertical transmission of the virus and the degree of fetal pathology and developmental dysregulation. To address this hypothesis, we propose to comprehensively define the immune response at the maternal-fetal interface in these pregnancies in two Specific Aims: Specific Aim 1. To define the T cell, antigen-presenting cell, and innate lymphoid/natural killer cell populations in control and ZIKV-infected decidua, establishing their transcriptional, secreted, and cell-surface profiles with high-dimensional flow cytometry and dimension reduction methodologies. Specific Aim 2. To define the Hofbauer cell surface, secreted, and activation profiles in control and ZIKV- infected placentas. We will use high-dimensional flow cytometric analytical methods established in our laboratories for human decidual leukocytes, guided by our previous work with rhesus decidual leukocytes and placental Hofbauer cells, comparing infected pregnancies with control pregnancies to be supported by this R21 proposal. The ZIKV- infected decidual and placental immunome will be interpreted in light of the distribution, burden, and pathogenic impact of ZIKV replication in the decidua and the fetus. A clearer understanding of the decidual and placental immune response with ZIKV infection, which we can couple with determination of fetal infection and pathology to be gained from the current study, will allow insight into the correlates of decidual and placental immune responses of fetal outcomes. Project Narrative: Infection of pregnant women with Zika virus has been implicated in an increase in the incidence of microcephaly in Brazil, as well as other fetal pathologies of the developing nervous system. It is not understood whether the immune response of the maternal reproductive tract or the fetal placenta itself can mitigate against the risk for fetal developmental outcomes. The nonhuman primate offers an outstanding opportunity to determine if a local response against Zika infection at the maternal-fetal interface can provide insight into developing interventions to interrupt these devastating fetal outcomes once maternal infection has occurred.",Immune response to Zika infection at the primate maternal-fetal interface,9608712,R21AI136014,"['Address', 'Antigen-Presenting Cells', 'Antiviral Response', 'Autopsy', 'Brazil', 'Cell surface', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Decidua', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Dose', 'Evaluation', 'Fetal Development', 'Fetal Membranes', 'Fetal Monitoring', 'Fetus', 'First Pregnancy Trimester', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Funding', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Histopathology', 'Human', 'Immune response', 'Incidence', 'Infection', 'Inflammation', 'Interruption', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Leukocytes', 'Life', 'Light', 'Link', 'Lymphoid', 'Macaca', 'Macaca mulatta', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maternal-Fetal Exchange', 'Methodology', 'Microcephaly', 'Modeling', 'Natural Killer Cells', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurologic Deficit', 'Optic Nerve', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathology', 'Phenotype', 'Placenta', 'Population', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnant Women', 'Primates', 'Process', 'Research Personnel', 'Retina', 'Risk', 'Specimen', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Techniques', 'Third Pregnancy Trimester', 'Tissues', 'Ultrasonography', 'Universities', 'Vertical Disease Transmission', 'Viral', 'Viral Load result', 'Viremia', 'Virus Replication', 'Visual system structure', 'Wisconsin', 'Work', 'ZIKV infection', 'Zika Virus', 'analytical method', 'base', 'co-infection', 'density', 'developmental disease', 'fetal', 'fetal infection', 'high dimensionality', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'intrauterine infection', 'malformation', 'nonhuman primate', 'novel', 'postnatal', 'pregnant', 'reproductive tract', 'response', 'segregation', 'therapeutic evaluation', 'transcriptome', 'transmission process', 'viral transmission', 'virtual', 'virus genetics']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R21,2019,191250,0.01834888021153007
"Mathematical ecology models of host-microbiota interaction in auto microbiota transplants (auto-FMT) Project Summary Mathematical ecology models of host-microbiota interaction  in auto microbiota transplants (auto-FMT) We aim to develop mathematical models for the rational design of microbiota transplants that can restore compositional diversity and function to the damaged microbiota of antibiotic-treated patients. We will focus on hospitalized cancer patients receiving allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplants (allo-HSCT). Allo-HSCT is a potentially curative cancer treatment that compromises the immune system, and requires that patients receive massive antibiotic treatments to prevent and treat life-threatening infections. We will build on a vast clinical database, in vitro experiments in bioreactors and in vivo experiments with mice to develop dynamic mathematical models that describe how antibiotics cause changes in the microbial composition, and how that can impact the recovery of the host's immune system after allo-HSCT. The model expands approaches pioneered by our team—the Generalized Lotka Volterra Ecological Regression (GLOVER) and agent-based models—towards a model that can assist in the development of microbiota therapies for patients undergoing allo-HSCT.  In aim 1 we will use data from a unique clinical resource available at the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer center—a sample bank obtained from >1,500 allo-HSCT patients (including microbiome 16S rRNA and shotgun sequencing) and extensive clinical metadata (including time series of complete blood counts and time and doses of all drugs given while the patients are hospitalized); we will also use data from a first-of-its-kind controlled randomized trial of autologous fecal microbiota transplant (auto-FMT) undergoing in allo-HSCT patients. We will use these unique resources to parameterize our models and investigate how the microbiota composition influences the recovery of the host immune system. In aim 2 we will validate the microbial component of our mathematical model using experimental data from anaerobic laboratory reactors that recreate—in vitro—the human microbiota dynamics during antibiotic treatment and auto-FMT in the absence of a living host. In aim 3 we will develop mouse models to investigate those same microbiota dynamics experimentally but now in the context of a living host.  The data obtained from these clinical studies, in vitro experiments and in vivo models will refine our mathematical models in close cycles of simulation and quantitative experimentation. Our ultimate goal is to develop models that can define optimal microbial cocktails and reconstitute the perturbed microbiota of allo- HSCT patients. In the process we hope to uncover general principles of microbiota ecology for future therapies in other patient populations whose microbiota is damaged by antibiotic treatments. Project Narrative Mathematical ecology models of host-microbiota interaction  in auto microbiota transplants (auto-FMT) The intestinal microbiota is an ecosystem with thousands of bacterial species that interact with each other and with their living host.

"Fluomics: The Next Generation Influenza A virus is a major human respiratory pathogen, and available vaccines and antivirals are of limited efficacy. In order to identify novel targets for therapeutic intervention during influenza virus infection, we have assembled an interdisciplinary team that uses a highly integrated systems level approach to identify and validate key genes/networks involved in virus pathogenesis. The overarching theme of our multidisciplinary proposal “FluOMICS: The NEXT Generation” is to obtain multiple OMICS-based systems level measurements and integrate them using modeling approaches and machine learning algorithms to identify and validate 1) host-virus networks that modulate influenza A virus disease severity, 2) biomarkers in blood that reflect the activation states of these networks and 3) novel host targets for therapeutic interventions. Our underlying main hypothesis is that host networks involved in viral replication and early host responses regulate disease outcomes and represent targets for therapeutic intervention. The proposed studies leverage on our previous collaborations that generated global datasets and models that predict severity of disease caused by three influenza virus strains with different levels of virulence. While our previous studies gave many novel insights in influenza pathogenesis, they likely provide a narrow window on the determinants of disease severity in humans. Thus, it is necessary expand beyond the specific virus strains that were used to study pathogenesis, and explore a broader context of viral and host perturbations linked to clinical outcomes. In order to identify clinically relevant networks involved in influenza virus pathogenesis we propose to integrate into predictive and comprehensive models global responses during influenza virus infection in three systems 1) human blood from a human cohort of patients with documented influenza virus infection and diverse clinical outcomes (Project 1); 2) mouse blood and tissues from experimentally infected animals under a variety of conditions and perturbations resulting in diverse disease outcomes (Project 1) and 3) relevant primary human cells (Project 2). Samples will be processed and send to the Technology Core for global transcriptomics, proteomics and metabolomics analysis. OMICS data sets will be integrated and compared by the Modeling Core to generate network models of disease, uncover blood biomarkers and identify key drivers as targets for therapeutic intervention. Predicted network regulators will be used as a source for subsequent iterative rounds of perturbations to refine existing and to identify new network disease models. Data and models will be managed and disseminated by the Data Management and Bioinformatics Core. We expect that these studies will uncover and validate novel pathogenic networks, blood biomarkers associated with them, and specific therapeutic targets to revert pathogenic networks. In summary, our modeling approaches will find correlates and associations between diverse experimental systems that will help us define human blood biomarkers, and link them to in vivo and ex vivo signatures for both companion diagnostics and personalized therapies. We propose a systematic approach (FluOMICS) to generate predictive models of influenza virus pathogenesis which will a) allow us to identify biomarkers for predicting disease outcome, and b) provide avenues to explore for new, host-directed, therapeutic interventions.",Fluomics: The Next Generation,9627935,U19AI135972,"['Animals', 'Antiviral Agents', 'Benchmarking', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'CRISPR screen', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Collaborations', 'Complementary DNA', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Disease model', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Experimental Models', 'Genes', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Human', 'Immune response', 'Infection', 'Influenza', 'Influenza A Virus, H1N1 Subtype', 'Influenza A virus', 'Integration Host Factors', 'Intervention', 'Link', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Mus', 'Network-based', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Post-Translational Protein Processing', 'Predisposition', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Proteomics', 'Sampling', 'Severities', 'Severity of illness', 'Small Interfering RNA', 'Source', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Tissues', 'Vaccines', 'Viral', 'Viral Pathogenesis', 'Virulence', 'Virus', 'Virus Diseases', 'Virus Replication', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'companion diagnostics', 'data integration', 'data management', 'early detection biomarkers', 'epigenome', 'epigenomics', 'functional genomics', 'human pathogen', 'in vivo', 'influenza virus strain', 'influenzavirus', 'insight', 'machine learning algorithm', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'mouse model', 'multidisciplinary', 'multiple omics', 'network models', 'new therapeutic target', 'next generation', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'personalized medicine', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'protein protein interaction', 'resilience', 'respiratory', 'response', 'specific biomarkers', 'targeted treatment', 'therapeutic target', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptomics']",NIAID,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,U19,2019,2648073,0.022623600016027097
"The Vanderbilt Urologic Infection Repository, a Resource for Personalized Clinical Discovery SUMMARY - OVERALL In personalized medicine, the care of each patient is guided by his/her unique clinical circumstances. At its foundation, however, this paradigm holds a concurrent need for personalized science, in which technologies are developed and hypothesis explored in light of individual diversity. Critically, this diversity also includes unique microbial populations, which can augment the onset, progression, and treatment of disease. Within the field of benign urology, one of the most common pathologies—urinary tract infections (UTIs)—is also one of the most heterogenous, as the risk factors, symptomatology, and outcomes can vary significantly from patient to patient. Not surprisingly, the complexity of UTIs extends beyond the host, with tremendous genotypic and phenotypic diversity among the species/strains of microbes that elicit these infections. To better align the management of UTIs with the goals of precision care, our understanding of pathophysiology must become more nuanced, as we network in tandem the inherent diversity of host and microbe. To these ends, we propose a resource that provides an interconnected picture of both components, the Vanderbilt Urologic Infection Repository (VUIR). With our institution's unique foundation in medical informatics, we will create a searchable database of clinical parameters from bacteriuric patients (many thousands of cases annually), together with microbiologic data on the organisms. In parallel, the paired microbial strains will be stored permanently as a biobank for analysis and experimentation, together with linkage to anonymized versions of patient records within Vanderbilt's Synthetic Derivative (a filtered version of our electronic health data). The logistical infrastructure for clinical biobanking is also already in place at Vanderbilt via the institutionally-supported microVU initiative, in which microbial isolates from the diagnostic laboratory are repurposed as academic resources. As a basic expansion of these efforts, the VUIR will represent a first-in-kind tool for developing technologies to combat UTIs, while also investigating their underlying pathogenesis. In particular, it could facilitate functional genomic studies that bridge host and pathogen. Demonstrating the resource's value, we will conduct whole-genome sequencing of clinically underrepresented bacterial species, together with genome-wide association studies that focus on the infection phenotypes of the source-patients. In addition to novel virulence factors, we seek to identify elusive genomic determinants that distinguish cases of asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) and symptomatic UTI. The molecular basis of UTI-versus-ASB epitomizes a clinical challenge that requires integration of host and pathogen, as provided by the VUIR. Finally, to support the program and its discoveries, we propose an organizational structure of multidisciplinary content-area experts and dedicated support staff. Along with coordinating daily activities and assuring seamless dissemination of data/specimens, this Administrative Core (AdCore) will champion educational activities and additional pilot projects that build upon the resource. In sum, the VUIR stands to generate actionable discoveries from the human and microbial diversity of UTIs—not in spite of it. PROJECT NARRATIVE - OVERALL Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are not only a common urologic ailment, but one of the most widespread medical conditions facing women, men and children around the globe. In order for clinicians to better manage UTIs—and scientists to understand them more deeply—our clinical viewpoint must become personalized, as we study in tandem the afflicted patients and offending pathogens. To these ends, the Vanderbilt Urologic Infection Repository will provide a first-in-kind resource for the biomedical community, creating a massive network of patient-level clinical data and banked microbial strains from patients with real-world infections.","The Vanderbilt Urologic Infection Repository, a Resource for Personalized Clinical Discovery",9913350,P20DK123967,"['Acinetobacter baumannii', 'Advisory Committees', 'Antimicrobial susceptibility', 'Area', 'Bacteriuria', 'Benign', 'Caring', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Communities', 'Community Outreach', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Education and Outreach', 'Educational Activities', 'Educational workshop', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Escherichia coli', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genitourinary System Infection', 'Genitourinary system', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Genus staphylococcus', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Informatics', 'Infrastructure', 'Institution', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Light', 'Link', 'Location', 'Logistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Medical', 'Medical Informatics', 'Medical Records', 'Microbe', 'Microbiology', 'Molecular', 'Organism', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Physiology', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Published Comment', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Resources', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Services', 'Source', 'Specimen', 'Sum', 'Symptoms', 'Taxonomy', 'Technology', 'Urinary tract infection', 'Urine', 'Urologic Diseases', 'Urology', 'Uropathogen', 'Virulence Factors', 'Woman', 'base', 'biobank', 'biomedical resource', 'career development', 'clinical database', 'clinical infrastructure', 'clinical sequencing', 'combat', 'data mining', 'data space', 'data warehouse', 'demographics', 'functional genomics', 'genome sequencing', 'genome wide association study', 'health data', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'innovation', 'interest', 'member', 'men', 'microbial', 'microbial genome', 'microbiome', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'operation', 'organizational structure', 'outcome forecast', 'pathogen', 'pathogenic microbe', 'personalized care', 'personalized medicine', 'precision medicine', 'prevent', 'programs', 'repository', 'symptomatology', 'tool', 'translational impact', 'urinary', 'urologic', 'whole genome', 'young woman']",NIDDK,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,P20,2019,340000,0.0357772854755248
"Clinical validation of a novel handheld optical measurement system to enable 1-touch assessment of middle ear effusion in standard otoscopy Broader Impacts  More than 90% of children experience at least one ear infection before age 5, making ear infections among the most common childhood conditions. Family Physicians and Pediatricians see more than 20 million suspected ear infection cases per year in the US. Approximately 40% of these are misdiagnosed infections in healthy ears, leading to 6-9 million unnecessary antibiotic prescriptions annually. In fact, ear infection is the leading cause of unnecessary antibiotic use in children, resulting in hundreds of millions of dollars wasted and millions of children placed at undue risk for adverse side effects. On a societal level, unnecessary antibiotic use and resultant resistant microorganisms adds $20B in excess healthcare costs annually. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, American Academy of Pediatrics, and American Academy of Family Physicians have identified improved ear infection diagnostics as necessary to slow the spread of resistant microorganisms. Unfortunately, despite updated clinical guidelines dating back to 1994, no significant reduction in unnecessary prescription rates has been achieved.  Even a modest improvement in ear infection diagnosis has the potential to positively affect millions of children, save hundreds of millions in direct costs, and slow the evolution of resistant bacteria. Cactus invented Optical Tympanometry (OT) technology to improve ear infection diagnosis in primary care, where most cases are seen. Cactus technology is 98% accurate in a clinical study of 30 pediatric participants, and works in clean and waxy ears. Intellectual Merit  Children affected with ear infection are most often too young to adequately describe their symptoms. Signs of ear infections are numerous, but they are also very non-specific. Clinical diagnosis is most commonly done by assessing a set of qualitative factors using an otoscope to provide a magnified view of the ear drum. Most clinicians look for middle ear redness. However, redness alone is less than 65% accurate, matching accuracy statistics observed in primary care. The American Academy of Pediatrics and American Academy of Family Physicians recommend an objective quantitative assessment of the presence or absence of middle ear effusion (MEE). In fact, Key Action Statement 1C in the AAP’s most recent Acute Otitis Media (active ear infection requiring antibiotic treatment, AOM) guideline states:  Clinicians should not diagnose AOM in children who do not have middle ear effusion (MEE)  Currently, MEE is often unassessed due to technology limitations. Existing acoustic and pneumatic devices are slow, subjective and can be painful to children. As a result, clinicians commonly prescribe a course of antibiotics out of a preponderance of caution, or to placate parents. Cactus invented OT as a rapid, seamless means of assessing MEE during otoscopy. This SBIR Phase I proposal validates a miniaturized embodiment of OT (LED-OT) built into the familiar otoscope. Specific Aims Aim 1 (Month 0-2): Assembly and Repeatability & Reproducibility Study of LED-OT Otoscopes. Cactus has developed a patent pending (US62/675,056 & US161040195) LED-OT otoscope based on its innovative multiLED microchip, which houses all 13 wavelengths required for OT in a 6x6mm form factor. Cactus will assemble 6 LED-OT otoscope units for rigorous measurement repeatability and reproducibility assessment followed by clinical validation in Aims 2-3. Aim 2 (Month 2-12): Clinical Data Collection IRB approved (UCI HS#2016-3039) data collection will take place under the supervision of UC Irvine Professor Elliot Botvinick via a sub-award. Clinical data collection mirrors that used in 510(k) applications for previously cleared acoustic devices and enables receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis of LED-OT otoscopy. Aim 3 (Month 2-12): Clinical Data Analysis Clinical data analysis will be concurrent with data collection, with two specific goals. First, train OT’s statistical component. Second, validate performance of LED-OT in pediatric participants using ROC analysis. A successful outcome of this proposal will be validated LED-OT technology and 6 otoscopes prepared for a pivotal study in Phase II to compare LED-OT and acoustic methods in an office setting. Together, Phase I and II will prepare LED-OT for analytical and clinical trials necessary for a 510(k) application, encourage adoption of our revolutionary technology, and facilitate private investment and relationships with strategic partners. Project Narrative  Cactus Medical, LLC is developing a rapid, low-cost, non-invasive ear infection indicator to improve ear infection diagnosis in pediatric care settings. Cactus’ SmartScope will provide physicians with an accurate indication of ear infection at the press of a button while they are performing their normal inspection of the ear drum through an otoscope. SmartScope technology has shown 98% accuracy in a pediatric clinical study. This device has the potential to save $1.5 billion annually and reduce the rate at which anti-bacterial resistance evolves by limiting unnecessary antibiotic prescriptions and protect millions of children from unnecessary antibiotic treatment.",Clinical validation of a novel handheld optical measurement system to enable 1-touch assessment of middle ear effusion in standard otoscopy,9844869,R43DC018248,"['Academy', 'Acoustics', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Analysis of Variance', 'Antibiotic Therapy', 'Antibiotics', 'Area', 'Award', 'Back', 'Bacterial Drug Resistance', 'Cactaceae', 'Caring', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical assessments', 'Collection', 'Confidence Intervals', 'County', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Direct Costs', 'Ear', 'Evolution', 'Family Physicians', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Guidelines', 'Head', 'Health Care Costs', 'Infection', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'Investments', 'Legal patent', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Optics', 'Oranges', 'Otitis Media', 'Otitis Media with Effusion', 'Otoscopes', 'Otoscopy', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Pediatrics', 'Peer Review', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Primary Health Care', 'Privatization', 'Procedures', 'Protocols documentation', 'Readiness', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Redness', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research Design', 'Resistance', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Supervision', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Touch sensation', 'Training', 'Tube', 'Tympanic membrane', 'Tympanometry', 'Tympanostomy', 'Update', 'Validation', 'Waxes', 'Work', 'accurate diagnosis', 'bacterial resistance', 'base', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'cost', 'design', 'ear infection', 'experience', 'flexible electronics', 'improved', 'innovation', 'microchip', 'microorganism', 'middle ear', 'miniaturize', 'novel', 'off-patent', 'pediatrician', 'professor', 'side effect', 'statistics', 'validation studies']",NIDCD,"CACTUS MEDICAL,LLC",R43,2019,224808,0.0363947671857444
"Decoding the microbial burden in diabetic foot ulcers Chronic, non-healing wounds are common and costly complications of diabetes. Microbial colonization and biofilm formation are hypothesized to impair wound healing and contribute to severe complications such as osteomyelitis and amputation. Although all chronic wounds are colonized with microbiota, its importance, in the absence of clinical infection, is currently unknown. In this competitive renewal, we hypothesize that host response, wound healing, and clinical DFU outcomes are determined by 1) genomic diversification of the wound pathogen Staphylococcus aureus; 2) commensal interactions with wound pathogens; and 3) commensal interactions with the host. In the previous cycle, we developed a shotgun metagenomic sequencing pipeline to analyze the microbiota colonizing neuropathic, non-infected DFU (n=100; the “DFU100” cohort) in a longitudinal prospective cohort study. We observed that strain-level variation of the wound pathogen Staphylococcus aureus was associated with DFU outcomes. Therefore, in Aim 1, we will use a microbial genomic approach and matched clinical isolates from the DFU100 cohort to identify S. aureus genomic determinants of pathogenesis in DFU and their association with clinical outcomes. We also observed that species clinically regarded as “bystanders” (e.g. skin commensals, environmental contaminants) influence the virulence of wound pathogens and tune host tissue repair responses to promote healing in vivo. Aim 2 will determine if a skin commensal, Corynebacterium striatum, tunes the virulence of S. aureus and improves wound healing in murine and porcine models of S. aureus wound infection. Aim 3 is based on our observation that Alcaligenes faecalis wound isolates promote keratinocyte migration, cytokine secretion, and accelerated wound closure in a murine model of diabetic wound healing. We will establish the mechanism and therapeutic potential of A. faecalis-mediated host responses that lead to accelerated wound healing. The proposed research will use cutting-edge, cross-disciplinary approaches to investigate interactions between wound pathogens, wound “bystanders”, and the host; understanding these mechanisms will lead to improved DFU outcomes as our long-term objectives are to 1) develop novel microbiota-based interventions to improve healing that exploit microbial interactions with each other and the host; and 2) identify microbial biomarkers to classify patients at risk of complication. Chronic non-healing foot wounds develop in as many as 25% of persons with diabetes, and are often colonized or infected with microbes, though the role of microbes in healing and complications is unclear. The objective of this project is to establish the microbial basis of impaired healing and poor outcomes in diabetic foot ulcers by coupling cutting-edge microbial genomic and bioinformatic techniques with clinically relevant models. This knowledge will enable the development of novel microbiota-based therapeutic approaches and identification of patients at risk for complication.",Decoding the microbial burden in diabetic foot ulcers,9816677,R01NR015639,"['Adhesions', 'Alcaligenes', 'Amputation', 'Attenuated', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Markers', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Complication', 'Complications of Diabetes Mellitus', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Corynebacterium', 'Coupling', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diabetic Foot Ulcer', 'Diabetic wound', 'Enterococcus faecalis', 'Environmental Pollution', 'Family suidae', 'Fractionation', 'Gene Expression', 'Genetic', 'Genomic approach', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Grant', 'Growth', 'Immune response', 'Impaired wound healing', 'In Vitro', 'Infection', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Length of Stay', 'Lower Extremity', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Mediating', 'Metadata', 'Microbe', 'Microbial Biofilms', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Neuropathy', 'Osteomyelitis', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Phenotype', 'Production', 'Prospective cohort study', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Series', 'Shotguns', 'Skin', 'Staphylococcus aureus', 'Staphylococcus aureus infection', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Toxic effect', 'United States', 'Variant', 'Virulence', 'Wound Healing', 'Wound Infection', 'antimicrobial', 'base', 'chronic wound', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'comparative', 'cost', 'cytokine', 'diabetic wound healing', 'foot', 'genome analysis', 'genome sequencing', 'genome wide association study', 'healing', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'in vivo', 'keratinocyte', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'metagenomic sequencing', 'microbial', 'microbial colonization', 'microbiota', 'microorganism interaction', 'migration', 'mortality', 'mouse model', 'non-healing wounds', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'phenotypic data', 'predict clinical outcome', 'predictive marker', 'response', 'tissue repair', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'whole genome', 'wound', 'wound closure']",NINR,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2019,542166,-0.009205630080063624

"Systematic Analysis of Morphogenesis, Commensalism, and Virulence in a Leading Human Fungal Pathogen The impact of fungal pathogens on human health is devastating. They infect billions of people worldwide, and kill more than 1.5 million each year. The most vulnerable are people with reduced immune function, such as those with HIV or those undergoing immune suppressing treatments for cancer or organ transplants. One of the most pervasive fungal pathogens is Candida albicans, which kills almost 40% of people suffering from bloodstream infections. Treating these infections is extremely difficult, as fungi are closely related to humans and there are very few drugs that kill the fungus without host toxicity. With the emergence of drug resistance, the development of new therapeutic strategies is now crucial. To address this important clinical need and identify new antifungal drug targets, it is critical to uncover mechanisms that enable C. albicans to cause life-threatening human disease.  We are one of the first academic labs to obtain a powerful resource that will allow us to test the function of almost every gene in the C. albicans genome. This resource includes a collection of double barcoded heterozygous mutants covering ~90% of the genome, and a collection of strains covering ~40% of the genome where the expression of the remaining wild-type allele of a gene is governed by the tetracycline-repressible promoter. This resource provides an unprecedented opportunity to identify genes that control key virulence traits such as morphogenesis. It also enables the identification of determinants of commensalism and virulence, and to further elucidate the molecular mechanisms involved. We have optimized a functional genomics platform for massively parallel analysis of fungal virulence traits using next generation sequencing to quantify the relative proportion of each barcoded strain in pooled assays. We have also optimized high- resolution image analysis of cellular morphology and structures, and assays for identifying genes important for commensalism, virulence, and interaction with host immune cells. Our studies will provide the first global analysis of C. albicans morphogenesis, commensalism, and virulence.  Our studies will: 1) develop a computational platform to predict C. albicans essential genes, and expand the collection of tetracycline-repressible conditional expression strains to cover most non-essential genes, since genes required for pathogen viability in vitro provide little insight into mechanisms of host adaptation or virulence; 2) identify novel regulators of key virulence traits such as morphogenesis; and 3) identify determinants of C. albicans host adaptation and virulence on a genome scale. This work will provide an expanded functional genomics resource to advance the field, and will leverage this resource to elucidate the genes and genetic networks governing morphogenesis and virulence. This will reveal new strategies to cripple fungal pathogens, and drug targets to improve clinical outcome. The focus of this proposal is to elucidate mechanisms governing morphogenesis, commensalism, and virulence of the fungal pathogen Candida albicans. This eukaryotic pathogen has a profound impact on human health, with a global incidence of Candida bloodstream infections of ~400,000 cases, associated with crude mortality rates of 42% and attributable mortality rates of 27%; C. albicans is the most prevalent Candida species in almost all patient populations. The central hypotheses that govern this proposal are that functional genomic analysis of C. albicans using genome-scale libraries of double barcoded heterozygous gene deletion mutants and tetracycline-repressible conditional expression strains will reveal novel circuitry governing morphogenesis, commensalism, and virulence, and that targeting this circuitry has therapeutic potential for combating life-threatening fungal infections.","Systematic Analysis of Morphogenesis, Commensalism, and Virulence in a Leading Human Fungal Pathogen",9751202,R01AI127375,"['Address', 'Alleles', 'Aneuploidy', 'Antifungal Agents', 'Antifungal Therapy', 'Ascomycota', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Candida', 'Candida albicans', 'Cells', 'Cellular Morphology', 'Cellular Structures', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Cues', 'Cytolysis', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diploidy', 'Drug Targeting', 'Drug resistance', 'Environment', 'Essential Genes', 'Filament', 'Foundations', 'Gastrointestinal tract structure', 'Gene Deletion', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomic Library', 'Genomic approach', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'HIV', 'Health', 'Human', 'Image Analysis', 'Immune', 'Immune system', 'Immunocompromised Host', 'In Vitro', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Investments', 'Laboratories', 'Libraries', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Morphogenesis', 'Mus', 'Mutation', 'Mycoses', 'Nosocomial Infections', 'Organ Transplantation', 'Organism', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Process', 'Property', 'Publishing', 'Resistance development', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Sepsis', 'Solid', 'Symbiosis', 'Systemic infection', 'Testing', 'Tetracyclines', 'Therapeutic', 'Toxic effect', 'Virulence', 'Work', 'Yeast Model System', 'Yeasts', 'attributable mortality', 'cancer therapy', 'cancer transplantation', 'combat', 'computational platform', 'fitness', 'functional genomics', 'fungus', 'gene replacement', 'genome-wide', 'genomic platform', 'high resolution imaging', 'human disease', 'immune function', 'improved', 'insight', 'member', 'mortality', 'mucosal microbiota', 'mutant', 'new therapeutic target', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'novel therapeutics', 'pathogen', 'pathogenic fungus', 'patient population', 'programs', 'promoter', 'quantitative imaging', 'response', 'trait', 'unpublished works']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF TORONTO,R01,2019,545099,-0.007558456386749937
"Comprehensive analysis of human adaptive immune receptors to elucidate correlates of Epstein-Barr virus disease suppression Project Summary/Abstract This project will develop a new technological approach for the comprehensive analysis of adaptive immune responses, which holds the potential to catalyze new strategies to prevent and treat disease. Here we will apply immune profiling techniques recently invented by the PI to investigate the mechanisms of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) adaptive immune control in clinical cohorts of infected patients. EBV is a highly prevalent pathogen infecting >90% of the world’s population. Primary EBV infection often causes infectious mononucleosis (IM) and long-term sequelae include numerous malignancies, lymphoproliferative disorders, and a strong association with multiple sclerosis. No EBV vaccine is approved to date, and the molecular mechanisms of immune protection from EBV-associated diseases are unclear. Unfortunately, prior technical barriers in high- throughput immune profiling methods have prevented a comprehensive understanding of adaptive immune protection against EBV diseases. A technological approach that identifies the critical features of EBV immune protection will advance new solutions for vaccine and therapeutic development. Therefore, we developed an experimental pipeline to enable rapid and cost-effective analysis of B- and T-cell responses to EBV that is scalable to dozens of human patients per experiment. We hypothesize that a comprehensive B- and T-cell analysis of carefully selected patient cohorts that either can or cannot suppress symptomatic infection will reveal function-based correlates of EBV control. To test this hypothesis, we will apply quantitative immune profiling technologies to analyze cryopreserved longitudinal samples from recently completed prospective clinical studies of IM. Patient samples in our cohort span pre- and post-infection through convalescence and encompass the full range of clinical IM severity scores (from 0, asymptomatic primary infection, to 6, essentially bedridden with IM). Immune profile data will be used to establish adaptive immune correlates of IM disease severity. In addition, we will analyze immune responses in apparently immunocompetent patients with chronic active EBV (CAEBV) disease, or patients who do not adequately suppress EBV infection, to gain insight regarding adaptive immune function and dysfunction in CAEBV. Finally, we will develop a new computational toolkit to rapidly identify immune correlates from high-throughput datasets. Successful completion of this project will constitute the first comprehensive functional B- and T-cell receptor analysis in a human clinical cohort. Our efforts will provide a repertoire-scale, mechanistic understanding of adaptive immunity to EBV and suggest new strategies for treatment and prevention of EBV-associated diseases. Our long-term goal is to develop human immune profiling techniques as a platform approach to accelerate the rational design of vaccines and therapeutics against pathogens of high public health importance, beginning with EBV. Project Narrative This project will apply new high-throughput immune profiling technologies to elucidate the features of effective Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) immune control. EBV causes a range of human diseases including infectious mononucleosis and several forms of cancer; however, limited EBV treatment options are available and no approved preventive EBV vaccines exist.

"Mentoring in Immunometabolic Dysregulation in TB and TB/HIV Tuberculosis (TB) is the leading cause of death among people living with HIV (PLWH) worldwide. Despite recent scientific advances, significant gaps remain in our understanding of the immune mechanisms responsible for control and eradication of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection. PLWH with latent TB infection (LTBI) have a ~10% annual risk of progressing to TB disease, however currently available tests for LTBI diagnosis have reduced sensitivity in this population and are not able to predict which latently infected individuals are at highest risk for developing TB for targeted preventive therapy. Emerging data from clinically relevant animal models suggest that LTBI and active TB represent a spectrum of immune responses and host pathology, with increasing metabolic changes and immune dysregulation during the transition to TB disease. We have identified unique serum metabolite and microRNA (miRNA) profiles that are able to discriminate between patients with TB and those with non-TB lung disease. However, these novel TB signatures have not been assessed prospectively to identify PLWH and HIV-negative persons with LTBI who are at increased risk for TB progression. In order to address this significant knowledge gap, in Aim 1 of the current research program, trainees will leverage the Indian and South African RePORT longitudinal biorepositories of household contacts of TB index cases to test the hypothesis that TB is a chronic inflammatory disease associated with profound changes in immune regulation and metabolism prior to the onset of clinical signs and symptoms. Another major barrier to global TB eradication efforts is the lengthy and complicated current anti-tubercular regimen, which is associated with medical nonadherence and the emergence of drug resistance. Recently, attention has focused on host-directed adjunctive therapies aimed at optimizing immune responses to the pathogen and improving lung damage. Lipid-laden macrophages (foam cells) are central to maintaining chronic TB infection by providing a favorable niche in which antimicrobial functions are down-regulated, and by inducing caseation and tissue damage. Recent work has shown that foam-cell-rich and necrotic areas of TB granulomas are particularly enriched in triglycerides. Mtb infection is associated with dysregulation of two cellular pathways involved in triglyceride homeostasis: a pro-lipogenic pathway involving protein kinase B and mTOR complex 1 (Akt/mTORC1), and an anti- lipogenic pathway involving AMP-activated protein kinase and the sirtuins (AMPK/SIRT). In Aim 2, trainees will use longitudinal clinical samples from RePORT study participants and experimental infections ex vivo to characterize: (i) the relationship between activation of these pathways and control of clinical Mtb infection, and the effect of anti-lipogenic treatments on antimycobacterial functions of human macrophages infected ex vivo. The research aims will be integrated with a mentoring strategy for mentees that fosters development of high impact patient-oriented research with a pathway to independence. Tuberculosis (TB) remains among the most deadly infections worldwide, especially among people living with HIV. Current available tests are not able to accurately detect persons at the highest risk of developing TB, and curing the disease requires at least 6 months of therapy because the TB bacteria can avoid being killed by the immune system and currently available drugs. In the current proposal, physician scientists will receive training in a variety of complementary disciplines, and use several cutting-edge experimental and modeling techniques to analyze samples from patients with TB and TB/HIV, with the ultimate goal of identifying new biomarkers that can predict TB disease and host-directed therapies that can shorten TB treatment.",Mentoring in Immunometabolic Dysregulation in TB and TB/HIV,9846869,K24AI143447,"['5&apos', '-AMP-activated protein kinase', 'Address', 'Animal Model', 'Antibiotics', 'Antimycobacterial Agents', 'Archives', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Automobile Driving', 'Bacteria', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Cause of Death', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Complex', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Drug resistance', 'Environment', 'Experimental Models', 'FRAP1 gene', 'Foam Cells', 'Fostering', 'Goals', 'HIV', 'HIV Seronegativity', 'HIV Seropositivity', 'HIV/TB', 'Homeostasis', 'Household', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immune system', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Inflammatory', 'International', 'Knowledge', 'Lesion', 'Lipid-Laden Macrophage', 'Lipids', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Mentors', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'MicroRNAs', 'Mycobacterium tuberculosis', 'Necrosis', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Preventive therapy', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt', 'Pulmonary Tuberculosis', 'Regimen', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Scientific Advances and Accomplishments', 'Scientist', 'Serum', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Sirtuins', 'South African', 'Specimen', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Triglycerides', 'Tuberculosis', 'Validation', 'Whole Blood', 'Work', 'World Health Organization', 'antimicrobial', 'biobank', 'biosignature', 'career', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'cytokine', 'high risk', 'immunoregulation', 'improved', 'indexing', 'lifetime risk', 'lung injury', 'macrophage', 'monocyte', 'mycobacterial', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'patient oriented research', 'peripheral blood', 'prevent', 'programs', 'prospective', 'tool', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'tuberculosis granuloma', 'tuberculosis treatment']",NIAID,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,K24,2019,191195,0.043484181483423145
"Systems Biology of Microbiome-mediated Resilience to Antibiotic-resistant Pathogens ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Infections caused by antibiotic-resistant bacterial pathogens are exceedingly common in immunocompromised hosts. Patients undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) are particularly susceptible to these infections and are the patient population our studies will focus upon. Our goal is to extend and further develop systems biology approaches that our group has pioneered to identify mechanisms by which the intestinal microbiota confers resistance to infection by Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE), antibiotic-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (arKp) and Clostridium difficile (C. diff). Aim 1 of our project is to establish a clinical database from the hospital recrds of allo-HSCT patients during their initial hospitalization that will include all laboratory values,vital signs, pharmacy data, dietary data, symptoms and physical exam findings. Aim 2 will expand our fecal bank by collecting fecal samples from approximately 160 allo-HSCT patients per year and determining the presence/absence of VRE, arKp and C. diff by culture and PCR. We will use NGS of 16S rRNA genes to determine microbiota composition on each sample, will perform metagenomic and RNA sequencing to determine the bacterial transcriptome and perform metabolomic analyses on a selected subset of fecal samples. Aim 3 is to extend our mathematical modeling to identify specific members of the microbiota, metabolic pathways and metabolic products that correlate with resistance to VRE or arKp expansion in the GI tract or are associated with resistance to C. diff infection. The clinical database will be used to establish correlations between clinical treatments or events and changes in the intestinal microbiota or the expression of bacterial metabolic pathways. Ultimately, the computational platforms developed in aim 3 will identify bacterial species or consortia that are associated with resistance to infection and Aim 4 will test these associations in germ-free mouse models. We will culture bacterial species associated with resistance, colonize mice with these protective bacteria and test for resistance against VRE, arKp and C. diff. Samples obtained from these experimental studies will be subjected to metagenomic and metabolomic analyses to further refine, in an iterative fashion, computational models developed in aim 3. Our proposed studies will develop new and extend existing computational models to identify bacterial species and molecular mechanisms that confer resistance to antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The normal bacteria inhabiting the human intestine provide a high level of resistance against antibiotic-resistant bacterial pathogens. We are investigating the intestinal flora of hospitalized patients and using mathematical modeling to identify bacterial species and their metabolic products that reduce the risk of infection by three prevalent antibiotic-resistant bacteria. These studies may lead to the development of new approaches to treat and prevent antibiotic-resistant infections.",Systems Biology of Microbiome-mediated Resilience to Antibiotic-resistant Pathogens,9657637,U01AI124275,"['16S ribosomal RNA sequencing', 'Allogenic', 'Antibiotic Resistance', 'Antibiotic Therapy', 'Antibiotics', 'Bacteria', 'Bacterial Antibiotic Resistance', 'Bacterial Infections', 'Categories', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Clostridium difficile', 'Collection', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Diet', 'Dietary intake', 'Enrollment', 'Event', 'Feces', 'Gastrointestinal tract structure', 'Germ-Free', 'Gnotobiotic', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immunocompromised Host', 'Infection', 'Integration Host Factors', 'Intestinal Content', 'Intestines', 'Klebsiella pneumonia bacterium', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurable', 'Mediating', 'Medical Records', 'Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Pathway', 'Metagenomics', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacy facility', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Resistance', 'Resistance to infection', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Symptoms', 'Systems Biology', 'Testing', 'Toxic effect', 'Transplantation', 'Uncertainty', 'Vancomycin Resistance', 'Vancomycin resistant enterococcus', 'antimicrobial drug', 'clinical database', 'clinically relevant', 'colonization resistance', 'commensal bacteria', 'commensal microbes', 'computational platform', 'computer studies', 'data warehouse', 'design', 'drug resistant pathogen', 'experimental study', 'falls', 'gut microbiota', 'host microbiome', 'immune activation', 'infection risk', 'mathematical model', 'member', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'metagenome', 'metagenomic sequencing', 'microbiome', 'microbiota', 'microorganism interaction', 'mouse model', 'network models', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'parallel computer', 'pathogenic bacteria', 'patient population', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'rRNA Genes', 'resilience', 'resistance mechanism', 'text searching', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics']",NIAID,SLOAN-KETTERING INST CAN RESEARCH,U01,2019,1697054,0.06710694682823037

The collaborative opportunities, intellectual environment and resources available to Dr. Farhat are outstanding. Research: Infectious diseases continue to be a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Despite the availability of effective antimicrobials, pathogens are successfully evolving new disease phenotypes that allow them to resist killing by these drugs or in other instances cause more severe disease manifestations or wider chains of transmission. Drug resistance (DR) is now common and some bacteria have even become resistant to multiple types or classes of antibiotics6. A key strategy in the fight against emerging pathogen phenotypes in infectious diseases is surveillance, and early personalized therapy to prevent transmission and propagation of these strains. The timely initiation of antibiotic therapy to which the pathogen is sensitive has been shown to be the key factor influencing treatment outcome for a diverse array of infections. Molecular tests that rely on the detection of microbial genetic mutations are particularly promising for surveillance and diagnosis of these pathogen phenotypes but rely on a comprehensive understanding of how mutations associate with these pathogen phenotypes. Currently there is an explosion of data on pathogen whole genome sequences (WGS) that is increasingly generated from clinical laboratories. Data on disease phenotype may also be available, but methods for the analysis and interpretation of these Big Data are lagging. Here I propose tools to aid in this analysis leveraging Big Data sets from Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) and my prior work. Specifically I propose to (1) develop a web-based public interface to several analysis tools, including a statistical learning model that can predict the MTB DR phenotype from its genomic sequence, (2) to develop and study an MTB gene-gene network, based on WGS data, to improve our understanding of the effect of mutation-mutation interactions on the DR phenotype, and (3) study the performance of methods in current use for the association of genotype and phenotype in pathogens, and develop a generalizable power calculator for the best performing method. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    Infectious agents of disease are successfully evolving drug resistance and other adaptations that threaten human health. Understanding the genetic mutations that underlie these disease phenotypes can inform surveillance and diagnostic strategies to combat this threat. Here I propose to develop accessible tools for pathogen genomic analysis that will help identify which genetic mutations are relevant to disease.",New Tools for the interpretation of Pathogen Genomic Data with a focus on Mycobacterium tuberculosis,9747894,K01ES026835,"['Affect', 'Antibiotic Therapy', 'Antibiotics', 'Area', 'Award', 'Bacteria', 'Big Data', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Biometry', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Complement', 'Consult', 'Critical Care', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Science', 'Data Scientist', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Drug resistance', 'Drug resistance in tuberculosis', 'Drug-sensitive', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Explosion', 'Exposure to', 'Future', 'Gene Structure', 'General Hospitals', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Determinism', 'Genetic Epistasis', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Heritability', 'Human', 'Infection', 'Infectious Agent', 'Infectious Diseases Research', 'Institutes', 'International', 'Journals', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Laboratories', 'Leadership', 'Low income', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Massachusetts', 'Measures', 'Medical Genetics', 'Medicine', 'Mentored Research Scientist Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Microbial Genetics', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mutation', 'Mycobacterium tuberculosis', 'National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease', 'Nature', 'Network-based', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Peer Review', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Phylogeny', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Public Health', 'Public Health Schools', 'Publications', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Severity of illness', 'Social Medicine', 'Social Sciences', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Structural Genes', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Treatment outcome', 'Tuberculosis', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'Virulent', 'Work', 'Writing', 'analytical tool', 'antimicrobial', 'base', 'big biomedical data', 'burden of illness', 'career', 'combat', 'computer science', 'design', 'disease phenotype', 'experience', 'fight against', 'gene interaction', 'genome sequencing', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'global health', 'human pathogen', 'improved', 'instructor', 'medical schools', 'microbial', 'microbial genome', 'mortality', 'pathogen', 'pathogen genome', 'pathogen genomics', 'personalized medicine', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'simulation', 'skills', 'tenure track', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'whole genome']",NIEHS,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,K01,2019,215352,0.013487820994266347
"UVPD-MS Characterization of Lipopolysaccharides Abstract. Gram-negative bacteria have caused many of the most persistent infections as well as some of the deadliest pandemics in the world. Some strains have developed resistant to all available drugs, thus leading to increasing mortality from previously treatable bacterial infections. The National Strategy for Combating Antibiotic-Resistant Bacteria released by the White House in September 2014 focused on the need for (i) advancing the development of methods for identification and characterization of bacteria, (ii) accelerating basic research for new antibiotics, and (iii) improving capabilities for surveillance of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. This proposal focuses on the development of innovative tandem mass spectrometry approaches for characterization of lipopolysaccharides (LPS), the primary constituent of the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria that protects the membrane from chemical attack and is recognized by the immune system during pathogenic invasion. Structural characterization of LPS is critical to understanding how the structure of LPS influences immune stimulation as well as facilitating development of new antimicrobials and vaccines. This is a significant analytical challenge due to the branched structures and amphipathic properties of LPS. The escalating concerns about antibiotic resistance bacteria and the need for better avenues of defense against infectious diseases have motivated the proposed work. The objectives of this proposal are: Aim 1: Development of ultraviolet photodissociation (UVPD) mass spectrometry via hierarchical, decision-tree workflows for top-down characterization of LPS to facilitate high throughput analysis; Aim 2: Development of MS/MS approaches for serotyping of Gram-negative bacteria based on LPS; Aim 3: Examination of peptide/LPS interactions via native-spray mass spectrometry to provide both mechanistic information and screening capabilities for new antimicrobials, and Aim 4: Applications to a variety of structural problems related to the biosynthesis of LPS in Gram- negative bacteria and characterization of hybrid O-antigen/lipid A molecules in vesicle-based vaccines.  We have established a new collaboration with Dr. Bryan Davies' group to develop mass spectrometry methods to characterize peptide/lipid A interactions in support of the hunt for better antimicrobials. The continued collaboration with Dr. Stephen Trent's group emphasizes: (i) approaches for deciphering the biosynthetic pathways of bacterial LPS that endow them with the remarkable ability to re-design their outer membranes and develop antibiotic resistance, and (ii) innovative vaccine design based on antigenic LPS in vesicles.    Narrative: Gram-negative bacteria are responsible for some of the deadliest and more widespread pandemics in the world. The proposed work focuses on the development of advanced mass spectrometry approaches for characterization of complex lipopolysaccharides, including the endotoxic lipid A domains, that comprise the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria.

"Multi-level modeling to inform interventions for control of multidrug-resistant organisms within healthcare networks Project Summary/Abstract Multidrug-resistant organisms (MDROs), particularly carbapenem-resistant organisms (CROs), are a major cause of healthcare-associated infections (HAIs). Though studies have found multiple interventions addressing MDRO colonization and transmission to be effective at reducing HAIs, implementation has lagged due to questions regarding the most efficacious combination of interventions. As healthcare facilities (e.g., hospitals, long-term care facilities, or outpatient surgical centers and clinics) are part of an interconnected healthcare network, evaluation of an intervention’s impact on transmission and infection must consider the dynamics across the healthcare system. To address remaining knowledge gaps regarding the most effective combinations of intervention strategies, we will build a multi-level model that spans from individual patients to regionally interconnected healthcare facilities. The resulting framework will provide hospital administrators and infection control experts with tools for quantifying individual patient risk factors for colonization and infection and for comparing the potential effectiveness of interventions to control HAIs. The aims of the project are: (1) to develop models to estimate the underlying prevalence and incidence of CROs and predict which patients are at highest risk for colonization and infection with CROs using clinical samples collected during the normal course of care; (2) to utilize hospital-level models to quantify the combinatorial relationship between, and marginal impact of, additional interventions to reduce HAIs; and (3) to build a regional model of a healthcare system to examine the effectiveness of interventions across institutions. Models will start with the patient at the center, utilizing the rich covariate data stored in electronic medical records to develop prediction models based on advanced machine learning. These prediction models will be translatable tools that can be directly incorporated into clinical care to assist clinicians in preventing HAIs. In addition, they will form the foundation of hospital-level models that will allow for detailed examinations of the effectiveness of different combinations of interventions. Hospital-level models will then be embedded in a network of healthcare facilities that accounts for the differing incentives faced by geographically dispersed facilities with variable demographic populations. These models will directly inform CDC guidelines about MDRO prevention and aid clinicians in reducing the risk of HAIs. Project Narrative The models developed through this proposal will improve understanding of how biological factors associated with the transmission of multidrug-resistant organisms (MDRO) impact interventions to reduce hospital-associated infections (HAIs). This will aid predictions of patients’ risk for colonization and infection, as well as improve understanding of how interventions can most effectively be combined to reduce the likelihood that patients will suffer from these high-consequence pathogens.",Multi-level modeling to inform interventions for control of multidrug-resistant organisms within healthcare networks,9730300,U01CK000536,[' '],NCEZID,"CENTER/ DISEASE DYNAMICS, ECONOM/POLICY",U01,2019,646905,0.012948549806404147
"An expert-guided machine-learning approach to estimate the incidence, risk and harms associated with diagnostic delays for infectious diseases. Project Summary / Abstract Diagnostic errors are increasingly recognized as a cause of pain, suffering and increased healthcare costs. Diagnostic delays are an important class of diagnostic errors. While many diagnostic errors occur in hospital settings, emergency departments visits may be especially important to consider because they treat critically ill patients and because most decisions to admit patients to the hospital are made in emergency departments. Thus, to enable a more complete understanding of diagnostic delays requires consideration of healthcare visits across a range of healthcare settings including clinic visits, emergency department visits and hospitalizations. Delays in diagnosing infectious diseases are important to consider. For contagious infectious diseases, diagnostic delays increase the risk of additional exposures, potentially generating more cases. Second, many infectious diseases can be effectively treated, but even short delays in treatment lead to worse clinical outcomes. However, with the exception of a few infectious diseases (e.g., tuberculosis), diagnostic delays for infectious diseases are understudied. Thus, there is a critical need to investigate the incidence, risk factors and clinical impact for diagnostic delays for infectious diseases. The overarching goal of our research is to investigate diagnostic delays associated with infectious diseases using existing data along with methods from the fields of computer science and statistics. While our research relies upon “big data”, we will also use clinical experts to review and contribute to all of our results. Our subject matter experts incorporate expertise in infectious diseases, emergency medicine, acute care, medical education, diagnostic reasoning, healthcare epidemiology, public health, industry, and professional infectious disease societies. Specifically, we will 1) determine the incidence of diagnostic delays for a wide range of infectious diseases; 2) identify the risk factors associated with diagnostic delays for infectious diseases that are frequently delayed or have serious outcomes; and 3) estimate the impact of diagnostic delays in terms of healthcare costs and mortality. With our data, methods and clinical experts, we will be able to translate our results into future interventions designed to decrease diagnostic delays and improve healthcare outcomes. In addition, while our proposal focuses on infectious diseases, the methods and approaches that we will develop can be adopted to investigate non-infectious diseases and conditions. Project Narrative Diagnostic delays for infectious diseases contribute to worse clinical outcomes, increased healthcare costs and, for some infectious diseases, outbreaks of great public health importance. We will use existing large data sets along with machine-learning techniques and expert clinical guidance to detect patterns of healthcare visits representing diagnostic delays. Our goal is to characterize the incidence, risk factors and clinical impact of diagnostic delays for a wide range of infectious diseases to inform future interventions.","An expert-guided machine-learning approach to estimate the incidence, risk and harms associated with diagnostic delays for infectious diseases.",9938200,R01HS027375,[' '],AHRQ,UNIVERSITY OF IOWA,R01,2019,497273,0.03948019480234192
"Identification of postoperative infections using electronic health record and administrative claims data Project Summary/Abstract Surgical operations can put patients at high risk of infections and other complications. However, studies have shown that half or more of surgical infections are discovered after hospital discharge. The American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (ACS NSQIP) began in 2005 with the goal of assisting hospitals with identifying and preventing surgical complications. Each participating ACS NSQIP hospital assigns a surgical clinical nurse reviewer to collect preoperative through 30-day postoperative data on a sample of surgical patients in order to risk adjust postoperative complications so that they can be compared across participating hospitals. Although at large volume hospitals these samples might represent only 10-15% of all surgical cases, these data are considered to be the current gold standard for accurate identification and comparison of postoperative complications. Unfortunately, chart review is time-consuming and costly and, as a result, cannot be scaled up easily to cover all surgical patients. The goal of this project is to learn from the ACS NSQIP data in order to develop electronic algorithms for identifying postoperative infections that can be scaled up easily and inexpensively. Development of such algorithms will also permit evaluation of interventions that intend to impact large populations of patients at risk of postoperative infections. Considering the large number of available binary classification algorithms for data mining that are easy to implement, it is paramount to consider new methods for identifying surgical infections electronically. Furthermore, postoperative infections are rare, and occur in about 7% of operated patients; therefore, it is difficult to identify models that classify infections well. Sampling techniques are commonly used in conjunction with classification models in order to improve sensitivity and positive predictive value. We believe that modern statistical techniques for classification combined with strategic sampling, and the use of ICD9 and ICD10 codes and pharmacy data, will improve upon existing methods for electronically identifying postoperative infections. The aims of this proposal are (1a) to develop algorithms for identifying surgical infections using machine learning techniques, (1b) to develop models for specific types of postoperative infections collected in the ACS NSQIP data separately, which include SSI, urinary tract infection, pneumonia and sepsis and (2) to validate these models in prospective ACS NSQIP data. Project Narrative In this application, we propose to use outcomes data from the University of Colorado American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program combined with electronic health record and administrative claims data in order to develop models for identifying postoperative infections electronically. These infections are currently identified through manual chart review, and it is our hope that successful development of these models could replace costly, time-consuming manual chart review. We will use machine learning and sampling techniques to achieve better performance than models previously reported in the literature.",Identification of postoperative infections using electronic health record and administrative claims data,9681394,R03HS026019,[' '],AHRQ,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,R03,2019,51181,0.02493791360936649
"Developing Computational Methods for Surveillance of Antimicrobial Resistant Agents PROJECT ABSTRACT  Antimicrobial resistance is a critical public health issue. Infections with drug resistant pathogens are estimated to cause an additional eight million hospitalization days annually over the hospitalizations that would be seen for infections with susceptible agents. The use of antibiotics (in both clinical and agricultural settings) is being viewed as precursor for these infections and thus, is a major public health concern—particularly as outbreaks become more frequent and severe. However, scientiﬁc evidence describing the hazards associated with antibiotic use is lacking due to inability to quantify the risk of these practices. One promising avenue to elucidate this risk is to use shotgun metagenomics to identify the AMR genes in samples taken through systematic spatiotemporal surveillance. The goal of this proposed work is to develop algorithms that will provide such a means for analysis. The algorithms need to be scalable to very large datasets and thus, will require the development and use succinct data structures.  In order to achieve this goal, the investigative team will develop the theoretical foundations and applied meth- ods needed to study AMR through the use of shotgun metagenomics. A major focus of the proposed work is developing algorithms that can handle very large datasets. To achieve this scalability, we will create novel means to create, compress, reconstruct and update very large de Bruijn graphs that metagenomics data in a manner needed to study AMR. In addition, we will pioneer the study of AMR through long read data by proposing new algorithmic problems and solutions that use data. For example, identifying the location of speciﬁc genes in a metagenomics sample using long read data has not been proposed or studied. Thus, the algorithmic ideas and techniques developed in this project will not only advance the study of AMR, but contribute to the growing domain of big data analysis and pan-genomics.  Lastly, we plan to apply our methods to samples collected from both agricultural and clinical settings in Florida. Analysis of preliminary and new data will allow us to conclude about (1) the public risk associated with antimicro- bial use in agriculture; (2) the effectiveness of interventions used to reduce resistant bacteria, and lastly, (3) the factors that allow resistant bacteria to grow, thrive and evolve. A–1 PROJECT NARRATIVE  Antibiotic use in agriculture is a major public health concern that is receiving a lot of media attention, par- ticularly as antibiotic-resistant infections in become more frequent and severe. This research will build a novel bioinformatics framework for determining how antimicrobial resistant genes evolve, grow, and persist in a system that has been affected by antibiotic use. This will, in turn, facilitate the development of effective intervention methods that reduce resistant pathogens in clinical and agricultural settings.

"Predicting tuberculosis outcomes using genotypic and biomarker signatures PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Tuberculosis (TB) is caused by an infectious pathogen, Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb) in susceptible individuals, but we cannot yet classify or predict outcomes in those prone to pulmonary TB disease versus those prone to resistance. In part, this reflects knowledge gaps regarding genotypes that may increase susceptibility, and in validated disease correlates (e.g. serum of lung protein biomarkers) measured individually, or combined signatures. We address these knowledge gaps by using Diversity Outbred (DO) mice, a population with abundant genetic diversity and heterozygosity, like the human population. Also, like humans, a low dose M.tb infection of DO mice produces a spectrum of outcomes, from highly susceptible to highly resistant, and many intermediate outcomes. In this proposal, we use the DO population to: 1) Identify and test the capacity of genotypic (alleles and statistically significant loci) to predict outcomes such as diagnostic category (class); and 2) To identify and test lung and serum biomarker (protein) and granuloma signatures to determine diagnostic category (class); and 3) To identify and test serum biomarker (protein) signatures that can forecast disease onset, within a 3-week window before illness manifests clinically. The best performing signatures will be tested using samples from humans. Collectively, results from these studies will generate new translatable knowledge regarding correlates of pulmonary TB (useful for diagnostics), and genotypic and serum protein signatures (useful for prognostics). PROJECT NARRATIVE Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb) causes tuberculosis (TB) in millions of susceptible humans each year. It is well known that humans respond variably to M.tb infection, yet we are unable to predict outcomes with accuracy. Here, we use the Diversity Outbred (DO) mouse population to identify and test genotypic, serum, and lung biomarker signatures to accurately predict outcomes. Findings are also validated in samples from humans.",Predicting tuberculosis outcomes using genotypic and biomarker signatures,9642291,R01HL145411,"['AIDS/HIV problem', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Aerosols', 'Alleles', 'Animal Model', 'Bacillus (bacterium)', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Categories', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Dose', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genotype', 'Granuloma', 'Harvest', 'Heterozygote', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Inbred Strain', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lung', 'Malaria', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mus', 'Mycobacterium tuberculosis', 'Necrosis', 'Onset of illness', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Process', 'Production', 'Proteins', 'Pulmonary Tuberculosis', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Resistance', 'Sampling', 'Serum', 'Serum Proteins', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Tuberculosis', 'Vehicle crash', 'base', 'human pathogen', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'learning algorithm', 'model development', 'novel diagnostics', 'novel marker', 'outcome forecast', 'outcome prediction', 'pathogen', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'protein biomarkers', 'public health intervention', 'response', 'supervised learning', 'survival outcome', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'tuberculosis diagnostics']",NHLBI,TUFTS UNIVERSITY BOSTON,R01,2019,617451,-0.0028748344588757388
"Deep learning based antibody design using high-throughput affinity testing of synthetic sequences Project Summary We will develop and apply a new high-throughput methodology for rapidly designing and testing antibodies for a myriad of purposes, including cancer and infectious disease immunotherapeutics. We will improve upon current approaches for antibody design by providing time, cost, and humane benefits over immunized animal methods and greatly improving the power of present synthetic methods that use randomized designs. To accomplish this, we will display millions of computationally designed antibody sequences using recently available technology, test the displayed antibodies in a high-throughput format at low cost, and use the resulting test data to train molecular dynamics and machine learning methods to generate new sequences for testing. Based on our test data our computational method will identify sequences that have ideal properties for target binding and therapeutic efficacy. We will accomplish these goals with three specific aims. We will develop a new approach to integrated molecular dynamics and machine learning using control targets and known receptor sequences to refine our methods for receptor generalization and model updating from observed data (Aim 1). We will design an iterative framework intended to enable identification of highly effective antibodies within a minimal number of experiments, in which our methods automatically propose promising antibody sequences to profile in subsequent assays (Aim 2). We will employ rounds of automated synthetic design, affinity test, and model improvement to produce highly target-specific antibodies. (Aim 3). ! Project Narrative We will develop new computational methods that learn from millions of examples to design antibodies that can be used to help cure a wide variety of human diseases such as cancer and viral infection. Previous antibody design approaches used a trial and error approach to find antibodies that worked well. In contrast our mathematical methods will directly produce new antibody designs by learning from large-scale experiments that test antibodies for function against disease targets. !",Deep learning based antibody design using high-throughput affinity testing of synthetic sequences,9520706,R01CA218094,"['Affinity', 'Animals', 'Antibodies', 'Antibody Affinity', 'Antigens', 'Architecture', 'Binding', 'Biological Assay', 'Budgets', 'Classification', 'Cloud Computing', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Computing Methodologies', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Fc Receptor', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Immunize', 'Immunotherapeutic agent', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Machines', 'Oligonucleotides', 'Output', 'Performance', 'Phage Display', 'Property', 'Randomized', 'Research', 'Services', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Specificity', 'Statistical Models', 'Technology', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Thinness', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Update', 'Virus Diseases', 'Work', 'base', 'cloud based', 'commercialization', 'computing resources', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'design', 'experimental study', 'human disease', 'improved', 'iterative design', 'learning strategy', 'mathematical methods', 'molecular dynamics', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'outcome prediction', 'predictive test', 'receptor']",NCI,MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2018,591130,0.026470134697052745
"Genome Based Influenza Vaccine Strain Selection  using Machine Learning ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Influenza A virus causes both pandemic and seasonal outbreaks, leading to loss of from thousands to millions of human lives within a short time period. Vaccination is the best option to prevent and minimize the effects of influenza outbreaks. Rapid selection of a well-matched influenza vaccine strain is the key to developing an effective vaccination program. However, this is a non-trivial task due to three major challenges in influenza vaccine strain selection: labor an time intensive virus isolation and serology-based antigenic characterization, poor growth of selected strains in chicken embryonic eggs during production, and biased sampling in influenza surveillance. Each year, many scientists worldwide, including thousands from the United States, are working altogether to select an optimal vaccine strain. However, incorrect vaccine strains have still been frequently chosen in the past decades.  Recent advances in genomic sequencing allow us to rapidly and economically sequence influenza genomes from the isolates and from the clinical samples. Sequencing influenza genomes has become a routine and important component in influenza surveillance. The objectives of this project are to develop a sequence-based strategy for influenza antigenic variant identification and to optimize vaccine strain selection using genomic data. To achieve these aims, we will develop machine learning based computational methods to estimate antigenic distances among influenza viruses by directly using their genome sequences. We will then identify the key residues and mutations in influenza genomes affecting influenza antigenic drift events. Such information will allow us to select most promising virus strains as candidates for vaccine production. Since economical virus production requires the selected virus strains to grow easily in chicken embryonic eggs, we also propose the development of a machine learning based method that can predict the growth ability of a virus strain based on its sequence information. This integrated genome based influenza vaccine strain selection system will be developed for detecting antigenic variants for influenza A viruses.  This project will help us provide fundamental technology that employs genomic signatures determining influenza antigenicity and growth ability in chicken embryonic eggs, which are the two key issues for efficient and effective influenza vaccine strain development. The resulting genome based vaccine strain selection strategy will significantly reduce the human labor needed for serological characterization, decrease the time required to select an effective strain that will grow well in eggs, and increase the likelihood of correct influenza vaccine candidate selection. Thus, this project will lead to significant technological advances in influenza prevention and control. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:     This study is to develop and validate a genome based strategy for influenza vaccine strain selection, and it will lead to significant technological advances in influenza prevention and control.",Genome Based Influenza Vaccine Strain Selection  using Machine Learning,9406205,R01AI116744,"['Affect', 'Africa', 'Algorithms', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Area', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological Assay', 'Chickens', 'Clinical', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Effectiveness', 'Embryo', 'Epidemic', 'Event', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Head', 'Hemagglutination', 'Hemagglutinin', 'Human', 'Immunology procedure', 'Influenza', 'Influenza A virus', 'Influenza prevention', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mutagenesis', 'Mutation', 'Phenotype', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Production', 'Proteins', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Biases', 'Scientist', 'Seasons', 'Serologic tests', 'Serological', 'Ships', 'Site', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Surveillance Program', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States', 'Vaccination', 'Vaccine Production', 'Vaccines', 'Variant', 'Viral', 'Virus', 'Work', 'base', 'candidate selection', 'egg', 'experimental study', 'genome sequencing', 'genomic data', 'genomic signature', 'improved', 'influenza outbreak', 'influenza surveillance', 'influenza virus vaccine', 'influenzavirus', 'learning strategy', 'multitask', 'new technology', 'novel', 'pandemic disease', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'receptor binding', 'vaccine candidate']",NIAID,MISSISSIPPI STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,372603,0.01980651705795075
"Digital High Resolution Melt and Machine Learning for Rapid and Specific Diagnosis in Neonatal Sepsis Project Summary Blood culture sensitivity in neonates is poor but is the “Gold Standard” for the diagnosis of sepsis. Universal genotyping of pathogen genomic sequences using High Resolution Melt (U-HRM) provides a simple, low cost, rapid, and modern alternative to blood culture testing. By measuring the fluorescence of an intercalating dye as PCR-amplified pathogen DNA fragments are heated and disassociate, sequence defined melt curves are generated with single-nucleotide resolution in a closed-tube reaction. We have advanced U- HRM into a digital PCR format (U-dHRM), where DNA sequences that are present in mixtures are individually amplified and identified as is needed for polymicrobial infections. We have also established unique signature melt curves for 37 bacterial species that commonly infect older children and adults and automatically identify them using machine learning technology. With the goal of creating an accurate and valid test for the timely diagnosis of neonatal sepsis, we will advance this technology to identify unique fungal, viral, and bacterial HRM signatures along with antibiotic resistance genes with an accuracy of 99-100% on minimal blood volume (1mL). Our aims are: Aim 1. Optimize and assess the U-dHRM platform for neonatal bacteremia diagnosis by expand our bacterial database (13 additional bacteria) to detect causes of >99% of neonatal bacterial infections, expand our antibiotic resistance gene database to include five clinically actionable genes, and assessing the performance of the system for bacteremia diagnosis in mock and clinical whole blood samples; Aim 2. Advance the U-dHRM platform for simultaneous detection of fungal and viral pathogens by upgrading our optical system to enable expansion to fungal and viral detection in a high-throughput format, multiplexing the assay to expand to viral and fungal pathogens causing >99% non-bacterial infections, and conducting analytical validation of the multiplexed platform using mock whole blood samples; and Aim 3. Advance the machine learning algorithm for detection of emerging pathogens by developing and integrating an anomaly detection algorithm for reporting emerging pathogens that are not included in our database and validating the algorithm using data generated in Aims 1 and 2. Thus, this proposal directly addresses the funding call by applying a multidisciplinary approach to overcome the biomedical challenge of rapidly diagnosis sepsis, a hidden public health disaster. Project Narrative Digital High Resolution Melting (dHRM) of DNA combined with machine learning creates unique “fingerprints"" for microbes and antibiotic resistance, allowing for faster and more precise detection and treatment of pathogen(s) causing sepsis. This project will advance and test the clinical performance of dHRM technology in the diagnosis of neonatal sepsis.

"Statistical methods for real-time forecasts of infectious disease: dynamic time-series and machine learning approaches PROJECT SUMMARY The past decade of biomedical research has borne witness to rapid growth in data and computational methods. A fundamental challenge for the scientific community in the 21st century is learning how to turn this deluge of data into evidence that can inform decision-making about improving health and preventing illness at the individual and population levels. The emerging field of real-time infectious disease forecasting is a prime example of a research area with great potential for leveraging modern analytical methods to maximize the impact on public health. Infectious diseases exact an enormous toll on global health each year. Improved real- time forecasts of infectious disease outbreaks can inform targeted intervention and prevention strategies, such as increased healthcare staffing or vector control measures. However we currently have a limited understanding of the best ways to integrate these types of forecasts into real-time public health decision- making. The central research activities of this project are (1) to develop and validate a suite of robust, real-time statistical prediction models for infectious diseases, (2) we will develop and evaluate an ensemble time-series prediction methodology for integrating multiple prediction models into a single forecast, and (3) to develop a collaborative platform for dissemination and evaluation of predictions by different research teams. Additionally, we will develop a suite of open-source educational modules to train researchers and public health officials in developing, validating, and implementing time-series forecasting, with a focus on real-time infectious disease applications.

"Reproducible Analytics for Secondary Analyses of ImmPort Vaccination-Related Cytometry Data Project Summary The immunology database and analysis portal (ImmPort, http://immport.niaid.nih.gov) is the NIAID-funded public resource for data archive and dissemination from clinical trials and mechanistic research projects. Among the current 291 studies archived in ImmPort, 114 are focused on vaccine responses (91 for influenza vaccine responses), which is the largest category when organized by research focus. As the most effective method of preventing infectious diseases, development of the next-generation vaccines is faced with the bottleneck that traditional empirical design becomes ineffective to stimulate human protective immunity against HIV, RSV, CMV, and other recent major public health threats. This project will focus on three important aspects of informatics approaches to secondary analysis of ImmPort data for influenza vaccination research: a) expanding the data analytical capabilities of ImmPort and ImmPortGalaxy through adding innovative computational methods for user-friendly unsupervised identification of cell populations, b) processing and analyzing a subset of the existing human influenza vaccination study data in ImmPort to identify cell-based biomarkers using the new computational methods, and c) returning data analysis results with data analytical provenance to ImmPort for dissemination of derived data, software tools, as well as semantic assertions of the identified biomarkers. Each aspect is one specific research aim in the proposed work. The project outcome will not only demonstrate the utility of the ImmPort data archive but also generate a foundation for the Human Vaccine Project (HVP) to establish pilot programs for influenza vaccine research, which currently include Vanderbilt University Medical Center; University of California San Diego (UCSD); Scripps Research Institute; La Jolla Institute of Allergy and Immunology; and J. Craig Venter Institute (JCVI). Once such computational analytical workflow is established, it can be applied to the secondary analysis of other ImmPort studies as well as to support the user-driven analytics of their own cytometry data. Each of the specific aims contains innovative methods or new applications of the existing methods. The computational method for population identification in Aim 1 is a newly developed constrained data clustering method, which combines advantages of unsupervised and supervised learning. Cutting-edge machine learning approaches including random forest will be used in Aim 2 for the identification of biomarkers across study cohorts, in addition to the traditional statistical hypothesis testing. Standardized knowledge representation to be developed in Aim 3 for cell-based biomarkers is also innovative, as semantic networks with inferring and deriving capabilities can be built based on the machine-readable knowledge assertions. The proposed work, when accomplished, will foster broader collaboration between ImmPort and the existing vaccine research consortia. It will also accelerate the deployment of up-to-date informatics software tools on ImmPortGalaxy. Project Narrative Flow cytometry (FCM) plays important roles in human influenza vaccination studies through interrogating immune cellular functions and quantifying the immune responses in different conditions. This project will extend the current data analytical capabilities of the Immunology Database and Analysis Portal (ImmPort) through adding novel data analytical methods and software tools for user-friendly identification of cell populations from FCM data in ImmPort influenza vaccine response studies.

"Interactions between Gut Microbiome Natural Products and Intestinal Helminths Project Summary / Abstract This project will identify the molecular mechanisms through which the gut microbiome interacts with infectious intestinal helminths. Intestinal helminthic parasites present one of the most pressing global health problems due to the abundance of infection, a limited understanding of etiology, and increasing drug resistance. Prior work has established that the gut microbiome can influence infection, but the specific mechanisms through which it does so are unknown. We hypothesize that the gut microbiome produces anti-helminthic metabolites that can prevent and control infection. We propose a series of experiments that integrate multi'omics data and machine learning techniques to discover natural products of the gut microbiome that predict infectious burden or associate with infection control. Our studies leverage a high-throughput zebrafish model of infection to precisely resolve these factors. Additionally, we will develop bioinformatic methods that (1) connect natural products to the genetic pathways and microbiota that produce them, and (2) impute the presence of these natural products in the human gut. Consequently, this project will produce novel anti-helminthic drug leads that can be efficiently isolated and tested, and will clarify the role of gut microbiome natural products in the etiology of infection. Project Narrative Intestinal helminthic infections are a pressing global health problem due to the number of infected individuals, a limited understanding of disease mechanisms, and an increase in resistance to anti-helminthic drugs. This project will discover gut microbiota, their genes, and their metabolites that are linked to the prevention and control of parasitic infection. The long-term goals of this project are to determine if the gut microbiome is a factor in the etiology of helminthic intestinal infection, and to identify microbiome-sourced candidates for the discovery of novel anti-helminthic drugs. !",Interactions between Gut Microbiome Natural Products and Intestinal Helminths,9436228,R21AI135641,"['Animals', 'Anthelmintics', 'Bioinformatics', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Drug resistance', 'Etiology', 'Exposure to', 'Fishes', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Growth and Development function', 'Helminths', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Infection Control', 'Inflammation', 'Informatics', 'Intestinal parasite', 'Intestines', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mammals', 'Measurement', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Microscopic', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Natural Products', 'Outcome', 'Parasites', 'Parasitic infection', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Probiotics', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Resistance', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sample Size', 'Series', 'Source', 'Taxonomy', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Work', 'Zebrafish', 'base', 'expectation', 'experimental study', 'global health', 'gut microbes', 'gut microbiome', 'gut microbiota', 'helminth infection', 'inquiry-based learning', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'metabolome', 'metagenome', 'microbial', 'microbiome', 'microbiota', 'multiple omics', 'neglected tropical diseases', 'novel', 'prevent']",NIAID,OREGON STATE UNIVERSITY,R21,2018,220500,0.013523993951046705
"Point-of-care antimicrobial susceptibility testing based on simultaneous tracking of multi-phenotypic features of single bacterial cells ABSTRACT Antibiotic resistance has become a significant public health threat. To combat the problem, a rapid pathogen identification (ID) and antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) technology is needed to provide timely diagno- sis of resistant infections and delivery of accurate antibiotic treatment at primary health-care settings, includ- ing hospitals and point-of-care (POC). The present project aims to develop a point-of-care AST (POCASTTM) technology based on a large-image-volume microscopy technique that enables direct detection of individual bacterial cells in clinical samples without culturing or pathogen isolation, and a machine-learning model that allows fast determination of pathogen and susceptibility. To establish the technology, the project will focus on urinary tract infections (UTIs). UTIs affect millions of people annually, and the pathogens that usually cause UTIs are the organisms that pose the highest threat of antimicrobial resistance, including carbapenem- resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) and extended spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Enterobacteri- aceae. This project will focus on: 1) developing the large-image-volume microscopy and machine learning model for simultaneous tracking of multi-phenotypic features of single bacterial cells directly in patient urine sample, and performing rapid automatic pathogen ID and AST for UTIs; 2) building prototype instrument, and 3) validating the instrument for UTIs using large scale clinical samples. Successful development and validation of the tech- nology will enable precise antibiotic prescription on the same day of patient visit. The project will be carried out by a multidisciplinary team with expertise in biosensors (Biodesign Center for Bioelectronics and Biosensors, ASU), microbiology and infectious diseases (Biodesign Center for Immuno- therapy, Vaccines and Virotherapy, ASU), biomedical instrument development and production (Biosensing Instrument Inc.), and clinical testing (Clinical Microbiology Laboratory, Mayo Clinic). ! PROJECT NARRATIVE This project will develop a culture-independent technology for point-of-care diagnosis of antimicrobial-resistant bacteria in urinary tract infections within 3 hours, by imaging urine samples directly with an innovative large- image-volume imaging technique and analyzing the data with a machine-learning model.

"Estimating Cholera Burden with Cross-sectional Immunologic Data Project Summary/Abstract Cholera is an acute dehydrating diarrheal disease caused by infection with Vibrio cholerae. It is endemic in over 50 countries, affecting up to 3 million people and causing more than 100,000 deaths annually. A renewed global effort to fight cholera is underway, catalyzed by the large on-going epidemic in Haiti and now aided by new generation oral cholera vaccines. Identifying key populations at high risk of cholera is essential to guide these activities. Current methods to estimate cholera burden are largely based on clinical reporting with infrequent microbiological confirmation. These methods are limited by the sporadic nature of outbreaks, poor surveillance infrastructure, and fundamental uncertainties in the number of asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic cases. Improved methods of detecting cholera exposure and risk are urgently needed. Detection of immune responses in serum (serosurveillance) can provide a new avenue for rapid and accurate estimates of cholera exposure and risk. We currently do not understand what immunological and clinical parameters are most predictive of recent exposure, nor whether immune responses in areas with different levels of endemicity are similar. In preliminary studies, we have used machine learning methods on antibody response data from cholera patients in Bangladesh to classify whether individuals had been exposed in the previous 30-, 90-, or 360-days with high sensitivity and specificity. In this application, we propose to use longitudinal antibody response kinetics, from populations with diverse genetic and epidemiologic profiles, paired with novel statistical and machine learning approaches to provide generalizable tools to estimate the incidence of exposure to Vibrio cholerae from cross sectional serosurveys. In Aim 1, we will develop models to estimate the time since exposure to Vibrio cholerae and exposure incidence from cross-sectional antibody profiles and demographic data using previously collected data from a cohort in Bangladesh. These results will allow us to identify the antibodies and demographic factors that are most useful for prediction of time-since-exposure. In Aim 2, we will collect longitudinal antibody data from a cohort of cholera cases and household contacts in Haiti to develop models for estimating exposure incidence from cross-sectional serosurveillance. This cohort will also enable us to compare the models developed for moderate/severe cases and mild/asymptomatic cases. In Aim 3, we will optimize and validate field-adapted methods to measure cholera-specific antibodies, including the use of dried blood spot and lateral flow assays. We will conduct a proof-of-concept cross-sectional serosurvey using these methods in rural Haiti. Upon the completion of these aims, we will have provided a number of new tools for measure of susceptibility to cholera in a population. These tools will have the potential to transform cholera control efforts from the current reactive strategies to proactive ones, with the potential to contribute to disease elimination. Project Narrative Cholera is a diarrheal disease affecting millions of people worldwide each year, with the majority of deaths due to cholera occurring in places with poor disease surveillance infrastructure.

"Vaccine Beliefs and Decision Making Project Summary This project will use methods from quantitative anthropology to describe the social space of vaccine beliefs that circulate among the general public and to provide an initial assessment of how different belief variations influence decisions to vaccinate. The results will establish, for the first time, the patterns of co-variation in the wide variety of pro- and anti- vaccine beliefs, and which axes of this variation appear associated with decisions to vaccinate. Vaccination is a key public health defense against infectious disease, but the lay public largely does not fully appreciate scientific evidence when making decisions for or against vaccination. Understanding the inter-correlations of these beliefs, therefore, is imperative for designing effective educational interventions that can directly interface with the cultural beliefs that surround vaccination and influence the public's decision making on this issue. The project will leverage insights from two very different but complementary data sources: responses to a nationally representative survey (fielded on the RAND American Life Panel) and social media data from Twitter. Our analytic approach will begin with systematic coding techniques from mixed-methods research to classify vaccine beliefs into a comprehensive set of belief variants. Manual coding will be validated through inter-observer reliability checks and replicated at scale with machine-learning algorithms. Having systematically coded the data, we will then assess whether nationally representative survey data and data mined from Twitter produce similar results using Cultural Consensus Analysis, a technique from quantitative cultural anthropology. From the survey data we will test whether vaccine beliefs are correlated with decisions to vaccinate after controlling for demographic attributes. To ensure completion of this innovative and methodologically expansive project, the project team combines expertise from anthropology, decision science, clinical medicine, and biomathematics. The principal investigator brings to this project multiple years of both academic and industry experience in statistical modelling of cultural data. Project Narrative Vaccination is a key public health defense against infectious disease, but patients' vaccination decisions may be more influenced by broadly circulated cultural beliefs than they are influenced by scientific evidence. This proposed research will systematically map the diversity of the publics' vaccination beliefs, assess how these beliefs influence vaccination decisions, and advise policy makers how to interface more directly with these popular belief systems that are critical to effective vaccination efforts.",Vaccine Beliefs and Decision Making,9557573,R21HD087749,"['Achievement', 'Adolescent', 'Adopted', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Anthropology', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Behavior', 'Belief', 'Belief System', 'Childhood', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Code', 'Cognitive', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Consensus', 'Cultural Anthropology', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Decision Making', 'Disease', 'Educational Intervention', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Fright', 'General Population', 'Health Communication', 'Health behavior', 'Immunization', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Measles', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Parents', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Policies', 'Policy Maker', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Principal Investigator', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Resistance', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Survey Methodology', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States', 'Vaccinated', 'Vaccination', 'Vaccines', 'Variant', 'Work', 'authority', 'biomathematics', 'cognitive process', 'design', 'efficacy testing', 'experience', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'prevent', 'response', 'social', 'social media', 'social space', 'theories', 'therapy design', 'vaccine safety']",NICHD,RAND CORPORATION,R21,2018,242266,-0.02775409966800947
"FAST platform for same-shift, complete antibiotic menu antibiotic susceptibility testing The goal of this Phase I SBIR proposal is to demonstrate utility to all major pathogenic bacterial strains of SeLux’s rapid, low-cost, phenotypic antibiotic susceptibility test (AST) system (fast-AST or FAST). Utilizing existing optical detectors and standard dried antibiotic microplates, and avoiding pitfalls of metabolic probes, FAST will potentially transform therapy of infections by significantly accelerating AST, thereby facilitating treatment with the optimal antibiotic. Aim 1 will apply FAST to hundreds of samples of pathogenic bacterial strains, while developing and optimizing a predictive algorithm for clinical utility. Aim 2 will extend the FAST platform to slow-growing strains and species as well. SeLux has demonstrated FAST to exceed FDA 510(k) requirements for minimum inhibitory concentration determinations for 25+ strains of Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli with full antibiotic panels. Completion of the proposed aims will expand FAST to all major clinically-relevant, non-fastidious bacterial pathogens. SeLux’s interdisciplinary team has expertise in nanosensing, microbiology, and algorithm design and is buttressed by distinguished experts in Clinical Microbiology, Infectious Disease, and Machine Learning. The new paradigm in clinical medicine is value-based healthcare, which requires rapid and accurate diagnoses leading to optimal patient treatment. Nowhere is this more important than in treating infections, where doctors are currently forced to overprescribe broad-spectrum antibiotics during an agonizing 48+ hour wait for antibiotic susceptibility test (AST) results. The novel, rapid, low-cost AST platform described in this proposal promises to reduce this delay in treatment by as much as 30 hours. This advance would be transformative for the treatment of infections because current over-use of broad-spectrum antibiotics not only harms individual patients but is a primary contributor to the growing epidemic of antibiotic resistance.","FAST platform for same-shift, complete antibiotic menu antibiotic susceptibility testing",9464993,R43AI136125,"['Agreement', 'Algorithm Design', 'Algorithms', 'Amplifiers', 'Antibiotic Resistance', 'Antibiotic Therapy', 'Antibiotic susceptibility', 'Antibiotics', 'Bacterial Antibiotic Resistance', 'Biological Assay', 'Blinded', 'Blood', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Chemicals', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Clinical Microbiology', 'Combating Antibiotic Resistant Bacteria', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnostic', 'End Point Assay', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Epidemic', 'Escherichia coli', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Healthcare', 'Hour', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Infection', 'Institutes', 'Invaded', 'Laboratories', 'Length of Stay', 'Machine Learning', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Microbiology', 'Minimum Inhibitory Concentration measurement', 'Optics', 'Pathogenicity', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Plague', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Privatization', 'Quality of Care', 'Reagent', 'Recovery', 'Regulatory Affairs', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Studies', 'Scientist', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Speed', 'Staphylococcus aureus', 'System', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Vancomycin', 'Work', 'accurate diagnosis', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'combat', 'commercialization', 'cost', 'cost effectiveness', 'design', 'detector', 'individual patient', 'instrument', 'nanosensors', 'novel', 'optimal treatments', 'pathogen', 'performance tests', 'prediction algorithm', 'prototype', 'rapid diagnosis']",NIAID,"SELUX DIAGNOSTICS, INC.",R43,2018,298851,0.059219905754864716
"Enhanced Detection System for Healthcare-Associated Transmission of Infection ABSTRACT Despite recent progress in reducing the incidence of healthcare-associated infections (HAIs), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimated that 722,000 HAIs occurred in U.S. acute care hospitals in 2011, resulting in 75,000 deaths. Current methods for detecting outbreaks in hospitals are rudimentary and likely to miss some outbreaks altogether and result in substantial delays in detection of others. There are two major developments in healthcare that have the potential to revolutionize how healthcare associated outbreaks of bacterial pathogens are identified and controlled in hospitals. First, the Affordable Care Act mandates use of the electronic medical record (EMR), which has led to its widespread use in healthcare. Second, the costs of bacterial whole genome sequencing (WGS) have declined substantially, which is making its use by infection programs increasingly feasible. In this application, we propose to establish and evaluate the impact of the Enhanced Detection System for Healthcare Association Transmission (EDS-HAT) at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC). EDS-HAT uses a combination of WGS and analysis of the EMR for enhanced outbreak detection. Our specific aims are to 1a): Determine the utility of EDS-HAT to identify HAT that is not identified through routine infection prevention practice, 1b): Improve the efficiency and reduce the cost of EDS-HAT by using the EMR to restrict the use of WGS, 2a): Measure reductions in HAIs following implementation of EDS-HAT, and 2b): Estimate the number of infections and deaths prevented and healthcare costs averted by EDS-HAT. For Aim 1a, EDS-HAT will be performed retrospectively while routine infection prevention practice (requests for molecular typing when an outbreak is suspected) continues, thus allowing a direct comparison of the two approaches. For Aim 1b, we will improve the efficiency and reduce the cost of EDS-HAT by using machine learning and data mining of the EMR to select isolates for WGS. For Aim 2a, we will monitor changes in HAI rates both before and after implementation of EDS-HAT in real time, which will occur at the beginning of year 3. Finally, for Aim 2b, we will perform clinical and budget impact analyses to determine the overall impact of EDS-HAT. To accomplish these aims, we have assembled a team with expertise in infectious diseases, outbreak investigation, infection prevention, microbial genomics and genomic epidemiology, machine learning and data mining, economic analysis and modeling, epidemiology, and biostatistics. EDS-HAT will likely lead to substantial reductions in infections, deaths, and healthcare costs and can serve as a model for how HAT is detected in hospitals. PROJECT NARRATIVE Outbreak detection in most hospitals uses outdated methods. The declining costs of whole genome sequencing (WGS) of bacterial pathogens and the wide-spread use of the electronic medical record (EMR) provide a unique opportunity to enhance outbreak detection in hospitals and therefore reduce the number of infections. Accordingly, we propose to establish the Enhanced Detection System for Healthcare Association Transmission (EDS-HAT), which uses routine WGS of bacterial pathogens and machine learning and data mining of the EMR to dramatically increase capacity to detect healthcare-associated outbreaks.",Enhanced Detection System for Healthcare-Associated Transmission of Infection,9535858,R01AI127472,"['Acinetobacter baumannii', 'Acute', 'Affordable Care Act', 'Bacterial Infections', 'Biometry', 'Budgets', 'Caring', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Cessation of life', 'Charge', 'Clinical', 'Clostridium difficile', 'Code', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Cost Savings', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Economics', 'Enterobacter aerogenes bacterium', 'Enterobacter cloacae', 'Enterococcus faecalis', 'Enterococcus faecium', 'Epidemiology', 'Escherichia coli', 'Event', 'Exposure to', 'Extended-spectrum β-lactamase', 'Genomics', 'Geographic Locations', 'Health Care Costs', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hospitals', 'Incidence', 'Infection', 'Infection prevention', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Investigation', 'Klebsiella pneumonia bacterium', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Microbiology', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Nosocomial Infections', 'Patients', 'Period Analysis', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Presbyterian Church', 'Prevention', 'Prevention program', 'Procedures', 'Pseudomonas aeruginosa', 'Records', 'Research', 'Source', 'Time', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Vancomycin resistant enterococcus', 'bacterial genome sequencing', 'base', 'cost', 'data mining', 'enteric pathogen', 'foodborne outbreak', 'genome analysis', 'genome sequencing', 'genomic epidemiology', 'health care settings', 'healthcare-associated infections', 'improved', 'innovation', 'meetings', 'methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus', 'microbial', 'pathogen', 'prevent', 'programs', 'prospective', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'virtual', 'whole genome']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2018,728162,0.047270506818474146
"Predictive Models for Small-Molecule Accumulation in Gram-Negative Bacteria PROJECT SUMMARY Predictive Models for Small-Molecule Accumulation in Gram-Negative Bacteria. Antibiotic-resistant Gram-negative bacterial infections are increasing in incidence and novel antibiotics are urgently needed to combat this growing threat to public health. A major roadblock to the development of novel antibiotics is our poor understanding of the structural features of small molecules that correlate with bacterial penetration and efflux. As a result, while potent biochemical inhibitors can often be identified for new targets, developing them into compounds with whole-cell antibacterial activity has proven challenging. To address this critical problem, we propose herein a comprehensive, multidisciplinary approach to develop quantitative models to predict small-molecule penetration and efflux in Gram-negative bacteria. We have pioneered a general platform for systematic, quantitative evaluation of small-molecule accumulation in bacteria, using label-free LC-MS/MS detection and multivariate cheminformatic analysis. We have also developed unique isogenic strain sets of wild-type, hyperporinated, efflux-knockout, and doubly-compromised E. coli, P. aeruginosa, and A. baumannii that allow us to dissect the individual contributions of outer/inner membrane penetration and active efflux to net accumulation, using a kinetic model that accurately recapitulates available experimental data. Moreover, we have developed machine learning and neural network approaches to QSAR (quantitative structure–activity relationship) modeling of pharmacological properties that will now be used to develop predictive cheminformatic models for Gram-negative accumulation, penetration, and efflux. This project will be carried out by a multidisciplinary SPEAR-GN Project Team (Small-molecule Penetration & Efflux in Antibiotic-Resistant Gram-Negatives, “speargun”) involving the labs of Derek Tan (MSK, PI), Helen Zgurskaya (OU, PI), Bradley Sherborne (Merck, Lead Collaborator), Valentin Rybenkov (OU, Co-I), Adam Duerfeldt (OU, Co-I), Carl Balibar (Merck, Collaborator), and David McLaren (Merck, Collaborator), comprising extensive combined expertise in organic and diversity-oriented synthesis, biochemistry, microbiology, high- throughput screening, mass spectrometry, biophysical modeling, cheminformatics, and medicinal chemistry. Herein, we will design and synthesize chemical libraries with diverse structural and physicochemical properties; analyze their accumulation in the isogenic strain sets in both high-throughput and high-density assay formats; extract kinetic parameters for penetration and efflux from the resulting experimental datasets; develop and validate robust QSAR models for accumulation, penetration, and efflux; and demonstrate the utility of these models in medicinal chemistry campaigns to develop novel Gram-negative antibiotics against three targets. This project will provide a major advance in the field of antibacterial drug discovery, providing powerful enabling tools to the scientific community to address this major threat to public health. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Predictive Models for Small-Molecule Accumulation in Gram-Negative Bacteria. Antibiotic-resistant Gram-negative bacteria pose a growing threat to public health in the U.S. and globally. A major obstacle to the development of new antibiotics to combat such infections is our poor understanding of the chemical requirements for small molecules to enter Gram-negative cells and to avoid ejection by efflux pumps. The proposed comprehensive, multidisciplinary research program aims to develop predictive computational tools to identify such molecules by carrying out large-scale, quantitative analyses of the accumulation of diverse small molecules in Gram-negative bacteria. These tools will then enable medicinal chemistry campaigns to develop novel antibiotics.",Predictive Models for Small-Molecule Accumulation in Gram-Negative Bacteria,9486312,R01AI136795,"['Acinetobacter baumannii', 'Address', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents', 'Antibiotic Resistance', 'Antibiotics', 'Architecture', 'Bacteria', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemistry', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Availability', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Effectiveness', 'Escherichia coli', 'Gram-Negative Bacteria', 'Gram-Negative Bacterial Infections', 'Human', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Kinetics', 'Knock-out', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Mammalian Cell', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Membrane', 'Microbiology', 'Modeling', 'Oral', 'Partner in relationship', 'Penetration', 'Pharmaceutical Chemistry', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Property', 'Pseudomonas aeruginosa', 'Public Health', 'Quantitative Evaluations', 'Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Role', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Variant', 'analog', 'base', 'biophysical model', 'cell envelope', 'cheminformatics', 'combat', 'computerized tools', 'density', 'design', 'drug discovery', 'efflux pump', 'high throughput screening', 'improved', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'lead optimization', 'learning network', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'screening', 'small molecule', 'small molecule libraries', 'success', 'tool']",NIAID,SLOAN-KETTERING INST CAN RESEARCH,R01,2018,1527746,0.00361189279585225
"Optimization of efflux avoidance and inhibition for antibiotic development Project Summary Failures of antibiotic therapy occur with increasing frequency in clinics due to the spread of multidrug resistant bacterial pathogens. The major challenge are infections caused by Gram-negative bacteria that are protected from antibiotics by the concerted action of multidrug efflux pumps and the low permeability barrier of outer membranes. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, an opportunistic human pathogen responsible for a variety of infectious diseases, is notorious for its antibiotic impermeability. A handful of clinical antibiotics used against this pathogen are beginning to fail due to the emergence of multidrug resistant strains. New antibiotics are needed to address this growing threat. Decades of antibiotic discovery and optimization perfected empirical approaches for improvement of antibiotic action and avoidance of class-specific resistance mechanisms. The current critical challenge is to develop approaches that will enable antibiotic penetration across non-specific permeability barriers of Gram-negative bacteria, which present an urgent and serious threat to public health. This project responds to this challenge and proposes the development of a new technology for optimization of efflux avoidance and inhibition in clinical and investigational antibacterial agents that will be effective against Gram-negative bacteria. The proposed approach targets simultaneously the multidrug efflux mechanism of P. aeruginosa and its outer membrane barrier and combines cutting edge technologies in experimental analyses of efflux inhibition and drug penetration, kinetic modeling of drug accumulation, computer simulations of drug efflux and transmembrane diffusion, synthetic chemistry and machine learning analyses. The central objective of the proposal is to create a mechanism-based predictive model that integrates physicochemical properties of compounds, kinetics of their intracellular accumulation and transmembrane diffusion, and a molecular level description of the interaction of efflux transporters with their substrates and inhibitors. The model will be validated by focused medicinal chemistry efforts to generate antibacterial agents that combine the traits of effective antibiotics and potent efflux pump inhibitors or avoiders. This multi-disciplinary approach is enabled by the collaborative efforts of PIs on the project: Helen Zgurskaya (biochemistry of drug uptake and efflux), Valentin Rybenkov (kinetic modeling), Paolo Ruggerone (computational biophysics of efflux), Gnanakaran (computational simulations of membrane permeation) and John Walker (medicinal chemistry). Narrative This project addresses a current critical challenge in the discovery and development of antibiotics effective against multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa.

"Alicanto:  Proteogenomic discovery of single chain antibodies in llama Antibodies are a key component of the adaptive immune system, released in response to disease in order to target foreign molecular surfaces. Due to their capacity for high target affinity and specificity, they’ve become one of the fastest growing classes of therapeutic molecules addressing a range of disease including infectious diseases, auto-immune diseases, and cancer. Camelids, including llamas, camels, and alpacas, produce a unique repertoire of antibodies that includes both dual chain antibodies and single chain antibodies. Single chain antibodies, due to their comparative structural simplicity, are simpler to express and develop at the scale required for therapeutics. In addition, single chain antibodies are able to bind to small epitopes, such as enzyme active sites, that would be hidden to larger, dual chain antibodies. The binding domain of the single chain antibody may be small enough to infiltrate traditionally difficult to access tissues, including crossing the blood-brain barrier.  Current approaches to single chain antibody discovery require the collection of cells that encode the antibody genes, including memory B cells and plasma cells. Target-specific antibodies are selected after the antibody transcripts are cloned into a display system, such as phage or yeast. While memory B cells and plasma cells represent only a minute fraction of the cells located in peripheral blood, target- specific antibodies are present in high concentration in blood after an infection. Each plasma cell can secrete thousands of antibodies per minute. Digital Proteomics is developing Alicanto, a technology that utilizes the antibodies circulating in blood to identify target-specific antibodies.  Alicanto integrates two sources of information about the antibody repertoire. First, Alicanto constructs a database of potential antigen-specific antibodies by performing next-generation sequencing of antibody transcripts. Next, Alicanto enriches for target-specific antibodies from the blood using affinity chromatography and subjects the antibodies to tandem mass spectrometry. Finally, Alicanto uses machine learning models to integrate the sequencing and mass spectrometry data to derive a collection of target-specific antibody candidates. For single chain antibody discovery, Alicanto will use specialized primers and enrichment techniques to isolate only the subset of the antibody repertoire that contains the single chain antibodies. Alicanto will be used to discover high affinity, single chain antibodies for development as therapeutic molecules. Antibodies are produced natively in humans to fight disease and the molecules have garnered significant attention due to their therapeutic potential. Single-chain antibodies, which are smaller than conventional antibodies, represent a new frontier for antibody-based therapeutics due to their ability to target molecular surfaces that would be hidden to larger antibodies, as well as the relative simplicity of their development.

"Predictive Personalized Public Health (P3H): A Novel Paradigm to Treat Infectious Disease Challenge, Innovation and Impact: In recent years, we have demonstrated that it is feasible to predict epidemic disease outbreaks from retrospective seasonal and geographical case data and to show that we can take climate factors into account in our predictive models. We are moving closer to real-time prediction at the population level. But we have never used prediction at point-of-care for treating the individual patient.  Presently, personalized medicine uses delayed results of laboratory testing of individuals. For infectious disease, most of such testing has targeted the pathogen in the host-pathogen interaction. The role of laboratory testing is to modify therapy after a variable period of time delay. Personalized medicine today is reactive. Complicating matters further, many infectious epidemic diseases are strongly dependent on environmental factors and climate. Lastly, we want to name the pathogens we are fighting, but we really need to know the resistance characteristics to select therapy for patients effectively. Both speciation and resistance can now be determined from molecular data, which can be integrated into point-of-care treatment predictions.  We here propose a radically different approach to the treatment of infectious diseases. Our hypothesis is that the alternative to time-delayed and expensive laboratory analysis of specimens from individual patients, is to use predictive modeling to forecast point-of-care treatment. Time-delayed personalized testing can be conducted as surveillance, and that data used for real-time prediction to guide point-of-care treatment.  We will introduce predictive personalized public health (P3H) policy at the individual patient level, with the potential to substantially improve patient outcomes compared with our present reactive approaches. Our key rationale is to expand population infectious disease predictive modeling in order to achieve prediction for treatment at point-of-care. Our primary insight is that we can reposition the delayed reactive personalized testing from the urgent medical decision-making process, and into a predictive modeling framework. The gaps and opportunities in technology that we will address are four-fold. First, we will employ individual case geospatial mapping at a fine scale to take into account infection spread and environmental factors. Second, our ability to perform pan-microbial analysis using molecular techniques is now feasible. Third, modeling our novel fusion of data has no simple low-dimensional solution – but machine learning technologies are now capable of handling such big data assimilation, model discovery and prediction. Fourth, our proposal is not an academic exercise. We have a partnership with the economic planners within a developing country to design and implement our new methods. We will prospectively tune and validate our algorithms in real-time. Our deliverable will be an open-source framework ready for clinical trials testing and adaptation to the public health infrastructure in any country. Project Narrative We have made substantial progress in our abilities to track and predict infectious disease epidemics at the population level, but prediction has never been used at the individual level to guide treatment at point-of-care. The individual treatment for all infectious disease syndromes at point-of-care is presently empirical, because laboratory testing is reactive and time delayed. We here propose a novel framework to use rigorous prediction strategies to guide point-of-care treatment for infectious diseases, and to validate this approach under real-world conditions.",Predictive Personalized Public Health (P3H): A Novel Paradigm to Treat Infectious Disease,9566413,R01AI145057,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Antigens', 'Assimilations', 'Bacterial Meningitis', 'Bacteriology', 'Big Data', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Cholera', 'Climate', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Complex', 'Country', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Developed Countries', 'Developing Countries', 'Diagnostic', 'Diarrhea', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Economics', 'Engineering', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemic', 'Equilibrium', 'Exanthema', 'Exercise', 'Fever', 'Frequencies', 'Genus staphylococcus', 'Geography', 'HIV', 'Hand', 'Health Policy', 'Hospitals', 'Hybrids', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Infection', 'Investments', 'Laboratories', 'Leadership', 'Leptospirosis', 'Machine Learning', 'Malaria', 'Measles', 'Medical', 'Medical emergency', 'Melioidosis', 'Meningitis', 'Methods', 'Microbiology', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Names', 'Newborn Infant', 'Paralysed', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Preventive', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Reaction', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Resistance', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Sepsis', 'Specimen', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Uganda', 'Work', 'acute infection', 'antimicrobial', 'authority', 'climate data', 'cost', 'cost outcomes', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'fighting', 'flu', 'global health', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'infectious disease model', 'infectious disease treatment', 'innovation', 'insight', 'microbial', 'mortality', 'novel', 'open source', 'pathogen', 'personalized medicine', 'personalized predictions', 'point of care', 'predictive modeling', 'prospective', 'resistance gene', 'spreading factor', 'surveillance data']",NIAID,PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIV HERSHEY MED CTR,R01,2018,1527723,0.03837620758696576
"New Serological Measures of Infectious Disease Transmission Intensity ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Candidate: Benjamin Arnold    I am an epidemiologist at the University of California, Berkeley. I completed my MA in Biostatistics and a PhD in Epidemiology from UC Berkeley in 2009. Since then, I have worked as an epidemiologist in Professor Jack Colford's group. The opportunity to work as the coordinating epidemiologist for a touchstone, multi-country cluster randomized trial - combined with the addition of two children to my family - led me to delay my academic career. I am now ready to restart my career progress toward independent investigator status.     My long-term career goal is to become a leader in the application of novel statistical methods to target and evaluate interventions that reduce the burden of enteric infections and neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) in low-income countries. This research focus and career objective build from my experience and from a growing collaboration with Dr. Patrick Lammie at the US Centers for Disease Control (CDC) that started in 2013 and has introduced me to seroepidemiologic research. My background in epidemiologic methods, biostatistics, and international field research makes me uniquely qualified to make significant contributions to infectious disease epidemiology at the interface between recent advances in statistical methodology and serological assays.    Environment: University of California, Berkeley    To achieve my career goal, I have developed a training and mentoring plan that focuses on recent advances in statistics (semi-parametric estimation theory and machine learning) and on infectious disease immunology. These are two areas where additional training will open up significant and unique opportunities for me to make meaningful contributions to seroepidemiologic research, and will enable me to launch an independent career as a productive faculty member at UC Berkeley.    I have assembled a multidisciplinary mentoring team of senior investigators in biostatistics and immunology to support my training, research, and career objectives. Mark van der Laan (primary mentor, biostatistics) will guide my training in semi-parametric methods and machine learning. Alan Hubbard (co-mentor, biostatistics) will guide my translation of the methodology to applications for enteric pathogens and NTDs. Patrick Lammie (co-mentor at CDC, immunology) will guide my immunology training and research with his expertise in the immunology of enteric pathogens and NTDs    Research: New Serological Measures of Infectious Disease Transmission    Background: Recent advances in multiplex antigen assays have led to the development of low-cost and sensitive methods to measure enteric pathogens and neglected tropical diseases (NTDs). There have not been commensurate advances in the statistical methods used to derive measures of transmission intensity from antibody response. Translating antibody response into metrics of transmission intensity is a key step from a public health perspective because it enables us to target intervention programs to the populations most in need and then measure the effectiveness of those programs.     Aims and Methods: The overarching goal of this research is to develop a methodologic framework to translate antibody response measured in cross-sectional surveys into measures of transmission intensity for enteric pathogens (7 included in the study, e.g., Cryptosporidium parvum, enterotoxigenic E. coli) and neglected tropical diseases (principal focus: lymphatic filariasis). We approach this goal from two novel perspectives. In Aim 1, we draw on the ""peak shift"" phenomenon for infectious diseases, and hypothesize that changes in transmission will be detectable in the age-specific antibody response curve. At lower transmission, antibody levels should decline across all ages due to fewer and less frequent active infections, leading to an overall shift in the age-specific response curve. We will evaluate the approach by comparing antibody response curves for young children with different exposures (improved vs. unimproved drinking water for enteric pathogens; pre- versus post- mass drug administration for lymphatic filariasis) in large, well characterized cohorts in Kenya, Tanzania, and Haiti.     In Aim 2, we will develop semi-parametric methods to estimate the force of infection (seroconversion rate) from seroprevalence data for pathogens where seroreversion is possible, using lymphatic filariasis as an example. Our new approach marks a significant advance over previous work in this area by making few modeling assumptions and by allowing for the flexible control of confounding between comparison groups. We will evaluate the approach in Haiti by measuring the effect of mass drug administration on the force of infection for lymphatic filariasis For all of the methods, we will create user-friendly, open source software to accelerate translation to applied research.     The Future: This mentored training and research plan represents a natural next step for me on a productive and collaborative path to independence at UC Berkeley. It will set the stage for a broader R01-level research portfolio that applies the newly developed methods to primary research studies that evaluate the impact of interventions on enteric infections, and help target and monitor global elimination efforts for NTDs. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Antibodies measured in blood provide a sensitive measure of infection for many infectious diseases. Statistical methods that enable us to measure disease transmission intensity at the population level from blood antibody levels are an important tool for public health efforts because they help identify populations in greatest need of intervention and help measure the effectiveness of interventions designed to reduce transmission. No statistical tools like this exist for enteric pathogens (those that cause diarrhea) and neglected tropical diseases, which together cause an immense health burden among the world's poorest people, and so we propose to develop new methods to measure population-level transmission intensity of these diseases based on antibodies measured in blood from children in Kenya, Tanzania, and Haiti.",New Serological Measures of Infectious Disease Transmission Intensity,9487840,K01AI119180,"['Age', 'Antibodies', 'Antibody Response', 'Antigens', 'Applied Research', 'Area', 'Biological Assay', 'Biometry', 'Blood', 'California', 'Campylobacter', 'Caregivers', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Child', 'Cluster randomized trial', 'Collaborations', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Computer software', 'Country', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Cryptosporidium', 'Cryptosporidium parvum', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Diarrhea', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Entamoeba histolytica', 'Enteral', 'Environment', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Epidemiologist', 'Epidemiology', 'Faculty', 'Family', 'Filarial Elephantiases', 'Future', 'Giardia', 'Goals', 'Haiti', 'Handwashing', 'Health', 'Immune response', 'Immunologist', 'Immunology', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Infectious Disease Epidemiology', 'Infectious Disease Immunology', 'Infectious Diseases Research', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Kenya', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measles', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Mumps', 'Outcome', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Play', 'Population', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Rubella', 'Running', 'Salmonella', 'Sanitation', 'Serological', 'Seroprevalences', 'Source', 'Spottings', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Survival Analysis', 'Tanzania', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Universities', 'Vibrio cholerae', 'Viral', 'Water', 'Work', 'base', 'career', 'cohort', 'comparison group', 'cost', 'disease transmission', 'drinking water', 'effectiveness measure', 'enteric pathogen', 'enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'high risk population', 'improved', 'intervention effect', 'intervention program', 'low income country', 'member', 'multidisciplinary', 'neglected tropical diseases', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'open source', 'pathogen', 'professor', 'programs', 'public health intervention', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'response', 'semiparametric', 'seroconversion', 'seropositive', 'skills', 'statistics', 'theories', 'therapy design', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'user-friendly']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,K01,2018,141048,0.05286467334922849
"Identifying individuals at risk of progression to active tuberculosis Project Summary Almost 2 billion people are infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), the causative agent of tuberculosis (TB). Approximately 10% of these individuals will progress to active TB disease over their lifetimes, but there is currently no clinical test to distinguish those that will progress to active TB disease, from those that will not. If we are to realize the World Health Organization's (WHO) goal of a world free of TB by 2035, the massive reservoir of TB infection must be addressed with a cost-effective, ethical therapy for preventing progression, based on treating only those most likely to progress. A diagnostic test that can accurately predict the risk of progression is critical for treating these high-risk individuals and the eradication of TB. Our goal is to develop such an assay. Our central hypothesis is that five independent host immune biomarkers, combined into a single multimetric signature will predict progression from latent to active TB with at least 90% sensitivity and specificity. We will test this hypothesis and achieve our goal by implementing the following specific aims: Aim 1: Compile a comprehensive dataset of biomarkers in a prospective cohort of individuals who are at risk of progressing to active TB. Working with the Moldova Ministry of Health's National TB Program, we will enroll 3,685 close contacts of active TB cases. All participants will be followed for two years to determine who progresses to active TB. We expect to identify ≥ 140 progressors. We will assess three previously established blood-based predictors of active TB progression, and two novel assays. We will verify the performance of previously published biomarkers in this population to discriminate progressors from non-progressors and identify new candidate biomarkers using RNA-Seq of antigen stimulated PBMC and detection of Mtb-peptides by NanoDisk MS. Aim 2: Use a discovery set of samples to develop predictive models of progression to active TB. Using data from 140 progressors and 140 non-progressors from Aim 1 we will (1) Verify the performance of existing biomarkers, (2) Use a cross-validation to identify new candidate biomarkers, and (3) derive predictive models using logistic regression and machine learning methods to identify optimal biomarker signatures that best predict progression to active TB within 12 months. Aim 3: Verify the ability of the model to predict progression to active TB disease. Using the same approach as Aim 1, we will enroll a new set of 1,340 household contacts of active TB and identify at least 60 progressors and 60 matched non-progressors and verify clinically the sensitivity/specificity of our models and biosignatures (Aim 2) to predict progression to active disease. A combined host biomarker signature that can predict TB progression from a small blood volume will have significant impact on the WHO End TB Program. PROJECT NARRATIVE Almost 2 billion people are infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the causative agent of tuberculosis (TB). Approximately 10% of these individuals will progress to active TB disease over their lifetimes, but there is currently no test to distinguish those that will progress from those that will not. We propose to develop a multimetric signature of host biomarkers that together will have a sensitivity and specificity of ≥ 90% for predicting progression to active TB in one year, a critical first step to developing cost-effective and ethical treatment plans in order to reach the World Health Organization goal of Ending TB by 2035.",Identifying individuals at risk of progression to active tuberculosis,9501395,R01AI137681,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Antigens', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood Volume', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Sensitivity', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Enrollment', 'Ethics', 'Event', 'Filtration', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Foundations', 'Freezing', 'Frequencies', 'Gender', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Household', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immunologic Markers', 'Individual', 'Interferon-alpha', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Lymphocyte', 'Machine Learning', 'Modeling', 'Moldova', 'Mycobacterium tuberculosis', 'Mycobacterium tuberculosis antigens', 'National Health Programs', 'Organizational Objectives', 'Outcomes Research', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Peptide Fragments', 'Peptides', 'Performance', 'Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell', 'Plasma', 'Population', 'Procedures', 'Production', 'Prospective cohort', 'Proteins', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'RNA', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Specificity', 'T cell response', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Testing', 'Tuberculosis', 'Validation', 'World Health Organization', 'age group', 'base', 'biobank', 'biomarker performance', 'biosignature', 'blood-based biomarker', 'candidate marker', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'cohort', 'cost effective', 'deep neural network', 'enzyme linked immunospot assay', 'falls', 'follow-up', 'forest', 'high risk', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'learning network', 'learning strategy', 'monocyte', 'nanodisk', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive test', 'prevent', 'programs', 'research clinical testing', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transmission process', 'treatment planning']",NIAID,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2018,798023,0.0434325364802885
"Models for synthesising molecular, clinical and epidemiological data, and transla DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A mathematical or computational model of infectious disease transmission represents the process of how an infection spreads from one person to another. Such models have a long history within infectious disease epidemiology, and are useful tools for giving insight into the dynamics of epidemics and for evaluating the potential effect of control methods. The overall objective of this project is to substantially improve the methods by which models of infectious diseases transmission are calibrated against biological and disease surveillance data. This will both improve the utility of models as tools for analyzing data on infectious disease outbreaks (for instance to provide more rapid and reliable estimates of how transmissible and lethal a new virus is to public health agencies) and also improve the reliability of models as tools for predicting the likely effect of different interventions (such as vaccines or case isolation) to help policy makers make more informed decisions about control policies. As with many areas of biology and medicine, the data landscape for infectious diseases modeling is changing rapidly. Larger and more complex datasets are becoming available that cover many different aspects of the interaction between a pathogen and the human population: clinical episode data, genetic data about fast-evolving pathogens; animal-model transmission data and community-based representative serological data. The specific aims of our project are to: (a) develop new machine-learning based methods to discover interesting patterns in complex datasets related to the transmission of infectious disease, so as to better specify subsequent mechanistic mathematical or computational models; (b) derive new approaches for using more than one type of data simultaneously to calibrate transmission models and (c) derive new methods of parameter estimation for simulations which model the spatial spread of infection or model both the transmission and genetic evolution of a pathogen. We will achieve these aims in the applied context of research on three key infections: emerging infectious diseases (such as MERS-CoV - the novel coronavirus currently spreading in the Middle East), influenza and Streptococcus pneumonia (a major bacterial pathogen). Examples of the scientific questions we will address that cannot be answered with current methods are: (i) how many unobserved cases of MERS-CoV have occurred so far (to be answered using data on case clusters data, the spatial distribution of cases and viral genetic sequences)? (ii) how many people in different age groups are infected with influenza each year and how does their immune system respond to infection (to be answered using data on case incidence and serological testing of the population)? (iii) how much is vaccination coupled with prescribing practices influencing the emergence of resistant strains of pneumococcus (to be addressed with data on antibiotic and vaccine use, case incidence and bacterial strain frequency)? PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Mathematical and computational models of infectious disease spread can provide valuable information to aid policy-makers in the tough choices they face when trying to control infectious diseases, but models must be designed to make the best possible use of the often limited data available. As the digital footprints of our lives grow, so te datasets available for infectious disease models become larger and more complex. This project will develop new algorithms and methods to allow models to make better use of all available data and therefore better inform control policy planning for diseases such as: influenza, pneumococcal infection and novel viruses like MERS-CoV.","Models for synthesising molecular, clinical and epidemiological data, and transla",9495704,U01GM110721,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Antibiotics', 'Antigenic Variation', 'Area', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Coronavirus', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Disease Surveillance', 'Economics', 'Emerging Communicable Diseases', 'Epidemic', 'Epidemiology', 'Evolution', 'Face', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Generations', 'Generic Drugs', 'Genetic', 'Genotype', 'Hospitalization', 'Human', 'Immune system', 'Immunological Models', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Infectious Disease Epidemiology', 'Influenza', 'Influenza A virus', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Medicine', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Middle East', 'Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Monte Carlo Method', 'Movement', 'Natural History', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Phenotype', 'Pneumococcal Infections', 'Policies', 'Policy Maker', 'Population', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Serologic tests', 'Serological', 'Shapes', 'Site', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Specificity', 'Stream', 'Streptococcus pneumoniae', 'Syndrome', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Vaccination', 'Vaccines', 'Variant', 'Virus', 'Work', 'age group', 'algorithmic methodologies', 'base', 'contextual factors', 'data exchange', 'data mining', 'design', 'digital', 'disease natural history', 'disease transmission', 'epidemiologic data', 'epidemiological model', 'forest', 'genetic evolution', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'infectious disease model', 'innovation', 'insight', 'mathematical model', 'meetings', 'mortality', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'novel virus', 'pandemic influenza', 'pathogen', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive tools', 'public health relevance', 'resistant strain', 'seasonal influenza', 'simulation', 'social', 'surveillance data', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'virus genetics']",NIGMS,U OF L IMPERIAL COL OF SCI/TECHNLGY/MED,U01,2018,396544,0.06874227544925647
"Successful Clinical Response In Pneumonia Therapy (SCRIPT) Systems Biology Center Overall Project Summary: This innovative integrated systems biology application seeks to delineate the complex host/pathogen interactions occurring at the alveolar level that lead to unsuccessful response to therapy in serious pneumonia. To achieve this objective, we will leverage our unique access to alveolar fluid collected as part of routine clinical care in mechanically ventilated patients with suspected pneumonia in our medical intensive care unit. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid will be obtained serially from well characterized mechanically ventilated patients with Pseudomonas or Acinetobacter pneumonia. Both of these CDC- designated serious hazard level pathogens have clinical failure rates as high as 50%. A robust clinical definition will allow comparison of both host and pathogen signatures associated with failure of therapy vs. success. These clinical specimens and extensive patient phenomics will anchor two mutually supportive and iterative research projects. Project One will deploy robust tools for flow sorting macrophage and lymphocyte subset populations, isolating RNA from these populations, and performing transcriptomic and epigenomic analysis to compare successful and unsuccessful host responses to infection. Project Two will focus on both specific pathogen genomic profiles associated with unsuccessful outcome. Changes in microbiome communities will be comprehensively assessed by shotgun deep sequencing to detect bacteriophage, other virus, and fungal DNA, in addition to bacterial. The Technology Core will perform cell sorting of NBBAL macrophage and lymphocyte subsets, RNA sequencing, and whole genome methylation, and perform parallel studies in a unique humanized alveolar macrophage mouse model. A Data Management and Bioinformatics Core will develop tools to reduce the dimensionality of these large comprehensive datasets, including the clinical phenomics, and provide them to the Modeling Core. The Modeling Core will then use innovative modeling approaches including a model of the alveolus during pneumonia as an ecosystem out of balance combined with unique machine learning tools and neural networks to generate biomarkers of host, pathogen and/or microbiome patterns predictive of successful pneumonia outcome. Predictive biomarkers developed in the Modeling Core will then be validated in a prospective confirmatory cohort of patients in whom analogous data will be generated. The Administrative Core will perform the outward-facing role of education and outreach to the community and sponsor, as well as regularly exchanging datasets, analytic tools, and specimens with NIH-sponsored/approved repository sites.

"Fluomics: The Next Generation Influenza A virus is a major human respiratory pathogen, and available vaccines and antivirals are of limited efficacy. In order to identify novel targets for therapeutic intervention during influenza virus infection, we have assembled an interdisciplinary team that uses a highly integrated systems level approach to identify and validate key genes/networks involved in virus pathogenesis. The overarching theme of our multidisciplinary proposal “FluOMICS: The NEXT Generation” is to obtain multiple OMICS-based systems level measurements and integrate them using modeling approaches and machine learning algorithms to identify and validate 1) host-virus networks that modulate influenza A virus disease severity, 2) biomarkers in blood that reflect the activation states of these networks and 3) novel host targets for therapeutic interventions. Our underlying main hypothesis is that host networks involved in viral replication and early host responses regulate disease outcomes and represent targets for therapeutic intervention. The proposed studies leverage on our previous collaborations that generated global datasets and models that predict severity of disease caused by three influenza virus strains with different levels of virulence. While our previous studies gave many novel insights in influenza pathogenesis, they likely provide a narrow window on the determinants of disease severity in humans. Thus, it is necessary expand beyond the specific virus strains that were used to study pathogenesis, and explore a broader context of viral and host perturbations linked to clinical outcomes. In order to identify clinically relevant networks involved in influenza virus pathogenesis we propose to integrate into predictive and comprehensive models global responses during influenza virus infection in three systems 1) human blood from a human cohort of patients with documented influenza virus infection and diverse clinical outcomes (Project 1); 2) mouse blood and tissues from experimentally infected animals under a variety of conditions and perturbations resulting in diverse disease outcomes (Project 1) and 3) relevant primary human cells (Project 2). Samples will be processed and send to the Technology Core for global transcriptomics, proteomics and metabolomics analysis. OMICS data sets will be integrated and compared by the Modeling Core to generate network models of disease, uncover blood biomarkers and identify key drivers as targets for therapeutic intervention. Predicted network regulators will be used as a source for subsequent iterative rounds of perturbations to refine existing and to identify new network disease models. Data and models will be managed and disseminated by the Data Management and Bioinformatics Core. We expect that these studies will uncover and validate novel pathogenic networks, blood biomarkers associated with them, and specific therapeutic targets to revert pathogenic networks. In summary, our modeling approaches will find correlates and associations between diverse experimental systems that will help us define human blood biomarkers, and link them to in vivo and ex vivo signatures for both companion diagnostics and personalized therapies. We propose a systematic approach (FluOMICS) to generate predictive models of influenza virus pathogenesis which will a) allow us to identify biomarkers for predicting disease outcome, and b) provide avenues to explore for new, host-directed, therapeutic interventions.",Fluomics: The Next Generation,9455006,U19AI135972,"['Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Antiviral Agents', 'Benchmarking', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'CRISPR screen', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Collaborations', 'Complementary DNA', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Disease model', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Experimental Models', 'Genes', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Human', 'Immune response', 'Infection', 'Influenza', 'Influenza A Virus, H1N1 Subtype', 'Influenza A virus', 'Integration Host Factors', 'Intervention', 'Link', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Mus', 'Network-based', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Post-Translational Protein Processing', 'Predisposition', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Proteomics', 'Sampling', 'Severities', 'Severity of illness', 'Small Interfering RNA', 'Source', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Tissues', 'Vaccines', 'Viral', 'Virulence', 'Virus', 'Virus Diseases', 'Virus Replication', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'companion diagnostics', 'data integration', 'data management', 'early detection biomarkers', 'epigenome', 'epigenomics', 'functional genomics', 'in vivo', 'influenza virus strain', 'influenzavirus', 'insight', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'mouse model', 'multidisciplinary', 'multiple omics', 'network models', 'new therapeutic target', 'next generation', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'personalized medicine', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'protein protein interaction', 'resilience', 'respiratory', 'response', 'specific biomarkers', 'targeted treatment', 'therapeutic target', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptomics', 'virus pathogenesis']",NIAID,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,U19,2018,2799687,0.022623600016027097
"Repurposing pyronaridine as a treatment for Chagas disease Summary Neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) are a diverse group of diseases with distinct characteristics that thrive mainly among the poorest populations of the world. There are 17 NTDs prioritized by the World Health Organization which are endemic in 149 countries and affect more than 1.4 billion people globally, which costs these developing economies billions of dollars annually. The neglected tropical diseases result from four different causative pathogens: protozoa, bacteria, helminth and virus. The majority of the diseases lack effective treatments. For example, 6 to 7 million people in Latin America are infected with the eukaryotic parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, the causative agent of Chagas disease. This disease is gaining recognition as an emerging infection in the United States where an estimated 300,000 people may be infected. Chagas disease has a serious economic impact on the United States and the world. The cost of treatment in the United States alone, where the disease is not indigenous, is estimated to be $900 million annually, which includes hospitalization and medical devices such as pacemakers. The global cost is estimated at $7 billion. Unfortunately, there are no FDA approved treatments for Chagas disease and the two available treatments used outside the U.S. have toxic side effects. New therapeutics for Chagas disease and the other NTDs are desperately needed. Using a machine learning model based on published data for compounds tested against T. cruzi we have identified the EU-approved antimalarial pyronaridine as particularly active in vitro and in vivo with statistically significant efficacy in a 4-day mouse model of infection with a T. cruzi strain expressing firefly luciferase. Pyronaridine demonstrated 85.2% parasite reduction after 4 days treatment, and is known to have a long half-life in humans (13.2 days), promising toxicity profile (less toxic than chloroquine in malaria treatment) and may suggest a drug repurposing opportunity for further study. We propose in this project to determine the minimum effective dose (treatment regimen) for pyronaridine in the acute model of Chagas disease. We will also determine efficacy in the chronic phase of Chagas disease (sterile cure). We will pursue combination therapy DMPK profiling as well as performing combination therapy in vivo efficacy in chronic model of Chagas disease. The results will enable us to assess whether this EU approved drug is worthy of a clinical trial for Chagas disease in the UH3 stage. If successful we will design a clinical study and recruit patients for a phase II trial. This grant represents a unique opportunity to partner the Center for Discovery and Innovation in Parasitic Diseases (www.cdipd.org) at UCSD and the University of Sao Paulo in Brazil with Collaborations Pharmaceuticals Inc. Narrative Approximately 6 to 7 million people in Latin America are infected with the eukaryotic parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, the causative agent of the deadly Chagas disease. This disease is gaining recognition as an emerging infection in the United States where an estimated 300,000 people may be infected and there is no FDA approved treatment. The antimalarial pyronaridine was recently identified by our groups using computational Bayesian repurposing methods and was confirmed as active when tested in vitro and in vivo in the acute mouse model of Chagas disease. We now propose in the UH2 stage to determine: the minimum effective dose in the acute model of Chagas disease and efficacy in the chronic phase while also assessing potential for combination therapy.

antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), serum and phagocytic cells (e.g. neutrophils) reveals therapeutic options  unrecognized in standard testing. The proposed U01 program represents a groundbreaking approach to use  systems biology approaches and inform more effective antibiotic utilization in the context of host innate

priority pathogens to systematically elucidate AR mechanisms and their condition­dependency. The iterative  workflow includes: (i) omics and physiological data generation.  Clinically isolated strains of the selected

overall biological functions. This analysis will lead to understanding of AR mechanisms.  (iii) Multi­scale  validation from animal models, to laboratory evolution, to cytology, to gene expression alteration, to structural  protein analysis of putative targets. The validation thus ranges from host behavior to atomistic detail of  ligand­target interactions. The iterative loop then closes, comparing computational prediction to experimental  outcomes. False­negative and false­positive predictions are then algorithmically analyzed by a hypothesis  generating family of algorithms that then makes suggestions about what conditions to use in the next iteration  of the loop.  The pathogens that we will focus on are methicillin­resistant ​Staphylococcus aureus ​(MRSA), the  carbapenem­resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) Klebsiella ​pneumoniae ​and ​Acinetobacter baumannii,​ and  Pseudomonas aeruginosa​. The team of investigators has made the foundational observations and led the  development of the technologies on which the iterative workflow is based. A multi­ and genome­scale methods  of systems biology fulfills requirements of RFA­AI­14­064 to which it responds.              Narrative    The current evaluation of antibiotic drug candidates in drug discovery and in clinical medicine is conducted in

"Microscopy-Based Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (MAST) Antibiotic resistance is compromising our ability to treat bacterial infections. Clinical microbiology laboratories guide appropriate treatment through antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) of patient bacterial isolates. However, increasingly, pathogens are developing resistance to a broad range of antimicrobials, requiring AST of less commonly used or recently introduced agents for which no commercially available or FDA-cleared testing methods exist. Agar and broth dilution are gold standard methods for AST that can be used to test any antimicrobial; however, labor and technical complexity precludes their use in hospital-based clinical laboratories. Therefore, bacterial isolates often must be sent to a reference laboratory with a 4-6 day delay in results. Furthermore, even standard methods require overnight incubation prior to readout. Therefore, there exists a significant AST testing gap in which current methodologies cannot adequately address the need for rapid results in the face of unpredictable susceptibility profiles. Our laboratory has recently verified inkjet printer-based digital dispensing technology as a novel platform to facilely perform reference AST for any antimicrobial at will. In this proposal, we aim to combine this methodology with advanced microscopy to leapfrog traditional AST capabilities through: (1) development of a method for microscopic imaging of bacterial replication on a solid-phase, 384-well microplate AST format, thereby allowing determination of susceptibility for any drug at will in 4 hours and (2) development and application of advanced image analysis for automated susceptibility calls. This new platform is designated MAST for microscopy-based antimicrobial susceptibility testing. The clinical diagnostic performance of the platform will be optimized against an AST reference method for accuracy and precision using a large panel of well-characterized clinical isolates. We anticipate establishing a prototype platform that will address the AST testing gap and thereby help our health system more effectively address the antimicrobial resistance threat. With the emergence of multi-drug resistant bacteria, it is no longer possible to accurately predict which antimicrobials will be effective against life-threatening bacterial illness. Testing bacteria directly for response available therapies may take several days. Therefore, a new technology platform called MAST is proposed to allow us to determine which antibiotics can treat a bacteria infection in a matter of hours and thereby address our current, clinically unacceptable antimicrobial testing gap.",Microscopy-Based Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (MAST),9455026,R21AI130434,"['Address', 'Agar', 'Algorithms', 'Antibiotic Resistance', 'Antibiotics', 'Antimicrobial Resistance', 'Antimicrobial susceptibility', 'Bacteria', 'Bacterial Infections', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Microbiology', 'Development', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Growth', 'Health system', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Laboratories', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Microscopic', 'Microscopy', 'Monitor', 'Multiple Bacterial Drug Resistance', 'Nutrient', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Predisposition', 'Printing', 'Regimen', 'Resistance', 'Resistance development', 'Solid', 'Supervision', 'Surface', 'Technology', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'antimicrobial', 'base', 'biomaterial compatibility', 'clinical diagnostics', 'digital', 'direct application', 'microscopic imaging', 'new technology', 'next generation', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'performance tests', 'prototype', 'response']",NIAID,BETH ISRAEL DEACONESS MEDICAL CENTER,R21,2018,263805,0.029998092892597625
"Neutralization Fingerprinting Analysis of Polyclonal Antibody Responses against HIV-1 Project Summary HIV-1 poses a substantial health and economic burden, with more than 30 million people currently infected worldwide. The search for an effective HIV-1 vaccine remains a top priority, and a deeper understanding of how the immune system recognizes HIV-1 can help inform vaccine design. Lately, much effort has focused on understanding the antibody responses to HIV-1 infection. However, the polyclonal neutralizing antibody responses in an individual are very complex. Standard methods for mapping such responses include various experimental techniques, but more recently, computational methods were also developed. These computational methods, which we call NFP (neutralization fingerprinting), are based on analysis of serum neutralization data that is typically obtained in the very first stages of donor sample characterization, and are therefore an efficient technology for accurately mapping antibody specificities in polyclonal responses. The NFP algorithms have already become an important tool in the HIV field and are being used extensively by laboratories throughout the world, including Duke CHAVI-ID, CAPRISA, NIH VRC, and MHRP.  Here, we propose to develop next-generation NFP algorithms and apply them to address biological questions with important implications for understanding the interactions between HIV-neutralizing antibodies and the virus. Specifically, we will develop and apply novel algorithms for: (1) Antibody specificity prediction with significantly improved accuracy and reliability. These algorithms will immensely improve the utility of the NFP approach for prospective identification of antibody specificities in polyclonal sera. (2) Mapping broadly neutralizing antibody responses against novel epitopes on HIV-1 Env. We will use epitope- structural analysis and computational search algorithms to identify novel Env epitopes, and will screen donor samples for the presence of related NFP signals. Promising signals for novel antibody specificities will be characterized further through collaborations. (3) Population-level analysis of broadly neutralizing antibody responses to HIV-1. We will analyze large collections of samples from diverse HIV infection cohorts in order to determine common antibody specificities elicited in response to HIV-1, as well as patterns of potential association between features of the infecting virus sequence and the elicited epitope specificities.  The proposed NFP algorithms will be made available to the public, and will be useful in a number of high-impact areas in the HIV field, including mapping of antibody specificities in previously uncharacterized samples, identification of novel Env epitopes, and large-scale analysis of broadly neutralizing antibody responses within a cohort, or at a population level. Overall, this work will lead to a better understanding of the neutralizing antibody responses against HIV-1 and will build a more complete picture of the epitopes on Env. The proposed algorithmic framework should be generalizable to other important viruses, such as influenza and hepatitis C, and therefore has the potential for a far-reaching impact on public health. Project Narrative  This project aims at developing next-generation neutralization fingerprinting algorithms for the analysis of antibody specificities in polyclonal responses against HIV-1.

"Omics for TB:  Response to Infection and Treatment Abstract – Overview With about 10 million new cases of active disease and 1.8 million deaths annually, TB is a global health emergency. A distinguishing feature of TB disease is its biological heterogeneity, which manifests at the clinical level chiefly in 2 forms: disease progression and treatment response. The premise of this Program is that the heterogeneous outcomes of TB infection and treatment are determined by the interplay of competing regulatory networks between the pathogen and the host. Our primary goal is to apply systems biology approaches to elucidate the biological control underlying the variability of disease outcome and response to treatment. Our first specific aim is to define novel host regulators of TB disease progression in vivo, and the innate and adaptive networks they control. We will also seek to define novel Mtb regulators of TB treatment response, and the Mtb regulatory networks that they control. This work will allow us to produce and validate host and Mtb models of TB disease progression and treatment response. Altogether, this program addresses key unanswered questions that stymie efforts to combat the TB pandemic. Our team has perfected the required platforms and scientific approaches to execute this ambitious research plan in a timely and cost- effective manner. All the participating investigators have strong records of interacting productively, and of disseminating their data and reagents to the scientific community. Project Narrative - Omics for TB: Response to Infection and Treatment Mycobacterium tuberculosis causes ~10 million new cases of active disease and 1.8 million deaths each year, and our tools to combat tuberculosis (TB) disease are universally outdated and overmatched.

"Integrating Bioinformatics and Clustering Analysis for Disease Surveillance ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  There has been a tremendous focus in bioinformatics on translation of data from the bench into information and knowledge for clinical decision-making. This includes analysis of human genetics for personalized medicine and treatment. However, there has been much less attention on translational bioinformatics for public health practice such as surveillance of emerging/re-emerging viruses. This involves data acquisition, integration, and analyses of viral genetics to infer origin, spread, and evolution suc as the emergence of new strains. The relevant scientific fields for this practice include certain aspects of molecular epidemiology and phylogeography. Recent attention has focused on viruses of zoonotic origin, which are defined as pathogens that are transmittable between animals and humans. In addition to seasonal influenza and West Nile virus, this classification of pathogens includes novel viruses such as Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome and influenza A H7N9. Despite the successes highlighted in the literature, there has been little utilization of bioinformatics resources and tools among state public health, agriculture, and wildlife agencies for zoonotic surveillance. Previously this type of resource has been restricted primarily to those in academia.       While bioinformatics has been sparsely used for surveillance of zoonotic viruses, other applications such as Geospatial Information Systems (GIS) have been employed by state health agencies to analyze spatial patterns of infection. This includes software to produce disease maps using an array of data types such as clinical, geographical, or human mobility data for tasks such as, geocoding, clustering, or outbreak detection. In addition, advances in geospatial statistics have enabled health agencies to perform more powerful space-time analyses to infer spatiotemporal patterns. However, these GIS consider only traditional epidemiological data such as location and timing of reported cases and not the genetics of the virus that causes the disease. This prevents health agencies from understanding how changes in the genome of the virus and the associated environment in which it disseminates impacts disease risk.      The long-term goal of this proposal is to enhance the identification of geospatial hotspots of zoonotic viruses by applying bioinformatics principles to access, integrate, and analyze viral genetics and spatiotemporal reportable disease data. This project will include approaches from bioinformatics, genetics, spatial statistics, GIS, and epidemiology. To do this, I will first measue the utilization of bioinformatics resources and tools as well as the current approaches and limitations identified by state agencies of public health, agriculture, and wildlife for detecting nd predicting hotspots (clusters) of zoonotic viruses (Aim 1). I will then use this feedback to develo a spatial decision support system for detecting and predicting zoonotic hotspots that applies bioinformatics principles to access, integrate, and analyze viral genetics, environmental, and spatiotemporal reportable disease data (Aim 2). In Aim 3, I will then evaluate my system for cluster detection and prediction against a system that does not consider viral genetics and relies on traditional spatiotemporal data, and perform validation of the predictive capability. Additional evaluation of the user's satisfaction and system usability will be evaluated. Project Narrative I will develop and evaluate a spatial decision support system to support surveillance of zoonotic viruses in both human and animal populations. I will use approaches from bioinformatics and public health to integrate genetic sequence data from the virus with data from cases of reported infectious diseases and associated environmental data. A surveillance system that considers the genetics and environment of the virus along with public health data will assist public health officials in making informed decisions regarding risk of infectious diseases.",Integrating Bioinformatics and Clustering Analysis for Disease Surveillance,9406513,F31LM012176,"['Academia', 'Address', 'Agriculture', 'Algorithm Design', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Biodiversity', 'Bioinformatics', 'Case Study', 'Clinical', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Detection', 'Disease', 'Disease Notification', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Disease Surveillance', 'Ecology', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Evaluation', 'Evolution', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Genbank', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Geographic Information Systems', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Human Genetics', 'Infection', 'Influenza', 'Influenza A Virus, H7N9 Subtype', 'Influenza A virus', 'Knowledge', 'Literature', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Metadata', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Epidemiology', 'Molecular Evolution', 'Pattern', 'Population', 'Public Health', 'Public Health Practice', 'Questionnaire Designs', 'Questionnaires', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk', 'Scanning', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Time', 'Translations', 'Validation', 'Validity and Reliability', 'Viral', 'Viral Genome', 'Virus', 'Virus Integration', 'West Nile virus', 'Work', 'Zoonoses', 'bioinformatics resource', 'clinical decision-making', 'data acquisition', 'data warehouse', 'disorder risk', 'epidemiologic data', 'health data', 'high risk', 'novel virus', 'pathogen', 'personalized medicine', 'prevent', 'respiratory', 'satisfaction', 'seasonal influenza', 'spatiotemporal', 'statistics', 'success', 'tool', 'usability', 'virus classification', 'virus genetics']",NLM,ARIZONA STATE UNIVERSITY-TEMPE CAMPUS,F31,2018,40590,0.024177918727219236
"Structure-Based Design of a Broadly Protective Group A Streptococcal Vaccine The overall goal of this project is to develop a safe, broadly effective, and affordable vaccine to prevent group A streptococcal infections. Antibodies against the N-terminal hypervariable region (HVR) of surface M (Emm) proteins of GAS are opsonic and are associated with protection against infection. Immunity has classically been described as “type-specific”, leading to the assumption that natural immunity confers protection against only one of the more than 200 different emm types of GAS. We now have new information that calls into question this classic view and serves as the basis for an entirely different approach to GAS vaccine design and development. A recent comprehensive sequence analysis of M proteins from a global collection of 175 emm types of GAS resulted in a new emm cluster typing system that classified 96.2% of all contemporary GAS isolates into 48 emm clusters containing structurally and functionally related M proteins. Moreover, 117 emm types contained in 16 clusters accounted for 94.4% of GAS infections in the world. Indeed, preclinical studies indicated that a multivalent vaccine containing N-terminal peptides from 30 prevalent M types cross-opsonized a significant number of non-vaccine emm types of GAS that co-localized in clusters with vaccine emm types. The frequency of cross-opsonic antibodies, combined with the emm cluster data, prompted us to conclude that there is a need for a paradigm shift away from the concept of “type-specific” immunity against GAS infections to one of “cluster-specific” immunity. Our overall hypothesis is that immunity to GAS infections is the result of both type-specific and cross-reactive antibodies against the N-terminal regions of M proteins and that a new approach employing computational predictions of peptide structures will result in a multivalent vaccine that will induce broadly protective immunity in populations throughout the world. Our preliminary results indicate the feasibility of using structure-based design to predict the antigenic relatedness of M peptides within a cluster. The specific aims of this proposal are to: 1) Apply computational structure-based design in an iterative process with immunological data from Aim 2 to predict the minimal number of M peptide sequences that are most representative of the structural and physicochemical properties of the peptides in one emm cluster containing 17 GAS emm types, 2) determine the cross-reactive immunogenicity of the selected peptides with all seventeen emm types of GAS in the cluster, and apply the results to refine the computational design predictions in Aim 1, 3) apply the refined computational parameters from Aims 1 and 2 to analyze the remaining epidemiologically important emm clusters, select a comprehensive panel of peptides representing all emm types, construct four multivalent recombinant vaccine proteins, and assess potential cross-protective immunogenicity using in vitro bactericidal assays against all 117 emm types of GAS, and 4) determine the protective immunogenicity of the final multivalent vaccine in unique transgenic mice expressing human C4BP and factor H that will be immunized and then challenged with multiple emm types of GAS. The world needs an effective, safe and affordable vaccine to prevent group A streptococcal (GAS) infections. Although most GAS infections are mild, there are more than 18 million people with a chronic complication of a severe GAS disease worldwide, over 15 million of whom have rheumatic heart disease, another 2 million cases of severe disease occur each year and a total of 517,000 deaths annually are estimated to be due to this organism.

"Host-derived biomarker signatures to differentiate acute viral, bacterial, and fungal infection Statement of Work There is an urgent need for improved diagnostic tests for the evaluation of the etiology of febrile states, particularly in immunocompromised hosts. This project will develop host-based biomarker signatures capable of identifying the presence and pathogen class of infections in vulnerable immunocompromised human subjects, thus potentially allowing for earlier, more directed (and thus more effective) therapy as well as reducing the need for potentially harmful empiric anti-infective therapy. In this study we will a) perform high dimensional gene expression analysis on existing samples of at-risk hosts with proven candidemia, viral infection, bacterial infection, or noninfectious illness, b) develop peripheral blood-based gene expression signatures of candidemia and c) generate a combined multinomial classifier capable of differentiating four clinical states: viral infection, bacterial infection, fungal infection (candidemia) and noninfectious illness. The enclosed work offers a true paradigm shift in the way febrile illnesses in this high-risk population are diagnosed and managed. Relevance Statement Timely and accurate differentiation of viral, bacterial, and fungal illness has important implications for both the individual patient and society as earlier/more accurate diagnosis may improve patient treatment and clinical outcomes as well as curb anti-microbial overusage and subsequent proliferation of resistant organisms.","Host-derived biomarker signatures to differentiate acute viral, bacterial, and fungal infection",9530534,R21AI132978,"['Acute', 'Anti-Infective Agents', 'Bacteremia', 'Bacterial Infections', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood specimen', 'Candida', 'Candidiasis', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Effector Cell', 'Enrollment', 'Etiology', 'Fever', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Hematologic Neoplasms', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immunocompromised Host', 'Immunosuppression', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Infection Control', 'Infectious Agent', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Microbiology', 'Modality', 'Mycoses', 'Organ Transplantation', 'Organism', 'Outcome', 'Pathogen detection', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Resistance', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Societies', 'Solid', 'Statistical Methods', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Viral', 'Virus Diseases', 'Work', 'accurate diagnosis', 'adjudicate', 'antimicrobial', 'base', 'candidemia', 'cohort', 'effective therapy', 'evaluation/testing', 'genomic signature', 'high dimensionality', 'high risk population', 'human subject', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'individual patient', 'learning strategy', 'migration', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'pathogen', 'peripheral blood', 'prototype', 'rapid diagnosis', 'therapy outcome', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NIAID,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R21,2018,198750,0.04156322145617015
"Optimized identification of therapeutic bacterial strains in ulcerative colitis PROJECT SUMMARY Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic gut inflammatory condition thought to be caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Therapeutic options are only partially effective in inducing and maintaining remission, and there is currently no cure for UC. Recent studies have found the microbiome of UC patients is distinct compared to that of healthy controls, suggesting that the microbiome could be a promising therapeutic target. Fecal microbiota transplant (FMT) has been extremely successful in the treatment of colitis caused by Clostridium difficile infection, further demonstrating the potential for bacterial therapeutics. The recently completed FOCUS (Faecal Microbiota Transplantation in Ulcerative Colitis) trial has demonstrated that FMT from healthy donors can induce clinical remission in 27% of UC patients compared to only 8% in the placebo group. However, we still lack an understanding of the exact mechanisms by which FMT is able to modulate disease pathogenesis. The overarching hypothesis of this proposal is that UC remission after FMT is induced by specific bacteria, and that accurate identification of bacterial strains will be paramount to develop microbial therapeutics for UC. To test this hypothesis, we will first develop a novel ensemble method to identify bacterial species and strains from deep metagenomic data. This method combines software tools using a voting algorithm that is weighted based on the accuracy of each tool. The accuracy of this method will be tested using microbial culture collections from UC patients, in silico simulations, and a bacterial mock community as gold standards. We will then apply this approach to metagenomic data generated from the FOCUS study in order to identify bacterial strains that are associated with UC remission. This will be performed by using established supervised learning techniques, as well as through a novel method based on co- occurrence network analysis that identifies clusters of bacteria that act synergistically. Based on these results, we will finally validate our findings using a gnotobiotic model of colitis. The prophylactic and/or therapeutic potential of candidate bacteria will be tested by inoculating them to gnotobiotic mice colonized with the microbiota of UC patients and with colitis induced through the transfer of naïve T cells. Our proposal will be the first to address the question of how specific bacteria modulate disease progression in a randomized trial of FMT in UC through the development of more sensitive and accurate methods for strain characterization that can be experimentally validated.

"Network modeling and robust estimation of the intraclass correlation coefficient to inform the design and analysis of cluster randomized trials for infectious diseases 7. Project Summary/Abstract There is an urgent need to support research that generates high-quality evidence to inform clinical decision making. Cluster randomized trials (CRTs) achieve the highest standard of evidence for the evaluation of community-level effectiveness of intervention strategies against infectious diseases. However, there is a need to develop new methods to improve the design and analysis of CRTs because unique and complicated analytical challenges arise in such settings. One such issue relates to the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), the degree to which individuals within a community are more similar to one another than to individuals in other communities. Design and analysis of CRTs must take into account the ICC. Lack of accurate information on the ICC jeopardizes the power of CRTs, leads to suboptimal choices of analysis methods and complicates the interpretation of study results. However, reliable information on the ICC is difficult to obtain. A robust and efficient approach for estimating ICCs is based on the second-order generalizing estimating equations. However, its use has been limited by considerable computational burden and poor convergence rates associated with the existing algorithms solving these equations. The first aim addresses these computational challenges. Missing data are ubiquitous and can lead to bias and loss of efficiency. The second aim proposes to develop novel robust and efficient methods for estimating ICCs in the presence of informative missing data. For infectious diseases, the underlying contact/transmission networks give rise to complicated correlation structure. The third aim is to develop network and epidemic models to project the ICC. User-friendly software will be developed to facilitate the implementation of new methods. An immediate application of the proposed methods is their application to the Botswana Combination Prevention Project to improve the estimation of intervention effect and to generate reliable ICC estimates for designing future CRTs in the same population. The proposed methods can be applied to other ongoing and future CRTs, and more broadly, to longitudinal studies and agreement studies where ICCs are also of great interest. The proposed research is significant, because success in addressing these issues will improve the ability to design efficient and well-powered CRTs and the precision in estimating the effects of intervention strategies. Innovation lies in the development of improved computing algorithms adapting approaches from deep learning, the use of semiparametric efficiency theory, and the integration of network modeling, epidemic modeling and statistical inference. The results of the proposed research will benefit both ongoing and future CRTs, permit more efficient use of the resources, and ultimately expedite the control of infectious diseases. 8. Project Narrative The proposed research is relevant to public health because improved methodologies for the design and analysis of cluster randomized trials will benefit both ongoing and future studies, permit more efficient use of the resources, and ultimately improve public health response intended to control the spread of infectious diseases. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to the part of NIAID’s mission that pertains to conducting and supporting research to prevent infectious diseases and to respond to emerging public health threats.",Network modeling and robust estimation of the intraclass correlation coefficient to inform the design and analysis of cluster randomized trials for infectious diseases,9661636,R01AI136947,"['AIDS prevention', 'Accounting', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Americas', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Botswana', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Cluster randomized trial', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Contracts', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Ebola virus', 'Effectiveness', 'Effectiveness of Interventions', 'Epidemic', 'Equation', 'Evaluation', 'Future', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Individual', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease', 'Nosocomial Infections', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Prevention strategy', 'Probability', 'Public Health', 'Publications', 'Randomized', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Research Support', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Running', 'Science', 'Societies', 'Structure', 'System', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'clinical decision-making', 'collaboratory', 'deep learning', 'design', 'experience', 'high standard', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'intervention effect', 'mathematical model', 'network models', 'novel', 'prevent', 'response', 'semiparametric', 'success', 'systems research', 'theories', 'transmission process', 'user friendly software']",NIAID,"HARVARD PILGRIM HEALTH CARE, INC.",R01,2018,263913,0.02745922735931247
"Immune response to Zika infection at the primate maternal-fetal interface ABSTRACT Infection with Zika virus (ZIKV), first linked with an increased incidence of microcephaly in Brazil, is now associated with a spectrum of fetal and postnatal malformations and developmental disorders. Our previous studies with rhesus macaques have demonstrated that, like the human population, severe fetal outcomes are uncommon, but they have also revealed that vertical transmission of ZIKV to the fetus may more common than is currently appreciated, with 100% transmission to fetuses when dams were inoculated in the first or third trimester. Additional neurological deficits from intrauterine infection are now becoming revealed in postnatal life, thus a better understanding of the correlates of vertical transmission at the maternal-fetal interface is critical. Investigators at the University of Wisconsin-Madison are funded to conduct a study to define the viral persistence and distribution in maternal tissues of pregnant rhesus macaques at staged intervals following infection with ZIKV. That study specifically will evaluate maternal tissues, but does not support concurrent evaluation of the maternal-fetal interface. We hypothesize that the antiviral response in the decidua and placenta can determine the risk for vertical transmission of the virus and the degree of fetal pathology and developmental dysregulation. To address this hypothesis, we propose to comprehensively define the immune response at the maternal-fetal interface in these pregnancies in two Specific Aims: Specific Aim 1. To define the T cell, antigen-presenting cell, and innate lymphoid/natural killer cell populations in control and ZIKV-infected decidua, establishing their transcriptional, secreted, and cell-surface profiles with high-dimensional flow cytometry and dimension reduction methodologies. Specific Aim 2. To define the Hofbauer cell surface, secreted, and activation profiles in control and ZIKV- infected placentas. We will use high-dimensional flow cytometric analytical methods established in our laboratories for human decidual leukocytes, guided by our previous work with rhesus decidual leukocytes and placental Hofbauer cells, comparing infected pregnancies with control pregnancies to be supported by this R21 proposal. The ZIKV- infected decidual and placental immunome will be interpreted in light of the distribution, burden, and pathogenic impact of ZIKV replication in the decidua and the fetus. A clearer understanding of the decidual and placental immune response with ZIKV infection, which we can couple with determination of fetal infection and pathology to be gained from the current study, will allow insight into the correlates of decidual and placental immune responses of fetal outcomes. Project Narrative: Infection of pregnant women with Zika virus has been implicated in an increase in the incidence of microcephaly in Brazil, as well as other fetal pathologies of the developing nervous system. It is not understood whether the immune response of the maternal reproductive tract or the fetal placenta itself can mitigate against the risk for fetal developmental outcomes. The nonhuman primate offers an outstanding opportunity to determine if a local response against Zika infection at the maternal-fetal interface can provide insight into developing interventions to interrupt these devastating fetal outcomes once maternal infection has occurred.",Immune response to Zika infection at the primate maternal-fetal interface,9444928,R21AI136014,"['Address', 'Antigen-Presenting Cells', 'Antiviral Response', 'Autopsy', 'Brazil', 'Cell surface', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Decidua', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Dose', 'Evaluation', 'Fetal Development', 'Fetal Membranes', 'Fetal Monitoring', 'Fetus', 'First Pregnancy Trimester', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Funding', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Histopathology', 'Human', 'Immune response', 'Incidence', 'Infection', 'Inflammation', 'Interruption', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Leukocytes', 'Life', 'Light', 'Link', 'Lymphoid', 'Macaca', 'Macaca mulatta', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maternal-Fetal Exchange', 'Methodology', 'Microcephaly', 'Modeling', 'Natural Killer Cells', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurologic Deficit', 'Optic Nerve', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathology', 'Phenotype', 'Placenta', 'Population', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnant Women', 'Primates', 'Process', 'Research Personnel', 'Retina', 'Risk', 'Specimen', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Techniques', 'Third Pregnancy Trimester', 'Tissues', 'Ultrasonography', 'Universities', 'Vertical Disease Transmission', 'Viral', 'Viral Load result', 'Viremia', 'Virus Replication', 'Visual system structure', 'Wisconsin', 'Work', 'ZIKV infection', 'Zika Virus', 'analytical method', 'base', 'co-infection', 'density', 'developmental disease', 'fetal', 'fetal infection', 'high dimensionality', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'malformation', 'nonhuman primate', 'novel', 'postnatal', 'pregnant', 'reproductive tract', 'response', 'segregation', 'therapeutic evaluation', 'transcriptome', 'transmission process', 'viral transmission', 'virtual', 'virus genetics']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R21,2018,229500,0.01834888021153007
"Reducing the incidence of febrile neutropenia in cancer patients treated with chemotherapy with PointCheck: a portable non-invasive neutropenia analyzer Every year in the US, 650,000 cancer patients are treated with chemotherapy. As a side effect,  their neutrophil counts (number of white blood cells that aid in fighting infections) become low  (referred to as neutropenia) and expose them to febrile neutropenia (FN) which are episodes  of serious infection that entail costly hospitalization and sometimes death. If  neutropenia is detected early, FN can be avoided through timely delivery of  prophylactic antibiotics or growth stimulating factors. Currently, neutrophil measurements require  visits to healthcare centers. This increases infection risk (as measurements are taken infrequently  and low counts may not be detected before infections ensue) and reduces chemotherapy efficacy (as  chemotherapy levels are kept at the lower end of frequency and dose for safety). We aim to overcome  this limitation with PointCheck, a noninvasive neutrophil test that can be used frequently in  local health centers or at home, enabling physicians to minimize infections and  personalize chemotherapy planning. The basis for our technology is noninvasive optical imaging of  microcirculation in nailfold capillaries. We conducted a pilot clinical study where trained   nurses used PointCheck to acquire data from 46 chemotherapy patients. By manually analyzing  a training dataset (N=38 measurements from 16 patients), we built a labeled dataset of flow gaps in  the microcirculation that can be considered proxies of neutrophils and demonstrated their number  can be used to distinguish baseline patients (>500 neutrophils/mm3) from grade IV neutropenic ones  (<500/mm3). However, the need for manual analysis makes the technology inaccessible to patients on  its current status. With support from SBIR Phase I, we will (a) develop algorithms that automatize  the manual data processing workflow employed on our training set, (b) test those algorithms on our  acquired and unanalyzed testing database (N=103 measurements from 30 patients) and (c) generate  additional performance data including further intermediate neutrophil ranges (>500 and <1,500  neutrophils/mm3), thus fulfilling the requirements for a minimum viable product. The consecution of  these milestones will enable, in Phase II, using PointCheck in a multi-site diagnostic validation  trial to confirm, under clinical conditions, that the management of FN can be improved with this  new paradigm. Development of a portable optical imaging device that can noninvasively  detect neutropenia-related immunosuppression, to enable more frequent monitoring of  chemotherapy patients so that timely medical interventions can be staged before  life-threatening infections develop.",Reducing the incidence of febrile neutropenia in cancer patients treated with chemotherapy with PointCheck: a portable non-invasive neutropenia analyzer,9622596,R43CA228920,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Adverse effects', 'Algorithms', 'Antibiotics', 'Area', 'Autologous Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Blinded', 'Blood capillaries', 'Blood specimen', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Colony-Stimulating Factors', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnostic', 'Dose', 'FPS-FES Oncogene', 'Fever', 'Fingers', 'Frequencies', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hematology', 'Home environment', 'Hospital Costs', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Imaging Device', 'Immunosuppression', 'Incidence', 'Infection', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Label', 'Letters', 'Leukocytes', 'Life', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Medical', 'Microcirculation', 'Monitor', 'Neutropenia', 'Nurses', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Pilot Projects', 'Process', 'Proxy', 'ROC Curve', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Site', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'System', 'Systems Analysis', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Triage', 'Validation', 'Visit', 'base', 'chemotherapy', 'cohort', 'computerized data processing', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'experience', 'fighting', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'man', 'mortality', 'movie', 'neutrophil', 'non-invasive\xa0optical imaging', 'oncology', 'optical imaging', 'personalized chemotherapy', 'point of care', 'portability', 'prophylactic', 'prototype']",NCI,"LEUKO LABS, INC.",R43,2018,213919,0.00925109061135182
"Systematic Analysis of Morphogenesis, Commensalism, and Virulence in a Leading Human Fungal Pathogen The impact of fungal pathogens on human health is devastating. They infect billions of people worldwide, and kill more than 1.5 million each year. The most vulnerable are people with reduced immune function, such as those with HIV or those undergoing immune suppressing treatments for cancer or organ transplants. One of the most pervasive fungal pathogens is Candida albicans, which kills almost 40% of people suffering from bloodstream infections. Treating these infections is extremely difficult, as fungi are closely related to humans and there are very few drugs that kill the fungus without host toxicity. With the emergence of drug resistance, the development of new therapeutic strategies is now crucial. To address this important clinical need and identify new antifungal drug targets, it is critical to uncover mechanisms that enable C. albicans to cause life-threatening human disease.  We are one of the first academic labs to obtain a powerful resource that will allow us to test the function of almost every gene in the C. albicans genome. This resource includes a collection of double barcoded heterozygous mutants covering ~90% of the genome, and a collection of strains covering ~40% of the genome where the expression of the remaining wild-type allele of a gene is governed by the tetracycline-repressible promoter. This resource provides an unprecedented opportunity to identify genes that control key virulence traits such as morphogenesis. It also enables the identification of determinants of commensalism and virulence, and to further elucidate the molecular mechanisms involved. We have optimized a functional genomics platform for massively parallel analysis of fungal virulence traits using next generation sequencing to quantify the relative proportion of each barcoded strain in pooled assays. We have also optimized high- resolution image analysis of cellular morphology and structures, and assays for identifying genes important for commensalism, virulence, and interaction with host immune cells. Our studies will provide the first global analysis of C. albicans morphogenesis, commensalism, and virulence.  Our studies will: 1) develop a computational platform to predict C. albicans essential genes, and expand the collection of tetracycline-repressible conditional expression strains to cover most non-essential genes, since genes required for pathogen viability in vitro provide little insight into mechanisms of host adaptation or virulence; 2) identify novel regulators of key virulence traits such as morphogenesis; and 3) identify determinants of C. albicans host adaptation and virulence on a genome scale. This work will provide an expanded functional genomics resource to advance the field, and will leverage this resource to elucidate the genes and genetic networks governing morphogenesis and virulence. This will reveal new strategies to cripple fungal pathogens, and drug targets to improve clinical outcome. The focus of this proposal is to elucidate mechanisms governing morphogenesis, commensalism, and virulence of the fungal pathogen Candida albicans. This eukaryotic pathogen has a profound impact on human health, with a global incidence of Candida bloodstream infections of ~400,000 cases, associated with crude mortality rates of 42% and attributable mortality rates of 27%; C. albicans is the most prevalent Candida species in almost all patient populations. The central hypotheses that govern this proposal are that functional genomic analysis of C. albicans using genome-scale libraries of double barcoded heterozygous gene deletion mutants and tetracycline-repressible conditional expression strains will reveal novel circuitry governing morphogenesis, commensalism, and virulence, and that targeting this circuitry has therapeutic potential for combating life-threatening fungal infections.","Systematic Analysis of Morphogenesis, Commensalism, and Virulence in a Leading Human Fungal Pathogen",9536694,R01AI127375,"['Address', 'Alleles', 'Aneuploidy', 'Antifungal Agents', 'Antifungal Therapy', 'Ascomycota', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Candida', 'Candida albicans', 'Cells', 'Cellular Morphology', 'Cellular Structures', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Cues', 'Cytolysis', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diploidy', 'Drug Targeting', 'Drug resistance', 'Environment', 'Essential Genes', 'Filament', 'Foundations', 'Gastrointestinal tract structure', 'Gene Deletion', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomic Library', 'Genomic approach', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'HIV', 'Health', 'Human', 'Image Analysis', 'Immune', 'Immune system', 'Immunocompromised Host', 'In Vitro', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Investments', 'Laboratories', 'Libraries', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Morphogenesis', 'Mucous Membrane', 'Mus', 'Mutation', 'Mycoses', 'Nosocomial Infections', 'Organ Transplantation', 'Organism', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Process', 'Property', 'Publishing', 'Resistance development', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Sepsis', 'Solid', 'Symbiosis', 'Systemic infection', 'Testing', 'Tetracyclines', 'Therapeutic', 'Toxic effect', 'Virulence', 'Work', 'Yeast Model System', 'Yeasts', 'attributable mortality', 'cancer therapy', 'combat', 'fitness', 'functional genomics', 'fungus', 'gene replacement', 'genome-wide', 'genomic platform', 'high resolution imaging', 'human disease', 'immune function', 'improved', 'insight', 'member', 'microbiota', 'mortality', 'mutant', 'new therapeutic target', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'novel therapeutics', 'pathogen', 'patient population', 'programs', 'promoter', 'quantitative imaging', 'response', 'trait', 'unpublished works']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF TORONTO,R01,2018,570554,-0.007558456386749937
"Protective biomarkers for the development of novel serotype-independent protein-based vaccine candidates against pneumococcus Streptococcus pneumoniae (the pneumococcus) is the most common cause of severe pneumonia, and, despite the existence of licensed vaccines, annually kills half of a million children under five years old worldwide. Pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCVs) have the intrinsic disadvantage of a limited number of serotypes against which they provide protection, resulting in disease due to serotype replacement that reduces their impact. A protein-based vaccine could be used alone or in combination with PCVs to provide protection against all pneumococcal types in low and middle income, as well as developed countries. Antigen Discovery, Inc (ADI) of Irvine, California has developed a S. pneumoniae pan-proteome microarray, with coverage of both the core and accessory geneome, which can be used to screen antibody responses against the entire pneumococcal proteome. A proteome-scale platform for antibody immune-profiling has never before been available to the pneumococcus research community, and this technology has the power to rapidly advance our understanding of the protective immune response directed to pneumococcal proteins. The Respiratory Infections Group (RIG) at the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine (LSTM) in the U.K. has developed a unique human model, which allows for the discovery of targets of naturally acquired and vaccine induced immunity against nasal colonization with pneumococci. In the Experimental Human Pneumococcal Carriage (EHPC) model, healthy volunteers are inoculated with a pneumococcal challenge strain, and acquisition of the challenge strain (carriage-positive) or protection from it (carriage-negative), as well as immune responses before and after challenge, are determined in mucosal secretions and peripheral blood. We will use pan-proteome microarrays to measure the anti-protein IgG and IgA levels to specific proteins before bacteria inoculation and associate these responses with protection from carriage using samples from the volunteers of EHPC trials. This tool will allow us to identify novel relevant protein targets that can be exploited as a part of a multi-component or monovalent vaccine. We expect to identify >200 immunoreactive protein targets, at least 10-20 of which are significantly associated with protection. We will attempt to prioritize 10 of the most promising candidate antigens to take forward for vaccine development.

"Systems Biology of Microbiome-mediated Resilience to Antibiotic-resistant Pathogens ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Infections caused by antibiotic-resistant bacterial pathogens are exceedingly common in immunocompromised hosts. Patients undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) are particularly susceptible to these infections and are the patient population our studies will focus upon. Our goal is to extend and further develop systems biology approaches that our group has pioneered to identify mechanisms by which the intestinal microbiota confers resistance to infection by Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE), antibiotic-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (arKp) and Clostridium difficile (C. diff). Aim 1 of our project is to establish a clinical database from the hospital recrds of allo-HSCT patients during their initial hospitalization that will include all laboratory values,vital signs, pharmacy data, dietary data, symptoms and physical exam findings. Aim 2 will expand our fecal bank by collecting fecal samples from approximately 160 allo-HSCT patients per year and determining the presence/absence of VRE, arKp and C. diff by culture and PCR. We will use NGS of 16S rRNA genes to determine microbiota composition on each sample, will perform metagenomic and RNA sequencing to determine the bacterial transcriptome and perform metabolomic analyses on a selected subset of fecal samples. Aim 3 is to extend our mathematical modeling to identify specific members of the microbiota, metabolic pathways and metabolic products that correlate with resistance to VRE or arKp expansion in the GI tract or are associated with resistance to C. diff infection. The clinical database will be used to establish correlations between clinical treatments or events and changes in the intestinal microbiota or the expression of bacterial metabolic pathways. Ultimately, the computational platforms developed in aim 3 will identify bacterial species or consortia that are associated with resistance to infection and Aim 4 will test these associations in germ-free mouse models. We will culture bacterial species associated with resistance, colonize mice with these protective bacteria and test for resistance against VRE, arKp and C. diff. Samples obtained from these experimental studies will be subjected to metagenomic and metabolomic analyses to further refine, in an iterative fashion, computational models developed in aim 3. Our proposed studies will develop new and extend existing computational models to identify bacterial species and molecular mechanisms that confer resistance to antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The normal bacteria inhabiting the human intestine provide a high level of resistance against antibiotic-resistant bacterial pathogens. We are investigating the intestinal flora of hospitalized patients and using mathematical modeling to identify bacterial species and their metabolic products that reduce the risk of infection by three prevalent antibiotic-resistant bacteria.

"Comprehensive analysis of human adaptive immune receptors to elucidate correlates of Epstein-Barr virus disease suppression Project Summary/Abstract This project will develop a new technological approach for the comprehensive analysis of adaptive immune responses, which holds the potential to catalyze new strategies to prevent and treat disease. Here we will apply immune profiling techniques recently invented by the PI to investigate the mechanisms of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) adaptive immune control in clinical cohorts of infected patients. EBV is a highly prevalent pathogen infecting >90% of the world’s population. Primary EBV infection often causes infectious mononucleosis (IM) and long-term sequelae include numerous malignancies, lymphoproliferative disorders, and a strong association with multiple sclerosis. No EBV vaccine is approved to date, and the molecular mechanisms of immune protection from EBV-associated diseases are unclear. Unfortunately, prior technical barriers in high- throughput immune profiling methods have prevented a comprehensive understanding of adaptive immune protection against EBV diseases. A technological approach that identifies the critical features of EBV immune protection will advance new solutions for vaccine and therapeutic development. Therefore, we developed an experimental pipeline to enable rapid and cost-effective analysis of B- and T-cell responses to EBV that is scalable to dozens of human patients per experiment. We hypothesize that a comprehensive B- and T-cell analysis of carefully selected patient cohorts that either can or cannot suppress symptomatic infection will reveal function-based correlates of EBV control. To test this hypothesis, we will apply quantitative immune profiling technologies to analyze cryopreserved longitudinal samples from recently completed prospective clinical studies of IM. Patient samples in our cohort span pre- and post-infection through convalescence and encompass the full range of clinical IM severity scores (from 0, asymptomatic primary infection, to 6, essentially bedridden with IM). Immune profile data will be used to establish adaptive immune correlates of IM disease severity. In addition, we will analyze immune responses in apparently immunocompetent patients with chronic active EBV (CAEBV) disease, or patients who do not adequately suppress EBV infection, to gain insight regarding adaptive immune function and dysfunction in CAEBV. Finally, we will develop a new computational toolkit to rapidly identify immune correlates from high-throughput datasets. Successful completion of this project will constitute the first comprehensive functional B- and T-cell receptor analysis in a human clinical cohort. Our efforts will provide a repertoire-scale, mechanistic understanding of adaptive immunity to EBV and suggest new strategies for treatment and prevention of EBV-associated diseases. Our long-term goal is to develop human immune profiling techniques as a platform approach to accelerate the rational design of vaccines and therapeutics against pathogens of high public health importance, beginning with EBV. Project Narrative This project will apply new high-throughput immune profiling technologies to elucidate the features of effective Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) immune control. EBV causes a range of human diseases including infectious mononucleosis and several forms of cancer; however, limited EBV treatment options are available and no approved preventive EBV vaccines exist.

The collaborative opportunities, intellectual environment and resources available to Dr. Farhat are outstanding. Research: Infectious diseases continue to be a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Despite the availability of effective antimicrobials, pathogens are successfully evolving new disease phenotypes that allow them to resist killing by these drugs or in other instances cause more severe disease manifestations or wider chains of transmission. Drug resistance (DR) is now common and some bacteria have even become resistant to multiple types or classes of antibiotics6. A key strategy in the fight against emerging pathogen phenotypes in infectious diseases is surveillance, and early personalized therapy to prevent transmission and propagation of these strains. The timely initiation of antibiotic therapy to which the pathogen is sensitive has been shown to be the key factor influencing treatment outcome for a diverse array of infections. Molecular tests that rely on the detection of microbial genetic mutations are particularly promising for surveillance and diagnosis of these pathogen phenotypes but rely on a comprehensive understanding of how mutations associate with these pathogen phenotypes. Currently there is an explosion of data on pathogen whole genome sequences (WGS) that is increasingly generated from clinical laboratories. Data on disease phenotype may also be available, but methods for the analysis and interpretation of these Big Data are lagging. Here I propose tools to aid in this analysis leveraging Big Data sets from Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) and my prior work. Specifically I propose to (1) develop a web-based public interface to several analysis tools, including a statistical learning model that can predict the MTB DR phenotype from its genomic sequence, (2) to develop and study an MTB gene-gene network, based on WGS data, to improve our understanding of the effect of mutation-mutation interactions on the DR phenotype, and (3) study the performance of methods in current use for the association of genotype and phenotype in pathogens, and develop a generalizable power calculator for the best performing method. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    Infectious agents of disease are successfully evolving drug resistance and other adaptations that threaten human health. Understanding the genetic mutations that underlie these disease phenotypes can inform surveillance and diagnostic strategies to combat this threat. Here I propose to develop accessible tools for pathogen genomic analysis that will help identify which genetic mutations are relevant to disease.",New Tools for the interpretation of Pathogen Genomic Data with a focus on Mycobacterium tuberculosis,9530648,K01ES026835,"['Affect', 'Antibiotic Therapy', 'Antibiotics', 'Area', 'Award', 'Bacteria', 'Big Data', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Biometry', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Complement', 'Consult', 'Critical Care', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Drug resistance', 'Drug resistance in tuberculosis', 'Drug-sensitive', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Explosion', 'Exposure to', 'Future', 'Gene Structure', 'General Hospitals', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Determinism', 'Genetic Epistasis', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Heritability', 'Human', 'Infection', 'Infectious Agent', 'Infectious Diseases Research', 'Institutes', 'International', 'Journals', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Laboratories', 'Leadership', 'Low income', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Massachusetts', 'Measures', 'Medical Genetics', 'Medicine', 'Mentored Research Scientist Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Microbial Genetics', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mutation', 'Mycobacterium tuberculosis', 'National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease', 'Nature', 'Network-based', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Peer Review', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Phylogeny', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Public Health', 'Public Health Schools', 'Publications', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Severity of illness', 'Social Medicine', 'Social Sciences', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Treatment outcome', 'Tuberculosis', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'Virulent', 'Work', 'Writing', 'analytical tool', 'antimicrobial', 'base', 'big biomedical data', 'burden of illness', 'career', 'combat', 'computer science', 'design', 'disease phenotype', 'experience', 'fight against', 'gene interaction', 'genome sequencing', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'global health', 'improved', 'instructor', 'medical schools', 'microbial', 'microbial genome', 'mortality', 'pathogen', 'pathogen genome', 'personalized medicine', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'simulation', 'skills', 'tenure track', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'whole genome']",NIEHS,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,K01,2018,220530,0.013487820994266347
"UVPD-MS Characterization of Lipopolysaccharides Abstract. Gram-negative bacteria have caused many of the most persistent infections as well as some of the deadliest pandemics in the world. Some strains have developed resistant to all available drugs, thus leading to increasing mortality from previously treatable bacterial infections. The National Strategy for Combating Antibiotic-Resistant Bacteria released by the White House in September 2014 focused on the need for (i) advancing the development of methods for identification and characterization of bacteria, (ii) accelerating basic research for new antibiotics, and (iii) improving capabilities for surveillance of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. This proposal focuses on the development of innovative tandem mass spectrometry approaches for characterization of lipopolysaccharides (LPS), the primary constituent of the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria that protects the membrane from chemical attack and is recognized by the immune system during pathogenic invasion. Structural characterization of LPS is critical to understanding how the structure of LPS influences immune stimulation as well as facilitating development of new antimicrobials and vaccines. This is a significant analytical challenge due to the branched structures and amphipathic properties of LPS. The escalating concerns about antibiotic resistance bacteria and the need for better avenues of defense against infectious diseases have motivated the proposed work. The objectives of this proposal are: Aim 1: Development of ultraviolet photodissociation (UVPD) mass spectrometry via hierarchical, decision-tree workflows for top-down characterization of LPS to facilitate high throughput analysis; Aim 2: Development of MS/MS approaches for serotyping of Gram-negative bacteria based on LPS; Aim 3: Examination of peptide/LPS interactions via native-spray mass spectrometry to provide both mechanistic information and screening capabilities for new antimicrobials, and Aim 4: Applications to a variety of structural problems related to the biosynthesis of LPS in Gram- negative bacteria and characterization of hybrid O-antigen/lipid A molecules in vesicle-based vaccines.  We have established a new collaboration with Dr. Bryan Davies' group to develop mass spectrometry methods to characterize peptide/lipid A interactions in support of the hunt for better antimicrobials. The continued collaboration with Dr. Stephen Trent's group emphasizes: (i) approaches for deciphering the biosynthetic pathways of bacterial LPS that endow them with the remarkable ability to re-design their outer membranes and develop antibiotic resistance, and (ii) innovative vaccine design based on antigenic LPS in vesicles.    Narrative: Gram-negative bacteria are responsible for some of the deadliest and more widespread pandemics in the world. The proposed work focuses on the development of advanced mass spectrometry approaches for characterization of complex lipopolysaccharides, including the endotoxic lipid A domains, that comprise the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria.

"Multi-level modeling to inform interventions for control of multidrug-resistant organisms within healthcare networks Project Summary/Abstract Multidrug-resistant organisms (MDROs), particularly carbapenem-resistant organisms (CROs), are a major cause of healthcare-associated infections (HAIs). Though studies have found multiple interventions addressing MDRO colonization and transmission to be effective at reducing HAIs, implementation has lagged due to questions regarding the most efficacious combination of interventions. As healthcare facilities (e.g., hospitals, long-term care facilities, or outpatient surgical centers and clinics) are part of an interconnected healthcare network, evaluation of an intervention’s impact on transmission and infection must consider the dynamics across the healthcare system. To address remaining knowledge gaps regarding the most effective combinations of intervention strategies, we will build a multi-level model that spans from individual patients to regionally interconnected healthcare facilities. The resulting framework will provide hospital administrators and infection control experts with tools for quantifying individual patient risk factors for colonization and infection and for comparing the potential effectiveness of interventions to control HAIs. The aims of the project are: (1) to develop models to estimate the underlying prevalence and incidence of CROs and predict which patients are at highest risk for colonization and infection with CROs using clinical samples collected during the normal course of care; (2) to utilize hospital-level models to quantify the combinatorial relationship between, and marginal impact of, additional interventions to reduce HAIs; and (3) to build a regional model of a healthcare system to examine the effectiveness of interventions across institutions. Models will start with the patient at the center, utilizing the rich covariate data stored in electronic medical records to develop prediction models based on advanced machine learning. These prediction models will be translatable tools that can be directly incorporated into clinical care to assist clinicians in preventing HAIs. In addition, they will form the foundation of hospital-level models that will allow for detailed examinations of the effectiveness of different combinations of interventions. Hospital-level models will then be embedded in a network of healthcare facilities that accounts for the differing incentives faced by geographically dispersed facilities with variable demographic populations. These models will directly inform CDC guidelines about MDRO prevention and aid clinicians in reducing the risk of HAIs. Project Narrative The models developed through this proposal will improve understanding of how biological factors associated with the transmission of multidrug-resistant organisms (MDRO) impact interventions to reduce hospital-associated infections (HAIs). This will aid predictions of patients’ risk for colonization and infection, as well as improve understanding of how interventions can most effectively be combined to reduce the likelihood that patients will suffer from these high-consequence pathogens.",Multi-level modeling to inform interventions for control of multidrug-resistant organisms within healthcare networks,9535814,U01CK000536,[' '],NCEZID,"CENTER/ DISEASE DYNAMICS, ECONOM/POLICY",U01,2018,649871,0.012948549806404147
"Identification of postoperative infections using electronic health record and administrative claims data Project Summary/Abstract Surgical operations can put patients at high risk of infections and other complications. However, studies have shown that half or more of surgical infections are discovered after hospital discharge. The American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (ACS NSQIP) began in 2005 with the goal of assisting hospitals with identifying and preventing surgical complications. Each participating ACS NSQIP hospital assigns a surgical clinical nurse reviewer to collect preoperative through 30-day postoperative data on a sample of surgical patients in order to risk adjust postoperative complications so that they can be compared across participating hospitals. Although at large volume hospitals these samples might represent only 10-15% of all surgical cases, these data are considered to be the current gold standard for accurate identification and comparison of postoperative complications. Unfortunately, chart review is time-consuming and costly and, as a result, cannot be scaled up easily to cover all surgical patients. The goal of this project is to learn from the ACS NSQIP data in order to develop electronic algorithms for identifying postoperative infections that can be scaled up easily and inexpensively. Development of such algorithms will also permit evaluation of interventions that intend to impact large populations of patients at risk of postoperative infections. Considering the large number of available binary classification algorithms for data mining that are easy to implement, it is paramount to consider new methods for identifying surgical infections electronically. Furthermore, postoperative infections are rare, and occur in about 7% of operated patients; therefore, it is difficult to identify models that classify infections well. Sampling techniques are commonly used in conjunction with classification models in order to improve sensitivity and positive predictive value. We believe that modern statistical techniques for classification combined with strategic sampling, and the use of ICD9 and ICD10 codes and pharmacy data, will improve upon existing methods for electronically identifying postoperative infections. The aims of this proposal are (1a) to develop algorithms for identifying surgical infections using machine learning techniques, (1b) to develop models for specific types of postoperative infections collected in the ACS NSQIP data separately, which include SSI, urinary tract infection, pneumonia and sepsis and (2) to validate these models in prospective ACS NSQIP data. Project Narrative In this application, we propose to use outcomes data from the University of Colorado American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program combined with electronic health record and administrative claims data in order to develop models for identifying postoperative infections electronically. These infections are currently identified through manual chart review, and it is our hope that successful development of these models could replace costly, time-consuming manual chart review. We will use machine learning and sampling techniques to achieve better performance than models previously reported in the literature.",Identification of postoperative infections using electronic health record and administrative claims data,9505567,R03HS026019,[' '],AHRQ,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,R03,2018,48771,0.02493791360936649

"Genome Based Influenza Vaccine Strain Selection  using Machine Learning ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Influenza A virus causes both pandemic and seasonal outbreaks, leading to loss of from thousands to millions of human lives within a short time period. Vaccination is the best option to prevent and minimize the effects of influenza outbreaks. Rapid selection of a well-matched influenza vaccine strain is the key to developing an effective vaccination program. However, this is a non-trivial task due to three major challenges in influenza vaccine strain selection: labor an time intensive virus isolation and serology-based antigenic characterization, poor growth of selected strains in chicken embryonic eggs during production, and biased sampling in influenza surveillance. Each year, many scientists worldwide, including thousands from the United States, are working altogether to select an optimal vaccine strain. However, incorrect vaccine strains have still been frequently chosen in the past decades.  Recent advances in genomic sequencing allow us to rapidly and economically sequence influenza genomes from the isolates and from the clinical samples. Sequencing influenza genomes has become a routine and important component in influenza surveillance. The objectives of this project are to develop a sequence-based strategy for influenza antigenic variant identification and to optimize vaccine strain selection using genomic data. To achieve these aims, we will develop machine learning based computational methods to estimate antigenic distances among influenza viruses by directly using their genome sequences. We will then identify the key residues and mutations in influenza genomes affecting influenza antigenic drift events. Such information will allow us to select most promising virus strains as candidates for vaccine production. Since economical virus production requires the selected virus strains to grow easily in chicken embryonic eggs, we also propose the development of a machine learning based method that can predict the growth ability of a virus strain based on its sequence information. This integrated genome based influenza vaccine strain selection system will be developed for detecting antigenic variants for influenza A viruses.  This project will help us provide fundamental technology that employs genomic signatures determining influenza antigenicity and growth ability in chicken embryonic eggs, which are the two key issues for efficient and effective influenza vaccine strain development. The resulting genome based vaccine strain selection strategy will significantly reduce the human labor needed for serological characterization, decrease the time required to select an effective strain that will grow well in eggs, and increase the likelihood of correct influenza vaccine candidate selection. Thus, this project will lead to significant technological advances in influenza prevention and control.

"Statistical methods for real-time forecasts of infectious disease: dynamic time-series and machine learning approaches PROJECT SUMMARY The past decade of biomedical research has borne witness to rapid growth in data and computational methods. A fundamental challenge for the scientific community in the 21st century is learning how to turn this deluge of data into evidence that can inform decision-making about improving health and preventing illness at the individual and population levels. The emerging field of real-time infectious disease forecasting is a prime example of a research area with great potential for leveraging modern analytical methods to maximize the impact on public health. Infectious diseases exact an enormous toll on global health each year. Improved real- time forecasts of infectious disease outbreaks can inform targeted intervention and prevention strategies, such as increased healthcare staffing or vector control measures. However we currently have a limited understanding of the best ways to integrate these types of forecasts into real-time public health decision- making. The central research activities of this project are (1) to develop and validate a suite of robust, real-time statistical prediction models for infectious diseases, (2) we will develop and evaluate an ensemble time-series prediction methodology for integrating multiple prediction models into a single forecast, and (3) to develop a collaborative platform for dissemination and evaluation of predictions by different research teams. Additionally, we will develop a suite of open-source educational modules to train researchers and public health officials in developing, validating, and implementing time-series forecasting, with a focus on real-time infectious disease applications.

"Vaccine Beliefs and Decision Making Project Summary This project will use methods from quantitative anthropology to describe the social space of vaccine beliefs that circulate among the general public and to provide an initial assessment of how different belief variations influence decisions to vaccinate. The results will establish, for the first time, the patterns of co-variation in the wide variety of pro- and anti- vaccine beliefs, and which axes of this variation appear associated with decisions to vaccinate. Vaccination is a key public health defense against infectious disease, but the lay public largely does not fully appreciate scientific evidence when making decisions for or against vaccination. Understanding the inter-correlations of these beliefs, therefore, is imperative for designing effective educational interventions that can directly interface with the cultural beliefs that surround vaccination and influence the public's decision making on this issue. The project will leverage insights from two very different but complementary data sources: responses to a nationally representative survey (fielded on the RAND American Life Panel) and social media data from Twitter. Our analytic approach will begin with systematic coding techniques from mixed-methods research to classify vaccine beliefs into a comprehensive set of belief variants. Manual coding will be validated through inter-observer reliability checks and replicated at scale with machine-learning algorithms. Having systematically coded the data, we will then assess whether nationally representative survey data and data mined from Twitter produce similar results using Cultural Consensus Analysis, a technique from quantitative cultural anthropology. From the survey data we will test whether vaccine beliefs are correlated with decisions to vaccinate after controlling for demographic attributes. To ensure completion of this innovative and methodologically expansive project, the project team combines expertise from anthropology, decision science, clinical medicine, and biomathematics. The principal investigator brings to this project multiple years of both academic and industry experience in statistical modelling of cultural data. Project Narrative Vaccination is a key public health defense against infectious disease, but patients' vaccination decisions may be more influenced by broadly circulated cultural beliefs than they are influenced by scientific evidence. This proposed research will systematically map the diversity of the publics' vaccination beliefs, assess how these beliefs influence vaccination decisions, and advise policy makers how to interface more directly with these popular belief systems that are critical to effective vaccination efforts.",Vaccine Beliefs and Decision Making,9241259,R21HD087749,"['Achievement', 'Adolescent', 'Adopted', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Anthropology', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Behavior', 'Belief', 'Belief System', 'Childhood', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Code', 'Cognitive', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Consensus', 'Cultural Anthropology', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Decision Making', 'Disease', 'Educational Intervention', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Fright', 'General Population', 'Health Communication', 'Health behavior', 'Immunization', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Measles', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Parents', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Policies', 'Policy Maker', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Principal Investigator', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Resistance', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Survey Methodology', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States', 'Vaccinated', 'Vaccination', 'Vaccines', 'Variant', 'Work', 'authority', 'biomathematics', 'cognitive process', 'design', 'efficacy testing', 'experience', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'prevent', 'response', 'social', 'social media', 'social space', 'theories', 'therapy design', 'vaccine safety']",NICHD,RAND CORPORATION,R21,2017,239723,-0.02775409966800947
"Enhanced Detection System for Healthcare-Associated Transmission of Infection ABSTRACT Despite recent progress in reducing the incidence of healthcare-associated infections (HAIs), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimated that 722,000 HAIs occurred in U.S. acute care hospitals in 2011, resulting in 75,000 deaths. Current methods for detecting outbreaks in hospitals are rudimentary and likely to miss some outbreaks altogether and result in substantial delays in detection of others. There are two major developments in healthcare that have the potential to revolutionize how healthcare associated outbreaks of bacterial pathogens are identified and controlled in hospitals. First, the Affordable Care Act mandates use of the electronic medical record (EMR), which has led to its widespread use in healthcare. Second, the costs of bacterial whole genome sequencing (WGS) have declined substantially, which is making its use by infection programs increasingly feasible. In this application, we propose to establish and evaluate the impact of the Enhanced Detection System for Healthcare Association Transmission (EDS-HAT) at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC). EDS-HAT uses a combination of WGS and analysis of the EMR for enhanced outbreak detection. Our specific aims are to 1a): Determine the utility of EDS-HAT to identify HAT that is not identified through routine infection prevention practice, 1b): Improve the efficiency and reduce the cost of EDS-HAT by using the EMR to restrict the use of WGS, 2a): Measure reductions in HAIs following implementation of EDS-HAT, and 2b): Estimate the number of infections and deaths prevented and healthcare costs averted by EDS-HAT. For Aim 1a, EDS-HAT will be performed retrospectively while routine infection prevention practice (requests for molecular typing when an outbreak is suspected) continues, thus allowing a direct comparison of the two approaches. For Aim 1b, we will improve the efficiency and reduce the cost of EDS-HAT by using machine learning and data mining of the EMR to select isolates for WGS. For Aim 2a, we will monitor changes in HAI rates both before and after implementation of EDS-HAT in real time, which will occur at the beginning of year 3. Finally, for Aim 2b, we will perform clinical and budget impact analyses to determine the overall impact of EDS-HAT. To accomplish these aims, we have assembled a team with expertise in infectious diseases, outbreak investigation, infection prevention, microbial genomics and genomic epidemiology, machine learning and data mining, economic analysis and modeling, epidemiology, and biostatistics. EDS-HAT will likely lead to substantial reductions in infections, deaths, and healthcare costs and can serve as a model for how HAT is detected in hospitals. PROJECT NARRATIVE Outbreak detection in most hospitals uses outdated methods. The declining costs of whole genome sequencing (WGS) of bacterial pathogens and the wide-spread use of the electronic medical record (EMR) provide a unique opportunity to enhance outbreak detection in hospitals and therefore reduce the number of infections. Accordingly, we propose to establish the Enhanced Detection System for Healthcare Association Transmission (EDS-HAT), which uses routine WGS of bacterial pathogens and machine learning and data mining of the EMR to dramatically increase capacity to detect healthcare-associated outbreaks.",Enhanced Detection System for Healthcare-Associated Transmission of Infection,9357523,R01AI127472,"['Acinetobacter baumannii', 'Acute', 'Affordable Care Act', 'Bacterial Infections', 'Biometry', 'Budgets', 'Caring', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Cessation of life', 'Charge', 'Clinical', 'Clostridium difficile', 'Code', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Cost Savings', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Economics', 'Enterobacter aerogenes bacterium', 'Enterobacter cloacae', 'Enterococcus faecalis', 'Enterococcus faecium', 'Epidemiology', 'Escherichia coli', 'Event', 'Exposure to', 'Extended-spectrum β-lactamase', 'Genomics', 'Geographic Locations', 'Health Care Costs', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hospitals', 'Incidence', 'Infection', 'Infection prevention', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Investigation', 'Klebsiella pneumonia bacterium', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Microbiology', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Nosocomial Infections', 'Patients', 'Period Analysis', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Presbyterian Church', 'Prevention', 'Prevention program', 'Procedures', 'Pseudomonas aeruginosa', 'Records', 'Research', 'Source', 'Time', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Vancomycin resistant enterococcus', 'base', 'cost', 'data mining', 'disorder prevention', 'enteric pathogen', 'foodborne outbreak', 'genome analysis', 'genome sequencing', 'genomic epidemiology', 'improved', 'innovation', 'meetings', 'methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus', 'microbial', 'pathogen', 'prevent', 'programs', 'prospective', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'virtual', 'whole genome']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2017,725048,0.047270506818474146
"Effects of Host Metabolic Variation on Antibiotic Susceptibility ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Host variation affects the pathogenicity of, susceptibility to, and recovery from infectious diseases. Elucidating how the host environment alters antibiotic susceptibility is therefore a critical step towards the long-term goal of realizig precision medicine for the clinical management of infectious diseases. The overall objective of this project is to identify the metabolic pathways participating in antibiotic susceptibility and t determine how host metabolism may affect antibiotic treatments at the site of infection. The working hypothesis is that metabolic processes can function as bacterial control mechanisms for antibiotic susceptibility and that the host metabolome can act on these processes to affect the outcome of antibiotic treatment. This hypothesis will be tested in three specific aims: (1) identif metabolic pathways involved in antibiotic susceptibility (K99 phase); (2) characterize changes in the host metabolome elicited by antibiotic administration (K99 phase); (3) evaluate effects of the host metabolome on antibiotic killing (R00 phase). During the mentored K99 phase, bactericidal antibiotics will be counterscreened with various metabolites to identify metabolic perturbations that can affect antibiotic susceptibility. Metabolic pathways contributing to antibiotic lethality ill be identified by combining this data with metabolic modeling and machine learning. Additionally, plasma and peritoneal fluid will be sampled and metabolomically profiled from a mouse peritoneal infection model, with and without antibiotic treatment. These profiles will be used to determine if antibiotics can alter the host metabolism in ways that may affect antibiotic susceptibility at the site of infection. During the independent R00 phase, the effects of host metabolic variation on antibiotic killing will be systematically tested by quantifying antibiotic susceptibility in synthesized media defined by metabolomic profiles from published and measured human and mouse plasma samples. A better understanding of how the host metabolic environment participates in antibiotic treatment fits NIH's public health mission and has direct implications for the clinical management of infectious diseases. Work from the proposed studies will form a quantitative framework for directly evaluating how host metabolism may affect antibiotic treatment outcomes and guide improved antibiotic stewardship in clinical practice. Although the applicant has significant expertise in systems biology, this award will provide the applicant research training to gain new experimental skills and an opportunity for continued career training and mentorship from an advisory committee comprised of international leaders in systems biology, metabolomics, chemical biology and infectious diseases. The support and training provided by this award and by the advisory committee will provide the applicant tools and expertise critical to his future independent research program. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE (provided by applicant): Host variation alters the clinical response to antibiotic treatment for infectious disease, but the pathways underlying differences in patient outcome have not yet all been elucidated. The proposed research is relevant to public health because it is the first systematic investigation of how host metabolites may act on bacterial pathogen metabolism and alter antibiotic susceptibility. This work is relevant to NIH's public health mission by providing a quantitative framework for establishing precision medicine for the treatment of infectious diseases.",Effects of Host Metabolic Variation on Antibiotic Susceptibility,9355203,K99GM118907,"['Adjuvant', 'Advisory Committees', 'Affect', 'Antibiotic Resistance', 'Antibiotic Therapy', 'Antibiotic susceptibility', 'Antibiotics', 'Award', 'Bacteria', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Biology', 'C57BL/6 Mouse', 'Carbon', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Chemicals', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Culture Media', 'Data', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease Pathway', 'Disease Resistance', 'Environment', 'Escherichia coli', 'Formulation', 'Future', 'Germ-Free', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Human', 'Immunity', 'In Vitro', 'Infection', 'Innovative Therapy', 'International', 'Investigation', 'Knock-out', 'Knowledge', 'Light', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Pathway', 'Metabolism', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Nitrogen', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Peritoneal', 'Peritoneal Fluid', 'Peritoneal lavage', 'Phase', 'Phosphorus', 'Plasma', 'Predisposition', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Research Training', 'Sampling', 'Serum', 'Site', 'Source', 'Sulfur', 'Supplementation', 'Symbiosis', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'Virulence', 'Work', 'bacterial metabolism', 'bactericide', 'base', 'biological adaptation to stress', 'career', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'counterscreen', 'desensitization', 'genome-wide', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'infectious disease treatment', 'insight', 'killings', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'microbial', 'microbiota', 'novel therapeutics', 'overexpression', 'pathogen', 'precision medicine', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'respiratory', 'response', 'skills', 'tool', 'treatment strategy']",NIGMS,MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,K99,2017,87929,0.05951414856600832
"New Serological Measures of Infectious Disease Transmission Intensity ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Candidate: Benjamin Arnold    I am an epidemiologist at the University of California, Berkeley. I completed my MA in Biostatistics and a PhD in Epidemiology from UC Berkeley in 2009. Since then, I have worked as an epidemiologist in Professor Jack Colford's group. The opportunity to work as the coordinating epidemiologist for a touchstone, multi-country cluster randomized trial - combined with the addition of two children to my family - led me to delay my academic career. I am now ready to restart my career progress toward independent investigator status.     My long-term career goal is to become a leader in the application of novel statistical methods to target and evaluate interventions that reduce the burden of enteric infections and neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) in low-income countries. This research focus and career objective build from my experience and from a growing collaboration with Dr. Patrick Lammie at the US Centers for Disease Control (CDC) that started in 2013 and has introduced me to seroepidemiologic research. My background in epidemiologic methods, biostatistics, and international field research makes me uniquely qualified to make significant contributions to infectious disease epidemiology at the interface between recent advances in statistical methodology and serological assays.    Environment: University of California, Berkeley    To achieve my career goal, I have developed a training and mentoring plan that focuses on recent advances in statistics (semi-parametric estimation theory and machine learning) and on infectious disease immunology. These are two areas where additional training will open up significant and unique opportunities for me to make meaningful contributions to seroepidemiologic research, and will enable me to launch an independent career as a productive faculty member at UC Berkeley.    I have assembled a multidisciplinary mentoring team of senior investigators in biostatistics and immunology to support my training, research, and career objectives. Mark van der Laan (primary mentor, biostatistics) will guide my training in semi-parametric methods and machine learning. Alan Hubbard (co-mentor, biostatistics) will guide my translation of the methodology to applications for enteric pathogens and NTDs. Patrick Lammie (co-mentor at CDC, immunology) will guide my immunology training and research with his expertise in the immunology of enteric pathogens and NTDs    Research: New Serological Measures of Infectious Disease Transmission    Background: Recent advances in multiplex antigen assays have led to the development of low-cost and sensitive methods to measure enteric pathogens and neglected tropical diseases (NTDs). There have not been commensurate advances in the statistical methods used to derive measures of transmission intensity from antibody response. Translating antibody response into metrics of transmission intensity is a key step from a public health perspective because it enables us to target intervention programs to the populations most in need and then measure the effectiveness of those programs.     Aims and Methods: The overarching goal of this research is to develop a methodologic framework to translate antibody response measured in cross-sectional surveys into measures of transmission intensity for enteric pathogens (7 included in the study, e.g., Cryptosporidium parvum, enterotoxigenic E. coli) and neglected tropical diseases (principal focus: lymphatic filariasis). We approach this goal from two novel perspectives. In Aim 1, we draw on the ""peak shift"" phenomenon for infectious diseases, and hypothesize that changes in transmission will be detectable in the age-specific antibody response curve. At lower transmission, antibody levels should decline across all ages due to fewer and less frequent active infections, leading to an overall shift in the age-specific response curve. We will evaluate the approach by comparing antibody response curves for young children with different exposures (improved vs. unimproved drinking water for enteric pathogens; pre- versus post- mass drug administration for lymphatic filariasis) in large, well characterized cohorts in Kenya, Tanzania, and Haiti.     In Aim 2, we will develop semi-parametric methods to estimate the force of infection (seroconversion rate) from seroprevalence data for pathogens where seroreversion is possible, using lymphatic filariasis as an example. Our new approach marks a significant advance over previous work in this area by making few modeling assumptions and by allowing for the flexible control of confounding between comparison groups. We will evaluate the approach in Haiti by measuring the effect of mass drug administration on the force of infection for lymphatic filariasis For all of the methods, we will create user-friendly, open source software to accelerate translation to applied research.     The Future: This mentored training and research plan represents a natural next step for me on a productive and collaborative path to independence at UC Berkeley. It will set the stage for a broader R01-level research portfolio that applies the newly developed methods to primary research studies that evaluate the impact of interventions on enteric infections, and help target and monitor global elimination efforts for NTDs. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Antibodies measured in blood provide a sensitive measure of infection for many infectious diseases. Statistical methods that enable us to measure disease transmission intensity at the population level from blood antibody levels are an important tool for public health efforts because they help identify populations in greatest need of intervention and help measure the effectiveness of interventions designed to reduce transmission. No statistical tools like this exist for enteric pathogens (those that cause diarrhea) and neglected tropical diseases, which together cause an immense health burden among the world's poorest people, and so we propose to develop new methods to measure population-level transmission intensity of these diseases based on antibodies measured in blood from children in Kenya, Tanzania, and Haiti.",New Serological Measures of Infectious Disease Transmission Intensity,9275314,K01AI119180,"['Age', 'Antibodies', 'Antibody Response', 'Antigens', 'Applied Research', 'Area', 'Biological Assay', 'Biometry', 'Blood', 'California', 'Campylobacter', 'Caregivers', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Child', 'Cluster randomized trial', 'Collaborations', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Computer software', 'Country', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Cryptosporidium', 'Cryptosporidium parvum', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Diarrhea', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Entamoeba histolytica', 'Enteral', 'Environment', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Epidemiologist', 'Epidemiology', 'Faculty', 'Family', 'Filarial Elephantiases', 'Future', 'Giardia', 'Goals', 'Haiti', 'Handwashing', 'Health', 'Immune response', 'Immunologist', 'Immunology', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Infectious Disease Epidemiology', 'Infectious Disease Immunology', 'Infectious Diseases Research', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Kenya', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measles', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Mumps', 'Outcome', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Play', 'Population', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Rubella', 'Running', 'Salmonella', 'Sanitation', 'Serological', 'Seroprevalences', 'Source', 'Spottings', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Survival Analysis', 'Tanzania', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Universities', 'Vibrio cholerae', 'Viral', 'Water', 'Work', 'base', 'career', 'cohort', 'comparison group', 'cost', 'disease transmission', 'drinking water', 'effectiveness measure', 'enteric pathogen', 'enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'high risk population', 'improved', 'intervention effect', 'intervention program', 'low income country', 'member', 'multidisciplinary', 'neglected tropical diseases', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'open source', 'pathogen', 'professor', 'programs', 'public health intervention', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'response', 'semiparametric', 'seroconversion', 'seropositive', 'skills', 'statistics', 'theories', 'therapy design', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'user-friendly']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,K01,2017,142177,0.05286467334922849
"Models for synthesising molecular, clinical and epidemiological data, and transla DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A mathematical or computational model of infectious disease transmission represents the process of how an infection spreads from one person to another. Such models have a long history within infectious disease epidemiology, and are useful tools for giving insight into the dynamics of epidemics and for evaluating the potential effect of control methods. The overall objective of this project is to substantially improve the methods by which models of infectious diseases transmission are calibrated against biological and disease surveillance data. This will both improve the utility of models as tools for analyzing data on infectious disease outbreaks (for instance to provide more rapid and reliable estimates of how transmissible and lethal a new virus is to public health agencies) and also improve the reliability of models as tools for predicting the likely effect of different interventions (such as vaccines or case isolation) to help policy makers make more informed decisions about control policies. As with many areas of biology and medicine, the data landscape for infectious diseases modeling is changing rapidly. Larger and more complex datasets are becoming available that cover many different aspects of the interaction between a pathogen and the human population: clinical episode data, genetic data about fast-evolving pathogens; animal-model transmission data and community-based representative serological data. The specific aims of our project are to: (a) develop new machine-learning based methods to discover interesting patterns in complex datasets related to the transmission of infectious disease, so as to better specify subsequent mechanistic mathematical or computational models; (b) derive new approaches for using more than one type of data simultaneously to calibrate transmission models and (c) derive new methods of parameter estimation for simulations which model the spatial spread of infection or model both the transmission and genetic evolution of a pathogen. We will achieve these aims in the applied context of research on three key infections: emerging infectious diseases (such as MERS-CoV - the novel coronavirus currently spreading in the Middle East), influenza and Streptococcus pneumonia (a major bacterial pathogen). Examples of the scientific questions we will address that cannot be answered with current methods are: (i) how many unobserved cases of MERS-CoV have occurred so far (to be answered using data on case clusters data, the spatial distribution of cases and viral genetic sequences)? (ii) how many people in different age groups are infected with influenza each year and how does their immune system respond to infection (to be answered using data on case incidence and serological testing of the population)? (iii) how much is vaccination coupled with prescribing practices influencing the emergence of resistant strains of pneumococcus (to be addressed with data on antibiotic and vaccine use, case incidence and bacterial strain frequency)? PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Mathematical and computational models of infectious disease spread can provide valuable information to aid policy-makers in the tough choices they face when trying to control infectious diseases, but models must be designed to make the best possible use of the often limited data available. As the digital footprints of our lives grow, so te datasets available for infectious disease models become larger and more complex. This project will develop new algorithms and methods to allow models to make better use of all available data and therefore better inform control policy planning for diseases such as: influenza, pneumococcal infection and novel viruses like MERS-CoV.","Models for synthesising molecular, clinical and epidemiological data, and transla",9279143,U01GM110721,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Antibiotics', 'Antigenic Variation', 'Area', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Coronaviridae', 'Coronavirus', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Economics', 'Emerging Communicable Diseases', 'Epidemic', 'Epidemiology', 'Evolution', 'Face', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Generations', 'Generic Drugs', 'Genetic', 'Genotype', 'Hospitalization', 'Human', 'Immune system', 'Immunological Models', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Infectious Disease Epidemiology', 'Influenza', 'Influenza A virus', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Medicine', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Middle East', 'Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Monte Carlo Method', 'Movement', 'Natural History', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Phenotype', 'Pneumococcal Infections', 'Policies', 'Policy Maker', 'Population', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Serologic tests', 'Serological', 'Shapes', 'Site', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Specificity', 'Stream', 'Streptococcus pneumoniae', 'Syndrome', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Vaccination', 'Vaccines', 'Variant', 'Virus', 'Work', 'age group', 'algorithmic methodologies', 'base', 'contextual factors', 'data exchange', 'data mining', 'design', 'digital', 'disease natural history', 'disease transmission', 'epidemiologic data', 'epidemiological model', 'forest', 'genetic evolution', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'infectious disease model', 'innovation', 'insight', 'mathematical model', 'meetings', 'mortality', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'novel virus', 'pandemic influenza', 'pathogen', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive tools', 'public health relevance', 'resistant strain', 'seasonal influenza', 'simulation', 'social', 'surveillance data', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'virus genetics']",NIGMS,U OF L IMPERIAL COL OF SCI/TECHNLGY/MED,U01,2017,202814,0.06874227544925647
"Repurposing pyronaridine as a treatment for Chagas disease Summary Neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) are a diverse group of diseases with distinct characteristics that thrive mainly among the poorest populations of the world. There are 17 NTDs prioritized by the World Health Organization which are endemic in 149 countries and affect more than 1.4 billion people globally, which costs these developing economies billions of dollars annually. The neglected tropical diseases result from four different causative pathogens: protozoa, bacteria, helminth and virus. The majority of the diseases lack effective treatments. For example, 6 to 7 million people in Latin America are infected with the eukaryotic parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, the causative agent of Chagas disease. This disease is gaining recognition as an emerging infection in the United States where an estimated 300,000 people may be infected. Chagas disease has a serious economic impact on the United States and the world. The cost of treatment in the United States alone, where the disease is not indigenous, is estimated to be $900 million annually, which includes hospitalization and medical devices such as pacemakers. The global cost is estimated at $7 billion. Unfortunately, there are no FDA approved treatments for Chagas disease and the two available treatments used outside the U.S. have toxic side effects. New therapeutics for Chagas disease and the other NTDs are desperately needed. Using a machine learning model based on published data for compounds tested against T. cruzi we have identified the EU-approved antimalarial pyronaridine as particularly active in vitro and in vivo with statistically significant efficacy in a 4-day mouse model of infection with a T. cruzi strain expressing firefly luciferase. Pyronaridine demonstrated 85.2% parasite reduction after 4 days treatment, and is known to have a long half-life in humans (13.2 days), promising toxicity profile (less toxic than chloroquine in malaria treatment) and may suggest a drug repurposing opportunity for further study. We propose in this project to determine the minimum effective dose (treatment regimen) for pyronaridine in the acute model of Chagas disease. We will also determine efficacy in the chronic phase of Chagas disease (sterile cure). We will pursue combination therapy DMPK profiling as well as performing combination therapy in vivo efficacy in chronic model of Chagas disease. The results will enable us to assess whether this EU approved drug is worthy of a clinical trial for Chagas disease in the UH3 stage. If successful we will design a clinical study and recruit patients for a phase II trial. This grant represents a unique opportunity to partner the Center for Discovery and Innovation in Parasitic Diseases (www.cdipd.org) at UCSD and the University of Sao Paulo in Brazil with Collaborations Pharmaceuticals Inc. Narrative Approximately 6 to 7 million people in Latin America are infected with the eukaryotic parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, the causative agent of the deadly Chagas disease. This disease is gaining recognition as an emerging infection in the United States where an estimated 300,000 people may be infected and there is no FDA approved treatment. The antimalarial pyronaridine was recently identified by our groups using computational Bayesian repurposing methods and was confirmed as active when tested in vitro and in vivo in the acute mouse model of Chagas disease. We now propose in the UH2 stage to determine: the minimum effective dose in the acute model of Chagas disease and efficacy in the chronic phase while also assessing potential for combination therapy.

"Systems Biology Approach to Redefine Susceptibility Testing and Treatment of MDR Pathogens in the Context of Host Immunity   Project Summary    For something as complex and multifaceted as bacterial antibiotic resistance (AR), our drug evaluation  paradigm is strikingly narrow and homogenous: MIC/MBC testing in standardized bacteriologic media. We  have shown that this drug evaluation paradigm is inadequate, even misleading, as changes in the media  conditions of the procedure lead to dramatically different results. A more holistic definition of antibiotic therapy  that centers on understanding antibiotic activity in synergy with host innate immune factors such as cationic  antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), serum and phagocytic cells (e.g. neutrophils) reveals therapeutic options

systems biology approaches and inform more effective antibiotic utilization in the context of host innate  immunity. We propose to: 1) build an iterative systems biology workflow that integrates multiple experimental  and computational approaches to give a comprehensive assessment of AR; and 2) apply this workflow to high  priority pathogens to systematically elucidate AR mechanisms and their condition­dependency. The iterative  workflow includes: (i) omics and physiological data generation.  Clinically isolated strains of the selected  pathogens will be grown under conventional testing (bacteriologic media) and more physiologic conditions  (tissue culture media, serum, and in presence of AMPs and neutrophils) to probe for advantageous gain of  activity.  The omics data types collected are: DNA resequencing, RNAseq, and metabolomics.  (ii)  Bioinformatics and data modeling analysis involves three approaches: big data analysis for data set  dimensionality and coarse grained variable dependencies assessment, genome­scale modeling for  mechanistic elucidation and analysis, and machine learning that uses AR­related metadata to classify the  overall biological functions. This analysis will lead to understanding of AR mechanisms.  (iii) Multi­scale  validation from animal models, to laboratory evolution, to cytology, to gene expression alteration, to structural  protein analysis of putative targets. The validation thus ranges from host behavior to atomistic detail of  ligand­target interactions. The iterative loop then closes, comparing computational prediction to experimental  outcomes. False­negative and false­positive predictions are then algorithmically analyzed by a hypothesis  generating family of algorithms that then makes suggestions about what conditions to use in the next iteration  of the loop.  The pathogens that we will focus on are methicillin­resistant ​Staphylococcus aureus ​(MRSA), the  carbapenem­resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) Klebsiella ​pneumoniae ​and ​Acinetobacter baumannii,​ and  Pseudomonas aeruginosa​. The team of investigators has made the foundational observations and led the

"Infection Control Implications of Heterogeneous Resistance Mechanisms in Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) PROJECT SUMMARY In 2013, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) assigned its highest antibiotic resistance threat level to carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE). CRE are resistant to nearly all routinely used antibiotics with gram-negative coverage and have been implicated in several high-profile nosocomial outbreaks in United States (U.S.) facilities. Although in past outbreaks institutions have deployed aggressive and highly bundled responses, this “kitchen sink” approach is unlikely to be resource- or cost-effective as CRE become endemic in the U.S. Evidence-based CRE policies are necessary, but fundamental gaps in knowledge remain. In particular, heterogeneous mechanisms encode carbapenem resistance in CRE, which are broadly classifiable by whether carbapenem resistance does (“CP-CRE”) or does not (“non-CP-CRE”) arise from carbapenemase production. Until recently resistance testing was limited in clinical settings, but this landscape is changing with the rollout of commercially available assays for identifying carbapenemase production. However, data on the prevalence of CP-CRE and non-CP-CRE in U.S. patients, especially among high-risk hospitalized populations, are limited. Moreover, some evidence suggests that propensity for intra-facility spread differs between CP-CRE and non-CP-CRE, but rigorous data are lacking. Evaluating epidemiological differences in CRE resistance types is essential to establishing public health priorities for CRE prevention in U.S. healthcare facilities. Aim 1 will evaluate the prevalence of and pre-admission risk factors for rectal colonization with CP-CRE and non-CP-CRE in a cohort of approximately 1900 patients admitted to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) and comprehensive transplant unit (CTU) at The Johns Hopkins Hospital. Risk factors will be analyzed with machine learning methodologies in order to develop a user-friendly decision tree to identify patients at high-risk of CP-CRE and/or non-CP-CRE carriage for future targeted surveillance screening. Aim 2 will utilize serially collected rectal swabs, in conjunction with clinical and environmental data, to estimate the incidence of nosocomial CP-CRE and non-CP-CRE colonization and to evaluate the contribution of asymptomatic CRE carriers and individual-level risk factors on a patient's risk of CRE acquisition during unit hospitalization. Strain-typing and other analyses as needed (e.g., whole genome sequencing) will be available to ascertain transmission events. This will be the first study in a U.S. hospital to investigate CRE spread associated exclusively with asymptomatic carriers and stratified by resistance type in a non-outbreak setting. The broad, long-term goals of this proposal are to advance our understanding of the epidemiology of CRE colonization and the implications of CRE resistance mechanisms to routes of nosocomial acquisition in order to guide CRE control policies and resource prioritization in U.S. healthcare facilities. PROJECT NARRATIVE Heterogeneous mechanisms encode carbapenem resistance in carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE). Understanding the infection control implications of this heterogeneity has assumed newfound relevance with the rollout of resistance mechanism assays to identify carbapenemase production. The proposed research seeks to examine whether risk factors for CRE colonization and propensity for organism spread in the hospital environment differ by CRE resistance type, in order to promote evidence-based strategies for CRE control in U.S. hospitals.",Infection Control Implications of Heterogeneous Resistance Mechanisms in Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE),9267654,R36HS025089,[' '],AHRQ,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R36,2017,41785,0.007281373131403753
"Understanding host-virus interactions at the single cell level ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The microbial world presents one of the largest challenges to modern medicine in the 21st century in the form of novel, untreatable pathogens. Bacteriophages, the viruses that infect bacteria, are a major driver of this challenge. In particular, bacteriophages mediate the exchange of novel genetic materials (a process known as horizontal gene transfer, or HGT) between bacteria, transforming otherwise benign bacteria into human pathogens and driving the rapid emergence of pathogens resistant to existing treatments. Accordingly, there is a critical need to elucidate when, where, and how phage-mediated HGT occurs.  One critical aspect of phage-mediated HGT is lysogenization, the process by which phage DNA is integrated into the host bacterium's genome. Which bacterial cells are capable of being lysogenized and how the process of lysogenization is coupled to the physiology of the host bacterial cell are key questions in phage biology that remain unanswered. Recent technological advances in computer vision and single-cell imaging along with our lab's existing expertise in bacterial physiology enable us to interrogate this model system with unprecedented precision and find concrete answers to these long standing questions. We therefore propose to study these questions using E. coli and phage lambda as our initial model system.  Our guiding hypothesis is that the physiology of the host bacterial cells plays a critical role in the occurrence of lysogeny. Interrogating this problem of bacteria-phage interactions requires a systems level view of bacterial physiology and detailed dynamic measurements of lysogeny development. The goal of this proposal is to develop a system capable of measuring the activities of viral transcription factors, host proteins, and infection outcomes simultaneously in single cells. The analysis and interpretation of these data will lead to the discovery of novel host-virus interactions underlying lysogenic development and ultimately identify molecular targets that can be exploited to suppress phage-mediated horizontal gene transfer.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Bacteriophages mediate horizontal gene transfer (HGT), the exchange of novel genetic materials between bacteria, transforming otherwise benign bacteria into human pathogens and driving the rapid emergence of pathogens resistant to existing treatments. Accordingly, there is a critical need to elucidate when, where, and how phage-mediated HGT occurs. Our proposal focuses on using novel technologies to answer these questions for bacteriophage lambda and its host, E. coli.        ",Understanding host-virus interactions at the single cell level,9377495,F32GM119319,"['Algorithms', 'Automobile Driving', 'Bacteria', 'Bacterial Physiology', 'Bacteriophage lambda', 'Bacteriophages', 'Benign', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Models', 'Biology', 'Carbon', 'Cell Size', 'Cells', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Consensus', 'Coupled', 'Cytolysis', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Enzymes', 'Escherichia coli', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Materials', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Horizontal Gene Transfer', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Libraries', 'Literature', 'Lysogeny', 'Lytic', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Modeling', 'Modern Medicine', 'Modernization', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Target', 'Outcome', 'Peptide Hydrolases', 'Phosphorus', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Plasmids', 'Play', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Regulatory Element', 'Reporter', 'Reporting', 'Resistance', 'Role', 'Source', 'System', 'Technology', 'Temperature', 'Testing', 'Viral Physiology', 'Viral Proteins', 'Viral Regulatory Proteins', 'Virus', 'Weight', 'Work', 'base', 'cellular imaging', 'experimental study', 'genetic regulatory protein', 'imaging Segmentation', 'live cell imaging', 'microbial', 'new technology', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'protein function', 'public health relevance', 'transcription factor', 'virus host interaction']",NIGMS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,F32,2017,64787,-0.0065715043640982365
"Integrating Bioinformatics and Clustering Analysis for Disease Surveillance ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  There has been a tremendous focus in bioinformatics on translation of data from the bench into information and knowledge for clinical decision-making. This includes analysis of human genetics for personalized medicine and treatment. However, there has been much less attention on translational bioinformatics for public health practice such as surveillance of emerging/re-emerging viruses. This involves data acquisition, integration, and analyses of viral genetics to infer origin, spread, and evolution suc as the emergence of new strains. The relevant scientific fields for this practice include certain aspects of molecular epidemiology and phylogeography. Recent attention has focused on viruses of zoonotic origin, which are defined as pathogens that are transmittable between animals and humans. In addition to seasonal influenza and West Nile virus, this classification of pathogens includes novel viruses such as Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome and influenza A H7N9. Despite the successes highlighted in the literature, there has been little utilization of bioinformatics resources and tools among state public health, agriculture, and wildlife agencies for zoonotic surveillance. Previously this type of resource has been restricted primarily to those in academia.       While bioinformatics has been sparsely used for surveillance of zoonotic viruses, other applications such as Geospatial Information Systems (GIS) have been employed by state health agencies to analyze spatial patterns of infection. This includes software to produce disease maps using an array of data types such as clinical, geographical, or human mobility data for tasks such as, geocoding, clustering, or outbreak detection. In addition, advances in geospatial statistics have enabled health agencies to perform more powerful space-time analyses to infer spatiotemporal patterns. However, these GIS consider only traditional epidemiological data such as location and timing of reported cases and not the genetics of the virus that causes the disease. This prevents health agencies from understanding how changes in the genome of the virus and the associated environment in which it disseminates impacts disease risk.      The long-term goal of this proposal is to enhance the identification of geospatial hotspots of zoonotic viruses by applying bioinformatics principles to access, integrate, and analyze viral genetics and spatiotemporal reportable disease data. This project will include approaches from bioinformatics, genetics, spatial statistics, GIS, and epidemiology. To do this, I will first measue the utilization of bioinformatics resources and tools as well as the current approaches and limitations identified by state agencies of public health, agriculture, and wildlife for detecting nd predicting hotspots (clusters) of zoonotic viruses (Aim 1). I will then use this feedback to develo a spatial decision support system for detecting and predicting zoonotic hotspots that applies bioinformatics principles to access, integrate, and analyze viral genetics, environmental, and spatiotemporal reportable disease data (Aim 2). In Aim 3, I will then evaluate my system for cluster detection and prediction against a system that does not consider viral genetics and relies on traditional spatiotemporal data, and perform validation of the predictive capability. Additional evaluation of the user's satisfaction and system usability will be evaluated.               Project Narrative I will develop and evaluate a spatial decision support system to support surveillance of zoonotic viruses in both human and animal populations. I will use approaches from bioinformatics and public health to integrate genetic sequence data from the virus with data from cases of reported infectious diseases and associated environmental data. A surveillance system that considers the genetics and environment of the virus along with public health data will assist public health officials in making informed decisions regarding risk of infectious diseases.",Integrating Bioinformatics and Clustering Analysis for Disease Surveillance,9189635,F31LM012176,"['Academia', 'Address', 'Agriculture', 'Algorithm Design', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Biodiversity', 'Bioinformatics', 'Case Study', 'Clinical', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Detection', 'Disease', 'Disease Notification', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Ecology', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Evaluation', 'Evolution', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Genbank', 'Genetic', 'Geographic Information Systems', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Human Genetics', 'Infection', 'Influenza', 'Influenza A Virus, H7N9 Subtype', 'Influenza A virus', 'Knowledge', 'Literature', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Metadata', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Epidemiology', 'Molecular Evolution', 'Pattern', 'Population', 'Public Health', 'Public Health Practice', 'Questionnaire Designs', 'Questionnaires', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk', 'Scanning', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Time', 'Translations', 'Validation', 'Validity and Reliability', 'Viral', 'Viral Genome', 'Virus', 'Virus Diseases', 'Virus Integration', 'West Nile virus', 'Work', 'Zoonoses', 'clinical decision-making', 'data acquisition', 'disorder risk', 'epidemiologic data', 'health data', 'high risk', 'novel virus', 'pathogen', 'personalized medicine', 'prevent', 'respiratory', 'satisfaction', 'seasonal influenza', 'spatiotemporal', 'statistics', 'success', 'tool', 'usability', 'virus classification', 'virus genetics']",NLM,ARIZONA STATE UNIVERSITY-TEMPE CAMPUS,F31,2017,38800,0.024177918727219236
"Structure-Based Design of a Broadly Protective Group A Streptococcal Vaccine The overall goal of this project is to develop a safe, broadly effective, and affordable vaccine to prevent group A streptococcal infections. Antibodies against the N-terminal hypervariable region (HVR) of surface M (Emm) proteins of GAS are opsonic and are associated with protection against infection. Immunity has classically been described as “type-specific”, leading to the assumption that natural immunity confers protection against only one of the more than 200 different emm types of GAS. We now have new information that calls into question this classic view and serves as the basis for an entirely different approach to GAS vaccine design and development. A recent comprehensive sequence analysis of M proteins from a global collection of 175 emm types of GAS resulted in a new emm cluster typing system that classified 96.2% of all contemporary GAS isolates into 48 emm clusters containing structurally and functionally related M proteins. Moreover, 117 emm types contained in 16 clusters accounted for 94.4% of GAS infections in the world. Indeed, preclinical studies indicated that a multivalent vaccine containing N-terminal peptides from 30 prevalent M types cross-opsonized a significant number of non-vaccine emm types of GAS that co-localized in clusters with vaccine emm types. The frequency of cross-opsonic antibodies, combined with the emm cluster data, prompted us to conclude that there is a need for a paradigm shift away from the concept of “type-specific” immunity against GAS infections to one of “cluster-specific” immunity. Our overall hypothesis is that immunity to GAS infections is the result of both type-specific and cross-reactive antibodies against the N-terminal regions of M proteins and that a new approach employing computational predictions of peptide structures will result in a multivalent vaccine that will induce broadly protective immunity in populations throughout the world. Our preliminary results indicate the feasibility of using structure-based design to predict the antigenic relatedness of M peptides within a cluster. The specific aims of this proposal are to: 1) Apply computational structure-based design in an iterative process with immunological data from Aim 2 to predict the minimal number of M peptide sequences that are most representative of the structural and physicochemical properties of the peptides in one emm cluster containing 17 GAS emm types, 2) determine the cross-reactive immunogenicity of the selected peptides with all seventeen emm types of GAS in the cluster, and apply the results to refine the computational design predictions in Aim 1, 3) apply the refined computational parameters from Aims 1 and 2 to analyze the remaining epidemiologically important emm clusters, select a comprehensive panel of peptides representing all emm types, construct four multivalent recombinant vaccine proteins, and assess potential cross-protective immunogenicity using in vitro bactericidal assays against all 117 emm types of GAS, and 4) determine the protective immunogenicity of the final multivalent vaccine in unique transgenic mice expressing human C4BP and factor H that will be immunized and then challenged with multiple emm types of GAS. The world needs an effective, safe and affordable vaccine to prevent group A streptococcal (GAS) infections. Although most GAS infections are mild, there are more than 18 million people with a chronic complication of a severe GAS disease worldwide, over 15 million of whom have rheumatic heart disease, another 2 million cases of severe disease occur each year and a total of 517,000 deaths annually are estimated to be due to this organism.

"Host-derived biomarker signatures to differentiate acute viral, bacterial, and fungal infection Statement of Work There is an urgent need for improved diagnostic tests for the evaluation of the etiology of febrile states, particularly in immunocompromised hosts. This project will develop host-based biomarker signatures capable of identifying the presence and pathogen class of infections in vulnerable immunocompromised human subjects, thus potentially allowing for earlier, more directed (and thus more effective) therapy as well as reducing the need for potentially harmful empiric anti-infective therapy. In this study we will a) perform high dimensional gene expression analysis on existing samples of at-risk hosts with proven candidemia, viral infection, bacterial infection, or noninfectious illness, b) develop peripheral blood-based gene expression signatures of candidemia and c) generate a combined multinomial classifier capable of differentiating four clinical states: viral infection, bacterial infection, fungal infection (candidemia) and noninfectious illness. The enclosed work offers a true paradigm shift in the way febrile illnesses in this high-risk population are diagnosed and managed. Relevance Statement Timely and accurate differentiation of viral, bacterial, and fungal illness has important implications for both the individual patient and society as earlier/more accurate diagnosis may improve patient treatment and clinical outcomes as well as curb anti-microbial overusage and subsequent proliferation of resistant organisms.","Host-derived biomarker signatures to differentiate acute viral, bacterial, and fungal infection",9373089,R21AI132978,"['Acute', 'Anti-Infective Agents', 'Bacteremia', 'Bacterial Infections', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood specimen', 'Candida', 'Candidiasis', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Effector Cell', 'Enrollment', 'Etiology', 'Fever', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Hematologic Neoplasms', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immunocompromised Host', 'Immunosuppression', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Infection Control', 'Infectious Agent', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Microbiology', 'Modality', 'Mycoses', 'Organ Transplantation', 'Organism', 'Outcome', 'Pathogen detection', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Resistance', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Societies', 'Solid', 'Statistical Methods', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Viral', 'Virus Diseases', 'Work', 'accurate diagnosis', 'adjudicate', 'antimicrobial', 'base', 'candidemia', 'cohort', 'evaluation/testing', 'genomic signature', 'high dimensionality', 'high risk population', 'human subject', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'individual patient', 'learning strategy', 'migration', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'pathogen', 'peripheral blood', 'prototype', 'rapid diagnosis', 'therapy outcome', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NIAID,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R21,2017,198750,0.04156322145617015
"Neutralization Fingerprinting Analysis of Polyclonal Antibody Responses against HIV-1 Project Summary HIV-1 poses a substantial health and economic burden, with more than 30 million people currently infected worldwide. The search for an effective HIV-1 vaccine remains a top priority, and a deeper understanding of how the immune system recognizes HIV-1 can help inform vaccine design. Lately, much effort has focused on understanding the antibody responses to HIV-1 infection. However, the polyclonal neutralizing antibody responses in an individual are very complex. Standard methods for mapping such responses include various experimental techniques, but more recently, computational methods were also developed. These computational methods, which we call NFP (neutralization fingerprinting), are based on analysis of serum neutralization data that is typically obtained in the very first stages of donor sample characterization, and are therefore an efficient technology for accurately mapping antibody specificities in polyclonal responses. The NFP algorithms have already become an important tool in the HIV field and are being used extensively by laboratories throughout the world, including Duke CHAVI-ID, CAPRISA, NIH VRC, and MHRP.  Here, we propose to develop next-generation NFP algorithms and apply them to address biological questions with important implications for understanding the interactions between HIV-neutralizing antibodies and the virus. Specifically, we will develop and apply novel algorithms for: (1) Antibody specificity prediction with significantly improved accuracy and reliability. These algorithms will immensely improve the utility of the NFP approach for prospective identification of antibody specificities in polyclonal sera. (2) Mapping broadly neutralizing antibody responses against novel epitopes on HIV-1 Env. We will use epitope- structural analysis and computational search algorithms to identify novel Env epitopes, and will screen donor samples for the presence of related NFP signals. Promising signals for novel antibody specificities will be characterized further through collaborations. (3) Population-level analysis of broadly neutralizing antibody responses to HIV-1. We will analyze large collections of samples from diverse HIV infection cohorts in order to determine common antibody specificities elicited in response to HIV-1, as well as patterns of potential association between features of the infecting virus sequence and the elicited epitope specificities.  The proposed NFP algorithms will be made available to the public, and will be useful in a number of high-impact areas in the HIV field, including mapping of antibody specificities in previously uncharacterized samples, identification of novel Env epitopes, and large-scale analysis of broadly neutralizing antibody responses within a cohort, or at a population level. Overall, this work will lead to a better understanding of the neutralizing antibody responses against HIV-1 and will build a more complete picture of the epitopes on Env. The proposed algorithmic framework should be generalizable to other important viruses, such as influenza and hepatitis C, and therefore has the potential for a far-reaching impact on public health. Project Narrative  This project aims at developing next-generation neutralization fingerprinting algorithms for the analysis of antibody specificities in polyclonal responses against HIV-1.

"Genomics-based prediction of antibiotic failure in S. aureus infections ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)    The Gram positive bacterium Staphylococcus aureus is both an asymptomatic human colonizer and a pathogen that can cause infections in multiple tissue sites, including blood, skin and soft tissue, bone, and internal organs. Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is a common cause of death by hospital infections (HA-MRSA) and is now also a common community acquired infection (CA-MRSA). Vancomycin (a glycopeptide antibiotic) is the most commonly prescribed drug to treat MRSA infections. High-level resistance (minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) ≥16 μg/ml) to vancomycin encoded by the mobile vanA gene is rare due to a fitness burden on S. aureus. However, it is more common to encounter strains with mutations conferring intermediate resistance to vancomycin arising from selection during the course of antibiotic therapy. The genetic basis of these vancomycin intermediate S. aureus (VISA) and heterogeneous resistant (hVISA) (MIC 2-8 μg/ml) strains involves a large number of different genomic mutations that result in cell wall thickening through changes in cellular signaling and regulation. Routine phenotypic testing in clinical labs probably underestimates the incidence of VISA and hVISA. Due to the fact that mutations in several genes have been linked with VISA, genetic-based detection of intermediate vancomycin resistance has not been developed for routine clinical microbiological use. In our preliminary work, we created an extensive catalog of sequenced clinical and laboratory-selected VISA as well as databases of SNPs and genetic variation in thousands of public S. aureus genomes. In this work we plan to extend these studies toward development of a sequence-based testing protocol that could be used for large numbers of clinical strains. In Specific Aim 1 we plan to extend our knowledge of the mutations that cause VISA by sequencing a panel of 300 novel mutants strains spontaneously selected from 40 S. aureus parent genotypes. We estimate, based on the results of the preliminary data, that this number of strains will be sufficient identify mutations found in 95% of VISA strains. These data will be used for creation of a comprehensive VISA detection assay based on whole genome data with an accuracy of at least 95%. In Specific Aim 2 we will use the information learned from Aim 1 to create a multiplex PCR sequence test for VISA, VRSA and other resistance determinants of S. aureus based on the commercially available Fluidigm platform. We will ultimately aim to have an assay that can be used to monitor systemic MRSA infections, such as bacteremia, to detect development of VISA in its early stages in clinical specimens from the patient. The test will also be able to detect other S. aureus resistance phenotypes and call the genotype of the strain. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    Vancomycin is an antibiotic commonly used to treat methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections in chronically ill patients. The efficacy of this relatively cheap and well-tolerated therapy is compromised by mutations in the genome of the bacterium. In this project we propose to develop a genetic test based on a library of MRSA genome sequences with known antibiotic susceptibility level that identifies bacteria with diminished resistance to vancomycin.",Genomics-based prediction of antibiotic failure in S. aureus infections,9241329,R21AI121860,"['Address', 'Antibiotic Resistance', 'Antibiotic Therapy', 'Antibiotic susceptibility', 'Antibiotics', 'Bacteremia', 'Bacteria', 'Base Sequence', 'Biological Assay', 'Blood', 'Catalogs', 'Cause of Death', 'Cell Wall', 'Chronically Ill', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Microbiology', 'Community-Acquired Infections', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Evolution', 'Failure', 'Frequencies', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genetic screening method', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Glycopeptide Antibiotics', 'Goals', 'Gram-Positive Bacteria', 'Healthcare', 'Human', 'Incidence', 'Infection', 'Intermediate resistance', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Methicillin', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Mutation', 'Nosocomial Infections', 'Organ', 'Parents', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Protocols documentation', 'Regulation', 'Resistance', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Skin Tissue', 'Specimen', 'Staphylococcus aureus', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Treatment Failure', 'University Hospitals', 'Vancomycin', 'Vancomycin Resistance', 'Vancomycin-resistant S. aureus', 'Variant', 'Virulence', 'Work', 'base', 'bone', 'design', 'economic cost', 'fitness', 'genetic predictors', 'genetic variant', 'interest', 'methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus', 'mortality', 'mutant', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'phenotypic data', 'pleiotropism', 'public health relevance', 'soft tissue', 'tool', 'whole genome']",NIAID,EMORY UNIVERSITY,R21,2017,195000,0.030661176467140366
"Systems Biology of Microbiome-mediated Resilience to Antibiotic-resistant Pathogens ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Infections caused by antibiotic-resistant bacterial pathogens are exceedingly common in immunocompromised hosts. Patients undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) are particularly susceptible to these infections and are the patient population our studies will focus upon. Our goal is to extend and further develop systems biology approaches that our group has pioneered to identify mechanisms by which the intestinal microbiota confers resistance to infection by Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE), antibiotic-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (arKp) and Clostridium difficile (C. diff). Aim 1 of our project is to establish a clinical database from the hospital recrds of allo-HSCT patients during their initial hospitalization that will include all laboratory values,vital signs, pharmacy data, dietary data, symptoms and physical exam findings. Aim 2 will expand our fecal bank by collecting fecal samples from approximately 160 allo-HSCT patients per year and determining the presence/absence of VRE, arKp and C. diff by culture and PCR. We will use NGS of 16S rRNA genes to determine microbiota composition on each sample, will perform metagenomic and RNA sequencing to determine the bacterial transcriptome and perform metabolomic analyses on a selected subset of fecal samples. Aim 3 is to extend our mathematical modeling to identify specific members of the microbiota, metabolic pathways and metabolic products that correlate with resistance to VRE or arKp expansion in the GI tract or are associated with resistance to C. diff infection. The clinical database will be used to establish correlations between clinical treatments or events and changes in the intestinal microbiota or the expression of bacterial metabolic pathways. Ultimately, the computational platforms developed in aim 3 will identify bacterial species or consortia that are associated with resistance to infection and Aim 4 will test these associations in germ-free mouse models. We will culture bacterial species associated with resistance, colonize mice with these protective bacteria and test for resistance against VRE, arKp and C. diff. Samples obtained from these experimental studies will be subjected to metagenomic and metabolomic analyses to further refine, in an iterative fashion, computational models developed in aim 3. Our proposed studies will develop new and extend existing computational models to identify bacterial species and molecular mechanisms that confer resistance to antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The normal bacteria inhabiting the human intestine provide a high level of resistance against antibiotic-resistant bacterial pathogens. We are investigating the intestinal flora of hospitalized patients and using mathematical modeling to identify bacterial species and their metabolic products that reduce the risk of infection by three prevalent antibiotic-resistant bacteria.

"Systematic Analysis of Morphogenesis, Commensalism, and Virulence in a Leading Human Fungal Pathogen The impact of fungal pathogens on human health is devastating. They infect billions of people worldwide, and kill more than 1.5 million each year. The most vulnerable are people with reduced immune function, such as those with HIV or those undergoing immune suppressing treatments for cancer or organ transplants. One of the most pervasive fungal pathogens is Candida albicans, which kills almost 40% of people suffering from bloodstream infections. Treating these infections is extremely difficult, as fungi are closely related to humans and there are very few drugs that kill the fungus without host toxicity. With the emergence of drug resistance, the development of new therapeutic strategies is now crucial. To address this important clinical need and identify new antifungal drug targets, it is critical to uncover mechanisms that enable C. albicans to cause life-threatening human disease.  We are one of the first academic labs to obtain a powerful resource that will allow us to test the function of almost every gene in the C. albicans genome. This resource includes a collection of double barcoded heterozygous mutants covering ~90% of the genome, and a collection of strains covering ~40% of the genome where the expression of the remaining wild-type allele of a gene is governed by the tetracycline-repressible promoter. This resource provides an unprecedented opportunity to identify genes that control key virulence traits such as morphogenesis. It also enables the identification of determinants of commensalism and virulence, and to further elucidate the molecular mechanisms involved. We have optimized a functional genomics platform for massively parallel analysis of fungal virulence traits using next generation sequencing to quantify the relative proportion of each barcoded strain in pooled assays. We have also optimized high- resolution image analysis of cellular morphology and structures, and assays for identifying genes important for commensalism, virulence, and interaction with host immune cells. Our studies will provide the first global analysis of C. albicans morphogenesis, commensalism, and virulence.  Our studies will: 1) develop a computational platform to predict C. albicans essential genes, and expand the collection of tetracycline-repressible conditional expression strains to cover most non-essential genes, since genes required for pathogen viability in vitro provide little insight into mechanisms of host adaptation or virulence; 2) identify novel regulators of key virulence traits such as morphogenesis; and 3) identify determinants of C. albicans host adaptation and virulence on a genome scale. This work will provide an expanded functional genomics resource to advance the field, and will leverage this resource to elucidate the genes and genetic networks governing morphogenesis and virulence. This will reveal new strategies to cripple fungal pathogens, and drug targets to improve clinical outcome. The focus of this proposal is to elucidate mechanisms governing morphogenesis, commensalism, and virulence of the fungal pathogen Candida albicans. This eukaryotic pathogen has a profound impact on human health, with a global incidence of Candida bloodstream infections of ~400,000 cases, associated with crude mortality rates of 42% and attributable mortality rates of 27%; C. albicans is the most prevalent Candida species in almost all patient populations. The central hypotheses that govern this proposal are that functional genomic analysis of C. albicans using genome-scale libraries of double barcoded heterozygous gene deletion mutants and tetracycline-repressible conditional expression strains will reveal novel circuitry governing morphogenesis, commensalism, and virulence, and that targeting this circuitry has therapeutic potential for combating life-threatening fungal infections.","Systematic Analysis of Morphogenesis, Commensalism, and Virulence in a Leading Human Fungal Pathogen",9213066,R01AI127375,"['Address', 'Alleles', 'Aneuploidy', 'Antifungal Agents', 'Antifungal Therapy', 'Ascomycota', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Candida', 'Candida albicans', 'Cells', 'Cellular Morphology', 'Cellular Structures', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Cues', 'Cytolysis', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diploidy', 'Drug Targeting', 'Drug resistance', 'Environment', 'Essential Genes', 'Filament', 'Foundations', 'Gastrointestinal tract structure', 'Gene Deletion', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomic Library', 'Genomic approach', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'HIV', 'Health', 'Human', 'Image Analysis', 'Immune', 'Immune system', 'Immunocompromised Host', 'In Vitro', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Investments', 'Laboratories', 'Libraries', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Morphogenesis', 'Mus', 'Mutation', 'Mycoses', 'Nosocomial Infections', 'Organ Transplantation', 'Organism', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Process', 'Property', 'Publishing', 'Resistance development', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Sepsis', 'Solid', 'Symbiosis', 'Systemic infection', 'Testing', 'Tetracyclines', 'Therapeutic', 'Toxic effect', 'Virulence', 'Work', 'Yeast Model System', 'Yeasts', 'attributable mortality', 'cancer therapy', 'combat', 'fitness', 'functional genomics', 'fungus', 'gene replacement', 'genome-wide', 'genomic platform', 'high resolution imaging', 'human disease', 'immune function', 'improved', 'insight', 'killings', 'member', 'microbiota', 'mortality', 'mutant', 'new therapeutic target', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'novel therapeutics', 'pathogen', 'patient population', 'programs', 'promoter', 'quantitative imaging', 'response', 'trait', 'unpublished works']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF TORONTO,R01,2017,591721,-0.007558456386749937
"Comprehensive analysis of human adaptive immune receptors to elucidate correlates of Epstein-Barr virus disease suppression Project Summary/Abstract This project will develop a new technological approach for the comprehensive analysis of adaptive immune responses, which holds the potential to catalyze new strategies to prevent and treat disease. Here we will apply immune profiling techniques recently invented by the PI to investigate the mechanisms of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) adaptive immune control in clinical cohorts of infected patients. EBV is a highly prevalent pathogen infecting >90% of the world’s population. Primary EBV infection often causes infectious mononucleosis (IM) and long-term sequelae include numerous malignancies, lymphoproliferative disorders, and a strong association with multiple sclerosis. No EBV vaccine is approved to date, and the molecular mechanisms of immune protection from EBV-associated diseases are unclear. Unfortunately, prior technical barriers in high- throughput immune profiling methods have prevented a comprehensive understanding of adaptive immune protection against EBV diseases. A technological approach that identifies the critical features of EBV immune protection will advance new solutions for vaccine and therapeutic development. Therefore, we developed an experimental pipeline to enable rapid and cost-effective analysis of B- and T-cell responses to EBV that is scalable to dozens of human patients per experiment. We hypothesize that a comprehensive B- and T-cell analysis of carefully selected patient cohorts that either can or cannot suppress symptomatic infection will reveal function-based correlates of EBV control. To test this hypothesis, we will apply quantitative immune profiling technologies to analyze cryopreserved longitudinal samples from recently completed prospective clinical studies of IM. Patient samples in our cohort span pre- and post-infection through convalescence and encompass the full range of clinical IM severity scores (from 0, asymptomatic primary infection, to 6, essentially bedridden with IM). Immune profile data will be used to establish adaptive immune correlates of IM disease severity. In addition, we will analyze immune responses in apparently immunocompetent patients with chronic active EBV (CAEBV) disease, or patients who do not adequately suppress EBV infection, to gain insight regarding adaptive immune function and dysfunction in CAEBV. Finally, we will develop a new computational toolkit to rapidly identify immune correlates from high-throughput datasets. Successful completion of this project will constitute the first comprehensive functional B- and T-cell receptor analysis in a human clinical cohort. Our efforts will provide a repertoire-scale, mechanistic understanding of adaptive immunity to EBV and suggest new strategies for treatment and prevention of EBV-associated diseases. Our long-term goal is to develop human immune profiling techniques as a platform approach to accelerate the rational design of vaccines and therapeutics against pathogens of high public health importance, beginning with EBV. Project Narrative This project will apply new high-throughput immune profiling technologies to elucidate the features of effective Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) immune control. EBV causes a range of human diseases including infectious mononucleosis and several forms of cancer; however, limited EBV treatment options are available and no approved preventive EBV vaccines exist.

The collaborative opportunities, intellectual environment and resources available to Dr. Farhat are outstanding. Research: Infectious diseases continue to be a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Despite the availability of effective antimicrobials, pathogens are successfully evolving new disease phenotypes that allow them to resist killing by these drugs or in other instances cause more severe disease manifestations or wider chains of transmission. Drug resistance (DR) is now common and some bacteria have even become resistant to multiple types or classes of antibiotics6. A key strategy in the fight against emerging pathogen phenotypes in infectious diseases is surveillance, and early personalized therapy to prevent transmission and propagation of these strains. The timely initiation of antibiotic therapy to which the pathogen is sensitive has been shown to be the key factor influencing treatment outcome for a diverse array of infections. Molecular tests that rely on the detection of microbial genetic mutations are particularly promising for surveillance and diagnosis of these pathogen phenotypes but rely on a comprehensive understanding of how mutations associate with these pathogen phenotypes. Currently there is an explosion of data on pathogen whole genome sequences (WGS) that is increasingly generated from clinical laboratories. Data on disease phenotype may also be available, but methods for the analysis and interpretation of these Big Data are lagging. Here I propose tools to aid in this analysis leveraging Big Data sets from Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) and my prior work. Specifically I propose to (1) develop a web-based public interface to several analysis tools, including a statistical learning model that can predict the MTB DR phenotype from its genomic sequence, (2) to develop and study an MTB gene-gene network, based on WGS data, to improve our understanding of the effect of mutation-mutation interactions on the DR phenotype, and (3) study the performance of methods in current use for the association of genotype and phenotype in pathogens, and develop a generalizable power calculator for the best performing method. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    Infectious agents of disease are successfully evolving drug resistance and other adaptations that threaten human health. Understanding the genetic mutations that underlie these disease phenotypes can inform surveillance and diagnostic strategies to combat this threat. Here I propose to develop accessible tools for pathogen genomic analysis that will help identify which genetic mutations are relevant to disease.",New Tools for the interpretation of Pathogen Genomic Data with a focus on Mycobacterium tuberculosis,9326841,K01ES026835,"['Affect', 'Antibiotic Therapy', 'Antibiotics', 'Area', 'Award', 'Bacteria', 'Big Data', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Biometry', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Complement', 'Consult', 'Critical Care', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Drug resistance', 'Drug resistance in tuberculosis', 'Drug-sensitive', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Explosion', 'Exposure to', 'Future', 'Gene Structure', 'General Hospitals', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Determinism', 'Genetic Epistasis', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Heritability', 'Human', 'Infection', 'Infectious Agent', 'Infectious Diseases Research', 'Institutes', 'International', 'Journals', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Laboratories', 'Leadership', 'Low income', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Massachusetts', 'Measures', 'Medical Genetics', 'Medicine', 'Mentored Research Scientist Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Microbial Genetics', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mutation', 'Mycobacterium tuberculosis', 'National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease', 'Nature', 'Network-based', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Peer Review', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Phylogeny', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Public Health', 'Public Health Schools', 'Publications', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Severity of illness', 'Social Medicine', 'Social Sciences', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Treatment outcome', 'Tuberculosis', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'Virulent', 'Work', 'Writing', 'analytical tool', 'antimicrobial', 'base', 'big biomedical data', 'burden of illness', 'career', 'combat', 'computer science', 'design', 'disease phenotype', 'experience', 'fight against', 'gene interaction', 'genome sequencing', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'global health', 'improved', 'instructor', 'killings', 'medical schools', 'microbial', 'microbial genome', 'mortality', 'pathogen', 'pathogen genome', 'personalized medicine', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'simulation', 'skills', 'tenure track', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'whole genome']",NIEHS,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,K01,2017,225549,0.013487820994266347
"UVPD-MS Characterization of Lipopolysaccharides Abstract. Gram-negative bacteria have caused many of the most persistent infections as well as some of the deadliest pandemics in the world. Some strains have developed resistant to all available drugs, thus leading to increasing mortality from previously treatable bacterial infections. The National Strategy for Combating Antibiotic-Resistant Bacteria released by the White House in September 2014 focused on the need for (i) advancing the development of methods for identification and characterization of bacteria, (ii) accelerating basic research for new antibiotics, and (iii) improving capabilities for surveillance of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. This proposal focuses on the development of innovative tandem mass spectrometry approaches for characterization of lipopolysaccharides (LPS), the primary constituent of the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria that protects the membrane from chemical attack and is recognized by the immune system during pathogenic invasion. Structural characterization of LPS is critical to understanding how the structure of LPS influences immune stimulation as well as facilitating development of new antimicrobials and vaccines. This is a significant analytical challenge due to the branched structures and amphipathic properties of LPS. The escalating concerns about antibiotic resistance bacteria and the need for better avenues of defense against infectious diseases have motivated the proposed work. The objectives of this proposal are: Aim 1: Development of ultraviolet photodissociation (UVPD) mass spectrometry via hierarchical, decision-tree workflows for top-down characterization of LPS to facilitate high throughput analysis; Aim 2: Development of MS/MS approaches for serotyping of Gram-negative bacteria based on LPS; Aim 3: Examination of peptide/LPS interactions via native-spray mass spectrometry to provide both mechanistic information and screening capabilities for new antimicrobials, and Aim 4: Applications to a variety of structural problems related to the biosynthesis of LPS in Gram- negative bacteria and characterization of hybrid O-antigen/lipid A molecules in vesicle-based vaccines.  We have established a new collaboration with Dr. Bryan Davies' group to develop mass spectrometry methods to characterize peptide/lipid A interactions in support of the hunt for better antimicrobials. The continued collaboration with Dr. Stephen Trent's group emphasizes: (i) approaches for deciphering the biosynthetic pathways of bacterial LPS that endow them with the remarkable ability to re-design their outer membranes and develop antibiotic resistance, and (ii) innovative vaccine design based on antigenic LPS in vesicles.    Narrative: Gram-negative bacteria are responsible for some of the deadliest and more widespread pandemics in the world. The proposed work focuses on the development of advanced mass spectrometry approaches for characterization of complex lipopolysaccharides, including the endotoxic lipid A domains, that comprise the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria.

"Multi-level modeling to inform interventions for control of multidrug-resistant organisms within healthcare networks Project Summary/Abstract Multidrug-resistant organisms (MDROs), particularly carbapenem-resistant organisms (CROs), are a major cause of healthcare-associated infections (HAIs). Though studies have found multiple interventions addressing MDRO colonization and transmission to be effective at reducing HAIs, implementation has lagged due to questions regarding the most efficacious combination of interventions. As healthcare facilities (e.g., hospitals, long-term care facilities, or outpatient surgical centers and clinics) are part of an interconnected healthcare network, evaluation of an intervention’s impact on transmission and infection must consider the dynamics across the healthcare system. To address remaining knowledge gaps regarding the most effective combinations of intervention strategies, we will build a multi-level model that spans from individual patients to regionally interconnected healthcare facilities. The resulting framework will provide hospital administrators and infection control experts with tools for quantifying individual patient risk factors for colonization and infection and for comparing the potential effectiveness of interventions to control HAIs. The aims of the project are: (1) to develop models to estimate the underlying prevalence and incidence of CROs and predict which patients are at highest risk for colonization and infection with CROs using clinical samples collected during the normal course of care; (2) to utilize hospital-level models to quantify the combinatorial relationship between, and marginal impact of, additional interventions to reduce HAIs; and (3) to build a regional model of a healthcare system to examine the effectiveness of interventions across institutions. Models will start with the patient at the center, utilizing the rich covariate data stored in electronic medical records to develop prediction models based on advanced machine learning. These prediction models will be translatable tools that can be directly incorporated into clinical care to assist clinicians in preventing HAIs. In addition, they will form the foundation of hospital-level models that will allow for detailed examinations of the effectiveness of different combinations of interventions. Hospital-level models will then be embedded in a network of healthcare facilities that accounts for the differing incentives faced by geographically dispersed facilities with variable demographic populations. These models will directly inform CDC guidelines about MDRO prevention and aid clinicians in reducing the risk of HAIs. Project Narrative The models developed through this proposal will improve understanding of how biological factors associated with the transmission of multidrug-resistant organisms (MDRO) impact interventions to reduce hospital-associated infections (HAIs). This will aid predictions of patients’ risk for colonization and infection, as well as improve understanding of how interventions can most effectively be combined to reduce the likelihood that patients will suffer from these high-consequence pathogens.",Multi-level modeling to inform interventions for control of multidrug-resistant organisms within healthcare networks,9420097,U01CK000536,[' '],NCEZID,"CENTER/ DISEASE DYNAMICS, ECONOM/POLICY",U01,2017,649361,0.012948549806404147
"Point of Care Device for Reducing Overuse of Antibiotics in Potentially Septic Hospital Populations Principal Investigator/Program Director (Last, first, middle): Reddy, Jr., Bobby Project Summary: At least 30 percent of antibiotics prescribed in the United States are unnecessary. This has obviously catastrophic implications for the future of humanity. Sepsis is the third leading cause of death in the United States with an annual toll of over 230,000 people. Survival rates have been reported to drop by 7.6% per hour appropriate treatment is delayed. This drastic drop in survival rate leads to vast over prescription of antibiotics in hospital settings. A dominant factor underlying this behavior is the lack of rapid methods to determine whether or not an individualized patient would actually benefit from the intended course of antibiotics. Furthermore, if a course of antibiotics are chosen to be administered, it is not clear how to optimize the de-escalation of the antibiotics. This results in a blanket antibiotics approach, where nearly every patient with even a possibility of sepsis is dosed with broad spectrum antibiotics and stays on these antibiotics for far longer than is necessary. Procalcitonin (PCT) has shown much promise in recent years as a potential discriminator between bacterial and viral infections. Various assays for PCT from company such as bioMerieux and Roche have received 510k clearance from the FDA for use by physicians in optimizing the administration of antibiotics. In addition, Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (SIRS) criteria are often used as rough indications of a global inflammatory problem in patients. Of these four criteria (WBC count, respiratory rate, heart rate, and temperature), only the WBC count is not currently possible to measure outside of clinical labs. A handheld device that could combine both a WBC count and a plasma PCT measurement from a drop of blood in 10 minutes could revolutionize the administration of antibiotics in acute care settings. In particular, obtaining the first measurement of both PCT and WBC as early as possible before arrival to Emergency Departments is critical. Ideally this would be obtained in the most common “funnels” into the acute care EDs, including outpatient, ambulatory, and nursing home settings. Several studies have shown that the temporal trends of these two parameters can be very powerful for further adjustments to the administered antibiotics. For example, Roche’s Elecsys BRAHMS PCT system recommends that a PCT measurement is performed at both day 0 and day 4, and that the difference should be used to inform optimization of the antibiotics. ElectroCyt, Inc. is an early stage company that has raised $1.7M in investment and has licensed its core technology from University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. The company aims to develop a hand-held electronic reader with an accompanying pipeline of cartridge designs to measure a variety of cell counts, cell surface receptor expression levels, and plasma protein expression levels. Our first cartridge will measure a total WBC count and PCT from a drop of blood. The company has signed an exciting joint development agreement (JDA) with Foxconn Interconnect Technologies (FIT) to co-develop the low cost prototype cartridge and hand- held readers (letter attached). In addition, ElectroCyt has also established two clinical partnerships with hospitals to perform clinical studies (letters attached) to build a unique combined biomarker/EMR dataset. This dataset, when combined with machine learning for predictive analytics and the patient’s latest biomarker readings, will provide real time feedback to physicians as to a patient’s overall “immune state score”. This score could be used as individualized evaluation of how well a patient is recovering or not recovering from a septic event, which can help physicians adjust course of antibiotics with real time feedback. In this project, we will adapt our core technology, which has focused on cell measurements, to enable plasma protein measurements as well. In addition, we will continue to perform clinical studies to build the unique combined biomarker + EMR dataset at three clinical sites, University of Chicago Main Hospital, Carle Foundation Hospital and Order of Saint Francis (OSF) hospital.

This system, consisting of a device to measure biomarkers rapidly from blood and a machine learning algorithm, could provide real time feedback to physicians describing an individual patient’s specific response to the administered antibiotics.

"Genome Based Influenza Vaccine Strain Selection  using Machine Learning ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Influenza A virus causes both pandemic and seasonal outbreaks, leading to loss of from thousands to millions of human lives within a short time period. Vaccination is the best option to prevent and minimize the effects of influenza outbreaks. Rapid selection of a well-matched influenza vaccine strain is the key to developing an effective vaccination program. However, this is a non-trivial task due to three major challenges in influenza vaccine strain selection: labor an time intensive virus isolation and serology-based antigenic characterization, poor growth of selected strains in chicken embryonic eggs during production, and biased sampling in influenza surveillance. Each year, many scientists worldwide, including thousands from the United States, are working altogether to select an optimal vaccine strain. However, incorrect vaccine strains have still been frequently chosen in the past decades.  Recent advances in genomic sequencing allow us to rapidly and economically sequence influenza genomes from the isolates and from the clinical samples. Sequencing influenza genomes has become a routine and important component in influenza surveillance. The objectives of this project are to develop a sequence-based strategy for influenza antigenic variant identification and to optimize vaccine strain selection using genomic data. To achieve these aims, we will develop machine learning based computational methods to estimate antigenic distances among influenza viruses by directly using their genome sequences. We will then identify the key residues and mutations in influenza genomes affecting influenza antigenic drift events. Such information will allow us to select most promising virus strains as candidates for vaccine production. Since economical virus production requires the selected virus strains to grow easily in chicken embryonic eggs, we also propose the development of a machine learning based method that can predict the growth ability of a virus strain based on its sequence information. This integrated genome based influenza vaccine strain selection system will be developed for detecting antigenic variants for influenza A viruses.  This project will help us provide fundamental technology that employs genomic signatures determining influenza antigenicity and growth ability in chicken embryonic eggs, which are the two key issues for efficient and effective influenza vaccine strain development. The resulting genome based vaccine strain selection strategy will significantly reduce the human labor needed for serological characterization, decrease the time required to select an effective strain that will grow well in eggs, and increase the likelihood of correct influenza vaccine candidate selection. Thus, this project will lead to significant technological advances in influenza prevention and control.

"Statistical methods for real-time forecasts of infectious disease: dynamic time-series and machine learning approaches PROJECT SUMMARY The past decade of biomedical research has borne witness to rapid growth in data and computational methods. A fundamental challenge for the scientific community in the 21st century is learning how to turn this deluge of data into evidence that can inform decision-making about improving health and preventing illness at the individual and population levels. The emerging field of real-time infectious disease forecasting is a prime example of a research area with great potential for leveraging modern analytical methods to maximize the impact on public health. Infectious diseases exact an enormous toll on global health each year. Improved real- time forecasts of infectious disease outbreaks can inform targeted intervention and prevention strategies, such as increased healthcare staffing or vector control measures. However we currently have a limited understanding of the best ways to integrate these types of forecasts into real-time public health decision- making. The central research activities of this project are (1) to develop and validate a suite of robust, real-time statistical prediction models for infectious diseases, (2) we will develop and evaluate an ensemble time-series prediction methodology for integrating multiple prediction models into a single forecast, and (3) to develop a collaborative platform for dissemination and evaluation of predictions by different research teams. Additionally, we will develop a suite of open-source educational modules to train researchers and public health officials in developing, validating, and implementing time-series forecasting, with a focus on real-time infectious disease applications.

"Enhanced Detection System for Healthcare-Associated Transmission of Infection ABSTRACT Despite recent progress in reducing the incidence of healthcare-associated infections (HAIs), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimated that 722,000 HAIs occurred in U.S. acute care hospitals in 2011, resulting in 75,000 deaths. Current methods for detecting outbreaks in hospitals are rudimentary and likely to miss some outbreaks altogether and result in substantial delays in detection of others. There are two major developments in healthcare that have the potential to revolutionize how healthcare associated outbreaks of bacterial pathogens are identified and controlled in hospitals. First, the Affordable Care Act mandates use of the electronic medical record (EMR), which has led to its widespread use in healthcare. Second, the costs of bacterial whole genome sequencing (WGS) have declined substantially, which is making its use by infection programs increasingly feasible. In this application, we propose to establish and evaluate the impact of the Enhanced Detection System for Healthcare Association Transmission (EDS-HAT) at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC). EDS-HAT uses a combination of WGS and analysis of the EMR for enhanced outbreak detection. Our specific aims are to 1a): Determine the utility of EDS-HAT to identify HAT that is not identified through routine infection prevention practice, 1b): Improve the efficiency and reduce the cost of EDS-HAT by using the EMR to restrict the use of WGS, 2a): Measure reductions in HAIs following implementation of EDS-HAT, and 2b): Estimate the number of infections and deaths prevented and healthcare costs averted by EDS-HAT. For Aim 1a, EDS-HAT will be performed retrospectively while routine infection prevention practice (requests for molecular typing when an outbreak is suspected) continues, thus allowing a direct comparison of the two approaches. For Aim 1b, we will improve the efficiency and reduce the cost of EDS-HAT by using machine learning and data mining of the EMR to select isolates for WGS. For Aim 2a, we will monitor changes in HAI rates both before and after implementation of EDS-HAT in real time, which will occur at the beginning of year 3. Finally, for Aim 2b, we will perform clinical and budget impact analyses to determine the overall impact of EDS-HAT. To accomplish these aims, we have assembled a team with expertise in infectious diseases, outbreak investigation, infection prevention, microbial genomics and genomic epidemiology, machine learning and data mining, economic analysis and modeling, epidemiology, and biostatistics. EDS-HAT will likely lead to substantial reductions in infections, deaths, and healthcare costs and can serve as a model for how HAT is detected in hospitals. PROJECT NARRATIVE Outbreak detection in most hospitals uses outdated methods. The declining costs of whole genome sequencing (WGS) of bacterial pathogens and the wide-spread use of the electronic medical record (EMR) provide a unique opportunity to enhance outbreak detection in hospitals and therefore reduce the number of infections. Accordingly, we propose to establish the Enhanced Detection System for Healthcare Association Transmission (EDS-HAT), which uses routine WGS of bacterial pathogens and machine learning and data mining of the EMR to dramatically increase capacity to detect healthcare-associated outbreaks.",Enhanced Detection System for Healthcare-Associated Transmission of Infection,9214494,R01AI127472,"['Acinetobacter baumannii', 'Acute', 'Affordable Care Act', 'Bacterial Infections', 'Biometry', 'Budgets', 'Caring', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Cessation of life', 'Charge', 'Clinical', 'Clostridium difficile', 'Code', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Economics', 'Enterobacter aerogenes bacterium', 'Enterobacter cloacae', 'Enterococcus faecalis', 'Enterococcus faecium', 'Epidemiology', 'Escherichia coli', 'Event', 'Exposure to', 'Extended-spectrum β-lactamase', 'Genomics', 'Geographic Locations', 'Health Care Costs', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hospitals', 'Incidence', 'Infection', 'Infection prevention', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Investigation', 'Klebsiella pneumonia bacterium', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Microbiology', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Nosocomial Infections', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Presbyterian Church', 'Prevention', 'Prevention program', 'Procedures', 'Pseudomonas aeruginosa', 'Records', 'Research', 'Sequence Analysis', 'Source', 'Time', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Vancomycin resistant enterococcus', 'base', 'cost', 'data mining', 'disorder prevention', 'enteric pathogen', 'falls', 'foodborne outbreak', 'genome sequencing', 'improved', 'innovation', 'meetings', 'methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus', 'microbial', 'pathogen', 'prevent', 'programs', 'prospective', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'whole genome']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2016,762222,0.047270506818474146
"Host and Microbial Biomarkers Related to the Development of Complicated Clostridium difficile Infection ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is implicated in nearly 3 million cases of diarrhea and colitis in the U.S. each year. CDI, which disproportionately affects older adults, can result in fulminant, life-threatening colitis and lead to multiple recurrnt episodes. There is an urgent need for validated biomarker-based clinical decision-making tools to predict which patients will experience adverse outcomes from CDI. There is a gap in knowledge regarding which known and yet to-be-discovered biomarkers, derived from the host, microbiome and pathogen, will best predict complications and recurrence. Our long-term goal is to develop and validate accurate risk-prediction models for adverse outcomes following CDI that can be used to guide therapy. The next step in pursuit of that goal, and our overall objective for the proposed research, is to discover new candidate biomarkers and determine which ones together best predict complicated CDI in an adjusted model. Our central hypothesis is that a biomarker-based model will better predict complicated CDI compared to models based on clinical variables alone. To address this hypothesis we propose three specific aims: 1) validate host biomarkers previously shown to associate with complicated CDI; 2) discover novel microbial biomarkers for complicated CDI; and 3) develop a candidate biomarker-based predictive model for complicated CDI. We will collect sera and stool prospectively in a cohort of older adults to determine if characteristics of the microbiome, microbial features of C. difficile, levels of antitoxin antibodies, and/or inflammatory mediators associate with complications. Multivariable models will be constructed using linear regression and machine learning techniques and model diagnostics will be used to generate a final portable, biomarker-based predictive model for use in future studies. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is implicated in nearly 3 million cases of diarrhea and colitis in the U.S. each year. We currently lack a complete understanding as to why certain patients with CDI progress to severe disease with increased complications, including death, while others recover. Our research proposes to discovery objective, readily obtainable indicators from serum/stool that predict adverse outcomes from CDI early after initial disease onset. It is envisioned that this could lead to a paradigm-shift in management by directing specific treatment strategies, including more costly therapeutics such as antibody treatment, fecal transplant and newer antibiotics, towards patients who would most benefit. This research takes the first steps towards development of a biomarker-based predictive tool to aid clinicians in treatment decisions.",Host and Microbial Biomarkers Related to the Development of Complicated Clostridium difficile Infection,9094678,R21AI120599,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Aftercare', 'Age', 'Antibiotics', 'Antibodies', 'Antitoxins', 'Bacterial Toxins', 'Biological Markers', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clostridium difficile', 'Colitis', 'Colon', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diarrhea', 'Disease', 'Elderly', 'Feces', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'HGF gene', 'Health', 'Infection', 'Inflammation Mediators', 'Interleukin-8', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Leukocyte L1 Antigen Complex', 'Life', 'Linear Models', 'Linear Regressions', 'Loop ileostomy', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Monoclonal Antibodies', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Onset of illness', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Patients', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Recurrence', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Retrieval', 'Ribosomal RNA', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sequence Analysis', 'Serum', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Toxin', 'Transplantation', 'Work', 'adverse outcome', 'aged', 'base', 'candidate marker', 'clinical decision-making', 'cohort', 'data reduction', 'experience', 'fecal transplantation', 'high risk', 'microbial', 'microbial host', 'microbiome', 'microbiota', 'mortality', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'pathogen', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive tools', 'procalcitonin', 'prospective', 'secondary outcome', 'specific biomarkers', 'tool', 'treatment strategy']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R21,2016,193750,-0.0042308659372232325
"Breath Volatile Metabolites for the Diagnosis of Emerging Invasive Mold Infection DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This resubmission K23 proposal outlines a five-year development plan for Sophia Koo to achieve independence as a patient-oriented clinician-scientist with particular expertise in the development and assessment of novel diagnostic modalities for invasive mold infections (IMI). The strategy outlined in this proposal will enable Dr. Koo to build upon her clinical background in caring for patients at risk for IMI and her clinicl research defining the limitations of currently available diagnostic modalities for these infections by taking advantage of the unique clinical and research strengths of Brigham and Women's Hospital and the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, biomedical engineering and bioinformatics capabilities of the Charles Stark Draper Laboratory, and epidemiology, biostatistics, and analytical chemistry training opportunities at the Harvard School of Public Health, Northeastern University, and Massachusetts Institute of Technology. She will be co-mentored by Dr. Lindsey Baden, Associate Professor of Medicine at Harvard Medical School, and Dr. Earl Francis Cook, Professor of Epidemiology at the Harvard School of Public Health. Dr. Baden is an expert in fungal diagnostics, and Dr. Cook is an expert in study design and statistical learning/data mining, including analysis of highly dimensional biomarker data. Dr. Koo will also work closely with Drs. Daniel Kuritzkes, Raphael Dolin, Francisco Marty, John Perfect, and John Wingard, who will provide career guidance and scientific advice on the execution of the proposed research plan, and her collaborators Drs. Paul Vouros, Terence Risby, and James Comolli, who will contribute their expertise in analytical chemistry and breath analysis to her research plan. The research program will employ analytical chemistry and statistical supervised learning approaches to define volatile organic compound (VOC) metabolite patterns of emerging invasive mold species in vitro and in patient breath to lay the groundwork for a noninvasive, point-of-care breath test for patients with emerging IMI. Specifically, this program proposes (1) a detailed definition of the VOC metabolome of the Mucorales, Fusarium, and Scedosporium species that most commonly cause human IMI, and (2) the prospective collection of VOC metabolites in the breath of patients with emerging IMI, patients with clinical and radiographic findings suggestive of an emerging IMI, and patients with respiratory tract colonization by these molds, with derivation and validation of VOC feature support vector machine classification algorithms to discriminate patients with emerging IMI from patients with other fungal infections or non-fungal pulmonary processes. Current diagnostic modalities for these infections are inadequate and often unacceptably morbid, and development of this novel, noninvasive diagnostic approach should allow earlier diagnosis of these infections than currently possible, prospective surveillance in the growing population of patients at risk for emerging IMI, more rational targeting of antifungal therapy, and improved clinical outcomes. Project Narrative Invasive mold infections are highly morbid and often fatal in the growing population of patients with compromised immune systems. The proposed research seeks to overcome the significant limitations of currently available diagnostic methods for these infections by developing a novel, noninvasive test that identifies unique volatile compounds in the breath of patients with these infections. Development of this sensitive fungal breath test will allow better surveillance and targeting of antifungal therapy in patients at risk for these infections and ultimately, improved patient outcomes.",Breath Volatile Metabolites for the Diagnosis of Emerging Invasive Mold Infection,9108235,K23AI097225,"['Agriculture', 'Algorithms', 'Analytical Chemistry', 'Antifungal Agents', 'Antifungal Therapy', 'Area', 'Aspergillosis', 'Aspergillus', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Markers', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Biometry', 'Biopsy', 'Breath Tests', 'Cereals', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Collection', 'Comorbidity', 'Complex Mixtures', 'Dana-Farber Cancer Institute', 'Data', 'Derivation procedure', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Disease', 'Dolin', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Environmental Health', 'Epidemiology', 'European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer', 'Exhalation', 'Fingerprint', 'Fusarium', 'Gas Chromatography', 'Gases', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Hematopoietic stem cells', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Immune system', 'Immunocompromised Host', 'Immunosuppressive Agents', 'In Vitro', 'Incidence', 'Industry', 'Infection', 'Institutes', 'Institution', 'Investigation', 'Kinetics', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Lung', 'Lung nodule', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Massachusetts', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Metabolism', 'Modality', 'Molds', 'Mucorales', 'Mucormycosis', 'Mycoses', 'Nutritional', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Organ Transplantation', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Pneumonia', 'Population', 'Process', 'Public Health Schools', 'Regimen', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Respiratory System', 'Respiratory tract structure', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Scedosporium', 'Scientist', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sodium Glutamate', 'Solid', 'Specimen', 'Spectrometry', 'Syndrome', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'The science of Mycology', 'Transplant Recipients', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Vial device', 'Vocational Guidance', 'Woman', 'Work', 'air sampling', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'cooking', 'data mining', 'diagnostic assay', 'improved', 'medical schools', 'metabolic profile', 'metabolome', 'microbial', 'mid-career faculty', 'mortality', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'patient oriented', 'patient population', 'point of care', 'pressure', 'professor', 'programs', 'prospective', 'training opportunity', 'volatile organic compound']",NIAID,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,K23,2016,137160,0.03191490346185556
"Effects of Host Metabolic Variation on Antibiotic Susceptibility ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Host variation affects the pathogenicity of, susceptibility to, and recovery from infectious diseases. Elucidating how the host environment alters antibiotic susceptibility is therefore a critical step towards the long-term goal of realizig precision medicine for the clinical management of infectious diseases. The overall objective of this project is to identify the metabolic pathways participating in antibiotic susceptibility and t determine how host metabolism may affect antibiotic treatments at the site of infection. The working hypothesis is that metabolic processes can function as bacterial control mechanisms for antibiotic susceptibility and that the host metabolome can act on these processes to affect the outcome of antibiotic treatment. This hypothesis will be tested in three specific aims: (1) identif metabolic pathways involved in antibiotic susceptibility (K99 phase); (2) characterize changes in the host metabolome elicited by antibiotic administration (K99 phase); (3) evaluate effects of the host metabolome on antibiotic killing (R00 phase). During the mentored K99 phase, bactericidal antibiotics will be counterscreened with various metabolites to identify metabolic perturbations that can affect antibiotic susceptibility. Metabolic pathways contributing to antibiotic lethality ill be identified by combining this data with metabolic modeling and machine learning. Additionally, plasma and peritoneal fluid will be sampled and metabolomically profiled from a mouse peritoneal infection model, with and without antibiotic treatment. These profiles will be used to determine if antibiotics can alter the host metabolism in ways that may affect antibiotic susceptibility at the site of infection. During the independent R00 phase, the effects of host metabolic variation on antibiotic killing will be systematically tested by quantifying antibiotic susceptibility in synthesized media defined by metabolomic profiles from published and measured human and mouse plasma samples. A better understanding of how the host metabolic environment participates in antibiotic treatment fits NIH's public health mission and has direct implications for the clinical management of infectious diseases. Work from the proposed studies will form a quantitative framework for directly evaluating how host metabolism may affect antibiotic treatment outcomes and guide improved antibiotic stewardship in clinical practice. Although the applicant has significant expertise in systems biology, this award will provide the applicant research training to gain new experimental skills and an opportunity for continued career training and mentorship from an advisory committee comprised of international leaders in systems biology, metabolomics, chemical biology and infectious diseases. The support and training provided by this award and by the advisory committee will provide the applicant tools and expertise critical to his future independent research program.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE (provided by applicant): Host variation alters the clinical response to antibiotic treatment for infectious disease, but the pathways underlying differences in patient outcome have not yet all been elucidated. The proposed research is relevant to public health because it is the first systematic investigation of how host metabolites may act on bacterial pathogen metabolism and alter antibiotic susceptibility.

"New Serological Measures of Infectious Disease Transmission Intensity ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Candidate: Benjamin Arnold    I am an epidemiologist at the University of California, Berkeley. I completed my MA in Biostatistics and a PhD in Epidemiology from UC Berkeley in 2009. Since then, I have worked as an epidemiologist in Professor Jack Colford's group. The opportunity to work as the coordinating epidemiologist for a touchstone, multi-country cluster randomized trial - combined with the addition of two children to my family - led me to delay my academic career. I am now ready to restart my career progress toward independent investigator status.     My long-term career goal is to become a leader in the application of novel statistical methods to target and evaluate interventions that reduce the burden of enteric infections and neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) in low-income countries. This research focus and career objective build from my experience and from a growing collaboration with Dr. Patrick Lammie at the US Centers for Disease Control (CDC) that started in 2013 and has introduced me to seroepidemiologic research. My background in epidemiologic methods, biostatistics, and international field research makes me uniquely qualified to make significant contributions to infectious disease epidemiology at the interface between recent advances in statistical methodology and serological assays.    Environment: University of California, Berkeley    To achieve my career goal, I have developed a training and mentoring plan that focuses on recent advances in statistics (semi-parametric estimation theory and machine learning) and on infectious disease immunology. These are two areas where additional training will open up significant and unique opportunities for me to make meaningful contributions to seroepidemiologic research, and will enable me to launch an independent career as a productive faculty member at UC Berkeley.    I have assembled a multidisciplinary mentoring team of senior investigators in biostatistics and immunology to support my training, research, and career objectives. Mark van der Laan (primary mentor, biostatistics) will guide my training in semi-parametric methods and machine learning. Alan Hubbard (co-mentor, biostatistics) will guide my translation of the methodology to applications for enteric pathogens and NTDs. Patrick Lammie (co-mentor at CDC, immunology) will guide my immunology training and research with his expertise in the immunology of enteric pathogens and NTDs    Research: New Serological Measures of Infectious Disease Transmission    Background: Recent advances in multiplex antigen assays have led to the development of low-cost and sensitive methods to measure enteric pathogens and neglected tropical diseases (NTDs). There have not been commensurate advances in the statistical methods used to derive measures of transmission intensity from antibody response. Translating antibody response into metrics of transmission intensity is a key step from a public health perspective because it enables us to target intervention programs to the populations most in need and then measure the effectiveness of those programs.     Aims and Methods: The overarching goal of this research is to develop a methodologic framework to translate antibody response measured in cross-sectional surveys into measures of transmission intensity for enteric pathogens (7 included in the study, e.g., Cryptosporidium parvum, enterotoxigenic E. coli) and neglected tropical diseases (principal focus: lymphatic filariasis). We approach this goal from two novel perspectives. In Aim 1, we draw on the ""peak shift"" phenomenon for infectious diseases, and hypothesize that changes in transmission will be detectable in the age-specific antibody response curve. At lower transmission, antibody levels should decline across all ages due to fewer and less frequent active infections, leading to an overall shift in the age-specific response curve. We will evaluate the approach by comparing antibody response curves for young children with different exposures (improved vs. unimproved drinking water for enteric pathogens; pre- versus post- mass drug administration for lymphatic filariasis) in large, well characterized cohorts in Kenya, Tanzania, and Haiti.     In Aim 2, we will develop semi-parametric methods to estimate the force of infection (seroconversion rate) from seroprevalence data for pathogens where seroreversion is possible, using lymphatic filariasis as an example. Our new approach marks a significant advance over previous work in this area by making few modeling assumptions and by allowing for the flexible control of confounding between comparison groups. We will evaluate the approach in Haiti by measuring the effect of mass drug administration on the force of infection for lymphatic filariasis For all of the methods, we will create user-friendly, open source software to accelerate translation to applied research.     The Future: This mentored training and research plan represents a natural next step for me on a productive and collaborative path to independence at UC Berkeley. It will set the stage for a broader R01-level research portfolio that applies the newly developed methods to primary research studies that evaluate the impact of interventions on enteric infections, and help target and monitor global elimination efforts for NTDs. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Antibodies measured in blood provide a sensitive measure of infection for many infectious diseases. Statistical methods that enable us to measure disease transmission intensity at the population level from blood antibody levels are an important tool for public health efforts because they help identify populations in greatest need of intervention and help measure the effectiveness of interventions designed to reduce transmission. No statistical tools like this exist for enteric pathogens (those that cause diarrhea) and neglected tropical diseases, which together cause an immense health burden among the world's poorest people, and so we propose to develop new methods to measure population-level transmission intensity of these diseases based on antibodies measured in blood from children in Kenya, Tanzania, and Haiti.",New Serological Measures of Infectious Disease Transmission Intensity,9094553,K01AI119180,"['Age', 'Antibodies', 'Antibody Response', 'Antigens', 'Applied Research', 'Area', 'Biological Assay', 'Biometry', 'Blood', 'California', 'Campylobacter', 'Caregivers', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Child', 'Cluster randomized trial', 'Collaborations', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Computer software', 'Country', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Cryptosporidium', 'Cryptosporidium parvum', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Diarrhea', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Effectiveness of Interventions', 'Entamoeba histolytica', 'Enteral', 'Environment', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Epidemiologist', 'Epidemiology', 'Faculty', 'Family', 'Filarial Elephantiases', 'Future', 'Giardia', 'Goals', 'Haiti', 'Handwashing', 'Health', 'Immune response', 'Immunologist', 'Immunology', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Infectious Disease Epidemiology', 'Infectious Disease Immunology', 'Infectious Diseases Research', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Kenya', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measles', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Mumps', 'Outcome', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Play', 'Population', 'Public Health', 'Qualifying', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Role', 'Rubella', 'Running', 'Salmonella', 'Sanitation', 'Serological', 'Seroprevalences', 'Source', 'Spottings', 'Staging', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Survival Analysis', 'Tanzania', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Universities', 'Vibrio cholerae', 'Viral', 'Water', 'Work', 'base', 'career', 'cohort', 'comparison group', 'cost', 'disease transmission', 'drinking water', 'effectiveness measure', 'enteric pathogen', 'enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'high risk', 'improved', 'intervention effect', 'intervention program', 'low income country', 'member', 'multidisciplinary', 'neglected tropical diseases', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'open source', 'pathogen', 'professor', 'programs', 'public health intervention', 'research study', 'response', 'seroconversion', 'seropositive', 'skills', 'statistics', 'theories', 'therapy design', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'user-friendly']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,K01,2016,141588,0.05286467334922849
"Models for synthesising molecular, clinical and epidemiological data, and transla DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A mathematical or computational model of infectious disease transmission represents the process of how an infection spreads from one person to another. Such models have a long history within infectious disease epidemiology, and are useful tools for giving insight into the dynamics of epidemics and for evaluating the potential effect of control methods. The overall objective of this project is to substantially improve the methods by which models of infectious diseases transmission are calibrated against biological and disease surveillance data. This will both improve the utility of models as tools for analyzing data on infectious disease outbreaks (for instance to provide more rapid and reliable estimates of how transmissible and lethal a new virus is to public health agencies) and also improve the reliability of models as tools for predicting the likely effect of different interventions (such as vaccines or case isolation) to help policy makers make more informed decisions about control policies. As with many areas of biology and medicine, the data landscape for infectious diseases modeling is changing rapidly. Larger and more complex datasets are becoming available that cover many different aspects of the interaction between a pathogen and the human population: clinical episode data, genetic data about fast-evolving pathogens; animal-model transmission data and community-based representative serological data. The specific aims of our project are to: (a) develop new machine-learning based methods to discover interesting patterns in complex datasets related to the transmission of infectious disease, so as to better specify subsequent mechanistic mathematical or computational models; (b) derive new approaches for using more than one type of data simultaneously to calibrate transmission models and (c) derive new methods of parameter estimation for simulations which model the spatial spread of infection or model both the transmission and genetic evolution of a pathogen. We will achieve these aims in the applied context of research on three key infections: emerging infectious diseases (such as MERS-CoV - the novel coronavirus currently spreading in the Middle East), influenza and Streptococcus pneumonia (a major bacterial pathogen). Examples of the scientific questions we will address that cannot be answered with current methods are: (i) how many unobserved cases of MERS-CoV have occurred so far (to be answered using data on case clusters data, the spatial distribution of cases and viral genetic sequences)? (ii) how many people in different age groups are infected with influenza each year and how does their immune system respond to infection (to be answered using data on case incidence and serological testing of the population)? (iii) how much is vaccination coupled with prescribing practices influencing the emergence of resistant strains of pneumococcus (to be addressed with data on antibiotic and vaccine use, case incidence and bacterial strain frequency)? PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Mathematical and computational models of infectious disease spread can provide valuable information to aid policy-makers in the tough choices they face when trying to control infectious diseases, but models must be designed to make the best possible use of the often limited data available. As the digital footprints of our lives grow, so te datasets available for infectious disease models become larger and more complex. This project will develop new algorithms and methods to allow models to make better use of all available data and therefore better inform control policy planning for diseases such as: influenza, pneumococcal infection and novel viruses like MERS-CoV.","Models for synthesising molecular, clinical and epidemiological data, and transla",9099895,U01GM110721,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Model', 'Antibiotics', 'Antigenic Variation', 'Area', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Coronavirus', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Economics', 'Emerging Communicable Diseases', 'Epidemic', 'Epidemiology', 'Evolution', 'Face', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Generations', 'Generic Drugs', 'Genetic', 'Genotype', 'Health', 'Hospitalization', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune system', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Infectious Disease Epidemiology', 'Influenza', 'Influenza A virus', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Middle East', 'Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Monte Carlo Method', 'Movement', 'Natural History', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Phenotype', 'Pneumococcal Infections', 'Policies', 'Policy Maker', 'Population', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Serologic tests', 'Serological', 'Shapes', 'Site', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Specificity', 'Stream', 'Streptococcus pneumoniae', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Vaccination', 'Vaccines', 'Variant', 'Virus', 'Work', 'age group', 'base', 'contextual factors', 'data exchange', 'data mining', 'design', 'digital', 'disease natural history', 'disease transmission', 'epidemiological model', 'forest', 'genetic evolution', 'improved', 'infectious disease model', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'mathematical model', 'meetings', 'mortality', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'novel virus', 'pandemic influenza', 'pathogen', 'predictive modeling', 'resistant strain', 'seasonal influenza', 'simulation', 'social', 'surveillance data', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'virus genetics']",NIGMS,U OF L IMPERIAL COL OF SCI/TECHNLGY/MED,U01,2016,418572,0.06874227544925647
"Genetic predictors of anti-TNF treatment response and infections in IBD DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) affect over 1.4 million Americans. Over the past 15 years, considerable progress has been made in the therapy of CD and UC with monoclonal antibodies against tumor necrosis factor � (anti-TNF) representing the most significant therapeutic breakthrough. However, many patients fail to respond adequately. Recent genome wide associations studies (GWAS) have significantly increased our understanding of the pathogenesis of CD and UC. The role of these genetic variants in predicting response to anti-TNF therapy is yet to be defined adequately. In addition, significant safety concerns remain with the use of these agents with serious infections occurring in up to 10% of patients. There is a strong genetic component to susceptibility to infections, in particular involving polymorphisms in innate immunity. Given the key role of innate immunity in IBD pathogenesis, whether such shared polymorphisms also influence risk of infections on anti-TNF therapy has not been examined previously. Thus, the development of tools to define likelihood of treatment response and infections are a key unmet need in the field. Our overarching objective is to identify clinical and genetic predictors of both short-term and long-term response as well as infectious complications of anti-TNF therapy. To achieve these aims, we will utilize the complementary strengths of two large cohorts - a prospective registry cohort of over 1200 patients with CD or UC, and a novel EMR-based cohort of over 11,000 patients with CD or UC linked to a biospecimen repository. This proposal utilizes the mentorship and significant expertise in key areas including analytical genetics, translational immunology, and bioinformatics and allows the candidate to develop fundamental skills in these novel content areas and research methods. The access to expertise at the NIH-funded center Informatics for Integrating Biology and the Bedside, the Center for Study of Inflammatory Bowel Disease, and the Broad Institute is a key strength of this application. This career development award will be critical in providing training in bioinformatics and genetic epidemiology, thus contributing to the candidate's long-term goal of establishing an independent IBD research career with focus on defining at-risk cohorts and personalizing therapy. The training component of the award includes graduate-level courses in the relevant content areas in genetic epidemiology, and bioinformatics at the Harvard Medical School, School of Public Health, and Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The candidate will continue to actively engage with an established group of multidisciplinary researchers who have demonstrated the utility of the EMR-based approach to accurately define autoimmune diseases, link it to biospecimen collection, and use it successfully for genotyping-phenotype research. This will help foster collaborative development of future proposals as the work proposed in this application has the potential for applicability in other cohorts. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The novel information gained from this study regarding genetic predictors of treatment response and infectious complications has the potential to transform clinical practice by leading to clinical trials focused on selected cohorts of patients most likely to respond to therapies with low risk of adverse events, thus preventing unnecessary exposure to potentially toxic therapies with low likelihood of benefit. Such work is a step toward developing personalized medicine approaches to tailor therapy based on likelihood of benefit and risk. The methodology developed here will also have applications in other EMR-based cohorts to investigate novel therapeutic agents and disease outcomes.",Genetic predictors of anti-TNF treatment response and infections in IBD,9070599,K23DK097142,"['Address', 'Adverse event', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Anti-Tumor Necrosis Factor Therapy', 'Antibodies', 'Area', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Award', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biology', 'CD14 gene', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collection', 'Comorbidity', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Crohn&apos', 's disease', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Disease remission', 'Exposure to', 'Fostering', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Research', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human Genetics', 'IL1R1 gene', 'Immune response', 'Immunology', 'Immunosuppressive Agents', 'Infection', 'Inflammatory Bowel Diseases', 'Informatics', 'Institutes', 'Institution', 'Interferons', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Massachusetts', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Monoclonal Antibodies', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Natural Immunity', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Pneumonia', 'Predisposition', 'Public Health Schools', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Sepsis', 'Source', 'Structure', 'TNF gene', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Training', 'Treatment outcome', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor Therapy', 'Ulcerative Colitis', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'adaptive immunity', 'base', 'career', 'clinical practice', 'clinical predictors', 'cohort', 'cost', 'genetic epidemiology', 'genetic predictors', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'immune function', 'medical schools', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'patient registry', 'personalized medicine', 'predicting response', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'repository', 'response', 'skills', 'tool development', 'translational genetics', 'treatment response']",NIDDK,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,K23,2016,169572,0.0056022998189181085
"A Framework for Integrating Multiple Data Sources for Modeling and Forecasting of Infectious Diseases DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): I am trained as a computational biologist and statistician, and I am currently a postdoctoral fellow at Boston Children's Hospital, Harvard Medical School. My main career goal is to become an independent researcher at a major research institution. I plan to continue my current research pursuits in global health and infectious diseases. Specifically, I aim to continue developing mathematical and computational approaches for modeling to understand disease transmission, forecasting future dynamics and evaluating interventions for public policy decisions. As a postdoctoral research fellow, I have had the wonderful opportunity of working with data from multiple sources. Although several of these data streams could be labeled as ""Big Data"", I typically work with the data after it is already processed, filtered and aggregated to a daily or weekly resolution. While I have developed the necessary skills for modeling these already processed data, there are three important areas where I require additional training, mentoring, and experience: (1) advanced computational skills especially in the use of high performance computing and informatics tools, (2) techniques in computational machine learning and data mining necessary for data acquisition and processing, and (3) biostatistical methodology needed for the statistical design of studies involving big data. These three training and mentoring aims would enable me to develop the skills necessary to become an independent investigator in Big Data Science for biomedical research. Boston Children's School and Harvard Medical School are leading institutions in translational biomedical research, thereby making them the ideal environment to pursue the training and research aims in this proposal. The recent emergence of infectious diseases such as the avian influenza H7N9 in China, and re-emergence of diseases such as polio in Syria underscores the importance of strengthening immunization and emergency response programs for the prevention and control of infectious diseases. Researchers have developed computational and mathematical models to capture determinants of infectious disease dynamics and identify factors that support prediction of these dynamics, provide estimates of disease risk, and evaluate various intervention scenarios. While these studies have been extremely useful for the understanding of infectious disease transmission and control, most have been disease specific and solely used data from traditional disease surveillance systems. In contrast, there is a huge amount of internet-based data that have been extensively assessed and validated for public health surveillance in the last decade, but it has been scarcely used in conjunction with other data sources for modeling to predict disease spread. Using these novel digital event-based data sources in combination with climate and case data from traditional disease surveillance systems, we will establish a much needed framework for integrating these disparate data sources for modeling to estimate disease risk and forecasting temporal dynamics of infectious diseases. Our approach will be achieved through three aims. The first objective is to develop an automated process for acquiring, processing and filtering data for modeling (Aim 1). Once we gather this data, we will develop temporal models for the dynamical assessment of the relationship between the various data variables and infectious disease incidence (Aim 2). Finally, we will assess the utility of the modeling approaches developed under Aim 2 for forecasting temporal trends of infectious diseases (Aim 3). Through data acquisition, thorough processing, statistical and epidemiological modeling, and guided by advisers with expertise in biomedical informatics, computer science and statistics, we plan to achieve a comprehensive approach to integrating multiple data streams for modeling to forecast infectious diseases. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Although there have been significant medical and technological advances towards infectious disease prevention, surveillance and control, infectious diseases still account for an estimated 15 million deaths each year worldwide. Reliable forecasts of infectious disease dynamics can influence decisions regarding prioritization of limited resources during outbreaks, optimization of disease interventions and implementation of rigorous surveillance processes for quicker case identification and control of emerging disease outbreaks. Our goal is therefore to develop a data mining/informatics framework that leverages the huge amount of digital event-based data sources in combination with climate data, and data from traditional disease surveillance systems for modeling and forecasting infectious diseases.",A Framework for Integrating Multiple Data Sources for Modeling and Forecasting of Infectious Diseases,9123353,K01ES025438,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Area', 'Avian Influenza', 'Big Data', 'Biological Models', 'Biomedical Research', 'Boston', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Cessation of life', 'Child', 'China', 'Climate', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Dengue', 'Detection', 'Disease', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Disease model', 'Emergency response', 'Emerging Communicable Diseases', 'Environment', 'Epidemic', 'Epidemiology', 'Event', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'High Performance Computing', 'Human', 'Humidity', 'Immunization', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Influenza', 'Influenza A Virus, H1N1 Subtype', 'Influenza A Virus, H7N9 Subtype', 'Informatics', 'Institution', 'International', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Label', 'Linear Models', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Poliomyelitis', 'Population Surveillance', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Prevention program', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Public Policy', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Proposals', 'Research Training', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Review Literature', 'Schools', 'Series', 'Source', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Stream', 'Syria', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Temperature', 'Time', 'Training', 'Weight', 'Work', 'World Health Organization', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'career', 'climate data', 'computer science', 'computerized data processing', 'data acquisition', 'data integration', 'data mining', 'data modeling', 'digital', 'disease transmission', 'disorder control', 'disorder prevention', 'disorder risk', 'epidemiological model', 'experience', 'global health', 'improved', 'infectious disease model', 'mathematical model', 'medical schools', 'model building', 'news', 'novel', 'pandemic influenza', 'skills', 'social media', 'statistics', 'tool', 'trend', 'web based interface']",NIEHS,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,K01,2016,107469,0.036727707187541835
"Systems Biology Approach to Redefine Susceptibility Testing and Treatment of MDR Pathogens in the Context of Host Immunity   Project Summary    For something as complex and multifaceted as bacterial antibiotic resistance (AR), our drug evaluation  paradigm is strikingly narrow and homogenous: MIC/MBC testing in standardized bacteriologic media. We  have shown that this drug evaluation paradigm is inadequate, even misleading, as changes in the media  conditions of the procedure lead to dramatically different results. A more holistic definition of antibiotic therapy  that centers on understanding antibiotic activity in synergy with host innate immune factors such as cationic  antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), serum and phagocytic cells (e.g. neutrophils) reveals therapeutic options

systems biology approaches and inform more effective antibiotic utilization in the context of host innate

workflow includes: (i) omics and physiological data generation.  Clinically isolated strains of the selected  pathogens will be grown under conventional testing (bacteriologic media) and more physiologic conditions  (tissue culture media, serum, and in presence of AMPs and neutrophils) to probe for advantageous gain of  activity.  The omics data types collected are: DNA resequencing, RNAseq, and metabolomics.  (ii)  Bioinformatics and data modeling analysis involves three approaches: big data analysis for data set  dimensionality and coarse grained variable dependencies assessment, genome­scale modeling for  mechanistic elucidation and analysis, and machine learning that uses AR­related metadata to classify the  overall biological functions. This analysis will lead to understanding of AR mechanisms.  (iii) Multi­scale  validation from animal models, to laboratory evolution, to cytology, to gene expression alteration, to structural  protein analysis of putative targets. The validation thus ranges from host behavior to atomistic detail of  ligand­target interactions. The iterative loop then closes, comparing computational prediction to experimental  outcomes. False­negative and false­positive predictions are then algorithmically analyzed by a hypothesis

"Metabolomics-based discovery of small molecule biomarkers for noninvasive dengue PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Epidemic dengue fever (DF) and dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF/DSS) have emerged throughout the tropical world with devastating public health consequences. A dramatic increase in severe dengue disease (DEN) in Latin America in the last decade is of grave concern; 30% of cases are now diagnosed as severe dengue virus (DENV) infections. DEN is overwhelming public health capacity for clinical care in much of the developing world. The overall goal of this proposal is to provide a major change in the diagnosis and prognosis (D&P) of DENV infections. A metabolomics approach will be used to identify candidate metabolite small molecule biomarkers (SMBs) that occur both in serum and in non-invasive clinical specimens (urine and saliva) that diagnose DENV infection and predict progression to severe disease. Preliminary studies using acute phase specimens from DEN patients have identified a number of molecular features and candidate SMBs of DF and DHF/SS in serum, saliva, and urine using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS)-based metabolomics. In the R21 phase of this project, we will use a metabolic fingerprinting approach to confim existing and identify new candidate SMBs in retrospectively collected serum specimens available from the high-quality pediatric DEN hospital-based and cohort studies in Nicaragua, will begin to characterize the SMBs and metabolic pathways involved, will investigate the efficacy for D&P of these SMBs in prospectively collected serum, saliva, and urine specimens in the hospital study, and will identify a portfolio of the most significant molecular features that differentiate DEN, severe DEN, and non-DEN disease. We will develop algorithms including SMBs, clinical signs and symptoms, and clinical laboratory results for the D&P of DENV infections. In the R33 phase of the project, prospectively collected serum, saliva, and urine samples from both the hospital study and a community-based cohort study will be analyzed by metabolic profiling using LC-tandem MS (LC- MS/MS) to identify candidate SMBs. First generation EIA tests for selected SMBs will be included in the diagnostic regimen in Nicaragua The diagnostic and prognostic sensitivity and specificity of the candidate SMBs and ""first generation"" SMB tests will be determined as will the preferred clinical specimen for SMB- based diagnoses. Overall these studies will identify a panel of SMBs (e.g., 5-10), which will be used to formulate the Target Product Profiles (TPP) for rapid point-of-care (POC) tests for use in clinics and hospitals for DEN D&P. Detection of SMBs in saliva and urine that are predictive of severe DEN is innovative and provides the opportunity for a true paradigm shift in diagnosis by using inexpensive, easily procured, non- invasive clinical specimens for D&P of DEN. NARRATIVE The studies will exploit liquid chromotography-tandem mass spectrometry to identify small molecule biomarkers (SMBs) in serum, saliva, and urine of DEN patients for both prognosis and diagnosis of DEN infections. This will be of enormous value to physicians and public health workers in the developing world to identify patients at greatest risk for severe DEN for supportive care and early therapeutic intervention, and the use of non-invasive samples will provide a true paradigm shift in DEN diagnosis and patient care. 3",Metabolomics-based discovery of small molecule biomarkers for noninvasive dengue,9207183,R33AI100186,"['Acute', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Bedside Testings', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood specimen', 'California', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Course of Disease', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinics and Hospitals', 'Cohort Studies', 'Colorado', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Country', 'Databases', 'Dengue', 'Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever', 'Dengue Infection', 'Dengue Virus', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Environment', 'Epidemic', 'Fingerprint', 'Funding Mechanisms', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hemorrhagic Shock', 'Hospitals', 'Immunoglobulin M', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Infection', 'Laboratories', 'Latin America', 'Liquid Chromatography', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Pathway', 'Metabolism', 'Mexico', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Weight', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Nicaragua', 'Nicaraguan', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Care Management', 'Patient Triage', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Physiological', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Public Health', 'Qualifying', 'Regimen', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Saliva', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Serum', 'Shock', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Specimen', 'Supportive care', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Tissues', 'Universities', 'Urine', 'amplification detection', 'base', 'candidate marker', 'clinical care', 'disease diagnosis', 'innovation', 'liquid chromatography mass spectrometry', 'metabolic profile', 'metabolomics', 'outcome forecast', 'point-of-care diagnostics', 'prognostic', 'programs', 'prospective', 'small molecule', 'tandem mass spectrometry']",NIAID,COLORADO STATE UNIVERSITY,R33,2016,28614,0.014500737505205285
"Volatile Metabolite-Based Detection of Clostridium difficile Infection ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is a major cause of nosocomial diarrhea and mortality worldwide, increasing dramatically in incidence and severity over the past decade and rivaling or exceeding methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus as the most common healthcare-associated infection in the US. A critical barrier to reducing the nosocomial spread of CDI is the delay in timely identification of CDI cases, with subsequent delays in initiation of appropriate antimicrobial therapy and implementation of contact precautions and isolation measures to reduce horizontal CDI transmission. Despite advances in rapid laboratory-based CDI testing, there are still delays of 2-5 days between the onset of clinical symptoms and stool sampling and another 0.5-3.5 days between sample collection and actionable test results. Anticipating a delay in obtaining diagnostic results, many providers prescribe CDI antimicrobial therapy empirically, resulting in frequent and unnecessary treatment of patients who ultimately test negative for CDI. There is clearly an unmet need for diagnostic methods that can reduce this interval between onset of clinical symptoms and accurate identification of CDI. To address this unmet need, we propose a novel approach to CDI diagnosis based on detection of the volatile metabolome of the altered CDI microbiome. C. difficile flourishes in the antibiotic- disrupted intestinal microbiome and emits a distinctive odo detectable by human and canine olfaction. In a pilot study, we assessed the volatile metabolome of stool specimens from patients with suspected CDI using analytical chemistry techniques and discerned major differences in the stool volatome of patients with and without CDI. We propose two aims executed in parallel, to test the hypothesis that the altered CDI intestinal microbiome has a unique volatile metabolite profile, distinct from the profile of patiens with other causes of antibiotic-associated diarrhea, which can be used to identify patients with CDI in the hospital setting. Using thermal desorption GC-MS/MS to capture and identify these trace volatile metabolites and supervised learning methods - support vector machines, prediction analysis for microarray analysis, and random forests - to analyze this high-dimensional data matrix, we will deconvolute the complex volatome of CDI, (1) identifying the characteristic volatile metabolite profile of stool samples from hospitalized patients with CDI, compared to patients with other antibiotic-associated diarrhea, and (2) defining the CDI volatile metabolite profile in ambient air samples from the inpatient environment of patients with CDI, compared to patients with other antibiotic-associated diarrhea. The ultimate objective of this research is to derive and validate the volatile metabolic signature of CDI in stool samples and in the patient's environment, laying the groundwork for a novel CDI assay that can be coupled to a point-of-care gas sensor system for the bedside identification of CDI, reducing delays in diagnosis and decreasing nosocomial transmission of this common, highly morbid, and life- threatening infection. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is a major cause of healthcare-associated diarrhea and death worldwide, increasing dramatically in incidence and severity over the past decade. The objective of the proposed research is to identify and validate key components of the distinctive volatile metabolic 'scent' of CDI in stool and in air samples from the patient environment, laying the groundwork for a rapid bedside test for the detection of CDI. Such an assay would reduce the interval between the onset of CDI symptoms and diagnosis, allowing earlier treatment of patients with CDI, reducing unnecessary antibiotic use in patients without CDI, and decreasing healthcare-based transmission of this common, life-threatening infection.",Volatile Metabolite-Based Detection of Clostridium difficile Infection,9088345,R21AI119692,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Address', 'Air', 'Analytical Chemistry', 'Antibiotics', 'Antigens', 'Biological Assay', 'Canis familiaris', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clostridium difficile', 'Complex', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Diarrhea', 'Early treatment', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Exotoxins', 'Exposure to', 'Feces', 'Gases', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Hospital Costs', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Infection Control', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Injury', 'Inpatients', 'Institution', 'Intestines', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Length of Stay', 'Life', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Fragmentography', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Microarray Analysis', 'Modeling', 'Nucleic Acid Amplification Tests', 'Odors', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pilot Projects', 'Proliferating', 'Provider', 'Pseudomembranous Colitis', 'Reference Standards', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Sampling', 'Septic Shock', 'Severities', 'Smell Perception', 'Specimen', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Toxic Megacolon', 'Toxin', 'Training', 'Tube', 'accurate diagnosis', 'air sampling', 'antimicrobial', 'base', 'cytotoxicity', 'design', 'forest', 'gut microbiome', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'metabolome', 'methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus', 'microbiome', 'mortality', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'point of care', 'sample collection', 'sensor', 'tertiary care', 'transmission process', 'unnecessary treatment']",NIAID,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R21,2016,221875,0.016918124079325404
"Metabolomics-based discovery of small molecule biomarkers for noninvasive dengue PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Epidemic dengue fever (DF) and dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF/DSS) have emerged throughout the tropical world with devastating public health consequences. A dramatic increase in severe dengue disease (DEN) in Latin America in the last decade is of grave concern; 30% of cases are now diagnosed as severe dengue virus (DENV) infections. DEN is overwhelming public health capacity for clinical care in much of the developing world. The overall goal of this proposal is to provide a major change in the diagnosis and prognosis (D&P) of DENV infections. A metabolomics approach will be used to identify candidate metabolite small molecule biomarkers (SMBs) that occur both in serum and in non-invasive clinical specimens (urine and saliva) that diagnose DENV infection and predict progression to severe disease. Preliminary studies using acute phase specimens from DEN patients have identified a number of molecular features and candidate SMBs of DF and DHF/SS in serum, saliva, and urine using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS)-based metabolomics. In the R21 phase of this project, we will use a metabolic fingerprinting approach to confim existing and identify new candidate SMBs in retrospectively collected serum specimens available from the high-quality pediatric DEN hospital-based and cohort studies in Nicaragua, will begin to characterize the SMBs and metabolic pathways involved, will investigate the efficacy for D&P of these SMBs in prospectively collected serum, saliva, and urine specimens in the hospital study, and will identify a portfolio of the most significant molecular features that differentiate DEN, severe DEN, and non-DEN disease. We will develop algorithms including SMBs, clinical signs and symptoms, and clinical laboratory results for the D&P of DENV infections. In the R33 phase of the project, prospectively collected serum, saliva, and urine samples from both the hospital study and a community-based cohort study will be analyzed by metabolic profiling using LC-tandem MS (LC- MS/MS) to identify candidate SMBs. First generation EIA tests for selected SMBs will be included in the diagnostic regimen in Nicaragua The diagnostic and prognostic sensitivity and specificity of the candidate SMBs and ""first generation"" SMB tests will be determined as will the preferred clinical specimen for SMB- based diagnoses. Overall these studies will identify a panel of SMBs (e.g., 5-10), which will be used to formulate the Target Product Profiles (TPP) for rapid point-of-care (POC) tests for use in clinics and hospitals for DEN D&P. Detection of SMBs in saliva and urine that are predictive of severe DEN is innovative and provides the opportunity for a true paradigm shift in diagnosis by using inexpensive, easily procured, non- invasive clinical specimens for D&P of DEN. NARRATIVE The studies will exploit liquid chromotography-tandem mass spectrometry to identify small molecule biomarkers (SMBs) in serum, saliva, and urine of DEN patients for both prognosis and diagnosis of DEN infections. This will be of enormous value to physicians and public health workers in the developing world to identify patients at greatest risk for severe DEN for supportive care and early therapeutic intervention, and the use of non-invasive samples will provide a true paradigm shift in DEN diagnosis and patient care. 3",Metabolomics-based discovery of small molecule biomarkers for noninvasive dengue,9067927,R33AI100186,"['Acute', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Bedside Testings', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood specimen', 'California', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Course of Disease', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinics and Hospitals', 'Cohort Studies', 'Colorado', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Country', 'Databases', 'Dengue', 'Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever', 'Dengue Infection', 'Dengue Virus', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Environment', 'Epidemic', 'Fingerprint', 'Funding Mechanisms', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hemorrhagic Shock', 'Hospitals', 'Immunoglobulin M', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Infection', 'Laboratories', 'Latin America', 'Liquid Chromatography', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Pathway', 'Metabolism', 'Mexico', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Weight', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Nicaragua', 'Nicaraguan', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Care Management', 'Patient Triage', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Physiological', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Public Health', 'Qualifying', 'Regimen', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Saliva', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Serum', 'Shock', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Specimen', 'Supportive care', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Tissues', 'Universities', 'Urine', 'amplification detection', 'base', 'candidate marker', 'clinical care', 'disease diagnosis', 'innovation', 'liquid chromatography mass spectrometry', 'metabolic profile', 'metabolomics', 'outcome forecast', 'point-of-care diagnostics', 'prognostic', 'programs', 'prospective', 'small molecule', 'tandem mass spectrometry']",NIAID,COLORADO STATE UNIVERSITY,R33,2016,461274,0.014500737505205285
"Genomics-based prediction of antibiotic failure in S. aureus infections ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)    The Gram positive bacterium Staphylococcus aureus is both an asymptomatic human colonizer and a pathogen that can cause infections in multiple tissue sites, including blood, skin and soft tissue, bone, and internal organs. Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is a common cause of death by hospital infections (HA-MRSA) and is now also a common community acquired infection (CA-MRSA). Vancomycin (a glycopeptide antibiotic) is the most commonly prescribed drug to treat MRSA infections. High-level resistance (minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) ≥16 μg/ml) to vancomycin encoded by the mobile vanA gene is rare due to a fitness burden on S. aureus. However, it is more common to encounter strains with mutations conferring intermediate resistance to vancomycin arising from selection during the course of antibiotic therapy. The genetic basis of these vancomycin intermediate S. aureus (VISA) and heterogeneous resistant (hVISA) (MIC 2-8 μg/ml) strains involves a large number of different genomic mutations that result in cell wall thickening through changes in cellular signaling and regulation. Routine phenotypic testing in clinical labs probably underestimates the incidence of VISA and hVISA. Due to the fact that mutations in several genes have been linked with VISA, genetic-based detection of intermediate vancomycin resistance has not been developed for routine clinical microbiological use. In our preliminary work, we created an extensive catalog of sequenced clinical and laboratory-selected VISA as well as databases of SNPs and genetic variation in thousands of public S. aureus genomes. In this work we plan to extend these studies toward development of a sequence-based testing protocol that could be used for large numbers of clinical strains. In Specific Aim 1 we plan to extend our knowledge of the mutations that cause VISA by sequencing a panel of 300 novel mutants strains spontaneously selected from 40 S. aureus parent genotypes. We estimate, based on the results of the preliminary data, that this number of strains will be sufficient identify mutations found in 95% of VISA strains. These data will be used for creation of a comprehensive VISA detection assay based on whole genome data with an accuracy of at least 95%. In Specific Aim 2 we will use the information learned from Aim 1 to create a multiplex PCR sequence test for VISA, VRSA and other resistance determinants of S. aureus based on the commercially available Fluidigm platform. We will ultimately aim to have an assay that can be used to monitor systemic MRSA infections, such as bacteremia, to detect development of VISA in its early stages in clinical specimens from the patient. The test will also be able to detect other S. aureus resistance phenotypes and call the genotype of the strain.             PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    Vancomycin is an antibiotic commonly used to treat methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections in chronically ill patients. The efficacy of this relatively cheap and well-tolerated therapy is compromised by mutations in the genome of the bacterium. In this project we propose to develop a genetic test based on a library of MRSA genome sequences with known antibiotic susceptibility level that identifies bacteria with diminished resistance to vancomycin.            ",Genomics-based prediction of antibiotic failure in S. aureus infections,9017369,R21AI121860,"['Address', 'Antibiotic Resistance', 'Antibiotic Therapy', 'Antibiotic susceptibility', 'Antibiotics', 'Bacteremia', 'Bacteria', 'Base Sequence', 'Biological Assay', 'Blood', 'Cataloging', 'Catalogs', 'Cause of Death', 'Cell Wall', 'Chronically Ill', 'Clinical', 'Community-Acquired Infections', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Drug Prescriptions', 'Evolution', 'Failure', 'Frequencies', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genetic screening method', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Glycopeptide Antibiotics', 'Goals', 'Gram-Positive Bacteria', 'Healthcare', 'Human', 'Incidence', 'Infection', 'Intermediate resistance', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Methicillin', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Mutation', 'Nosocomial Infections', 'Organ', 'Parents', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Protocols documentation', 'Regulation', 'Resistance', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Skin Tissue', 'Specimen', 'Staging', 'Staphylococcus aureus', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Treatment Failure', 'University Hospitals', 'Vancomycin', 'Vancomycin Resistance', 'Vancomycin-resistant S. aureus', 'Variant', 'Virulence', 'Work', 'base', 'bone', 'clinical sequencing', 'design', 'economic cost', 'fitness', 'genetic predictors', 'genetic variant', 'genome sequencing', 'interest', 'methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus', 'mortality', 'mutant', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'pleiotropism', 'public health relevance', 'soft tissue', 'tool', 'whole genome']",NIAID,EMORY UNIVERSITY,R21,2016,234000,0.030661176467140366
"Impact of Gastrointestinal Microbiome on the Host Response to an Effector-Memory T-Cell AIDS Vaccine and Multiple Low-Dose Challenge ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This computational research project will analyze gastrointestinal microbiome, host cellular immune response, and host transcriptional response datasets derived from a large-scale rhesus macaque AIDS vaccine study. The vaccine study includes 70 animals divided into five groups and is designed to test the efficacy of a cytomegalovirus (CMV) vector expressing the major simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) proteins. In previous studies, RhCMV/SIV vaccines elicit a robust effector-memory T cell response. After challenge with highly pathogenic SIVmac239, approximately 50% of RhCMV/SIV-vaccinated monkeys exhibit a pattern of viral control that is characterized by a ""blip"" of viremia followed by control of plasma viremia to undetectable levels. One to three years later, RhCMV/SIV-protected monkeys show no sign of SIV infection, suggesting immune-mediated clearance of the virus. The mechanisms responsible for this 50% efficacy are not clear, but may reflect T cell responses at the site of SIV entry or sites of early replication. Thi project will investigate the role of the gastrointestinal microbiome on RhCMV/SIV-induced effector-memory T cell responses and protection against SIVmac239 challenge. The project includes two computationally based Specific Aims: 1) Define the composition of the gut microbiome prior to and after vaccination and during repeated limiting-dose SIVmac239 challenge; and 2) Determine how the composition of the gut microbiome correlates with protective immune cell responses and vaccine-induced host transcriptional responses. In Aim 1, 16S ribosomal sequence data (obtained from rectal swabs) will be used to determine operational taxonomic units. Variation in bacterial species over time and within individual animals will be determined using Mothur and Qiime metagenomic software.  Nonparametric statistical analyses and co-occurrence and co-exclusion networks will be used to identify bacterial species associated with progression or control of SIV infection after repeated limiting-dose intrarectal SIVmac239 challenge. In Aim 2, principle component analysis will be used to identify associations between microbiome composition and SIV-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses. Gene module-based and correlation network-based approaches will be used to determine associations between microbiome composition and host transcriptional responses (collected from whole blood samples). Together, these analyses will allow us to better understand microbiome-host interactions and their role in eliciting a protective vaccine-derived effector-memory T cell response. Such understanding will inform future vaccination strategies and attempts to modulate microbiome composition to affect vaccine efficacy. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The types and numbers of bacterial species that live in the gastrointestinal tract (together known as the microbiome) affect many aspects of human health and disease, including how individuals respond to vaccination and viral infection. In this study, we will define the gastrointestinal microbiome of rhesus monkeys before and after vaccination with an experimental AIDS vaccine and after infection with a monkey immunodeficiency virus. This study will allow us to determine how the microbiome impacts the effectiveness of the vaccine and may suggest whether altering the microbiome may improve vaccine performance.",Impact of Gastrointestinal Microbiome on the Host Response to an Effector-Memory T-Cell AIDS Vaccine and Multiple Low-Dose Challenge,9267858,R21AI120713,"['AIDS Vaccines', 'Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome', 'Affect', 'Animals', 'Blood specimen', 'CD8B1 gene', 'Cells', 'Communities', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer software', 'Confounding Factors (Epidemiology)', 'Cytomegalovirus', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Diet', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Dose-Limiting', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Exclusion', 'Exhibits', 'Foundations', 'Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gastrointestinal tract structure', 'Gene Expression', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Health', 'Health Sciences', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immunologic Deficiency Syndromes', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Joints', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Life Style', 'Location', 'Macaca mulatta', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Memory', 'Metagenomics', 'Microbiology', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Monkeys', 'National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease', 'Network-based', 'Oregon', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Plasma', 'Process', 'Research', 'Research Assistant', 'Research Project Grants', 'Role', 'SIV', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Site', 'Swab', 'T cell response', 'T memory cell', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Universities', 'Vaccinated', 'Vaccination', 'Vaccine Research', 'Vaccines', 'Variant', 'Viral', 'Viral Proteins', 'Viremia', 'Virus', 'Virus Diseases', 'Washington', 'Whole Blood', 'base', 'design', 'efficacy testing', 'functional genomics', 'gut microbiome', 'improved', 'microbiome', 'nonhuman primate', 'professor', 'rectal', 'response', 'vaccination strategy', 'vaccine development', 'vaccine effectiveness', 'vaccine efficacy', 'vaccine response', 'vaccine trial', 'vaccine-induced immunity', 'vector']",NIAID,NORTH CAROLINA STATE UNIVERSITY RALEIGH,R21,2016,227250,0.002174046046725607
"Systems Biology of Microbiome-mediated Resilience to Antibiotic-resistant Pathogens ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Infections caused by antibiotic-resistant bacterial pathogens are exceedingly common in immunocompromised hosts. Patients undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) are particularly susceptible to these infections and are the patient population our studies will focus upon. Our goal is to extend and further develop systems biology approaches that our group has pioneered to identify mechanisms by which the intestinal microbiota confers resistance to infection by Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE), antibiotic-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (arKp) and Clostridium difficile (C. diff). Aim 1 of our project is to establish a clinical database from the hospital recrds of allo-HSCT patients during their initial hospitalization that will include all laboratory values,vital signs, pharmacy data, dietary data, symptoms and physical exam findings. Aim 2 will expand our fecal bank by collecting fecal samples from approximately 160 allo-HSCT patients per year and determining the presence/absence of VRE, arKp and C. diff by culture and PCR. We will use NGS of 16S rRNA genes to determine microbiota composition on each sample, will perform metagenomic and RNA sequencing to determine the bacterial transcriptome and perform metabolomic analyses on a selected subset of fecal samples. Aim 3 is to extend our mathematical modeling to identify specific members of the microbiota, metabolic pathways and metabolic products that correlate with resistance to VRE or arKp expansion in the GI tract or are associated with resistance to C. diff infection. The clinical database will be used to establish correlations between clinical treatments or events and changes in the intestinal microbiota or the expression of bacterial metabolic pathways. Ultimately, the computational platforms developed in aim 3 will identify bacterial species or consortia that are associated with resistance to infection and Aim 4 will test these associations in germ-free mouse models. We will culture bacterial species associated with resistance, colonize mice with these protective bacteria and test for resistance against VRE, arKp and C. diff. Samples obtained from these experimental studies will be subjected to metagenomic and metabolomic analyses to further refine, in an iterative fashion, computational models developed in aim 3. Our proposed studies will develop new and extend existing computational models to identify bacterial species and molecular mechanisms that confer resistance to antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The normal bacteria inhabiting the human intestine provide a high level of resistance against antibiotic-resistant bacterial pathogens. We are investigating the intestinal flora of hospitalized patients and using mathematical modeling to identify bacterial species and their metabolic products that reduce the risk of infection by three prevalent antibiotic-resistant bacteria. These studies may lead to the development of new approaches to treat and prevent antibiotic-resistant infections.        ",Systems Biology of Microbiome-mediated Resilience to Antibiotic-resistant Pathogens,9108539,U01AI124275,"['Allogenic', 'Antibiotic Resistance', 'Antibiotic Therapy', 'Antibiotics', 'Bacteria', 'Bacterial Antibiotic Resistance', 'Bacterial Infections', 'Categories', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Clostridium difficile', 'Collection', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Diet', 'Dietary intake', 'Enrollment', 'Event', 'Feces', 'Gastrointestinal tract structure', 'Germ-Free', 'Gnotobiotic', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immunocompromised Host', 'Infection', 'Integration Host Factors', 'Intestinal Content', 'Intestines', 'Klebsiella pneumonia bacterium', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurable', 'Mediating', 'Medical Records', 'Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Pathway', 'Metagenomics', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacy facility', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Resistance', 'Resistance to infection', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Systems Biology', 'Testing', 'Toxic effect', 'Transplantation', 'Uncertainty', 'Vancomycin Resistance', 'Vancomycin resistant enterococcus', 'antimicrobial drug', 'commensal microbes', 'computer studies', 'design', 'falls', 'gut microbiota', 'immune activation', 'mathematical model', 'member', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'metagenome', 'metagenomic sequencing', 'microbiome', 'microbiota', 'microorganism interaction', 'mouse model', 'network models', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'pathogen', 'patient population', 'physical symptom', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'rRNA Genes', 'research study', 'resilience', 'resistance mechanism', 'text searching', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics']",NIAID,SLOAN-KETTERING INST CAN RESEARCH,U01,2016,1722908,0.06710694682823037
"Comprehensive analysis of human adaptive immune receptors to elucidate correlates of Epstein-Barr virus disease suppression Project Summary/Abstract This project will develop a new technological approach for the comprehensive analysis of adaptive immune responses, which holds the potential to catalyze new strategies to prevent and treat disease. Here we will apply immune profiling techniques recently invented by the PI to investigate the mechanisms of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) adaptive immune control in clinical cohorts of infected patients. EBV is a highly prevalent pathogen infecting >90% of the world’s population. Primary EBV infection often causes infectious mononucleosis (IM) and long-term sequelae include numerous malignancies, lymphoproliferative disorders, and a strong association with multiple sclerosis. No EBV vaccine is approved to date, and the molecular mechanisms of immune protection from EBV-associated diseases are unclear. Unfortunately, prior technical barriers in high- throughput immune profiling methods have prevented a comprehensive understanding of adaptive immune protection against EBV diseases. A technological approach that identifies the critical features of EBV immune protection will advance new solutions for vaccine and therapeutic development. Therefore, we developed an experimental pipeline to enable rapid and cost-effective analysis of B- and T-cell responses to EBV that is scalable to dozens of human patients per experiment. We hypothesize that a comprehensive B- and T-cell analysis of carefully selected patient cohorts that either can or cannot suppress symptomatic infection will reveal function-based correlates of EBV control. To test this hypothesis, we will apply quantitative immune profiling technologies to analyze cryopreserved longitudinal samples from recently completed prospective clinical studies of IM. Patient samples in our cohort span pre- and post-infection through convalescence and encompass the full range of clinical IM severity scores (from 0, asymptomatic primary infection, to 6, essentially bedridden with IM). Immune profile data will be used to establish adaptive immune correlates of IM disease severity. In addition, we will analyze immune responses in apparently immunocompetent patients with chronic active EBV (CAEBV) disease, or patients who do not adequately suppress EBV infection, to gain insight regarding adaptive immune function and dysfunction in CAEBV. Finally, we will develop a new computational toolkit to rapidly identify immune correlates from high-throughput datasets. Successful completion of this project will constitute the first comprehensive functional B- and T-cell receptor analysis in a human clinical cohort. Our efforts will provide a repertoire-scale, mechanistic understanding of adaptive immunity to EBV and suggest new strategies for treatment and prevention of EBV-associated diseases. Our long-term goal is to develop human immune profiling techniques as a platform approach to accelerate the rational design of vaccines and therapeutics against pathogens of high public health importance, beginning with EBV. Project Narrative This project will apply new high-throughput immune profiling technologies to elucidate the features of effective Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) immune control. EBV causes a range of human diseases including infectious mononucleosis and several forms of cancer; however, limited EBV treatment options are available and no approved preventive EBV vaccines exist.

"New Tools for the interpretation of Pathogen Genomic Data with a focus on Mycobacterium tuberculosis ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)    Maha R Farhat, MD is an Instructor of Medicine at Harvard Medical School on the tenure track and a staff physician in the Department of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine at Massachusetts General Hospital. She is completing a masters of biostatistics at the Harvard School of Public Health in 5/2015. She has spent the last 4.5 years acquiring skills in Mycobacterium tuberculosis biology, epidemiology, bioinformatics and biostatistics. She has experience in the analysis of whole genome sequence data, drug resistance data and patient clinical outcome data with the focus of identifying Mycobacterium tuberculosis genetic determinants of drug resistance. She has also developed new methods in this area. Dr. Farhat has 11 publications 5 of which are first author including high impact and highly cited work in the journals Nature Genetics, Genome Medicine and the International Journal of Tuberculosis and Lung Disease. The short term goals of this K01 award are to provide training for Dr. Farhat in critical aspects of data science, computational and evolutionary biology, advanced biostatistics and network science. Dr. Farhat's long term goal is to become a leader in the field of Big Data analysis for infectious diseases. The proposed research as well as the training activities outlined in the proposal will successfully position Dr. Farhat for her first R01 and an independent career as a physician scientist. Environment: Dr. Farhat will perform the interdisciplinary work outlined in this proposal at the distinguished Harvard Departments of Global Health Social Medicine, Biostatistics, Evolutionary biology and the Institute for Quantitative Social Sciences. Dr. Farhat' mentorship team will include two world renowned leaders in the fields of infectious diseases and Big Data, Dr. Megan Murray and Dr. Gary King; and two rising stars in the fields of network Science and evolutionary Biology, Dr. JP Onnela and Dr. Michael Desai. Dr. Murray, the principal mentor on this proposal has mentored over 38 trainees, 9 of which have went on to have independent research careers, and 6 competed successfully for K awards. She is also PI on two recently awarded NIH/NIAID grants a CETR U19 and a TBRU U19 and has over 350 peer reviewed publications. To complement the expertise of her mentors Dr. Farhat will be advised by Dr. Christiani a practicing pulmonary and critical care physician and world renowned researcher in the field of lung and environmental genetics. She will also collaborate and consult with Dr. Merce Crosas, a data scientist, and Dr. Pardis Sabeti, a computational biologist. She will rotate through Dr. Soumya Raychaudhuri's bioinformatics laboratory to diversify her exposure to biomedical Big Data. In addition, she will receive formal training in evolutionary biology, Bayesian and mixed-model biostatistics, computer science, leadership skills and grant writing. The collaborative opportunities, intellectual environment and resources available to Dr. Farhat are outstanding. Research: Infectious diseases continue to be a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Despite the availability of effective antimicrobials, pathogens are successfully evolving new disease phenotypes that allow them to resist killing by these drugs or in other instances cause more severe disease manifestations or wider chains of transmission. Drug resistance (DR) is now common and some bacteria have even become resistant to multiple types or classes of antibiotics6. A key strategy in the fight against emerging pathogen phenotypes in infectious diseases is surveillance, and early personalized therapy to prevent transmission and propagation of these strains. The timely initiation of antibiotic therapy to which the pathogen is sensitive has been shown to be the key factor influencing treatment outcome for a diverse array of infections. Molecular tests that rely on the detection of microbial genetic mutations are particularly promising for surveillance and diagnosis of these pathogen phenotypes but rely on a comprehensive understanding of how mutations associate with these pathogen phenotypes. Currently there is an explosion of data on pathogen whole genome sequences (WGS) that is increasingly generated from clinical laboratories. Data on disease phenotype may also be available, but methods for the analysis and interpretation of these Big Data are lagging. Here I propose tools to aid in this analysis leveraging Big Data sets from Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) and my prior work. Specifically I propose to (1) develop a web-based public interface to several analysis tools, including a statistical learning model that can predict the MTB DR phenotype from its genomic sequence, (2) to develop and study an MTB gene-gene network, based on WGS data, to improve our understanding of the effect of mutation-mutation interactions on the DR phenotype, and (3) study the performance of methods in current use for the association of genotype and phenotype in pathogens, and develop a generalizable power calculator for the best performing method. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    Infectious agents of disease are successfully evolving drug resistance and other adaptations that threaten human health.

"UVPD-MS Characterization of Lipopolysaccharides Abstract. Gram-negative bacteria have caused many of the most persistent infections as well as some of the deadliest pandemics in the world. Some strains have developed resistant to all available drugs, thus leading to increasing mortality from previously treatable bacterial infections. The National Strategy for Combating Antibiotic-Resistant Bacteria released by the White House in September 2014 focused on the need for (i) advancing the development of methods for identification and characterization of bacteria, (ii) accelerating basic research for new antibiotics, and (iii) improving capabilities for surveillance of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. This proposal focuses on the development of innovative tandem mass spectrometry approaches for characterization of lipopolysaccharides (LPS), the primary constituent of the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria that protects the membrane from chemical attack and is recognized by the immune system during pathogenic invasion. Structural characterization of LPS is critical to understanding how the structure of LPS influences immune stimulation as well as facilitating development of new antimicrobials and vaccines. This is a significant analytical challenge due to the branched structures and amphipathic properties of LPS. The escalating concerns about antibiotic resistance bacteria and the need for better avenues of defense against infectious diseases have motivated the proposed work. The objectives of this proposal are: Aim 1: Development of ultraviolet photodissociation (UVPD) mass spectrometry via hierarchical, decision-tree workflows for top-down characterization of LPS to facilitate high throughput analysis; Aim 2: Development of MS/MS approaches for serotyping of Gram-negative bacteria based on LPS; Aim 3: Examination of peptide/LPS interactions via native-spray mass spectrometry to provide both mechanistic information and screening capabilities for new antimicrobials, and Aim 4: Applications to a variety of structural problems related to the biosynthesis of LPS in Gram- negative bacteria and characterization of hybrid O-antigen/lipid A molecules in vesicle-based vaccines.  We have established a new collaboration with Dr. Bryan Davies' group to develop mass spectrometry methods to characterize peptide/lipid A interactions in support of the hunt for better antimicrobials. The continued collaboration with Dr. Stephen Trent's group emphasizes: (i) approaches for deciphering the biosynthetic pathways of bacterial LPS that endow them with the remarkable ability to re-design their outer membranes and develop antibiotic resistance, and (ii) innovative vaccine design based on antigenic LPS in vesicles.    Narrative: Gram-negative bacteria are responsible for some of the deadliest and more widespread pandemics in the world. The proposed work focuses on the development of advanced mass spectrometry approaches for characterization of complex lipopolysaccharides, including the endotoxic lipid A domains, that comprise the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria. The proposed work will be applied to evaluate new antimicrobials and support development of hybrid vaccines.",UVPD-MS Characterization of Lipopolysaccharides,9174984,R01GM103655,"['Acylation', 'Address', 'Advanced Development', 'Affinity', 'Antibiotic Resistance', 'Antibiotics', 'Antimicrobial Resistance', 'Architecture', 'Bacteria', 'Bacterial Infections', 'Bacterial Vaccines', 'Basic Science', 'Binding', 'Cataloging', 'Catalogs', 'Cells', 'Chemical Warfare', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Complex', 'Complex Mixtures', 'Custom', 'Databases', 'Decision Trees', 'Development', 'Distal', 'Exhibits', 'Focus Groups', 'Glycolipids', 'Gram-Negative Bacteria', 'Housing', 'Hybrids', 'Immune', 'Immune system', 'Infection', 'Ions', 'Lipid A', 'Lipopolysaccharide Biosynthesis Pathway', 'Lipopolysaccharides', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Membrane', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'O Antigens', 'Oligosaccharides', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Peptides', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phosphorylation', 'Polysaccharides', 'Process', 'Production', 'Property', 'Publishing', 'Resistance', 'Serotyping', 'Structure', 'System', 'Tail', 'Vaccine Design', 'Vaccines', 'Variant', 'Vesicle', 'Virulence', 'Work', 'abstracting', 'acyl group', 'antimicrobial', 'base', 'cell envelope', 'combat', 'design', 'high throughput analysis', 'improved', 'innovation', 'innovative technologies', 'inorganic phosphate', 'instrument', 'mortality', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'pandemic disease', 'response', 'screening', 'sugar', 'tandem mass spectrometry', 'ultraviolet']",NIGMS,"UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS, AUSTIN",R01,2016,322883,0.029694832398998727
"E. coli ST131-H30 colonization: defining community and population level antagonism in the gastrointestinal microbiome ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A virulent subclone of E. coli sequence type 131 (ST131), called ST131-H30, has become the dominant extraintestinal pathogenic E. coli lineage in the US, where it kills thousands of patients each year. Multidrug resistance is a hallmark of ST131-H30-including production of the CTX-M-15 extended spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-making its clinical management particularly challenging. The ability of ST131-H30 to colonize more frequently and persistently than other strains is thought to be important to its disproportional dis- ease burden. Yet, in our preliminary studies, we have observed that some people fail to become colonized with ST131-H30 despite prolonged household exposure. This strongly suggests that factors other than ST131- H30's intrinsic traits influence colonization. We know that, in the human GI tract, ST131-H30 does not live alone, but rather, as a minor component of a complex microbial community, within which it may be subjected to intense inter- and intra-species competition. In our previous microbiome studies of other body sites, we observed predictable relationships between commensal bacteria and opportunistic pathogens. This led us to hypothesize that distinct components of the GI microbiota, including bacteriocin-producing E. coli strains, may competitively exclude ST131-H30. Approach: By leveraging an ongoing longitudinal study of 600 participants, who will contribute > 7,000 fecal specimens, we will conduct two case-control studies to identify the microbiota unique to individuals who remain free of ST131-H30 for 12 months despite ongoing household exposure to ST131-H30 (elite non-colonizers), as compared to individuals with persistent colonization by ST131-H30 for 12 months (elite colonizers) and individuals who newly acquire ST131-H30 during the study (acquirers). We will identify bacterial species most predictive of resistance to ST131-H30 GI colonization using indicator species and decision tree analysis. The decision model will be validated using fecal microbiota data from an additional 300 participants from another cross-sectional survey. To explore intra-species competition, we will identify commensal E. coli strains antagonistic to ST131-H30 using in vitro inhibition assays, and will cross-validate the in vitro results by assessing the antagonistic strains' association with ST131-H30 exclusion using data from the longitudinal and cross-sectional cohorts. Innovation: Our approach is innovative in attempting to define mechanisms that influence GI colonization with ST131-H30; its focus on elite non-colonizers; its inter- and intra- species investigation of the microbiome within an ongoing longitudinal epidemiologic study; and its goal of identifying commensal bacteria antagonistic to a single virulent E. coli subclone. The expected outcome of this study is to identify commensal bacteria that can exclude ST131-H30 from the GI tract. With emerging resistance neutralizing the effectiveness our current antibiotic armamentarium, we must find new ways to prevent the spread of multidrug-resistant colonizing pathogens. These results could lead to novel, probiotic strategies for interrupting the transmission of ST131-H30 and future multidrug-resistant colonizing pathogens. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project is relevant to the NIH, NIAID, and public health because it will lay the groundwork for developing novel strategies to prevent the spread of multidrug-resistant E. coli. Some of the most dangerous kinds of E. coli spread asymptomatically in the gastrointestinal tracts of people. In this study, we seek to identify non- pathogenic bacteria that can prevent a deadly new strain of antibiotic-resistant E. coli, called ST131-H30, from colonizing the human gut.",E. coli ST131-H30 colonization: defining community and population level antagonism in the gastrointestinal microbiome,9020203,R21AI117654,"['Antibiotic Resistance', 'Antibiotics', 'Bacteria', 'Bacterial Adhesion', 'Biological Assay', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Cyclophosphamide', 'Cystitis', 'Data', 'Decision Modeling', 'Decision Trees', 'Detection', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Effectiveness', 'Epidemiologic Studies', 'Epidemiology', 'Escherichia coli', 'Exclusion', 'Exposure to', 'Extended-spectrum β-lactamase', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Gastrointestinal tract structure', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Household', 'Human', 'Human Microbiome', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Integration Host Factors', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Mediating', 'Minor', 'Multi-Drug Resistance', 'National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease', 'Natural Resistance', 'Nature', 'Outcome Study', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Preventive measure', 'Price', 'Probiotics', 'Production', 'Productivity', 'Public Health', 'Pyelonephritis', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Role', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Site', 'Specimen', 'Structure', 'Taxon', 'Testing', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Virulent', 'Work', 'bacteriocin', 'base', 'beta-Lactamase', 'cohort', 'combat', 'commensal microbes', 'fluoroquinolone resistance', 'gastrointestinal', 'gastrointestinal bacteria', 'gut microbiome', 'innovation', 'killings', 'microbial community', 'microbiome', 'microbiota', 'multi-drug resistant pathogen', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'pathogen', 'pathogenic Escherichia coli', 'pathogenic bacteria', 'prevent', 'resistant strain', 'stem', 'trait', 'transmission process', 'urinary']",NIAID,GEORGE WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R21,2016,181875,0.015609290940075083

"Genome Based Influenza Vaccine Strain Selection  using Machine Learning ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Influenza A virus causes both pandemic and seasonal outbreaks, leading to loss of from thousands to millions of human lives within a short time period. Vaccination is the best option to prevent and minimize the effects of influenza outbreaks. Rapid selection of a well-matched influenza vaccine strain is the key to developing an effective vaccination program. However, this is a non-trivial task due to three major challenges in influenza vaccine strain selection: labor an time intensive virus isolation and serology-based antigenic characterization, poor growth of selected strains in chicken embryonic eggs during production, and biased sampling in influenza surveillance. Each year, many scientists worldwide, including thousands from the United States, are working altogether to select an optimal vaccine strain. However, incorrect vaccine strains have still been frequently chosen in the past decades.  Recent advances in genomic sequencing allow us to rapidly and economically sequence influenza genomes from the isolates and from the clinical samples. Sequencing influenza genomes has become a routine and important component in influenza surveillance. The objectives of this project are to develop a sequence-based strategy for influenza antigenic variant identification and to optimize vaccine strain selection using genomic data. To achieve these aims, we will develop machine learning based computational methods to estimate antigenic distances among influenza viruses by directly using their genome sequences. We will then identify the key residues and mutations in influenza genomes affecting influenza antigenic drift events. Such information will allow us to select most promising virus strains as candidates for vaccine production. Since economical virus production requires the selected virus strains to grow easily in chicken embryonic eggs, we also propose the development of a machine learning based method that can predict the growth ability of a virus strain based on its sequence information. This integrated genome based influenza vaccine strain selection system will be developed for detecting antigenic variants for influenza A viruses.  This project will help us provide fundamental technology that employs genomic signatures determining influenza antigenicity and growth ability in chicken embryonic eggs, which are the two key issues for efficient and effective influenza vaccine strain development. The resulting genome based vaccine strain selection strategy will significantly reduce the human labor needed for serological characterization, decrease the time required to select an effective strain that will grow well in eggs, and increase the likelihood of correct influenza vaccine candidate selection. Thus, this project will lead to significant technological advances in influenza prevention and control.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:     This study is to develop and validate a genome based strategy for influenza vaccine strain selection, and it will lead to significant technological advances in influenza prevention and control.                ",Genome Based Influenza Vaccine Strain Selection  using Machine Learning,8859887,R01AI116744,"['Affect', 'Africa', 'Algorithms', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Area', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological Assay', 'Chickens', 'Clinical', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Effectiveness', 'Embryo', 'Epidemic', 'Event', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Head', 'Hemagglutination', 'Hemagglutinin', 'Human', 'Influenza', 'Influenza A virus', 'Influenza prevention', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mutagenesis', 'Mutation', 'Peptide Sequence Determination', 'Phenotype', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Production', 'Proteins', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Biases', 'Scientist', 'Seasons', 'Serologic tests', 'Serological', 'Site', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States', 'Vaccination', 'Vaccine Production', 'Vaccines', 'Variant', 'Viral', 'Virus', 'Work', 'base', 'candidate selection', 'egg', 'flu', 'genome sequencing', 'improved', 'influenza outbreak', 'influenza virus vaccine', 'influenzavirus', 'multitask', 'new technology', 'novel', 'pandemic disease', 'prevent', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'receptor binding', 'research study', 'vaccine candidate']",NIAID,MISSISSIPPI STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2015,381704,0.01980651705795075
"Host and Microbial Biomarkers Related to the Development of Complicated Clostridium difficile Infection ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is implicated in nearly 3 million cases of diarrhea and colitis in the U.S. each year. CDI, which disproportionately affects older adults, can result in fulminant, life-threatening colitis and lead to multiple recurrnt episodes. There is an urgent need for validated biomarker-based clinical decision-making tools to predict which patients will experience adverse outcomes from CDI. There is a gap in knowledge regarding which known and yet to-be-discovered biomarkers, derived from the host, microbiome and pathogen, will best predict complications and recurrence. Our long-term goal is to develop and validate accurate risk-prediction models for adverse outcomes following CDI that can be used to guide therapy. The next step in pursuit of that goal, and our overall objective for the proposed research, is to discover new candidate biomarkers and determine which ones together best predict complicated CDI in an adjusted model. Our central hypothesis is that a biomarker-based model will better predict complicated CDI compared to models based on clinical variables alone. To address this hypothesis we propose three specific aims: 1) validate host biomarkers previously shown to associate with complicated CDI; 2) discover novel microbial biomarkers for complicated CDI; and 3) develop a candidate biomarker-based predictive model for complicated CDI. We will collect sera and stool prospectively in a cohort of older adults to determine if characteristics of the microbiome, microbial features of C. difficile, levels of antitoxin antibodies, and/or inflammatory mediators associate with complications. Multivariable models will be constructed using linear regression and machine learning techniques and model diagnostics will be used to generate a final portable, biomarker-based predictive model for use in future studies.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is implicated in nearly 3 million cases of diarrhea and colitis in the U.S. each year. We currently lack a complete understanding as to why certain patients with CDI progress to severe disease with increased complications, including death, while others recover. Our research proposes to discovery objective, readily obtainable indicators from serum/stool that predict adverse outcomes from CDI early after initial disease onset. It is envisioned that this could lead to a paradigm-shift in management by directing specific treatment strategies, including more costly therapeutics such as antibody treatment, fecal transplant and newer antibiotics, towards patients who would most benefit. This research takes the first steps towards development of a biomarker-based predictive tool to aid clinicians in treatment decisions.            ",Host and Microbial Biomarkers Related to the Development of Complicated Clostridium difficile Infection,8987064,R21AI120599,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Aftercare', 'Age', 'Antibiotics', 'Antibodies', 'Antitoxins', 'Bacterial Toxins', 'Biological Markers', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clostridium difficile', 'Colitis', 'Colon', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diarrhea', 'Disease', 'Elderly', 'Feces', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Hepatocyte Growth Factor', 'Infection', 'Inflammation Mediators', 'Interleukin-8', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Leukocyte L1 Antigen Complex', 'Life', 'Linear Models', 'Linear Regressions', 'Loop ileostomy', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Monoclonal Antibodies', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Onset of illness', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Patients', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Recurrence', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Retrieval', 'Ribosomal RNA', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sequence Analysis', 'Serum', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Toxin', 'Transplantation', 'Work', 'adverse outcome', 'aged', 'base', 'clinical decision-making', 'cohort', 'data reduction', 'experience', 'high risk', 'microbial', 'microbial host', 'microbiome', 'mortality', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'predictive modeling', 'procalcitonin', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'secondary outcome', 'tool', 'treatment strategy']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R21,2015,232500,-0.0042308659372232325
"Breath Volatile Metabolites for the Diagnosis of Emerging Invasive Mold Infection DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This resubmission K23 proposal outlines a five-year development plan for Sophia Koo to achieve independence as a patient-oriented clinician-scientist with particular expertise in the development and assessment of novel diagnostic modalities for invasive mold infections (IMI). The strategy outlined in this proposal will enable Dr. Koo to build upon her clinical background in caring for patients at risk for IMI and her clinicl research defining the limitations of currently available diagnostic modalities for these infections by taking advantage of the unique clinical and research strengths of Brigham and Women's Hospital and the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, biomedical engineering and bioinformatics capabilities of the Charles Stark Draper Laboratory, and epidemiology, biostatistics, and analytical chemistry training opportunities at the Harvard School of Public Health, Northeastern University, and Massachusetts Institute of Technology. She will be co-mentored by Dr. Lindsey Baden, Associate Professor of Medicine at Harvard Medical School, and Dr. Earl Francis Cook, Professor of Epidemiology at the Harvard School of Public Health. Dr. Baden is an expert in fungal diagnostics, and Dr. Cook is an expert in study design and statistical learning/data mining, including analysis of highly dimensional biomarker data. Dr. Koo will also work closely with Drs. Daniel Kuritzkes, Raphael Dolin, Francisco Marty, John Perfect, and John Wingard, who will provide career guidance and scientific advice on the execution of the proposed research plan, and her collaborators Drs. Paul Vouros, Terence Risby, and James Comolli, who will contribute their expertise in analytical chemistry and breath analysis to her research plan. The research program will employ analytical chemistry and statistical supervised learning approaches to define volatile organic compound (VOC) metabolite patterns of emerging invasive mold species in vitro and in patient breath to lay the groundwork for a noninvasive, point-of-care breath test for patients with emerging IMI. Specifically, this program proposes (1) a detailed definition of the VOC metabolome of the Mucorales, Fusarium, and Scedosporium species that most commonly cause human IMI, and (2) the prospective collection of VOC metabolites in the breath of patients with emerging IMI, patients with clinical and radiographic findings suggestive of an emerging IMI, and patients with respiratory tract colonization by these molds, with derivation and validation of VOC feature support vector machine classification algorithms to discriminate patients with emerging IMI from patients with other fungal infections or non-fungal pulmonary processes. Current diagnostic modalities for these infections are inadequate and often unacceptably morbid, and development of this novel, noninvasive diagnostic approach should allow earlier diagnosis of these infections than currently possible, prospective surveillance in the growing population of patients at risk for emerging IMI, more rational targeting of antifungal therapy, and improved clinical outcomes. Project Narrative Invasive mold infections are highly morbid and often fatal in the growing population of patients with compromised immune systems. The proposed research seeks to overcome the significant limitations of currently available diagnostic methods for these infections by developing a novel, noninvasive test that identifies unique volatile compounds in the breath of patients with these infections. Development of this sensitive fungal breath test will allow better surveillance and targeting of antifungal therapy in patients at risk for these infections and ultimately, improved patient outcomes.",Breath Volatile Metabolites for the Diagnosis of Emerging Invasive Mold Infection,8875578,K23AI097225,"['Agriculture', 'Algorithms', 'Analytical Chemistry', 'Antifungal Agents', 'Antifungal Therapy', 'Area', 'Aspergillosis', 'Aspergillus', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Markers', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Biometry', 'Biopsy', 'Breath Tests', 'Cereals', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Collection', 'Comorbidity', 'Complex Mixtures', 'Dana-Farber Cancer Institute', 'Data', 'Derivation procedure', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Disease', 'Dolin', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Environmental Health', 'Epidemiology', 'European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer', 'Exhalation', 'Fingerprint', 'Fusarium', 'Gas Chromatography', 'Gases', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Hematopoietic stem cells', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Immune system', 'Immunocompromised Host', 'Immunosuppressive Agents', 'In Vitro', 'Incidence', 'Industry', 'Infection', 'Institutes', 'Institution', 'Investigation', 'Kinetics', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Lung', 'Lung nodule', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Massachusetts', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'Modality', 'Molds', 'Mucorales', 'Mucormycosis', 'Mycoses', 'Nutritional', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Organ Transplantation', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Pneumonia', 'Population', 'Process', 'Public Health Schools', 'Regimen', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Respiratory System', 'Respiratory tract structure', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Scedosporium', 'Scientist', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sodium Glutamate', 'Solid', 'Specimen', 'Spectrometry', 'Syndrome', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'The science of Mycology', 'Training', 'Transplant Recipients', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Vial device', 'Woman', 'Work', 'air sampling', 'base', 'career', 'clinically relevant', 'cooking', 'data mining', 'diagnostic assay', 'improved', 'medical schools', 'microbial', 'mortality', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'patient oriented', 'patient population', 'point of care', 'pressure', 'professor', 'programs', 'prospective', 'volatile organic compound']",NIAID,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,K23,2015,137160,0.03191490346185556
"New Serological Measures of Infectious Disease Transmission Intensity ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Candidate: Benjamin Arnold    I am an epidemiologist at the University of California, Berkeley. I completed my MA in Biostatistics and a PhD in Epidemiology from UC Berkeley in 2009. Since then, I have worked as an epidemiologist in Professor Jack Colford's group. The opportunity to work as the coordinating epidemiologist for a touchstone, multi-country cluster randomized trial - combined with the addition of two children to my family - led me to delay my academic career. I am now ready to restart my career progress toward independent investigator status.     My long-term career goal is to become a leader in the application of novel statistical methods to target and evaluate interventions that reduce the burden of enteric infections and neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) in low-income countries. This research focus and career objective build from my experience and from a growing collaboration with Dr. Patrick Lammie at the US Centers for Disease Control (CDC) that started in 2013 and has introduced me to seroepidemiologic research. My background in epidemiologic methods, biostatistics, and international field research makes me uniquely qualified to make significant contributions to infectious disease epidemiology at the interface between recent advances in statistical methodology and serological assays.    Environment: University of California, Berkeley    To achieve my career goal, I have developed a training and mentoring plan that focuses on recent advances in statistics (semi-parametric estimation theory and machine learning) and on infectious disease immunology. These are two areas where additional training will open up significant and unique opportunities for me to make meaningful contributions to seroepidemiologic research, and will enable me to launch an independent career as a productive faculty member at UC Berkeley.    I have assembled a multidisciplinary mentoring team of senior investigators in biostatistics and immunology to support my training, research, and career objectives. Mark van der Laan (primary mentor, biostatistics) will guide my training in semi-parametric methods and machine learning. Alan Hubbard (co-mentor, biostatistics) will guide my translation of the methodology to applications for enteric pathogens and NTDs. Patrick Lammie (co-mentor at CDC, immunology) will guide my immunology training and research with his expertise in the immunology of enteric pathogens and NTDs    Research: New Serological Measures of Infectious Disease Transmission    Background: Recent advances in multiplex antigen assays have led to the development of low-cost and sensitive methods to measure enteric pathogens and neglected tropical diseases (NTDs). There have not been commensurate advances in the statistical methods used to derive measures of transmission intensity from antibody response. Translating antibody response into metrics of transmission intensity is a key step from a public health perspective because it enables us to target intervention programs to the populations most in need and then measure the effectiveness of those programs.     Aims and Methods: The overarching goal of this research is to develop a methodologic framework to translate antibody response measured in cross-sectional surveys into measures of transmission intensity for enteric pathogens (7 included in the study, e.g., Cryptosporidium parvum, enterotoxigenic E. coli) and neglected tropical diseases (principal focus: lymphatic filariasis). We approach this goal from two novel perspectives. In Aim 1, we draw on the ""peak shift"" phenomenon for infectious diseases, and hypothesize that changes in transmission will be detectable in the age-specific antibody response curve. At lower transmission, antibody levels should decline across all ages due to fewer and less frequent active infections, leading to an overall shift in the age-specific response curve. We will evaluate the approach by comparing antibody response curves for young children with different exposures (improved vs. unimproved drinking water for enteric pathogens; pre- versus post- mass drug administration for lymphatic filariasis) in large, well characterized cohorts in Kenya, Tanzania, and Haiti.     In Aim 2, we will develop semi-parametric methods to estimate the force of infection (seroconversion rate) from seroprevalence data for pathogens where seroreversion is possible, using lymphatic filariasis as an example. Our new approach marks a significant advance over previous work in this area by making few modeling assumptions and by allowing for the flexible control of confounding between comparison groups. We will evaluate the approach in Haiti by measuring the effect of mass drug administration on the force of infection for lymphatic filariasis For all of the methods, we will create user-friendly, open source software to accelerate translation to applied research.     The Future: This mentored training and research plan represents a natural next step for me on a productive and collaborative path to independence at UC Berkeley. It will set the stage for a broader R01-level research portfolio that applies the newly developed methods to primary research studies that evaluate the impact of interventions on enteric infections, and help target and monitor global elimination efforts for NTDs.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Antibodies measured in blood provide a sensitive measure of infection for many infectious diseases. Statistical methods that enable us to measure disease transmission intensity at the population level from blood antibody levels are an important tool for public health efforts because they help identify populations in greatest need of intervention and help measure the effectiveness of interventions designed to reduce transmission. No statistical tools like this exist for enteric pathogens (those that cause diarrhea) and neglected tropical diseases, which together cause an immense health burden among the world's poorest people, and so we propose to develop new methods to measure population-level transmission intensity of these diseases based on antibodies measured in blood from children in Kenya, Tanzania, and Haiti.            ",New Serological Measures of Infectious Disease Transmission Intensity,8947064,K01AI119180,"['Age', 'Antibodies', 'Antibody Response', 'Antigens', 'Applied Research', 'Area', 'Biological Assay', 'Biometry', 'Blood', 'California', 'Campylobacter', 'Caregivers', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Child', 'Cluster randomized trial', 'Collaborations', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Computer software', 'Country', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Cryptosporidium', 'Cryptosporidium parvum', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Diarrhea', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Effectiveness of Interventions', 'Entamoeba histolytica', 'Enteral', 'Environment', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Epidemiologist', 'Epidemiology', 'Faculty', 'Family', 'Filarial Elephantiases', 'Future', 'Giardia', 'Goals', 'Haiti', 'Handwashing', 'Health', 'Immune response', 'Immunologist', 'Immunology', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Infectious Disease Epidemiology', 'Infectious Disease Immunology', 'Infectious Diseases Research', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Kenya', 'Literature', 'Low income', 'Machine Learning', 'Measles', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Mumps', 'Outcome', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Play', 'Population', 'Public Health', 'Qualifying', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Role', 'Rubella', 'Running', 'Salmonella', 'Sanitation', 'Serological', 'Seroprevalences', 'Source', 'Spottings', 'Staging', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Survival Analysis', 'Tanzania', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Universities', 'Vibrio cholerae', 'Viral', 'Water', 'Work', 'base', 'career', 'cohort', 'comparison group', 'cost', 'disease transmission', 'drinking water', 'effectiveness measure', 'enteric pathogen', 'enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'high risk', 'improved', 'intervention effect', 'intervention program', 'member', 'multidisciplinary', 'neglected tropical diseases', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'open source', 'pathogen', 'professor', 'programs', 'public health intervention', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'response', 'seroconversion', 'seropositive', 'skills', 'statistics', 'theories', 'therapy design', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'user-friendly']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,K01,2015,142069,0.05286467334922849
"Models for synthesising molecular, clinical and epidemiological data, and transla DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A mathematical or computational model of infectious disease transmission represents the process of how an infection spreads from one person to another. Such models have a long history within infectious disease epidemiology, and are useful tools for giving insight into the dynamics of epidemics and for evaluating the potential effect of control methods. The overall objective of this project is to substantially improve the methods by which models of infectious diseases transmission are calibrated against biological and disease surveillance data. This will both improve the utility of models as tools for analyzing data on infectious disease outbreaks (for instance to provide more rapid and reliable estimates of how transmissible and lethal a new virus is to public health agencies) and also improve the reliability of models as tools for predicting the likely effect of different interventions (such as vaccines or case isolation) to help policy makers make more informed decisions about control policies. As with many areas of biology and medicine, the data landscape for infectious diseases modeling is changing rapidly. Larger and more complex datasets are becoming available that cover many different aspects of the interaction between a pathogen and the human population: clinical episode data, genetic data about fast-evolving pathogens; animal-model transmission data and community-based representative serological data. The specific aims of our project are to: (a) develop new machine-learning based methods to discover interesting patterns in complex datasets related to the transmission of infectious disease, so as to better specify subsequent mechanistic mathematical or computational models; (b) derive new approaches for using more than one type of data simultaneously to calibrate transmission models and (c) derive new methods of parameter estimation for simulations which model the spatial spread of infection or model both the transmission and genetic evolution of a pathogen. We will achieve these aims in the applied context of research on three key infections: emerging infectious diseases (such as MERS-CoV - the novel coronavirus currently spreading in the Middle East), influenza and Streptococcus pneumonia (a major bacterial pathogen). Examples of the scientific questions we will address that cannot be answered with current methods are: (i) how many unobserved cases of MERS-CoV have occurred so far (to be answered using data on case clusters data, the spatial distribution of cases and viral genetic sequences)? (ii) how many people in different age groups are infected with influenza each year and how does their immune system respond to infection (to be answered using data on case incidence and serological testing of the population)? (iii) how much is vaccination coupled with prescribing practices influencing the emergence of resistant strains of pneumococcus (to be addressed with data on antibiotic and vaccine use, case incidence and bacterial strain frequency)? PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Mathematical and computational models of infectious disease spread can provide valuable information to aid policy-makers in the tough choices they face when trying to control infectious diseases, but models must be designed to make the best possible use of the often limited data available. As the digital footprints of our lives grow, so te datasets available for infectious disease models become larger and more complex. This project will develop new algorithms and methods to allow models to make better use of all available data and therefore better inform control policy planning for diseases such as: influenza, pneumococcal infection and novel viruses like MERS-CoV.","Models for synthesising molecular, clinical and epidemiological data, and transla",8927659,U01GM110721,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Model', 'Antibiotics', 'Antigenic Variation', 'Area', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Coronavirus', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Economics', 'Emerging Communicable Diseases', 'Epidemic', 'Epidemiology', 'Evolution', 'Face', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Generations', 'Generic Drugs', 'Genetic', 'Genotype', 'Health', 'Hospitalization', 'Human', 'Human Influenza A Virus', 'Immune', 'Immune system', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Infectious Disease Epidemiology', 'Influenza', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Middle East', 'Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Monte Carlo Method', 'Movement', 'Natural History', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Phenotype', 'Pneumococcal Infections', 'Policies', 'Policy Maker', 'Population', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Serologic tests', 'Serological', 'Shapes', 'Site', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Specificity', 'Stream', 'Streptococcus pneumoniae', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Vaccination', 'Vaccines', 'Variant', 'Virus', 'Work', 'age group', 'base', 'contextual factors', 'data exchange', 'data mining', 'design', 'digital', 'disease natural history', 'disease transmission', 'epidemiological model', 'forest', 'genetic evolution', 'improved', 'infectious disease model', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'mathematical model', 'meetings', 'mortality', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'novel virus', 'pandemic influenza', 'pathogen', 'predictive modeling', 'resistant strain', 'seasonal influenza', 'simulation', 'social', 'surveillance data', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'virus genetics']",NIGMS,U OF L IMPERIAL COL OF SCI/TECHNLGY/MED,U01,2015,434391,0.06874227544925647
"Genetic predictors of anti-TNF treatment response and infections in IBD DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) affect over 1.4 million Americans. Over the past 15 years, considerable progress has been made in the therapy of CD and UC with monoclonal antibodies against tumor necrosis factor � (anti-TNF) representing the most significant therapeutic breakthrough. However, many patients fail to respond adequately. Recent genome wide associations studies (GWAS) have significantly increased our understanding of the pathogenesis of CD and UC. The role of these genetic variants in predicting response to anti-TNF therapy is yet to be defined adequately. In addition, significant safety concerns remain with the use of these agents with serious infections occurring in up to 10% of patients. There is a strong genetic component to susceptibility to infections, in particular involving polymorphisms in innate immunity. Given the key role of innate immunity in IBD pathogenesis, whether such shared polymorphisms also influence risk of infections on anti-TNF therapy has not been examined previously. Thus, the development of tools to define likelihood of treatment response and infections are a key unmet need in the field. Our overarching objective is to identify clinical and genetic predictors of both short-term and long-term response as well as infectious complications of anti-TNF therapy. To achieve these aims, we will utilize the complementary strengths of two large cohorts - a prospective registry cohort of over 1200 patients with CD or UC, and a novel EMR-based cohort of over 11,000 patients with CD or UC linked to a biospecimen repository. This proposal utilizes the mentorship and significant expertise in key areas including analytical genetics, translational immunology, and bioinformatics and allows the candidate to develop fundamental skills in these novel content areas and research methods. The access to expertise at the NIH-funded center Informatics for Integrating Biology and the Bedside, the Center for Study of Inflammatory Bowel Disease, and the Broad Institute is a key strength of this application. This career development award will be critical in providing training in bioinformatics and genetic epidemiology, thus contributing to the candidate's long-term goal of establishing an independent IBD research career with focus on defining at-risk cohorts and personalizing therapy. The training component of the award includes graduate-level courses in the relevant content areas in genetic epidemiology, and bioinformatics at the Harvard Medical School, School of Public Health, and Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The candidate will continue to actively engage with an established group of multidisciplinary researchers who have demonstrated the utility of the EMR-based approach to accurately define autoimmune diseases, link it to biospecimen collection, and use it successfully for genotyping-phenotype research. This will help foster collaborative development of future proposals as the work proposed in this application has the potential for applicability in other cohorts. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The novel information gained from this study regarding genetic predictors of treatment response and infectious complications has the potential to transform clinical practice by leading to clinical trials focused on selected cohorts of patients most likely to respond to therapies with low risk of adverse events, thus preventing unnecessary exposure to potentially toxic therapies with low likelihood of benefit. Such work is a step toward developing personalized medicine approaches to tailor therapy based on likelihood of benefit and risk. The methodology developed here will also have applications in other EMR-based cohorts to investigate novel therapeutic agents and disease outcomes.",Genetic predictors of anti-TNF treatment response and infections in IBD,8852606,K23DK097142,"['Address', 'Adverse event', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Anti-Tumor Necrosis Factor Therapy', 'Antibodies', 'Area', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Award', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biology', 'CD14 gene', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collection', 'Comorbidity', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Crohn&apos', 's disease', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Disease remission', 'Exposure to', 'Fostering', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Research', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human Genetics', 'IL1R1 gene', 'Immune response', 'Immunology', 'Immunosuppressive Agents', 'Infection', 'Inflammatory Bowel Diseases', 'Informatics', 'Institutes', 'Institution', 'Interferons', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Massachusetts', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Monoclonal Antibodies', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Natural Immunity', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Pneumonia', 'Predisposition', 'Public Health Schools', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Sepsis', 'Source', 'Structure', 'TNF gene', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Training', 'Treatment outcome', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor Therapy', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha', 'Ulcerative Colitis', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'adaptive immunity', 'base', 'career', 'clinical practice', 'clinical predictors', 'cohort', 'cost', 'genetic epidemiology', 'genetic predictors', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'immune function', 'medical schools', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'patient registry', 'personalized medicine', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'repository', 'response', 'skills', 'tool development', 'treatment response']",NIDDK,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,K23,2015,169572,0.0056022998189181085
"Probabilistic Disease Surveillance DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         The proposed research will further develop and evaluate a probabilistic approach to disease surveillance. In this approach, a probabilistic case detection system (CDS) uses Bayesian diagnostic networks to compute the likelihoods of patient findings for each of a set of infectious diseases for every patient in a monitored population. CDS computes these likelihoods from data in electronic medical records, including information derived from free-text reports by natural language processing. CDS makes those estimates available to a probabilistic outbreak detection and characterization component (ODCS).             ODCS also utilizes a Bayesian approach to compute the probability that an outbreak is ongoing for each of a set of infectious diseases of interest, given information from CDS. ODCS also computes probability distributions over the current and future size of a detected outbreak and other characteristics such as incubation period used by public health officials when responding to an outbreak.                        The proposed research will extend the approach, which we have already developed and evaluated for the disease influenza to six additional respiratory infectious diseases. The research will also extend the capabilities of ODCS to utilize non-EMR data, detect an unknown disease, and detect and characterize concurrent outbreaks. The planned evaluations will measure the accuracy of both CDS and ODCS using historical surveillance data from two regions and simulated outbreak data, which we will create by adding outbreak cases generated by an agent-based epidemic simulator to real baseline surveillance data from non-outbreak periods.                        The innovation being advanced by this research is a novel, integrated, Bayesian approach for the early and accurate detection of cases of diseases that threaten health and for the detection and characterization of outbreaks of diseases that threaten public health. The proposed approach has significant potential to improve the information available to public health officials and physicians, which can be expected to improve clinical and public health decision making, and ultimately to improve population health. Project Relevance  The proposed research will improve the ability of public health officials and physicians to estimate the current incidence of influenza and other infectious diseases and to predict the future course of epidemics of those diseases. The improved information will better support decisions made by health departments to control epidemics, which is expected to reduce morbidity and mortality from epidemic diseases.",Probabilistic Disease Surveillance,8875053,R01LM011370,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Advanced Development', 'Area', 'Bayesian Method', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Complex', 'Computer Systems', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'County', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Disease model', 'Epidemic', 'Epidemiologist', 'Epidemiology', 'Evaluation', 'Future', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Influenza', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lung diseases', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Probability', 'Public Health', 'Public Health Practice', 'Publications', 'ROC Curve', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Schools', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Severities', 'Sodium Chloride', 'Structure', 'Support System', 'System', 'Systems Integration', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Topaz', 'Universities', 'Utah', 'Vaccination', 'advanced system', 'base', 'computer code', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'disorder control', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'influenza outbreak', 'innovation', 'interest', 'knowledge base', 'mortality', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'operation', 'pandemic disease', 'population health', 'portability', 'reproductive', 'respiratory', 'surveillance data']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2015,531035,0.010166254611523956
"A Framework for Integrating Multiple Data Sources for Modeling and Forecasting of Infectious Diseases     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): I am trained as a computational biologist and statistician, and I am currently a postdoctoral fellow at Boston Children's Hospital, Harvard Medical School. My main career goal is to become an independent researcher at a major research institution. I plan to continue my current research pursuits in global health and infectious diseases. Specifically, I aim to continue developing mathematical and computational approaches for modeling to understand disease transmission, forecasting future dynamics and evaluating interventions for public policy decisions. As a postdoctoral research fellow, I have had the wonderful opportunity of working with data from multiple sources. Although several of these data streams could be labeled as ""Big Data"", I typically work with the data after it is already processed, filtered and aggregated to a daily or weekly resolution. While I have developed the necessary skills for modeling these already processed data, there are three important areas where I require additional training, mentoring, and experience: (1) advanced computational skills especially in the use of high performance computing and informatics tools, (2) techniques in computational machine learning and data mining necessary for data acquisition and processing, and (3) biostatistical methodology needed for the statistical design of studies involving big data. These three training and mentoring aims would enable me to develop the skills necessary to become an independent investigator in Big Data Science for biomedical research. Boston Children's School and Harvard Medical School are leading institutions in translational biomedical research, thereby making them the ideal environment to pursue the training and research aims in this proposal. The recent emergence of infectious diseases such as the avian influenza H7N9 in China, and re-emergence of diseases such as polio in Syria underscores the importance of strengthening immunization and emergency response programs for the prevention and control of infectious diseases. Researchers have developed computational and mathematical models to capture determinants of infectious disease dynamics and identify factors that support prediction of these dynamics, provide estimates of disease risk, and evaluate various intervention scenarios. While these studies have been extremely useful for the understanding of infectious disease transmission and control, most have been disease specific and solely used data from traditional disease surveillance systems. In contrast, there is a huge amount of internet-based data that have been extensively assessed and validated for public health surveillance in the last decade, but it has been scarcely used in conjunction with other data sources for modeling to predict disease spread. Using these novel digital event-based data sources in combination with climate and case data from traditional disease surveillance systems, we will establish a much needed framework for integrating these disparate data sources for modeling to estimate disease risk and forecasting temporal dynamics of infectious diseases. Our approach will be achieved through three aims. The first objective is to develop an automated process for acquiring, processing and filtering data for modeling (Aim 1). Once we gather this data, we will develop temporal models for the dynamical assessment of the relationship between the various data variables and infectious disease incidence (Aim 2). Finally, we will assess the utility of the modeling approaches developed under Aim 2 for forecasting temporal trends of infectious diseases (Aim 3). Through data acquisition, thorough processing, statistical and epidemiological modeling, and guided by advisers with expertise in biomedical informatics, computer science and statistics, we plan to achieve a comprehensive approach to integrating multiple data streams for modeling to forecast infectious diseases.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Although there have been significant medical and technological advances towards infectious disease prevention, surveillance and control, infectious diseases still account for an estimated 15 million deaths each year worldwide. Reliable forecasts of infectious disease dynamics can influence decisions regarding prioritization of limited resources during outbreaks, optimization of disease interventions and implementation of rigorous surveillance processes for quicker case identification and control of emerging disease outbreaks. Our goal is therefore to develop a data mining/informatics framework that leverages the huge amount of digital event-based data sources in combination with climate data, and data from traditional disease surveillance systems for modeling and forecasting infectious diseases.            ",A Framework for Integrating Multiple Data Sources for Modeling and Forecasting of Infectious Diseases,8935819,K01ES025438,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Area', 'Avian Influenza', 'Big Data', 'Biological Models', 'Biomedical Research', 'Boston', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Cessation of life', 'Child', 'China', 'Climate', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Dengue', 'Detection', 'Disease', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Disease model', 'Emergency response', 'Emerging Communicable Diseases', 'Environment', 'Epidemic', 'Epidemiology', 'Event', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'High Performance Computing', 'Human', 'Humidity', 'Immunization', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Influenza', 'Influenza A Virus, H1N1 Subtype', 'Influenza A Virus, H7N9 Subtype', 'Informatics', 'Institution', 'International', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Label', 'Linear Models', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Poliomyelitis', 'Population Surveillance', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Prevention program', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Public Policy', 'Report (account)', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Proposals', 'Research Training', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Review Literature', 'Schools', 'Science', 'Series', 'Source', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Stream', 'Syria', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Temperature', 'Time', 'Training', 'Weight', 'Work', 'World Health Organization', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'career', 'climate data', 'computer science', 'computerized data processing', 'data acquisition', 'data integration', 'data mining', 'data modeling', 'digital', 'disease transmission', 'disorder control', 'disorder prevention', 'disorder risk', 'epidemiological model', 'experience', 'global health', 'improved', 'infectious disease model', 'mathematical model', 'medical schools', 'model building', 'news', 'novel', 'pandemic influenza', 'public health relevance', 'skills', 'social', 'statistics', 'tool', 'trend', 'web based interface']",NIEHS,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,K01,2015,107469,0.036727707187541835
"Integrating Bioinformatics and Clustering Analysis for Disease Surveillance ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  There has been a tremendous focus in bioinformatics on translation of data from the bench into information and knowledge for clinical decision-making. This includes analysis of human genetics for personalized medicine and treatment. However, there has been much less attention on translational bioinformatics for public health practice such as surveillance of emerging/re-emerging viruses. This involves data acquisition, integration, and analyses of viral genetics to infer origin, spread, and evolution suc as the emergence of new strains. The relevant scientific fields for this practice include certain aspects of molecular epidemiology and phylogeography. Recent attention has focused on viruses of zoonotic origin, which are defined as pathogens that are transmittable between animals and humans. In addition to seasonal influenza and West Nile virus, this classification of pathogens includes novel viruses such as Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome and influenza A H7N9. Despite the successes highlighted in the literature, there has been little utilization of bioinformatics resources and tools among state public health, agriculture, and wildlife agencies for zoonotic surveillance. Previously this type of resource has been restricted primarily to those in academia.       While bioinformatics has been sparsely used for surveillance of zoonotic viruses, other applications such as Geospatial Information Systems (GIS) have been employed by state health agencies to analyze spatial patterns of infection. This includes software to produce disease maps using an array of data types such as clinical, geographical, or human mobility data for tasks such as, geocoding, clustering, or outbreak detection. In addition, advances in geospatial statistics have enabled health agencies to perform more powerful space-time analyses to infer spatiotemporal patterns. However, these GIS consider only traditional epidemiological data such as location and timing of reported cases and not the genetics of the virus that causes the disease. This prevents health agencies from understanding how changes in the genome of the virus and the associated environment in which it disseminates impacts disease risk.      The long-term goal of this proposal is to enhance the identification of geospatial hotspots of zoonotic viruses by applying bioinformatics principles to access, integrate, and analyze viral genetics and spatiotemporal reportable disease data. This project will include approaches from bioinformatics, genetics, spatial statistics, GIS, and epidemiology. To do this, I will first measue the utilization of bioinformatics resources and tools as well as the current approaches and limitations identified by state agencies of public health, agriculture, and wildlife for detecting nd predicting hotspots (clusters) of zoonotic viruses (Aim 1). I will then use this feedback to develo a spatial decision support system for detecting and predicting zoonotic hotspots that applies bioinformatics principles to access, integrate, and analyze viral genetics, environmental, and spatiotemporal reportable disease data (Aim 2). In Aim 3, I will then evaluate my system for cluster detection and prediction against a system that does not consider viral genetics and relies on traditional spatiotemporal data, and perform validation of the predictive capability. Additional evaluation of the user's satisfaction and system usability will be evaluated.               Project Narrative I will develop and evaluate a spatial decision support system to support surveillance of zoonotic viruses in both human and animal populations. I will use approaches from bioinformatics and public health to integrate genetic sequence data from the virus with data from cases of reported infectious diseases and associated environmental data. A surveillance system that considers the genetics and environment of the virus along with public health data will assist public health officials in making informed decisions regarding risk of infectious diseases.",Integrating Bioinformatics and Clustering Analysis for Disease Surveillance,9050106,F31LM012176,"['Academia', 'Address', 'Agriculture', 'Algorithm Design', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Biodiversity', 'Bioinformatics', 'Case Study', 'Clinical', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Detection', 'Disease', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Ecology', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Evaluation', 'Evolution', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Genbank', 'Genetic', 'Geographic Information Systems', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Human Genetics', 'Infection', 'Influenza', 'Influenza A Virus, H7N9 Subtype', 'Influenza A virus', 'Knowledge', 'Literature', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Metadata', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Epidemiology', 'Molecular Evolution', 'Pattern', 'Population', 'Public Health', 'Public Health Practice', 'Questionnaire Designs', 'Questionnaires', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk', 'Satellite Viruses', 'Scanning', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Time', 'Translations', 'Validation', 'Validity and Reliability', 'Viral', 'Viral Genome', 'Virus', 'Virus Diseases', 'West Nile virus', 'Work', 'clinical decision-making', 'data acquisition', 'disorder risk', 'health data', 'high risk', 'novel virus', 'pathogen', 'personalized medicine', 'prevent', 'respiratory', 'satisfaction', 'seasonal influenza', 'spatiotemporal', 'statistics', 'success', 'tool', 'usability', 'virus classification', 'virus genetics']",NLM,ARIZONA STATE UNIVERSITY-TEMPE CAMPUS,F31,2015,36613,0.024177918727219236
"Volatile Metabolite-Based Detection of Clostridium difficile Infection ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is a major cause of nosocomial diarrhea and mortality worldwide, increasing dramatically in incidence and severity over the past decade and rivaling or exceeding methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus as the most common healthcare-associated infection in the US. A critical barrier to reducing the nosocomial spread of CDI is the delay in timely identification of CDI cases, with subsequent delays in initiation of appropriate antimicrobial therapy and implementation of contact precautions and isolation measures to reduce horizontal CDI transmission. Despite advances in rapid laboratory-based CDI testing, there are still delays of 2-5 days between the onset of clinical symptoms and stool sampling and another 0.5-3.5 days between sample collection and actionable test results. Anticipating a delay in obtaining diagnostic results, many providers prescribe CDI antimicrobial therapy empirically, resulting in frequent and unnecessary treatment of patients who ultimately test negative for CDI. There is clearly an unmet need for diagnostic methods that can reduce this interval between onset of clinical symptoms and accurate identification of CDI. To address this unmet need, we propose a novel approach to CDI diagnosis based on detection of the volatile metabolome of the altered CDI microbiome. C. difficile flourishes in the antibiotic- disrupted intestinal microbiome and emits a distinctive odo detectable by human and canine olfaction. In a pilot study, we assessed the volatile metabolome of stool specimens from patients with suspected CDI using analytical chemistry techniques and discerned major differences in the stool volatome of patients with and without CDI. We propose two aims executed in parallel, to test the hypothesis that the altered CDI intestinal microbiome has a unique volatile metabolite profile, distinct from the profile of patiens with other causes of antibiotic-associated diarrhea, which can be used to identify patients with CDI in the hospital setting. Using thermal desorption GC-MS/MS to capture and identify these trace volatile metabolites and supervised learning methods - support vector machines, prediction analysis for microarray analysis, and random forests - to analyze this high-dimensional data matrix, we will deconvolute the complex volatome of CDI, (1) identifying the characteristic volatile metabolite profile of stool samples from hospitalized patients with CDI, compared to patients with other antibiotic-associated diarrhea, and (2) defining the CDI volatile metabolite profile in ambient air samples from the inpatient environment of patients with CDI, compared to patients with other antibiotic-associated diarrhea. The ultimate objective of this research is to derive and validate the volatile metabolic signature of CDI in stool samples and in the patient's environment, laying the groundwork for a novel CDI assay that can be coupled to a point-of-care gas sensor system for the bedside identification of CDI, reducing delays in diagnosis and decreasing nosocomial transmission of this common, highly morbid, and life- threatening infection.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is a major cause of healthcare-associated diarrhea and death worldwide, increasing dramatically in incidence and severity over the past decade. The objective of the proposed research is to identify and validate key components of the distinctive volatile metabolic 'scent' of CDI in stool and in air samples from the patient environment, laying the groundwork for a rapid bedside test for the detection of CDI. Such an assay would reduce the interval between the onset of CDI symptoms and diagnosis, allowing earlier treatment of patients with CDI, reducing unnecessary antibiotic use in patients without CDI, and decreasing healthcare-based transmission of this common, life-threatening infection.            ",Volatile Metabolite-Based Detection of Clostridium difficile Infection,8954018,R21AI119692,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Address', 'Air', 'Analytical Chemistry', 'Antibiotics', 'Antigens', 'Biological Assay', 'Canis familiaris', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clostridium difficile', 'Complex', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Diarrhea', 'Early treatment', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Exotoxins', 'Exposure to', 'Feces', 'Gases', 'Healthcare', 'Hospital Costs', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Infection Control', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Injury', 'Inpatients', 'Institution', 'Intestines', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Length of Stay', 'Life', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Fragmentography', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Microarray Analysis', 'Modeling', 'Nucleic Acid Amplification Tests', 'Odors', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pilot Projects', 'Proliferating', 'Provider', 'Pseudomembranous Colitis', 'Reference Standards', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Sampling', 'Septic Shock', 'Severities', 'Smell Perception', 'Specimen', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Toxic Megacolon', 'Toxin', 'Training', 'Tube', 'accurate diagnosis', 'air sampling', 'antimicrobial', 'base', 'cytotoxicity', 'design', 'forest', 'innovation', 'methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus', 'microbiome', 'mortality', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'point of care', 'public health relevance', 'sample collection', 'sensor', 'tertiary care', 'transmission process']",NIAID,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R21,2015,266063,0.016918124079325404
"Metabolomics-based discovery of small molecule biomarkers for noninvasive dengue PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Epidemic dengue fever (DF) and dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF/DSS) have emerged throughout the tropical world with devastating public health consequences. A dramatic increase in severe dengue disease (DEN) in Latin America in the last decade is of grave concern; 30% of cases are now diagnosed as severe dengue virus (DENV) infections. DEN is overwhelming public health capacity for clinical care in much of the developing world. The overall goal of this proposal is to provide a major change in the diagnosis and prognosis (D&P) of DENV infections. A metabolomics approach will be used to identify candidate metabolite small molecule biomarkers (SMBs) that occur both in serum and in non-invasive clinical specimens (urine and saliva) that diagnose DENV infection and predict progression to severe disease. Preliminary studies using acute phase specimens from DEN patients have identified a number of molecular features and candidate SMBs of DF and DHF/SS in serum, saliva, and urine using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS)-based metabolomics. In the R21 phase of this project, we will use a metabolic fingerprinting approach to confim existing and identify new candidate SMBs in retrospectively collected serum specimens available from the high-quality pediatric DEN hospital-based and cohort studies in Nicaragua, will begin to characterize the SMBs and metabolic pathways involved, will investigate the efficacy for D&P of these SMBs in prospectively collected serum, saliva, and urine specimens in the hospital study, and will identify a portfolio of the most significant molecular features that differentiate DEN, severe DEN, and non-DEN disease. We will develop algorithms including SMBs, clinical signs and symptoms, and clinical laboratory results for the D&P of DENV infections. In the R33 phase of the project, prospectively collected serum, saliva, and urine samples from both the hospital study and a community-based cohort study will be analyzed by metabolic profiling using LC-tandem MS (LC- MS/MS) to identify candidate SMBs. First generation EIA tests for selected SMBs will be included in the diagnostic regimen in Nicaragua The diagnostic and prognostic sensitivity and specificity of the candidate SMBs and ""first generation"" SMB tests will be determined as will the preferred clinical specimen for SMB- based diagnoses. Overall these studies will identify a panel of SMBs (e.g., 5-10), which will be used to formulate the Target Product Profiles (TPP) for rapid point-of-care (POC) tests for use in clinics and hospitals for DEN D&P. Detection of SMBs in saliva and urine that are predictive of severe DEN is innovative and provides the opportunity for a true paradigm shift in diagnosis by using inexpensive, easily procured, non- invasive clinical specimens for D&P of DEN. NARRATIVE The studies will exploit liquid chromotography-tandem mass spectrometry to identify small molecule biomarkers (SMBs) in serum, saliva, and urine of DEN patients for both prognosis and diagnosis of DEN infections. This will be of enormous value to physicians and public health workers in the developing world to identify patients at greatest risk for severe DEN for supportive care and early therapeutic intervention, and the use of non-invasive samples will provide a true paradigm shift in DEN diagnosis and patient care. 3",Metabolomics-based discovery of small molecule biomarkers for noninvasive dengue,8853788,R33AI100186,"['Acute', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Bedside Testings', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood specimen', 'California', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Course of Disease', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinics and Hospitals', 'Cohort Studies', 'Colorado', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Country', 'Databases', 'Dengue', 'Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever', 'Dengue Virus', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Environment', 'Epidemic', 'Fingerprint', 'Funding Mechanisms', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hemorrhagic Shock', 'Hospitals', 'Immunoglobulin M', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Infection', 'Laboratories', 'Latin America', 'Liquid Chromatography', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Pathway', 'Metabolism', 'Mexico', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Weight', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Nicaragua', 'Nicaraguan', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Care Management', 'Patient Triage', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Physiological', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Public Health', 'Qualifying', 'Regimen', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Saliva', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Serum', 'Shock', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Specimen', 'Supportive care', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Tissues', 'Universities', 'Urine', 'Virus Diseases', 'amplification detection', 'base', 'clinical care', 'disease diagnosis', 'innovation', 'liquid chromatography mass spectrometry', 'metabolomics', 'outcome forecast', 'point-of-care diagnostics', 'prognostic', 'programs', 'prospective', 'small molecule', 'tandem mass spectrometry']",NIAID,COLORADO STATE UNIVERSITY,R33,2015,404827,0.014500737505205285
"Impact of Gastrointestinal Microbiome on the Host Response to an Effector-Memory T-Cell AIDS Vaccine and Multiple Low-Dose Challenge ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This computational research project will analyze gastrointestinal microbiome, host cellular immune response, and host transcriptional response datasets derived from a large-scale rhesus macaque AIDS vaccine study. The vaccine study includes 70 animals divided into five groups and is designed to test the efficacy of a cytomegalovirus (CMV) vector expressing the major simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) proteins. In previous studies, RhCMV/SIV vaccines elicit a robust effector-memory T cell response. After challenge with highly pathogenic SIVmac239, approximately 50% of RhCMV/SIV-vaccinated monkeys exhibit a pattern of viral control that is characterized by a ""blip"" of viremia followed by control of plasma viremia to undetectable levels. One to three years later, RhCMV/SIV-protected monkeys show no sign of SIV infection, suggesting immune-mediated clearance of the virus. The mechanisms responsible for this 50% efficacy are not clear, but may reflect T cell responses at the site of SIV entry or sites of early replication. Thi project will investigate the role of the gastrointestinal microbiome on RhCMV/SIV-induced effector-memory T cell responses and protection against SIVmac239 challenge. The project includes two computationally based Specific Aims: 1) Define the composition of the gut microbiome prior to and after vaccination and during repeated limiting-dose SIVmac239 challenge; and 2) Determine how the composition of the gut microbiome correlates with protective immune cell responses and vaccine-induced host transcriptional responses. In Aim 1, 16S ribosomal sequence data (obtained from rectal swabs) will be used to determine operational taxonomic units. Variation in bacterial species over time and within individual animals will be determined using Mothur and Qiime metagenomic software.  Nonparametric statistical analyses and co-occurrence and co-exclusion networks will be used to identify bacterial species associated with progression or control of SIV infection after repeated limiting-dose intrarectal SIVmac239 challenge. In Aim 2, principle component analysis will be used to identify associations between microbiome composition and SIV-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses. Gene module-based and correlation network-based approaches will be used to determine associations between microbiome composition and host transcriptional responses (collected from whole blood samples). Together, these analyses will allow us to better understand microbiome-host interactions and their role in eliciting a protective vaccine-derived effector-memory T cell response. Such understanding will inform future vaccination strategies and attempts to modulate microbiome composition to affect vaccine efficacy.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The types and numbers of bacterial species that live in the gastrointestinal tract (together known as the microbiome) affect many aspects of human health and disease, including how individuals respond to vaccination and viral infection. In this study, we will define the gastrointestinal microbiome of rhesus monkeys before and after vaccination with an experimental AIDS vaccine and after infection with a monkey immunodeficiency virus. This study will allow us to determine how the microbiome impacts the effectiveness of the vaccine and may suggest whether altering the microbiome may improve vaccine performance.            ",Impact of Gastrointestinal Microbiome on the Host Response to an Effector-Memory T-Cell AIDS Vaccine and Multiple Low-Dose Challenge,8992226,R21AI120713,"['AIDS Vaccines', 'Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome', 'Affect', 'Animals', 'Blood specimen', 'CD8B1 gene', 'Cells', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Confounding Factors (Epidemiology)', 'Cytomegalovirus', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Diet', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Dose-Limiting', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Exclusion', 'Exhibits', 'Foundations', 'Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gastrointestinal tract structure', 'Gene Expression', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Health', 'Health Sciences', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immunologic Deficiency Syndromes', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Joints', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Life Style', 'Location', 'Macaca mulatta', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Memory', 'Metagenomics', 'Microbiology', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Monkeys', 'National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease', 'Network-based', 'Oregon', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Plasma', 'Process', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Role', 'SIV', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Site', 'Swab', 'T cell response', 'T memory cell', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Universities', 'Vaccinated', 'Vaccination', 'Vaccine Research', 'Vaccines', 'Variant', 'Viral', 'Viral Proteins', 'Viremia', 'Virus', 'Virus Diseases', 'Washington', 'Whole Blood', 'base', 'design', 'efficacy testing', 'functional genomics', 'gastrointestinal', 'improved', 'microbiome', 'nonhuman primate', 'professor', 'public health relevance', 'rectal', 'response', 'vaccination strategy', 'vaccine development', 'vaccine effectiveness', 'vaccine efficacy', 'vaccine response', 'vaccine trial', 'vaccine-induced immunity', 'vector']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R21,2015,217500,0.002174046046725607

The collaborative opportunities, intellectual environment and resources available to Dr. Farhat are outstanding. Research: Infectious diseases continue to be a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Despite the availability of effective antimicrobials, pathogens are successfully evolving new disease phenotypes that allow them to resist killing by these drugs or in other instances cause more severe disease manifestations or wider chains of transmission. Drug resistance (DR) is now common and some bacteria have even become resistant to multiple types or classes of antibiotics6. A key strategy in the fight against emerging pathogen phenotypes in infectious diseases is surveillance, and early personalized therapy to prevent transmission and propagation of these strains. The timely initiation of antibiotic therapy to which the pathogen is sensitive has been shown to be the key factor influencing treatment outcome for a diverse array of infections. Molecular tests that rely on the detection of microbial genetic mutations are particularly promising for surveillance and diagnosis of these pathogen phenotypes but rely on a comprehensive understanding of how mutations associate with these pathogen phenotypes. Currently there is an explosion of data on pathogen whole genome sequences (WGS) that is increasingly generated from clinical laboratories. Data on disease phenotype may also be available, but methods for the analysis and interpretation of these Big Data are lagging. Here I propose tools to aid in this analysis leveraging Big Data sets from Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) and my prior work. Specifically I propose to (1) develop a web-based public interface to several analysis tools, including a statistical learning model that can predict the MTB DR phenotype from its genomic sequence, (2) to develop and study an MTB gene-gene network, based on WGS data, to improve our understanding of the effect of mutation-mutation interactions on the DR phenotype, and (3) study the performance of methods in current use for the association of genotype and phenotype in pathogens, and develop a generalizable power calculator for the best performing method.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    Infectious agents of disease are successfully evolving drug resistance and other adaptations that threaten human health. Understanding the genetic mutations that underlie these disease phenotypes can inform surveillance and diagnostic strategies to combat this threat. Here I propose to develop accessible tools for pathogen genomic analysis that will help identify which genetic mutations are relevant to disease.                ",New Tools for the interpretation of Pathogen Genomic Data with a focus on Mycobacterium tuberculosis,9044227,K01ES026835,"['Affect', 'Antibiotic Therapy', 'Antibiotics', 'Area', 'Award', 'Bacteria', 'Big Data', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Biometry', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Complement', 'Computational Science', 'Consult', 'Critical Care', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Drug resistance', 'Drug resistance in tuberculosis', 'Drug-sensitive', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Explosion', 'Exposure to', 'Future', 'Gene Structure', 'General Hospitals', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Determinism', 'Genetic Epistasis', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Human', 'Infection', 'Infectious Agent', 'Infectious Diseases Research', 'Institutes', 'International', 'Journals', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Laboratories', 'Leadership', 'Low income', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Massachusetts', 'Measures', 'Medical Genetics', 'Medicine', 'Mentored Research Scientist Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Microbial Genetics', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mutation', 'Mycobacterium tuberculosis', 'National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease', 'Nature', 'Network-based', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Peer Review', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Phylogeny', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Public Health', 'Public Health Schools', 'Publications', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Severity of illness', 'Social Medicine', 'Social Sciences', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Treatment outcome', 'Tuberculosis', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'Virulent', 'Work', 'Writing', 'analytical tool', 'antimicrobial', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'career', 'combat', 'computer science', 'design', 'disease phenotype', 'experience', 'fight against', 'gene interaction', 'genome sequencing', 'genome-wide', 'global health', 'improved', 'instructor', 'killings', 'medical schools', 'microbial', 'microbial genome', 'mortality', 'pathogen', 'personalized medicine', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'simulation', 'skills', 'tool', 'transmission process']",NIEHS,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,K01,2015,230806,0.013487820994266347
"E. coli ST131-H30 colonization: defining community and population level antagonism in the gastrointestinal microbiome ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A virulent subclone of E. coli sequence type 131 (ST131), called ST131-H30, has become the dominant extraintestinal pathogenic E. coli lineage in the US, where it kills thousands of patients each year. Multidrug resistance is a hallmark of ST131-H30-including production of the CTX-M-15 extended spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-making its clinical management particularly challenging. The ability of ST131-H30 to colonize more frequently and persistently than other strains is thought to be important to its disproportional dis- ease burden. Yet, in our preliminary studies, we have observed that some people fail to become colonized with ST131-H30 despite prolonged household exposure. This strongly suggests that factors other than ST131- H30's intrinsic traits influence colonization. We know that, in the human GI tract, ST131-H30 does not live alone, but rather, as a minor component of a complex microbial community, within which it may be subjected to intense inter- and intra-species competition. In our previous microbiome studies of other body sites, we observed predictable relationships between commensal bacteria and opportunistic pathogens. This led us to hypothesize that distinct components of the GI microbiota, including bacteriocin-producing E. coli strains, may competitively exclude ST131-H30. Approach: By leveraging an ongoing longitudinal study of 600 participants, who will contribute > 7,000 fecal specimens, we will conduct two case-control studies to identify the microbiota unique to individuals who remain free of ST131-H30 for 12 months despite ongoing household exposure to ST131-H30 (elite non-colonizers), as compared to individuals with persistent colonization by ST131-H30 for 12 months (elite colonizers) and individuals who newly acquire ST131-H30 during the study (acquirers). We will identify bacterial species most predictive of resistance to ST131-H30 GI colonization using indicator species and decision tree analysis. The decision model will be validated using fecal microbiota data from an additional 300 participants from another cross-sectional survey. To explore intra-species competition, we will identify commensal E. coli strains antagonistic to ST131-H30 using in vitro inhibition assays, and will cross-validate the in vitro results by assessing the antagonistic strains' association with ST131-H30 exclusion using data from the longitudinal and cross-sectional cohorts. Innovation: Our approach is innovative in attempting to define mechanisms that influence GI colonization with ST131-H30; its focus on elite non-colonizers; its inter- and intra- species investigation of the microbiome within an ongoing longitudinal epidemiologic study; and its goal of identifying commensal bacteria antagonistic to a single virulent E. coli subclone. The expected outcome of this study is to identify commensal bacteria that can exclude ST131-H30 from the GI tract. With emerging resistance neutralizing the effectiveness our current antibiotic armamentarium, we must find new ways to prevent the spread of multidrug-resistant colonizing pathogens. These results could lead to novel, probiotic strategies for interrupting the transmission of ST131-H30 and future multidrug-resistant colonizing pathogens.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project is relevant to the NIH, NIAID, and public health because it will lay the groundwork for developing novel strategies to prevent the spread of multidrug-resistant E. coli. Some of the most dangerous kinds of E. coli spread asymptomatically in the gastrointestinal tracts of people. In this study, we seek to identify non- pathogenic bacteria that can prevent a deadly new strain of antibiotic-resistant E. coli, called ST131-H30, from colonizing the human gut.            ",E. coli ST131-H30 colonization: defining community and population level antagonism in the gastrointestinal microbiome,8881522,R21AI117654,"['Antibiotic Resistance', 'Antibiotics', 'Bacteria', 'Bacterial Adhesion', 'Biological Assay', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Cyclophosphamide', 'Cystitis', 'Data', 'Decision Modeling', 'Decision Trees', 'Detection', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Effectiveness', 'Epidemiologic Studies', 'Epidemiology', 'Escherichia coli', 'Exclusion', 'Exposure to', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Gastrointestinal tract structure', 'Goals', 'Household', 'Human', 'Human Microbiome', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Integration Host Factors', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Minor', 'Multi-Drug Resistance', 'National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease', 'Natural Resistance', 'Nature', 'Outcome Study', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Preventive', 'Price', 'Probiotics', 'Production', 'Productivity', 'Public Health', 'Pyelonephritis', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Role', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Site', 'Specimen', 'Structure', 'Taxon', 'Testing', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Virulent', 'Work', 'bacteriocin', 'base', 'beta-Lactamase', 'cohort', 'combat', 'commensal microbes', 'fluoroquinolone resistance', 'gastrointestinal', 'gastrointestinal bacteria', 'innovation', 'killings', 'microbial community', 'microbiome', 'multi-drug resistant pathogen', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'pathogen', 'pathogenic Escherichia coli', 'pathogenic bacteria', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'resistant strain', 'stem', 'trait', 'transmission process', 'urinary']",NIAID,GEORGE WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R21,2015,236125,0.015609290940075083
"Breath Volatile Metabolites for the Diagnosis of Emerging Invasive Mold Infection     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This resubmission K23 proposal outlines a five-year development plan for Sophia Koo to achieve independence as a patient-oriented clinician-scientist with particular expertise in the development and assessment of novel diagnostic modalities for invasive mold infections (IMI). The strategy outlined in this proposal will enable Dr. Koo to build upon her clinical background in caring for patients at risk for IMI and her clinicl research defining the limitations of currently available diagnostic modalities for these infections by taking advantage of the unique clinical and research strengths of Brigham and Women's Hospital and the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, biomedical engineering and bioinformatics capabilities of the Charles Stark Draper Laboratory, and epidemiology, biostatistics, and analytical chemistry training opportunities at the Harvard School of Public Health, Northeastern University, and Massachusetts Institute of Technology. She will be co-mentored by Dr. Lindsey Baden, Associate Professor of Medicine at Harvard Medical School, and Dr. Earl Francis Cook, Professor of Epidemiology at the Harvard School of Public Health. Dr. Baden is an expert in fungal diagnostics, and Dr. Cook is an expert in study design and statistical learning/data mining, including analysis of highly dimensional biomarker data. Dr. Koo will also work closely with Drs. Daniel Kuritzkes, Raphael Dolin, Francisco Marty, John Perfect, and John Wingard, who will provide career guidance and scientific advice on the execution of the proposed research plan, and her collaborators Drs. Paul Vouros, Terence Risby, and James Comolli, who will contribute their expertise in analytical chemistry and breath analysis to her research plan. The research program will employ analytical chemistry and statistical supervised learning approaches to define volatile organic compound (VOC) metabolite patterns of emerging invasive mold species in vitro and in patient breath to lay the groundwork for a noninvasive, point-of-care breath test for patients with emerging IMI. Specifically, this program proposes (1) a detailed definition of the VOC metabolome of the Mucorales, Fusarium, and Scedosporium species that most commonly cause human IMI, and (2) the prospective collection of VOC metabolites in the breath of patients with emerging IMI, patients with clinical and radiographic findings suggestive of an emerging IMI, and patients with respiratory tract colonization by these molds, with derivation and validation of VOC feature support vector machine classification algorithms to discriminate patients with emerging IMI from patients with other fungal infections or non-fungal pulmonary processes. Current diagnostic modalities for these infections are inadequate and often unacceptably morbid, and development of this novel, noninvasive diagnostic approach should allow earlier diagnosis of these infections than currently possible, prospective surveillance in the growing population of patients at risk for emerging IMI, more rational targeting of antifungal therapy, and improved clinical outcomes.  Project Narrative Invasive mold infections are highly morbid and often fatal in the growing population of patients with compromised immune systems. The proposed research seeks to overcome the significant limitations of currently available diagnostic methods for these infections by developing a novel, noninvasive test that identifies unique volatile compounds in the breath of patients with these infections. Development of this sensitive fungal breath test will allow better surveillance and targeting of antifungal therapy in patients at risk for these infections and ultimately, improved patient outcomes.            ",Breath Volatile Metabolites for the Diagnosis of Emerging Invasive Mold Infection,8699494,K23AI097225,"['Agriculture', 'Algorithms', 'Analytical Chemistry', 'Antifungal Agents', 'Antifungal Therapy', 'Area', 'Aspergillosis', 'Aspergillus', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Biometry', 'Biopsy', 'Breath Tests', 'Cereals', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Collection', 'Comorbidity', 'Complex Mixtures', 'Dana-Farber Cancer Institute', 'Data', 'Derivation procedure', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Disease', 'Dolin', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Environmental Health', 'Epidemiology', 'European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer', 'Exhalation', 'Fingerprint', 'Fusarium', 'Gas Chromatography', 'Gases', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Hematopoietic stem cells', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Immune system', 'Immunocompromised Host', 'Immunosuppressive Agents', 'In Vitro', 'Incidence', 'Industry', 'Infection', 'Institutes', 'Institution', 'Investigation', 'Kinetics', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Lung', 'Lung nodule', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Massachusetts', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'Modality', 'Molds', 'Mucorales', 'Mucormycosis', 'Mycoses', 'Nutritional', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Organ Transplantation', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Pneumonia', 'Population', 'Process', 'Public Health Schools', 'Regimen', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Respiratory System', 'Respiratory tract structure', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Scedosporium', 'Scientist', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sodium Glutamate', 'Solid', 'Specimen', 'Spectrometry', 'Syndrome', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'The science of Mycology', 'Training', 'Transplant Recipients', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Vial device', 'Woman', 'Work', 'air sampling', 'base', 'career', 'clinically relevant', 'cooking', 'data mining', 'improved', 'medical schools', 'microbial', 'mortality', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'patient oriented', 'patient population', 'point of care', 'pressure', 'professor', 'programs', 'prospective', 'volatile organic compound']",NIAID,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,K23,2014,137160,0.03191490346185556
"Models for synthesising molecular, clinical and epidemiological data, and transla     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A mathematical or computational model of infectious disease transmission represents the process of how an infection spreads from one person to another. Such models have a long history within infectious disease epidemiology, and are useful tools for giving insight into the dynamics of epidemics and for evaluating the potential effect of control methods. The overall objective of this project is to substantially improve the methods by which models of infectious diseases transmission are calibrated against biological and disease surveillance data. This will both improve the utility of models as tools for analyzing data on infectious disease outbreaks (for instance to provide more rapid and reliable estimates of how transmissible and lethal a new virus is to public health agencies) and also improve the reliability of models as tools for predicting the likely effect of different interventions (such as vaccines or case isolation) to help policy makers make more informed decisions about control policies. As with many areas of biology and medicine, the data landscape for infectious diseases modeling is changing rapidly. Larger and more complex datasets are becoming available that cover many different aspects of the interaction between a pathogen and the human population: clinical episode data, genetic data about fast-evolving pathogens; animal-model transmission data and community-based representative serological data. The specific aims of our project are to: (a) develop new machine-learning based methods to discover interesting patterns in complex datasets related to the transmission of infectious disease, so as to better specify subsequent mechanistic mathematical or computational models; (b) derive new approaches for using more than one type of data simultaneously to calibrate transmission models and (c) derive new methods of parameter estimation for simulations which model the spatial spread of infection or model both the transmission and genetic evolution of a pathogen. We will achieve these aims in the applied context of research on three key infections: emerging infectious diseases (such as MERS-CoV - the novel coronavirus currently spreading in the Middle East), influenza and Streptococcus pneumonia (a major bacterial pathogen). Examples of the scientific questions we will address that cannot be answered with current methods are: (i) how many unobserved cases of MERS-CoV have occurred so far (to be answered using data on case clusters data, the spatial distribution of cases and viral genetic sequences)? (ii) how many people in different age groups are infected with influenza each year and how does their immune system respond to infection (to be answered using data on case incidence and serological testing of the population)? (iii) how much is vaccination coupled with prescribing practices influencing the emergence of resistant strains of pneumococcus (to be addressed with data on antibiotic and vaccine use, case incidence and bacterial strain frequency)?         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Mathematical and computational models of infectious disease spread can provide valuable information to aid policy-makers in the tough choices they face when trying to control infectious diseases, but models must be designed to make the best possible use of the often limited data available. As the digital footprints of our lives grow, so te datasets available for infectious disease models become larger and more complex. This project will develop new algorithms and methods to allow models to make better use of all available data and therefore better inform control policy planning for diseases such as: influenza, pneumococcal infection and novel viruses like MERS-CoV.            ","Models for synthesising molecular, clinical and epidemiological data, and transla",8703195,U01GM110721,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Model', 'Antibiotics', 'Antigenic Variation', 'Area', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Coronavirus', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Economics', 'Emerging Communicable Diseases', 'Epidemic', 'Epidemiology', 'Evolution', 'Face', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Generations', 'Generic Drugs', 'Genetic', 'Genotype', 'Hospitalization', 'Human', 'Human Influenza A Virus', 'Immune', 'Immune system', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Infectious Disease Epidemiology', 'Influenza', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Middle East', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Monte Carlo Method', 'Movement', 'Natural History', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Phenotype', 'Pneumococcal Infections', 'Policies', 'Policy Maker', 'Population', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Serologic tests', 'Serological', 'Shapes', 'Site', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Specificity', 'Stream', 'Streptococcus pneumoniae', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Vaccination', 'Vaccines', 'Variant', 'Virus', 'Work', 'age group', 'base', 'contextual factors', 'data exchange', 'data mining', 'design', 'digital', 'disease natural history', 'disease transmission', 'epidemiological model', 'forest', 'genetic evolution', 'improved', 'infectious disease model', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'mathematical model', 'meetings', 'mortality', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'novel virus', 'pandemic influenza', 'pathogen', 'predictive modeling', 'public health relevance', 'resistant strain', 'seasonal influenza', 'simulation', 'social', 'surveillance data', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'virus genetics']",NIGMS,U OF L IMPERIAL COL OF SCI/TECHNLGY/MED,U01,2014,427668,0.06874227544925647
"Genetic predictors of anti-TNF treatment response and infections in IBD     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) affect over 1.4 million Americans. Over the past 15 years, considerable progress has been made in the therapy of CD and UC with monoclonal antibodies against tumor necrosis factor ¿ (anti-TNF) representing the most significant therapeutic breakthrough. However, many patients fail to respond adequately. Recent genome wide associations studies (GWAS) have significantly increased our understanding of the pathogenesis of CD and UC. The role of these genetic variants in predicting response to anti-TNF therapy is yet to be defined adequately. In addition, significant safety concerns remain with the use of these agents with serious infections occurring in up to 10% of patients. There is a strong genetic component to susceptibility to infections, in particular involving polymorphisms in innate immunity. Given the key role of innate immunity in IBD pathogenesis, whether such shared polymorphisms also influence risk of infections on anti-TNF therapy has not been examined previously. Thus, the development of tools to define likelihood of treatment response and infections are a key unmet need in the field. Our overarching objective is to identify clinical and genetic predictors of both short-term and long-term response as well as infectious complications of anti-TNF therapy. To achieve these aims, we will utilize the complementary strengths of two large cohorts - a prospective registry cohort of over 1200 patients with CD or UC, and a novel EMR-based cohort of over 11,000 patients with CD or UC linked to a biospecimen repository. This proposal utilizes the mentorship and significant expertise in key areas including analytical genetics, translational immunology, and bioinformatics and allows the candidate to develop fundamental skills in these novel content areas and research methods. The access to expertise at the NIH-funded center Informatics for Integrating Biology and the Bedside, the Center for Study of Inflammatory Bowel Disease, and the Broad Institute is a key strength of this application. This career development award will be critical in providing training in bioinformatics and genetic epidemiology, thus contributing to the candidate's long-term goal of establishing an independent IBD research career with focus on defining at-risk cohorts and personalizing therapy. The training component of the award includes graduate-level courses in the relevant content areas in genetic epidemiology, and bioinformatics at the Harvard Medical School, School of Public Health, and Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The candidate will continue to actively engage with an established group of multidisciplinary researchers who have demonstrated the utility of the EMR-based approach to accurately define autoimmune diseases, link it to biospecimen collection, and use it successfully for genotyping-phenotype research. This will help foster collaborative development of future proposals as the work proposed in this application has the potential for applicability in other cohorts.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The novel information gained from this study regarding genetic predictors of treatment response and infectious complications has the potential to transform clinical practice by leading to clinical trials focused on selected cohorts of patients most likely to respond to therapies with low risk of adverse events, thus preventing unnecessary exposure to potentially toxic therapies with low likelihood of benefit. Such work is a step toward developing personalized medicine approaches to tailor therapy based on likelihood of benefit and risk. The methodology developed here will also have applications in other EMR-based cohorts to investigate novel therapeutic agents and disease outcomes.                  ",Genetic predictors of anti-TNF treatment response and infections in IBD,8676787,K23DK097142,"['Address', 'Adverse event', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Anti-Tumor Necrosis Factor Therapy', 'Antibodies', 'Area', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Award', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biology', 'CD14 gene', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collection', 'Comorbidity', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Crohn&apos', 's disease', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Disease remission', 'Exposure to', 'Fostering', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Research', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Human Genetics', 'IL1R1 gene', 'Immune response', 'Immunology', 'Immunosuppressive Agents', 'Infection', 'Inflammatory Bowel Diseases', 'Informatics', 'Institutes', 'Institution', 'Interferons', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Massachusetts', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Monoclonal Antibodies', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Natural Immunity', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Pneumonia', 'Predisposition', 'Public Health Schools', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Sepsis', 'Source', 'Structure', 'TNF gene', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Training', 'Treatment outcome', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor Therapy', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha', 'Ulcerative Colitis', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'adaptive immunity', 'base', 'career', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'cost', 'genetic epidemiology', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'immune function', 'medical schools', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'patient registry', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'repository', 'response', 'skills', 'tool development', 'treatment response']",NIDDK,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,K23,2014,169572,0.0056022998189181085
"Probabilistic Disease Surveillance     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         The proposed research will further develop and evaluate a probabilistic approach to disease surveillance. In this approach, a probabilistic case detection system (CDS) uses Bayesian diagnostic networks to compute the likelihoods of patient findings for each of a set of infectious diseases for every patient in a monitored population. CDS computes these likelihoods from data in electronic medical records, including information derived from free-text reports by natural language processing. CDS makes those estimates available to a probabilistic outbreak detection and characterization component (ODCS).             ODCS also utilizes a Bayesian approach to compute the probability that an outbreak is ongoing for each of a set of infectious diseases of interest, given information from CDS. ODCS also computes probability distributions over the current and future size of a detected outbreak and other characteristics such as incubation period used by public health officials when responding to an outbreak.                        The proposed research will extend the approach, which we have already developed and evaluated for the disease influenza to six additional respiratory infectious diseases. The research will also extend the capabilities of ODCS to utilize non-EMR data, detect an unknown disease, and detect and characterize concurrent outbreaks. The planned evaluations will measure the accuracy of both CDS and ODCS using historical surveillance data from two regions and simulated outbreak data, which we will create by adding outbreak cases generated by an agent-based epidemic simulator to real baseline surveillance data from non-outbreak periods.                        The innovation being advanced by this research is a novel, integrated, Bayesian approach for the early and accurate detection of cases of diseases that threaten health and for the detection and characterization of outbreaks of diseases that threaten public health. The proposed approach has significant potential to improve the information available to public health officials and physicians, which can be expected to improve clinical and public health decision making, and ultimately to improve population health.                  Project Relevance  The proposed research will improve the ability of public health officials and physicians to estimate the current incidence of influenza and other infectious diseases and to predict the future course of epidemics of those diseases. The improved information will better support decisions made by health departments to control epidemics, which is expected to reduce morbidity and mortality from epidemic diseases.",Probabilistic Disease Surveillance,8708209,R01LM011370,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Advanced Development', 'Area', 'Bayesian Method', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Complex', 'Computer Systems', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'County', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Disease model', 'Epidemic', 'Epidemiologist', 'Epidemiology', 'Evaluation', 'Future', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Influenza', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lung diseases', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Probability', 'Public Health', 'Public Health Practice', 'Publications', 'ROC Curve', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Schools', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Severities', 'Simulate', 'Sodium Chloride', 'Structure', 'Support System', 'System', 'Systems Integration', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Topaz', 'Universities', 'Utah', 'Vaccination', 'advanced system', 'base', 'computer code', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'disorder control', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'influenza outbreak', 'innovation', 'interest', 'knowledge base', 'mortality', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'operation', 'pandemic disease', 'population health', 'portability', 'reproductive', 'respiratory', 'surveillance data']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2014,535841,0.010166254611523956
"A Framework for Integrating Multiple Data Sources for Modeling and Forecasting of Infectious Diseases     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): I am trained as a computational biologist and statistician, and I am currently a postdoctoral fellow at Boston Children's Hospital, Harvard Medical School. My main career goal is to become an independent researcher at a major research institution. I plan to continue my current research pursuits in global health and infectious diseases. Specifically, I aim to continue developing mathematical and computational approaches for modeling to understand disease transmission, forecasting future dynamics and evaluating interventions for public policy decisions. As a postdoctoral research fellow, I have had the wonderful opportunity of working with data from multiple sources. Although several of these data streams could be labeled as ""Big Data"", I typically work with the data after it is already processed, filtered and aggregated to a daily or weekly resolution. While I have developed the necessary skills for modeling these already processed data, there are three important areas where I require additional training, mentoring, and experience: (1) advanced computational skills especially in the use of high performance computing and informatics tools, (2) techniques in computational machine learning and data mining necessary for data acquisition and processing, and (3) biostatistical methodology needed for the statistical design of studies involving big data. These three training and mentoring aims would enable me to develop the skills necessary to become an independent investigator in Big Data Science for biomedical research. Boston Children's School and Harvard Medical School are leading institutions in translational biomedical research, thereby making them the ideal environment to pursue the training and research aims in this proposal. The recent emergence of infectious diseases such as the avian influenza H7N9 in China, and re-emergence of diseases such as polio in Syria underscores the importance of strengthening immunization and emergency response programs for the prevention and control of infectious diseases. Researchers have developed computational and mathematical models to capture determinants of infectious disease dynamics and identify factors that support prediction of these dynamics, provide estimates of disease risk, and evaluate various intervention scenarios. While these studies have been extremely useful for the understanding of infectious disease transmission and control, most have been disease specific and solely used data from traditional disease surveillance systems. In contrast, there is a huge amount of internet-based data that have been extensively assessed and validated for public health surveillance in the last decade, but it has been scarcely used in conjunction with other data sources for modeling to predict disease spread. Using these novel digital event-based data sources in combination with climate and case data from traditional disease surveillance systems, we will establish a much needed framework for integrating these disparate data sources for modeling to estimate disease risk and forecasting temporal dynamics of infectious diseases. Our approach will be achieved through three aims. The first objective is to develop an automated process for acquiring, processing and filtering data for modeling (Aim 1). Once we gather this data, we will develop temporal models for the dynamical assessment of the relationship between the various data variables and infectious disease incidence (Aim 2). Finally, we will assess the utility of the modeling approaches developed under Aim 2 for forecasting temporal trends of infectious diseases (Aim 3). Through data acquisition, thorough processing, statistical and epidemiological modeling, and guided by advisers with expertise in biomedical informatics, computer science and statistics, we plan to achieve a comprehensive approach to integrating multiple data streams for modeling to forecast infectious diseases.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Although there have been significant medical and technological advances towards infectious disease prevention, surveillance and control, infectious diseases still account for an estimated 15 million deaths each year worldwide. Reliable forecasts of infectious disease dynamics can influence decisions regarding prioritization of limited resources during outbreaks, optimization of disease interventions and implementation of rigorous surveillance processes for quicker case identification and control of emerging disease outbreaks. Our goal is therefore to develop a data mining/informatics framework that leverages the huge amount of digital event-based data sources in combination with climate data, and data from traditional disease surveillance systems for modeling and forecasting infectious diseases.            ",A Framework for Integrating Multiple Data Sources for Modeling and Forecasting of Infectious Diseases,8829434,K01ES025438,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Area', 'Avian Influenza', 'Big Data', 'Biological Models', 'Biomedical Research', 'Boston', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Cessation of life', 'Child', 'China', 'Climate', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Computer Simulation', 'Coronavirus', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Dengue', 'Detection', 'Disease', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Disease model', 'Emergency Situation', 'Emerging Communicable Diseases', 'Environment', 'Epidemic', 'Epidemiology', 'Event', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'High Performance Computing', 'Human', 'Humidity', 'Immunization', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Influenza', 'Influenza A Virus, H1N1 Subtype', 'Influenza A Virus, H7N9 Subtype', 'Informatics', 'Institution', 'International', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Label', 'Linear Models', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Middle East', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Poliomyelitis', 'Population Surveillance', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Prevention program', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Public Policy', 'Report (account)', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Proposals', 'Research Training', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Review Literature', 'Schools', 'Science', 'Series', 'Source', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Stream', 'Syndrome', 'Syria', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Temperature', 'Time', 'Training', 'Weight', 'Work', 'World Health Organization', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'career', 'computer science', 'computerized data processing', 'data acquisition', 'data integration', 'data mining', 'data modeling', 'digital', 'disease transmission', 'disorder control', 'disorder prevention', 'disorder risk', 'epidemiological model', 'experience', 'global health', 'improved', 'infectious disease model', 'mathematical model', 'medical schools', 'news', 'novel', 'pandemic influenza', 'public health relevance', 'respiratory', 'response', 'skills', 'social', 'statistics', 'tool', 'trend', 'web based interface']",NIEHS,BOSTON CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,K01,2014,42469,0.036727707187541835
"Metabolomics-based discovery of small molecule biomarkers for noninvasive dengue PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Epidemic dengue fever (DF) and dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF/DSS) have emerged throughout the tropical world with devastating public health consequences. A dramatic increase in severe dengue disease (DEN) in Latin America in the last decade is of grave concern; 30% of cases are now diagnosed as severe dengue virus (DENV) infections. DEN is overwhelming public health capacity for clinical care in much of the developing world. The overall goal of this proposal is to provide a major change in the diagnosis and prognosis (D&P) of DENV infections. A metabolomics approach will be used to identify candidate metabolite small molecule biomarkers (SMBs) that occur both in serum and in non-invasive clinical specimens (urine and saliva) that diagnose DENV infection and predict progression to severe disease. Preliminary studies using acute phase specimens from DEN patients have identified a number of molecular features and candidate SMBs of DF and DHF/SS in serum, saliva, and urine using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS)-based metabolomics. In the R21 phase of this project, we will use a metabolic fingerprinting approach to confim existing and identify new candidate SMBs in retrospectively collected serum specimens available from the high-quality pediatric DEN hospital-based and cohort studies in Nicaragua, will begin to characterize the SMBs and metabolic pathways involved, will investigate the efficacy for D&P of these SMBs in prospectively collected serum, saliva, and urine specimens in the hospital study, and will identify a portfolio of the most significant molecular features that differentiate DEN, severe DEN, and non-DEN disease. We will develop algorithms including SMBs, clinical signs and symptoms, and clinical laboratory results for the D&P of DENV infections. In the R33 phase of the project, prospectively collected serum, saliva, and urine samples from both the hospital study and a community-based cohort study will be analyzed by metabolic profiling using LC-tandem MS (LC- MS/MS) to identify candidate SMBs. First generation EIA tests for selected SMBs will be included in the diagnostic regimen in Nicaragua The diagnostic and prognostic sensitivity and specificity of the candidate SMBs and ""first generation"" SMB tests will be determined as will the preferred clinical specimen for SMB- based diagnoses. Overall these studies will identify a panel of SMBs (e.g., 5-10), which will be used to formulate the Target Product Profiles (TPP) for rapid point-of-care (POC) tests for use in clinics and hospitals for DEN D&P. Detection of SMBs in saliva and urine that are predictive of severe DEN is innovative and provides the opportunity for a true paradigm shift in diagnosis by using inexpensive, easily procured, non- invasive clinical specimens for D&P of DEN. NARRATIVE The studies will exploit liquid chromotography-tandem mass spectrometry to identify small molecule biomarkers (SMBs) in serum, saliva, and urine of DEN patients for both prognosis and diagnosis of DEN infections. This will be of enormous value to physicians and public health workers in the developing world to identify patients at greatest risk for severe DEN for supportive care and early therapeutic intervention, and the use of non-invasive samples will provide a true paradigm shift in DEN diagnosis and patient care. 3",Metabolomics-based discovery of small molecule biomarkers for noninvasive dengue,8841436,R33AI100186,"['Acute', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Bedside Testings', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood specimen', 'California', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Course of Disease', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinics and Hospitals', 'Cohort Studies', 'Colorado', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Country', 'Databases', 'Dengue', 'Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever', 'Dengue Virus', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Environment', 'Epidemic', 'Fingerprint', 'Funding Mechanisms', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hemorrhagic Shock', 'Hospitals', 'Immunoglobulin M', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Infection', 'Laboratories', 'Latin America', 'Liquid Chromatography', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Pathway', 'Metabolism', 'Mexico', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Weight', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Nicaragua', 'Nicaraguan', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Care Management', 'Patient Triage', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Physiological', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Public Health', 'Qualifying', 'Regimen', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Saliva', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Serum', 'Shock', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Specimen', 'Supportive care', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Tissues', 'Universities', 'Urine', 'Virus Diseases', 'base', 'clinical care', 'disease diagnosis', 'innovation', 'liquid chromatography mass spectrometry', 'metabolomics', 'outcome forecast', 'point-of-care diagnostics', 'prognostic', 'programs', 'prospective', 'small molecule', 'tandem mass spectrometry']",NIAID,COLORADO STATE UNIVERSITY,R33,2014,402924,0.014500737505205285
"MACHINE LEARNING TO FORECAST ZOONOTIC DISEASE EMERGENCE    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): As over 70% of emerging infectious diseases are caused by parasites or pathogens transmitted from animals to humans (leading to 'zoonotic' infections), a fundamental issues for public health is identifying the drivers leading to zoonotic diseases in humans. Cross-species transmission of infectious agents depends on numerous traits of hosts, their infectious agents, and environmental factors defining the external context of disease. Previous studies identifying predictors of cross-species transmission have been limited by a focus on single infectious diseases (e.g., rabies, Lyme disease) at restricted spatial scales, in part because large-scale analyses spanning numerous host species and infectious agents are precluded by the many complex interactions, autocorrelations, and sampling biases common in multivariate, high-dimensional data. The proposed research confronts these computational limitations through the innovative application of machine learning algorithms. Specifically, analyses will address three outstanding and interrelated questions in global health: (1) What characteristics signal a predisposition of mammalian host species to be reservoirs of zoonotic disease?; (2) What traits among infectious agents predict their potential to cause zoonotic infection?; (3) What are the most important environmental and anthropogenic predictors of zoonotic outbreaks globally? Analyses will apply a series of supervised, unsupervised and semi-supervised machine learning algorithms to new, global-scale databases containing biological, ecological, environmental, and anthropogenic data for three groups of mammalian hosts (primates, carnivores, and ungulates) and their zoonotic infectious agents. A long-term goal of this research is to empirically develop ""rules of thumb"" about zoonotic diseases by highlighting the key traits of mammalian hosts, infectious agents, and the environmental and human factors describing zoonotic outbreaks in recent history. Ultimately, research proposed herein will provide a basis for predicting the geographic locations, infectious agents, and animal reservoirs from which future zoonoses will emerge.        This project proposes to investigate the factors driving zoonotic disease outbreaks and cross-species transmission from wild mammals into humans through the innovative application of machine learning algorithms to newly published data describing hundreds of infectious agents, their mammalian host species, human populations, and the global environment. Ultimately, this project aims to predict the locations and species from which future diseases will emerge, and is therefore directly relevant for the improvement of human health.

"Breath Volatile Metabolites for the Diagnosis of Emerging Invasive Mold Infection     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This resubmission K23 proposal outlines a five-year development plan for Sophia Koo to achieve independence as a patient-oriented clinician-scientist with particular expertise in the development and assessment of novel diagnostic modalities for invasive mold infections (IMI). The strategy outlined in this proposal will enable Dr. Koo to build upon her clinical background in caring for patients at risk for IMI and her clinicl research defining the limitations of currently available diagnostic modalities for these infections by taking advantage of the unique clinical and research strengths of Brigham and Women's Hospital and the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, biomedical engineering and bioinformatics capabilities of the Charles Stark Draper Laboratory, and epidemiology, biostatistics, and analytical chemistry training opportunities at the Harvard School of Public Health, Northeastern University, and Massachusetts Institute of Technology. She will be co-mentored by Dr. Lindsey Baden, Associate Professor of Medicine at Harvard Medical School, and Dr. Earl Francis Cook, Professor of Epidemiology at the Harvard School of Public Health. Dr. Baden is an expert in fungal diagnostics, and Dr. Cook is an expert in study design and statistical learning/data mining, including analysis of highly dimensional biomarker data. Dr. Koo will also work closely with Drs. Daniel Kuritzkes, Raphael Dolin, Francisco Marty, John Perfect, and John Wingard, who will provide career guidance and scientific advice on the execution of the proposed research plan, and her collaborators Drs. Paul Vouros, Terence Risby, and James Comolli, who will contribute their expertise in analytical chemistry and breath analysis to her research plan. The research program will employ analytical chemistry and statistical supervised learning approaches to define volatile organic compound (VOC) metabolite patterns of emerging invasive mold species in vitro and in patient breath to lay the groundwork for a noninvasive, point-of-care breath test for patients with emerging IMI. Specifically, this program proposes (1) a detailed definition of the VOC metabolome of the Mucorales, Fusarium, and Scedosporium species that most commonly cause human IMI, and (2) the prospective collection of VOC metabolites in the breath of patients with emerging IMI, patients with clinical and radiographic findings suggestive of an emerging IMI, and patients with respiratory tract colonization by these molds, with derivation and validation of VOC feature support vector machine classification algorithms to discriminate patients with emerging IMI from patients with other fungal infections or non-fungal pulmonary processes. Current diagnostic modalities for these infections are inadequate and often unacceptably morbid, and development of this novel, noninvasive diagnostic approach should allow earlier diagnosis of these infections than currently possible, prospective surveillance in the growing population of patients at risk for emerging IMI, more rational targeting of antifungal therapy, and improved clinical outcomes.  Project Narrative Invasive mold infections are highly morbid and often fatal in the growing population of patients with compromised immune systems. The proposed research seeks to overcome the significant limitations of currently available diagnostic methods for these infections by developing a novel, noninvasive test that identifies unique volatile compounds in the breath of patients with these infections. Development of this sensitive fungal breath test will allow better surveillance and targeting of antifungal therapy in patients at risk for these infections and ultimately, improved patient outcomes.            ",Breath Volatile Metabolites for the Diagnosis of Emerging Invasive Mold Infection,8528464,K23AI097225,"['Agriculture', 'Algorithms', 'Analytical Chemistry', 'Antifungal Agents', 'Antifungal Therapy', 'Area', 'Aspergillosis', 'Aspergillus', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Biometry', 'Biopsy', 'Breath Tests', 'Cereals', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Collection', 'Comorbidity', 'Complex Mixtures', 'Dana-Farber Cancer Institute', 'Data', 'Derivation procedure', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Disease', 'Dolin', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Environmental Health', 'Epidemiology', 'European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer', 'Exhalation', 'Fingerprint', 'Fusarium', 'Gas Chromatography', 'Gases', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Hematopoietic stem cells', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Immune system', 'Immunocompromised Host', 'Immunosuppressive Agents', 'In Vitro', 'Incidence', 'Industry', 'Infection', 'Institutes', 'Institution', 'Investigation', 'Kinetics', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Lung', 'Lung nodule', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Massachusetts', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'Modality', 'Molds', 'Mucorales', 'Mucormycosis', 'Mycoses', 'Nutritional', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Organ Transplantation', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Pneumonia', 'Population', 'Process', 'Public Health Schools', 'Regimen', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Respiratory System', 'Respiratory tract structure', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Scedosporium', 'Scientist', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sodium Glutamate', 'Solid', 'Specimen', 'Spectrometry', 'Syndrome', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'The science of Mycology', 'Training', 'Transplant Recipients', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Vial device', 'Woman', 'Work', 'air sampling', 'base', 'career', 'clinically relevant', 'cooking', 'data mining', 'improved', 'medical schools', 'microbial', 'mortality', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'patient oriented', 'patient population', 'point of care', 'pressure', 'professor', 'programs', 'prospective', 'volatile organic compound']",NIAID,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,K23,2013,137160,0.03191490346185556
"Text Processing and Geospatial Uncertainty for Phylogeography of Zoonotic Viruses     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Phylogeography of zoonotic viruses studies the geographical spread and genetic lineages of viruses that are transmittable between animals and humans such as avian influenza and rabies. This science can help state public health and agriculture agencies identify the animal hosts that most impact virus propagation in a particular geographic region, the migration path of the virus including its origin, and the patterns of infection in various host populations, including humans, over time. The National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), specifically GenBank, provides an abundance of available viral sequence data for phylogeography. Sequences and their metadata can be downloaded and imported into software applications that generate phylogeographic trees and models for surveillance. However, geospatial metadata such as host location is inconsistently represented and sparse across GenBank entries, with our preliminary studies showing only about 20% of the GenBank records contain specific information such as a county, town, or region within a state. While this detailed geospatial information might be included in the corresponding journal article, it is not available for immediate use in a bioinformatics or GIS application unless it is manually extracted and linked back to the appropriate sequence. Absence of precise sampling locations from easily-computable secondary data sources such as GenBank increases the difficulty of achieving accurate phylogeographic models of virus migration. We propose an infrastructure to improve phylogeographic models of virus migration by linking relevant geospatial data from the literature. This work represents the first effort to use automatically extracted geospatial data present in journal articles corresponding to GenBank records in order to enhance modeling of virus migration. Our research will extend phylogeography and zoonotic surveillance by: creating a Natural Language Processing (NLP) infrastructure that will improve the level of detail of geospatial data for phylogeography of zoonotic viruses (Aim 1), develop phylogeographic models using the data extracted in Aim 1 with adequate biostatistical models (Aim 2), and evaluating the impact of our approach for phylogeography and surveillance of zoonotic viruses (Aim 3). Thus, this work will provide researchers with a framework for population surveillance using an integrated biomedical informatics approach including NLP, biostatistics, bioinformatics, and database design.           We will create Natural Language Processing Infrastructure and novel phylogeographic models of zoonotic viruses that will allow state public health and agriculture agencies and other researchers to study virus migration. This will enhance population health surveillance including identification of the animal hosts that most impact virus propagation in a particular geographic region, the migration path of zoonotic pathogens, and the patterns of infection in various host populations over time, including humans. This resource will enable state agencies to implement improved public health control measures that will reduce morbidity and mortality of animals and humans from zoonotic diseases.

"Probabilistic Disease Surveillance     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         The proposed research will further develop and evaluate a probabilistic approach to disease surveillance. In this approach, a probabilistic case detection system (CDS) uses Bayesian diagnostic networks to compute the likelihoods of patient findings for each of a set of infectious diseases for every patient in a monitored population. CDS computes these likelihoods from data in electronic medical records, including information derived from free-text reports by natural language processing. CDS makes those estimates available to a probabilistic outbreak detection and characterization component (ODCS).             ODCS also utilizes a Bayesian approach to compute the probability that an outbreak is ongoing for each of a set of infectious diseases of interest, given information from CDS. ODCS also computes probability distributions over the current and future size of a detected outbreak and other characteristics such as incubation period used by public health officials when responding to an outbreak.                        The proposed research will extend the approach, which we have already developed and evaluated for the disease influenza to six additional respiratory infectious diseases. The research will also extend the capabilities of ODCS to utilize non-EMR data, detect an unknown disease, and detect and characterize concurrent outbreaks. The planned evaluations will measure the accuracy of both CDS and ODCS using historical surveillance data from two regions and simulated outbreak data, which we will create by adding outbreak cases generated by an agent-based epidemic simulator to real baseline surveillance data from non-outbreak periods.                        The innovation being advanced by this research is a novel, integrated, Bayesian approach for the early and accurate detection of cases of diseases that threaten health and for the detection and characterization of outbreaks of diseases that threaten public health. The proposed approach has significant potential to improve the information available to public health officials and physicians, which can be expected to improve clinical and public health decision making, and ultimately to improve population health.                  Project Relevance  The proposed research will improve the ability of public health officials and physicians to estimate the current incidence of influenza and other infectious diseases and to predict the future course of epidemics of those diseases. The improved information will better support decisions made by health departments to control epidemics, which is expected to reduce morbidity and mortality from epidemic diseases.",Probabilistic Disease Surveillance,8578484,R01LM011370,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Advanced Development', 'Area', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Complex', 'Computer Systems', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'County', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Disease model', 'Epidemic', 'Epidemiologist', 'Epidemiology', 'Evaluation', 'Future', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Influenza', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lung diseases', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Probability', 'Public Health', 'Public Health Practice', 'Publications', 'ROC Curve', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Schools', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Severities', 'Simulate', 'Sodium Chloride', 'Structure', 'Support System', 'System', 'Systems Integration', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Topaz', 'Universities', 'Utah', 'Vaccination', 'advanced system', 'base', 'computer code', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'disorder control', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'influenza outbreak', 'innovation', 'interest', 'knowledge base', 'mortality', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'operation', 'pandemic disease', 'population health', 'portability', 'reproductive', 'respiratory', 'surveillance data']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2013,590023,0.010166254611523956
"Genetic predictors of anti-TNF treatment response and infections in IBD     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) affect over 1.4 million Americans. Over the past 15 years, considerable progress has been made in the therapy of CD and UC with monoclonal antibodies against tumor necrosis factor ¿ (anti-TNF) representing the most significant therapeutic breakthrough. However, many patients fail to respond adequately. Recent genome wide associations studies (GWAS) have significantly increased our understanding of the pathogenesis of CD and UC. The role of these genetic variants in predicting response to anti-TNF therapy is yet to be defined adequately. In addition, significant safety concerns remain with the use of these agents with serious infections occurring in up to 10% of patients. There is a strong genetic component to susceptibility to infections, in particular involving polymorphisms in innate immunity. Given the key role of innate immunity in IBD pathogenesis, whether such shared polymorphisms also influence risk of infections on anti-TNF therapy has not been examined previously. Thus, the development of tools to define likelihood of treatment response and infections are a key unmet need in the field. Our overarching objective is to identify clinical and genetic predictors of both short-term and long-term response as well as infectious complications of anti-TNF therapy. To achieve these aims, we will utilize the complementary strengths of two large cohorts - a prospective registry cohort of over 1200 patients with CD or UC, and a novel EMR-based cohort of over 11,000 patients with CD or UC linked to a biospecimen repository. This proposal utilizes the mentorship and significant expertise in key areas including analytical genetics, translational immunology, and bioinformatics and allows the candidate to develop fundamental skills in these novel content areas and research methods. The access to expertise at the NIH-funded center Informatics for Integrating Biology and the Bedside, the Center for Study of Inflammatory Bowel Disease, and the Broad Institute is a key strength of this application. This career development award will be critical in providing training in bioinformatics and genetic epidemiology, thus contributing to the candidate's long-term goal of establishing an independent IBD research career with focus on defining at-risk cohorts and personalizing therapy. The training component of the award includes graduate-level courses in the relevant content areas in genetic epidemiology, and bioinformatics at the Harvard Medical School, School of Public Health, and Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The candidate will continue to actively engage with an established group of multidisciplinary researchers who have demonstrated the utility of the EMR-based approach to accurately define autoimmune diseases, link it to biospecimen collection, and use it successfully for genotyping-phenotype research. This will help foster collaborative development of future proposals as the work proposed in this application has the potential for applicability in other cohorts.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The novel information gained from this study regarding genetic predictors of treatment response and infectious complications has the potential to transform clinical practice by leading to clinical trials focused on selected cohorts of patients most likely to respond to therapies with low risk of adverse events, thus preventing unnecessary exposure to potentially toxic therapies with low likelihood of benefit. Such work is a step toward developing personalized medicine approaches to tailor therapy based on likelihood of benefit and risk. The methodology developed here will also have applications in other EMR-based cohorts to investigate novel therapeutic agents and disease outcomes.                  ",Genetic predictors of anti-TNF treatment response and infections in IBD,8545840,K23DK097142,"['Address', 'Adverse event', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Anti-Tumor Necrosis Factor Therapy', 'Antibodies', 'Area', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Award', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biology', 'CD14 gene', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collection', 'Comorbidity', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Crohn&apos', 's disease', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Disease remission', 'Exposure to', 'Fostering', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Research', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Human Genetics', 'IL1R1 gene', 'Immune response', 'Immunology', 'Immunosuppressive Agents', 'Infection', 'Inflammatory Bowel Diseases', 'Informatics', 'Institutes', 'Institution', 'Interferons', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Massachusetts', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Monoclonal Antibodies', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Natural Immunity', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Pneumonia', 'Predisposition', 'Public Health Schools', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Sepsis', 'Source', 'Structure', 'TNF gene', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Training', 'Treatment outcome', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha', 'Ulcerative Colitis', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'adaptive immunity', 'base', 'career', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'cost', 'genetic epidemiology', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'immune function', 'medical schools', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'patient registry', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'repository', 'response', 'skills', 'tool development', 'treatment response']",NIDDK,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,K23,2013,168632,0.0056022998189181085
"Metabolomics-based discovery of small molecule biomarkers for noninvasive dengue     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Epidemic dengue fever (DF) and dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF/DSS) have emerged throughout the tropical world with devastating public health consequences. A dramatic increase in severe dengue disease (DEN) in Latin America in the last decade is of grave concern; 30% of cases are now diagnosed as severe dengue virus (DENV) infections. DEN is overwhelming public health capacity for clinical care in much of the developing world. The overall goal of this proposal is to provide a major change in the diagnosis and prognosis (D&P) of DENV infections. A metabolomics approach will be used to identify candidate metabolite small molecule biomarkers (SMBs) that occur both in serum and in non-invasive clinical specimens (urine and saliva) that diagnose DENV infection and predict progression to severe disease. Preliminary studies using acute phase specimens from DEN patients have identified a number of molecular features and candidate SMBs of DF and DHF/SS in serum, saliva, and urine using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS)-based metabolomics. In the R21 phase of this project, we will use a metabolic fingerprinting approach to confirm existing and identify new candidate SMBs in retrospectively collected serum specimens available from the high-quality pediatric DEN hospital-based and cohort studies in Nicaragua, will begin to characterize the SMBs and metabolic pathways involved, will investigate the efficacy for D&P of these SMBs in prospectively collected serum, saliva, and urine specimens in the hospital study, and will identify a portfolio of the most significant molecular features that differentiate DEN, severe DEN, and non-DEN disease. We will develop algorithms including SMBs, clinical signs and symptoms, and clinical laboratory results for the D&P of DENV infections. In the R33 phase of the project, prospectively collected serum, saliva, and urine samples from both the hospital study and a community-based cohort study will be analyzed by metabolic profiling using LC-tandem MS (LC-MS/MS) to identify candidate SMBs. First generation EIA tests for selected SMBs will be included in the diagnostic regimen in Nicaragua The diagnostic and prognostic sensitivity and specificity of the candidate SMBs and ""first generation"" SMB tests will be determined as will the preferred clinical specimen for SMB-based diagnoses. Overall these studies will identify a panel of SMBs (e.g. 5-10), which will be used to formulate the Target Product Profiles (TPP) for rapid point-of-care (POC) tests for use in clinics and hospitals for DEN D&P. Detection of SMBs in saliva and urine that are predictive of severe DEN is innovative and provides the opportunity for a true paradigm shift in diagnosis by using inexpensive, easily procured, non-invasive clinical specimens for D&P of DEN.          The studies will exploit liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry to identify small molecule biomarkers (SMBs) in serum, saliva, and urine of DEN patients for both prognosis and diagnosis of DEN infections. This will be of enormous value to physicians and public health workers in the developing world to identify patients at greatest risk for severe DEN for supportive care and early therapeutic intervention, and the use of non-invasive samples will provide a true paradigm shift in DEN diagnosis and patient care.

"Transcriptomics of Tuberculosis Latency and Reactivation in Primates DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Tuberculosis (TB), caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), is a global infectious disease emergency. A major hurdle in combating TB is the fact Mtb is able to persist for long periods of time in host tissues, in a quiescent state. These bacilli are able to reactivate and cause pulmonary TB, when the immune system is compromised. Hence, a complete understanding of TB latency and reactivation is required for the effective control of TB. The research models and tools necessary to perform these studies are now available. Nonhuman Primates (NHPs) are excellent models of TB, especially to study the progression of experimental infection to latency, and to study the pathology and biology of granulomatous lesions - the hallmarks of TB infections. We have established a model of human TB, by exposing NHPs to true Mtb aerosols. While many research groups focus on the bacterial factors of latency and reactivation, we would like to leverage our highly tractable model to identify host signatures and mediators of this process. We show that pro-inflammatory immune signaling pathways, initially induced in NHP TB lesions, are overwhelmingly silenced over the course of next several weeks. This transcriptional reprogramming could be a host response to changes in bacterial replication and physiology. Further, these responses could reflect the efforts of the pathogen to prevent excessive immunopathology during the infection of lungs. The central hypothesis of our proposal is that host granuloma responses can be used to predict latent and reactivation TB. We propose to perform a systematic study of the ""transcriptome"" and the ""miRNAome"" of NHP lung lesions. Temporal profiles will be obtained from NHPs infected with a low-dose of Mtb aerosols, accurately modeling long-term latent infection. Profiles will also be obtained from NHPs in which latent TB is reactivated by simian AIDS. These system-wide profiles, in conjugation with the clinical, microbiological and immunological data obtained from infected NHPs will generate statistical learning algorithms and mixed effects computational models of latent and reactivation TB. The relevance of some of the most informative set of genetic predictors available from the data collected will be tested back in both the NHP model, as well as in human patients. The expression profiles of CCL24, CCL25 and CCL27 show negative correlation with all other chemokine ligands and receptors in primate TB granulomas. The expression of these three chemokines is significantly increased in late, rather than early lesions. We hypothesize that these chemokines are important for the long-term maintenance of primate lesions harboring latent Mtb bacilli. The expression of LAG3 was induced more than 40-fold in early primate lesions relative to late ones. LAG3 is a novel marker of Treg cells. We hypothesize that LAG3 is responsible for negatively regulating protective immune responses generated by effector T cells in primate TB lesions. The expression of ""latency"" specific genes CCL24/25/27 and the ""active-TB: specific gene LAG3 will be silenced in NHPs using a novel lipidated-siRNA nanoparticle based approach. The progression of latent disease and its immunological and molecular correlates will then be studied in these animals. Finally, the expression of an immune response to these and other ""latency"" and ""reactivation""- specific profiles will be determined in human patients of latent and active TB, as well as TB/AIDS co- infected patients. These systems-biology studies will likely exponentially enhance our understanding of TB latency and reactivation in a host that mimics both TB and AIDS in the closest possible manner to humans. Eventually, these advances may empower clinicians better to detect and treat latent TB. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Tuberculosis (TB), caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), is a global infectious disease emergency. A major hurdle in combating TB is the fact Mtb is able to persist for long periods of time in host tissues, reactivating when the immune system is compromised. Hence, effective and long-term control of TB requires a better understanding of TB latency and reactivation. Nonhuman Primates (NHPs) are excellent models of TB. We have recently established a model of human TB, by exposing NHPs to Mtb aerosols. Pro-inflammatory immune signaling pathways are initially induced in NHP TB lesions, but silence over the course of several weeks. This could be a response to the progression of Mtb to a latent phase of growth within these NHP granulomas. We will employ a systems biology approach to study the host granulomatous response to Mtb latency and reactivation, using our NHP model. Towards this, we have assembled a highly diverse and collaborative team including microbiologists, aerobiologists, bioinformaticians, mathematicians/statisticians, veterinarians, veterinary pathologists, as well as infectious disease and critical respiratory care clinicians/clinician-researchers.",Transcriptomics of Tuberculosis Latency and Reactivation in Primates,8528702,R01HL106790,"['Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome', 'Aerosols', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Automobile Driving', 'Bacillus (bacterium)', 'Back', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Biopsy', 'CCL24 gene', 'CCL25 gene', 'CCL27 gene', 'Caring', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Emergency Situation', 'Equilibrium', 'Excision', 'Exhibits', 'Focus Groups', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Gene Silencing', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Models', 'Granuloma', 'Granulomatous', 'Growth', 'HIV', 'Health', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immune system', 'Immunology', 'Infection', 'Inflammatory', 'Lesion', 'Life', 'Ligands', 'Lung', 'Macaca mulatta', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Metadata', 'Methodology', 'MicroRNAs', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Mycobacterium tuberculosis', 'Organogenesis', 'Pathologist', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Physiology', 'Primates', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Pulmonary Tuberculosis', 'RNA Interference', 'Regulatory T-Lymphocyte', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'SIV', 'Sampling', 'Signal Pathway', 'Simian Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome', 'Small Interfering RNA', 'Statistical Models', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Transcript', 'Tuberculosis', 'Vaccines', 'Veterinarians', 'base', 'chemokine', 'combat', 'empowered', 'genome-wide', 'immunopathology', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'latent infection', 'nanoparticle', 'nonhuman primate', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'pathogen', 'prevent', 'pulmonary granuloma', 'reactivation from latency', 'receptor', 'respiratory', 'response', 'tool', 'transcriptomics', 'tuberculosis granuloma']",NHLBI,TULANE UNIVERSITY OF LOUISIANA,R01,2013,696467,0.05915649142343967
"MACHINE LEARNING TO FORECAST ZOONOTIC DISEASE EMERGENCE    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): As over 70% of emerging infectious diseases are caused by parasites or pathogens transmitted from animals to humans (leading to 'zoonotic' infections), a fundamental issues for public health is identifying the drivers leading to zoonotic diseases in humans. Cross-species transmission of infectious agents depends on numerous traits of hosts, their infectious agents, and environmental factors defining the external context of disease. Previous studies identifying predictors of cross-species transmission have been limited by a focus on single infectious diseases (e.g., rabies, Lyme disease) at restricted spatial scales, in part because large-scale analyses spanning numerous host species and infectious agents are precluded by the many complex interactions, autocorrelations, and sampling biases common in multivariate, high-dimensional data. The proposed research confronts these computational limitations through the innovative application of machine learning algorithms. Specifically, analyses will address three outstanding and interrelated questions in global health: (1) What characteristics signal a predisposition of mammalian host species to be reservoirs of zoonotic disease?; (2) What traits among infectious agents predict their potential to cause zoonotic infection?; (3) What are the most important environmental and anthropogenic predictors of zoonotic outbreaks globally? Analyses will apply a series of supervised, unsupervised and semi-supervised machine learning algorithms to new, global-scale databases containing biological, ecological, environmental, and anthropogenic data for three groups of mammalian hosts (primates, carnivores, and ungulates) and their zoonotic infectious agents. A long-term goal of this research is to empirically develop ""rules of thumb"" about zoonotic diseases by highlighting the key traits of mammalian hosts, infectious agents, and the environmental and human factors describing zoonotic outbreaks in recent history. Ultimately, research proposed herein will provide a basis for predicting the geographic locations, infectious agents, and animal reservoirs from which future zoonoses will emerge.        This project proposes to investigate the factors driving zoonotic disease outbreaks and cross-species transmission from wild mammals into humans through the innovative application of machine learning algorithms to newly published data describing hundreds of infectious agents, their mammalian host species, human populations, and the global environment. Ultimately, this project aims to predict the locations and species from which future diseases will emerge, and is therefore directly relevant for the improvement of human health.

"Breath Volatile Metabolites for the Diagnosis of Emerging Invasive Mold Infection     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This resubmission K23 proposal outlines a five-year development plan for Sophia Koo to achieve independence as a patient-oriented clinician-scientist with particular expertise in the development and assessment of novel diagnostic modalities for invasive mold infections (IMI). The strategy outlined in this proposal will enable Dr. Koo to build upon her clinical background in caring for patients at risk for IMI and her clinicl research defining the limitations of currently available diagnostic modalities for these infections by taking advantage of the unique clinical and research strengths of Brigham and Women's Hospital and the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, biomedical engineering and bioinformatics capabilities of the Charles Stark Draper Laboratory, and epidemiology, biostatistics, and analytical chemistry training opportunities at the Harvard School of Public Health, Northeastern University, and Massachusetts Institute of Technology. She will be co-mentored by Dr. Lindsey Baden, Associate Professor of Medicine at Harvard Medical School, and Dr. Earl Francis Cook, Professor of Epidemiology at the Harvard School of Public Health. Dr. Baden is an expert in fungal diagnostics, and Dr. Cook is an expert in study design and statistical learning/data mining, including analysis of highly dimensional biomarker data. Dr. Koo will also work closely with Drs. Daniel Kuritzkes, Raphael Dolin, Francisco Marty, John Perfect, and John Wingard, who will provide career guidance and scientific advice on the execution of the proposed research plan, and her collaborators Drs. Paul Vouros, Terence Risby, and James Comolli, who will contribute their expertise in analytical chemistry and breath analysis to her research plan. The research program will employ analytical chemistry and statistical supervised learning approaches to define volatile organic compound (VOC) metabolite patterns of emerging invasive mold species in vitro and in patient breath to lay the groundwork for a noninvasive, point-of-care breath test for patients with emerging IMI. Specifically, this program proposes (1) a detailed definition of the VOC metabolome of the Mucorales, Fusarium, and Scedosporium species that most commonly cause human IMI, and (2) the prospective collection of VOC metabolites in the breath of patients with emerging IMI, patients with clinical and radiographic findings suggestive of an emerging IMI, and patients with respiratory tract colonization by these molds, with derivation and validation of VOC feature support vector machine classification algorithms to discriminate patients with emerging IMI from patients with other fungal infections or non-fungal pulmonary processes. Current diagnostic modalities for these infections are inadequate and often unacceptably morbid, and development of this novel, noninvasive diagnostic approach should allow earlier diagnosis of these infections than currently possible, prospective surveillance in the growing population of patients at risk for emerging IMI, more rational targeting of antifungal therapy, and improved clinical outcomes. Project Narrative Invasive mold infections are highly morbid and often fatal in the growing population of patients with compromised immune systems. The proposed research seeks to overcome the significant limitations of currently available diagnostic methods for these infections by developing a novel, noninvasive test that identifies unique volatile compounds in the breath of patients with these infections. Development of this sensitive fungal breath test will allow better surveillance and targeting of antifungal therapy in patients at risk for these infections and ultimately, improved patient outcomes.              Invasive mold infections are highly morbid and often fatal in the growing population of patients with compromised immune systems.

Over the past 15 years, considerable progress has been made in the therapy of CD and UC with monoclonal antibodies against tumor necrosis factor ¿ (anti-TNF) representing the most significant therapeutic breakthrough. However, many patients fail to respond adequately. Recent genome wide associations studies (GWAS) have significantly increased our understanding of the pathogenesis of CD and UC. The role of these genetic variants in predicting response to anti-TNF therapy is yet to be defined adequately. In addition, significant safety concerns remain with the use of these agents with serious infections occurring in up to 10% of patients. There is a strong genetic component to susceptibility to infections, in particular involving polymorphisms in innate immunity. Given the key role of innate immunity in IBD pathogenesis, whether such shared polymorphisms also influence risk of infections on anti-TNF therapy has not been examined previously. Thus, the development of tools to define likelihood of treatment response and infections are a key unmet need in the field. Our overarching objective is to identify clinical and genetic predictors of both short-term and long-term response as well as infectious complications of anti-TNF therapy. To achieve these aims, we will utilize the complementary strengths of two large cohorts - a prospective registry cohort of over 1200 patients with CD or UC, and a novel EMR-based cohort of over 11,000 patients with CD or UC linked to a biospecimen repository. This proposal utilizes the mentorship and significant expertise in key areas including analytical genetics, translational immunology, and bioinformatics and allows the candidate to develop fundamental skills in these novel content areas and research methods. The access to expertise at the NIH-funded center Informatics for Integrating Biology and the Bedside, the Center for Study of Inflammatory Bowel Disease, and the Broad Institute is a key strength of this application. This career development award will be critical in providing training in bioinformatics and genetic epidemiology, thus contributing to the candidate's long-term goal of establishing an independent IBD research career with focus on defining at-risk cohorts and personalizing therapy. The training component of the award includes graduate-level courses in the relevant content areas in genetic epidemiology, and bioinformatics at the Harvard Medical School, School of Public Health, and Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The candidate will continue to actively engage with an established group of multidisciplinary researchers who have demonstrated the utility of the EMR-based approach to accurately define autoimmune diseases, link it to biospecimen collection, and use it successfully for genotyping-phenotype research. This will help foster collaborative development of future proposals as the work proposed in this application has the potential for applicability in other cohorts.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The novel information gained from this study regarding genetic predictors of treatment response and infectious complications has the potential to transform clinical practice by leading to clinical trials focused on selected cohorts of patients most likely to respond to therapies with low risk of adverse events, thus preventing unnecessary exposure to potentially toxic therapies with low likelihood of benefit. Such work is a step toward developing personalized medicine approaches to tailor therapy based on likelihood of benefit and risk. The methodology developed here will also have applications in other EMR-based cohorts to investigate novel therapeutic agents and disease outcomes.                    The novel information gained from this study regarding genetic predictors of treatment response and infectious complications has the potential to transform clinical practice by leading to clinical trials focused on selected cohorts of patients most likely to respond to therapies with low risk of adverse events, thus preventing unnecessary exposure to potentially toxic therapies with low likelihood of benefit.

"Ontology-based Information Network to Support Vaccine Research  Project Summary (Abstract):  Since the introduction of Edward Jenner's smallpox vaccine in 1796, vaccines have proven invaluable for their ability to stimulate the immune system and to confer protection against pathogenic organisms. Progress in modern vaccine research has been accompanied by a dramatic increase in the number of vaccine-related papers in the published literature. It has become increasingly challenging to identify and annotate vaccine data from this large and diverse literature which no one scientist or team can fully master. Although vaccine databases exist that emphasize commercialized vaccines, no public central repository is available to store research data concerning commercial vaccines, vaccines in clinical trials, or vaccine candidates in early stages of development, in a fashion that render such data available for advanced analyses. To fill this need, we have developed VIOLIN (http://www.violinet.org), a web-based database system for annotation, storage, and analysis of published vaccine data. An ontology represents consensus-based controlled vocabularies of terms and relations, with associated definitions which are logically formulated in such a way as to promote automated reasoning. A bottleneck of vaccine research and further VIOLIN development is the lack of a vaccine ontology, which in turn makes a significant obstacle for vaccine data standardization, retrieval, integration, and advanced analysis and prediction. Our goal is to develop the community-based Vaccine Ontology (VO) and apply it to efficient vaccine literature mining and analysis of protective immune mechanisms. We will focus on two model pathogens: Escherichia coli and Brucella species. This project contains three specific aims: (1) develop a community-based Vaccine Ontology (VO), and apply it to establish a vaccine knowledgebase and to promote vaccine data integration and query through Semantic Web. The VO development will be achieved through collaboration with vaccine researchers, the Infectious Disease Ontology (IDO) Initiative, and the National Center for Biomedical Ontology (NCBO); (2) develop a VO-based natural language processing (NLP) system and apply it for more efficient retrieval of Brucella and E. coli vaccine information, automated annotation of journal articles with VO terms, and VO improvement. This task will be achieved by collaboration with the National Center for Integrative Biomedical Informatics (NCIBI). (3) analyze and predict vaccine targets and protective immune networks attributable to the interactions between host and vaccine. This will be achieved mainly by VO-based literature mining and a novel genome- and literature-based statistical methodology. This project will be implemented by a strong collaborative team and supported from a large user community. The Vaccine Ontology and its applications to literature mining and for studying protective immunity against Brucella spp. and E. coli will lay a strong foundation for further advanced informatics research on vaccines against infectious diseases in the post-genomics and information era.  Narrative: Vaccines stimulate the immune system and confer protection against pathogenic microorganisms. A bottleneck of vaccine research is the lack of an ontology (consensus- based controlled vocabularies of terms and relations) to ensure consistency of literature curation and support automated reasoning.

"Mathematical Techniques for Control of Epidemic Trypanosoma cruzi Transmission    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Chagas disease, caused by the unicellular parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, is a preventable disease. Nevertheless more people in the Americas die from Chagas disease than any other parasitic infection. This application will provide tutorial-based training to the applicant in mathematical modeling and modern computer science at the University of Pennsylvania and the Bloomberg School of Public Health of Johns Hopkins University. Training will be geared towards developing the skills necessary to address complex problems hindering the control of Chagas disease. The long term goal of the research is to integrate diagnostic testing of children at high risk of T. cruzi infection into control programs focused mainly on vector elimination, and to better guide vector elimination campaigns. In addition to tutorial-based training in the United States, entomologic and clinical research will be conducted in Peru in coordination with a research grant awarded by   the Fogarty International Center to Dr. Cesar Naquira and collaborators. In Arequipa, a city of nearly one million inhabitants in southern Peru, T. cruzi and Chagas disease have become urban problems. A quiet epidemic of Chagas disease infection is progressing across the city. The specific aims of this application are: 1) To develop techniques to understand and control T. cruzi transmission in epidemic situations, and, 2. To optimize the spatio-temporal ordering of the Chagas disease vector control   campaign in Arequipa, and to elucidate best-practice strategies for vector control elsewhere. In developing these mathematical techniques the candidate will receive quantitative training that will complement his previous work on infectious disease and allow him to develop into a well-rounded independent investigator. RELEVANCE: Integrating diagnosis of children for T cruzi infection into Chagas control campaigns has the potential to greatly reduce morbidity and mortality due to Chagas disease in Peru and elsewhere. Optimizing the spatio-temporal order of vector control campaigns can increase the probability that these eliminate future transmission of T cruzi.          n/a",Mathematical Techniques for Control of Epidemic Trypanosoma cruzi Transmission,8279285,K01AI079162,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Americas', 'Area', 'Award', 'Brazil', 'Capital', 'Chagas Disease', 'Child', 'Chile', 'Cities', 'Clinical Research', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Disease Vectors', 'Ecology', 'Empirical Research', 'Epidemic', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Housing', 'Infection', 'Infection Control', 'Insect Vectors', 'Insecticides', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Mentors', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Parasites', 'Parasitic infection', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pennsylvania', 'Peru', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Principal Investigator', 'Probability', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Public Health Schools', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Residual state', 'Retinal Cone', 'Running', 'Rural', 'Solutions', 'South America', 'Techniques', 'Training', 'Triatoma', 'Tropical Medicine', 'Trypanosoma cruzi', 'Tuberculosis', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Work', 'base', 'chemotherapy', 'computer science', 'disease transmission', 'disorder control', 'high risk', 'international center', 'killings', 'mathematical model', 'mortality', 'novel', 'programs', 'pyrethroid', 'rural area', 'skills', 'success', 'theories', 'transmission process', 'urban area', 'vector', 'vector control']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,K01,2012,105194,0.01445589553419772
"Metabolomics-based discovery of small molecule biomarkers for noninvasive dengue     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Epidemic dengue fever (DF) and dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF/DSS) have emerged throughout the tropical world with devastating public health consequences. A dramatic increase in severe dengue disease (DEN) in Latin America in the last decade is of grave concern; 30% of cases are now diagnosed as severe dengue virus (DENV) infections. DEN is overwhelming public health capacity for clinical care in much of the developing world. The overall goal of this proposal is to provide a major change in the diagnosis and prognosis (D&P) of DENV infections. A metabolomics approach will be used to identify candidate metabolite small molecule biomarkers (SMBs) that occur both in serum and in non-invasive clinical specimens (urine and saliva) that diagnose DENV infection and predict progression to severe disease. Preliminary studies using acute phase specimens from DEN patients have identified a number of molecular features and candidate SMBs of DF and DHF/SS in serum, saliva, and urine using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS)-based metabolomics. In the R21 phase of this project, we will use a metabolic fingerprinting approach to confirm existing and identify new candidate SMBs in retrospectively collected serum specimens available from the high-quality pediatric DEN hospital-based and cohort studies in Nicaragua, will begin to characterize the SMBs and metabolic pathways involved, will investigate the efficacy for D&P of these SMBs in prospectively collected serum, saliva, and urine specimens in the hospital study, and will identify a portfolio of the most significant molecular features that differentiate DEN, severe DEN, and non-DEN disease. We will develop algorithms including SMBs, clinical signs and symptoms, and clinical laboratory results for the D&P of DENV infections. In the R33 phase of the project, prospectively collected serum, saliva, and urine samples from both the hospital study and a community-based cohort study will be analyzed by metabolic profiling using LC-tandem MS (LC-MS/MS) to identify candidate SMBs. First generation EIA tests for selected SMBs will be included in the diagnostic regimen in Nicaragua The diagnostic and prognostic sensitivity and specificity of the candidate SMBs and ""first generation"" SMB tests will be determined as will the preferred clinical specimen for SMB-based diagnoses. Overall these studies will identify a panel of SMBs (e.g. 5-10), which will be used to formulate the Target Product Profiles (TPP) for rapid point-of-care (POC) tests for use in clinics and hospitals for DEN D&P. Detection of SMBs in saliva and urine that are predictive of severe DEN is innovative and provides the opportunity for a true paradigm shift in diagnosis by using inexpensive, easily procured, non-invasive clinical specimens for D&P of DEN.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The studies will exploit liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry to identify small molecule biomarkers (SMBs) in serum, saliva, and urine of DEN patients for both prognosis and diagnosis of DEN infections. This will be of enormous value to physicians and public health workers in the developing world to identify patients at greatest risk for severe DEN for supportive care and early therapeutic intervention, and the use of non-invasive samples will provide a true paradigm shift in DEN diagnosis and patient care.               The studies will exploit liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry to identify small molecule biomarkers (SMBs) in serum, saliva, and urine of DEN patients for both prognosis and diagnosis of DEN infections.

"Transcriptomics of Tuberculosis Latency and Reactivation in Primates DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Tuberculosis (TB), caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), is a global infectious disease emergency. A major hurdle in combating TB is the fact Mtb is able to persist for long periods of time in host tissues, in a quiescent state. These bacilli are able to reactivate and cause pulmonary TB, when the immune system is compromised. Hence, a complete understanding of TB latency and reactivation is required for the effective control of TB. The research models and tools necessary to perform these studies are now available. Nonhuman Primates (NHPs) are excellent models of TB, especially to study the progression of experimental infection to latency, and to study the pathology and biology of granulomatous lesions - the hallmarks of TB infections. We have established a model of human TB, by exposing NHPs to true Mtb aerosols. While many research groups focus on the bacterial factors of latency and reactivation, we would like to leverage our highly tractable model to identify host signatures and mediators of this process. We show that pro-inflammatory immune signaling pathways, initially induced in NHP TB lesions, are overwhelmingly silenced over the course of next several weeks. This transcriptional reprogramming could be a host response to changes in bacterial replication and physiology. Further, these responses could reflect the efforts of the pathogen to prevent excessive immunopathology during the infection of lungs. The central hypothesis of our proposal is that host granuloma responses can be used to predict latent and reactivation TB. We propose to perform a systematic study of the ""transcriptome"" and the ""miRNAome"" of NHP lung lesions. Temporal profiles will be obtained from NHPs infected with a low-dose of Mtb aerosols, accurately modeling long-term latent infection. Profiles will also be obtained from NHPs in which latent TB is reactivated by simian AIDS. These system-wide profiles, in conjugation with the clinical, microbiological and immunological data obtained from infected NHPs will generate statistical learning algorithms and mixed effects computational models of latent and reactivation TB. The relevance of some of the most informative set of genetic predictors available from the data collected will be tested back in both the NHP model, as well as in human patients. The expression profiles of CCL24, CCL25 and CCL27 show negative correlation with all other chemokine ligands and receptors in primate TB granulomas. The expression of these three chemokines is significantly increased in late, rather than early lesions. We hypothesize that these chemokines are important for the long-term maintenance of primate lesions harboring latent Mtb bacilli. The expression of LAG3 was induced more than 40-fold in early primate lesions relative to late ones. LAG3 is a novel marker of Treg cells. We hypothesize that LAG3 is responsible for negatively regulating protective immune responses generated by effector T cells in primate TB lesions. The expression of ""latency"" specific genes CCL24/25/27 and the ""active-TB: specific gene LAG3 will be silenced in NHPs using a novel lipidated-siRNA nanoparticle based approach. The progression of latent disease and its immunological and molecular correlates will then be studied in these animals. Finally, the expression of an immune response to these and other ""latency"" and ""reactivation""- specific profiles will be determined in human patients of latent and active TB, as well as TB/AIDS co- infected patients. These systems-biology studies will likely exponentially enhance our understanding of TB latency and reactivation in a host that mimics both TB and AIDS in the closest possible manner to humans. Eventually, these advances may empower clinicians better to detect and treat latent TB.

"MACHINE LEARNING TO FORECAST ZOONOTIC DISEASE EMERGENCE    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): As over 70% of emerging infectious diseases are caused by parasites or pathogens transmitted from animals to humans (leading to 'zoonotic' infections), a fundamental issues for public health is identifying the drivers leading to zoonotic diseases in humans. Cross-species transmission of infectious agents depends on numerous traits of hosts, their infectious agents, and environmental factors defining the external context of disease. Previous studies identifying predictors of cross-species transmission have been limited by a focus on single infectious diseases (e.g., rabies, Lyme disease) at restricted spatial scales, in part because large-scale analyses spanning numerous host species and infectious agents are precluded by the many complex interactions, autocorrelations, and sampling biases common in multivariate, high-dimensional data. The proposed research confronts these computational limitations through the innovative application of machine learning algorithms. Specifically, analyses will address three outstanding and interrelated questions in global health: (1) What characteristics signal a predisposition of mammalian host species to be reservoirs of zoonotic disease?; (2) What traits among infectious agents predict their potential to cause zoonotic infection?; (3) What are the most important environmental and anthropogenic predictors of zoonotic outbreaks globally? Analyses will apply a series of supervised, unsupervised and semi-supervised machine learning algorithms to new, global-scale databases containing biological, ecological, environmental, and anthropogenic data for three groups of mammalian hosts (primates, carnivores, and ungulates) and their zoonotic infectious agents. A long-term goal of this research is to empirically develop ""rules of thumb"" about zoonotic diseases by highlighting the key traits of mammalian hosts, infectious agents, and the environmental and human factors describing zoonotic outbreaks in recent history. Ultimately, research proposed herein will provide a basis for predicting the geographic locations, infectious agents, and animal reservoirs from which future zoonoses will emerge.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project proposes to investigate the factors driving zoonotic disease outbreaks and cross-species transmission from wild mammals into humans through the innovative application of machine learning algorithms to newly published data describing hundreds of infectious agents, their mammalian host species, human populations, and the global environment. Ultimately, this project aims to predict the locations and species from which future diseases will emerge, and is therefore directly relevant for the improvement of human health.           This project proposes to investigate the factors driving zoonotic disease outbreaks and cross-species transmission from wild mammals into humans through the innovative application of machine learning algorithms to newly published data describing hundreds of infectious agents, their mammalian host species, human populations, and the global environment.

"Bacterial colonization, inflammation and its role in carcinogenesis    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): It is estimated that over 20% of fatal cancers or about 2.1 million cases per year worldwide can be attributed to viral or bacterial infections, suggesting the tremendous potential of controlling microbe-related processes for cancer prevention. Although viral infections have been associated with cancer, the involvement of bacteria has also recently received attention, and there is increasing evidence to suggest that studies on the role of bacteria in cancer progressions are warranted. Important mechanisms by which bacterial agents may promote carcinogenesis include chronic infection, inflammation, immune evasion and immune suppression. Our overall hypothesis is that the bacterial colonization is associated with chronic inflammation which has the capacity to support oral squamous cell carcinomas (OSCC) progression. The oral cavity and OSCC represent a unique opportunity to study the bacterial association with cancer because: (1) the microbiota of the oral cavity is well documented; and (2) the ease of sample collection. In Aim 1, we hypothesize that the bacterial colonization is altered in OSCC and dysplasia as compared to adjacent normal mucosa. We will determine the difference between the bacterial colonization (cultivable and non-cultivable) in OSCC, epithelial dysplasia, vs. adjacent normal mucosa. Using 400 bp fragments of the 16S rDNA gene and high throughput 454 pyrosequencing we will determine the relative abundance and species richness of the bacterial population in these sample groups. Artificial Intelligence analysis will be used to discover a pattern of bacterial phylotypes that are represented in OSCC, epithelial dysplasia, and normal mucosa. In Aim 2, we hypothesize that the colonization of dysplastic lesions and OSCC by bacterial pathogens is associated with chronic inflammation. We will use immunohistochemistry to compare the composition and quantity of the inflammatory cell infiltrate and evaluate the cytokine profile in the same tissue samples of OSCC, dysplasia, and normal mucosa used in Aim 1. The differences in bacterial profile between OSCC tissue and normal mucosa and the similarities in bacterial profile for OSCC and dysplasia will be used to develop a bacterial profile of OSCC which in association with inflammatory factors will serve as an indicator of risk for OSCC.

"Discovering hidden groups across tuberculosis patient and pathogen genotype data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       The principal objective of this project is to develop methods that combine pathogen genotyping and patient epidemiology data that can be used in the control, understanding, and tracking of infectious diseases. This work focuses on the modeling of large international collections of patient epidemiology and strain data for the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTC), the causative agent of tuberculosis disease (TB), because of the urgent global need and the unique data availability due to the National TB genotyping program. Specifically, the project addresses the following problem: given MTC DNA fingerprinting and TB patient data being accumulated nationally and internationally, identify hidden groups capturing MTC genetic families and TB epidemiology using machine learning, and use these hidden groups to address problems in the control, understanding, prevention, and treatment of tuberculosis at city, state, national, and international levels. To address this objective, we identify several aims. The first aim is to gather and merge large databases of MTC patient-isolate genotypes as well as associated patient information from the New York City, New York State, United States, and the rest of the world. The second aim is to identify MTC strain families based on multiple genotype methods using graphical models constrained to reflect background knowledge. The third aim is to identify hidden host-pathogen groups within TB patient demographics and MTC genotypes using a combination of probabilistic graphical models and deterministic multi-way tensor analysis methods designed to capture the temporal dynamics of TB. The fourth aim answers public health questions posed by TB experts by transforming the questions into quantifiable metrics applied to the hidden groups. The hidden group models and metrics will be embedded in analysis methods, and then evaluated by TB experts. The proposed models and analysis methods will capture and share knowledge embedded in large TB patient and MTC genotyping databases without necessarily sharing the actual data.          n/a",Discovering hidden groups across tuberculosis patient and pathogen genotype data,8055907,R01LM009731,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Cities', 'Collection', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Complex', 'DNA Fingerprinting', 'DNA Insertion Elements', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Epidemiology', 'Exercise', 'Family', 'Fingerprint', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Guadeloupe', 'Healthcare', 'International', 'Investigation', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Metric', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Epidemiology', 'Mycobacterium tuberculosis', 'Nature', 'New York', 'New York City', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Research Institute', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Social Network', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Trees', 'Tuberculosis', 'United States', 'Visual', 'Work', 'base', 'demographics', 'design', 'disorder control', 'disorder prevention', 'family genetics', 'fight against', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic variant', 'global health', 'improved', 'mycobacterial', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'patient privacy', 'programs', 'prototype', 'public health research', 'relational database', 'success', 'theories', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'trend', 'tuberculosis treatment']",NLM,RENSSELAER POLYTECHNIC INSTITUTE,R01,2011,325956,0.04804501107576973
"Ontology-based Information Network to Support Vaccine Research    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Since the introduction of Edward Jenner's smallpox vaccine in 1796, vaccines have proven invaluable for their ability to stimulate the immune system and to confer protection against pathogenic organisms. Progress in modern vaccine research has been accompanied by a dramatic increase in the number of vaccine-related papers in the published literature. It has become increasingly challenging to identify and annotate vaccine data from this large and diverse literature which no one scientist or team can fully master. Although vaccine databases exist that emphasize commercialized vaccines, no public central repository is available to store research data concerning commercial vaccines, vaccines in clinical trials, or vaccine candidates in early stages of development, in a fashion that render such data available for advanced analyses. To fill this need, we have developed VIOLIN (http://www.violinet.org), a web-based database system for annotation, storage, and analysis of published vaccine data. An ontology represents consensus-based controlled vocabularies of terms and relations, with associated definitions which are logically formulated in such a way as to promote automated reasoning. A bottleneck of vaccine research and further VIOLIN development is the lack of a vaccine ontology, which in turn makes a significant obstacle for vaccine data standardization, retrieval, integration, and advanced analysis and prediction. Our goal is to develop the community-based Vaccine Ontology (VO) and apply it to efficient vaccine literature mining and analysis of protective immune mechanisms. We will focus on two model pathogens: Escherichia coli and Brucella species. This project contains three specific aims: (1) develop a community-based Vaccine Ontology (VO), and apply it to establish a vaccine knowledgebase and to promote vaccine data integration and query through Semantic Web. The VO development will be achieved through collaboration with vaccine researchers, the Infectious Disease Ontology (IDO) Initiative, and the National Center for Biomedical Ontology (NCBO); (2) develop a VO-based natural language processing (NLP) system and apply it for more efficient retrieval of Brucella and E. coli vaccine information, automated annotation of journal articles with VO terms, and VO improvement. This task will be achieved by collaboration with the National Center for Integrative Biomedical Informatics (NCIBI). (3) analyze and predict vaccine targets and protective immune networks attributable to the interactions between host and vaccine. This will be achieved mainly by VO-based literature mining and a novel genome- and literature-based statistical methodology. This project will be implemented by a strong collaborative team and supported from a large user community. The Vaccine Ontology and its applications to literature mining and for studying protective immunity against Brucella spp. and E. coli will lay a strong foundation for further advanced informatics research on vaccines against infectious diseases in the post-genomics and information era.            Narrative: Vaccines stimulate the immune system and confer protection against pathogenic microorganisms. A bottleneck of vaccine research is the lack of an ontology (consensus- based controlled vocabularies of terms and relations) to ensure consistency of literature curation and support automated reasoning.

"Mathematical Techniques for Control of Epidemic Trypanosoma cruzi Transmission    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Chagas disease, caused by the unicellular parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, is a preventable disease. Nevertheless more people in the Americas die from Chagas disease than any other parasitic infection. This application will provide tutorial-based training to the applicant in mathematical modeling and modern computer science at the University of Pennsylvania and the Bloomberg School of Public Health of Johns Hopkins University. Training will be geared towards developing the skills necessary to address complex problems hindering the control of Chagas disease. The long term goal of the research is to integrate diagnostic testing of children at high risk of T. cruzi infection into control programs focused mainly on vector elimination, and to better guide vector elimination campaigns. In addition to tutorial-based training in the United States, entomologic and clinical research will be conducted in Peru in coordination with a research grant awarded by   the Fogarty International Center to Dr. Cesar Naquira and collaborators. In Arequipa, a city of nearly one million inhabitants in southern Peru, T. cruzi and Chagas disease have become urban problems. A quiet epidemic of Chagas disease infection is progressing across the city. The specific aims of this application are: 1) To develop techniques to understand and control T. cruzi transmission in epidemic situations, and, 2. To optimize the spatio-temporal ordering of the Chagas disease vector control   campaign in Arequipa, and to elucidate best-practice strategies for vector control elsewhere. In developing these mathematical techniques the candidate will receive quantitative training that will complement his previous work on infectious disease and allow him to develop into a well-rounded independent investigator. RELEVANCE: Integrating diagnosis of children for T cruzi infection into Chagas control campaigns has the potential to greatly reduce morbidity and mortality due to Chagas disease in Peru and elsewhere. Optimizing the spatio-temporal order of vector control campaigns can increase the probability that these eliminate future transmission of T cruzi.          n/a",Mathematical Techniques for Control of Epidemic Trypanosoma cruzi Transmission,8077374,K01AI079162,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Americas', 'Area', 'Award', 'Brazil', 'Capital', 'Chagas Disease', 'Child', 'Chile', 'Cities', 'Clinical Research', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Disease Vectors', 'Ecology', 'Empirical Research', 'Epidemic', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Housing', 'Infection', 'Infection Control', 'Insect Vectors', 'Insecticides', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Mentors', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Parasites', 'Parasitic infection', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pennsylvania', 'Peru', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Principal Investigator', 'Probability', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Public Health Schools', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Residual state', 'Retinal Cone', 'Running', 'Rural', 'Solutions', 'South America', 'Techniques', 'Training', 'Triatoma', 'Tropical Medicine', 'Trypanosoma cruzi', 'Tuberculosis', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Work', 'base', 'chemotherapy', 'computer science', 'disease transmission', 'disorder control', 'high risk', 'international center', 'killings', 'mathematical model', 'mortality', 'novel', 'programs', 'pyrethroid', 'rural area', 'skills', 'success', 'theories', 'transmission process', 'urban area', 'vector', 'vector control']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,K01,2011,105194,0.01445589553419772
"Transcriptomics of Tuberculosis Latency and Reactivation in Primates    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Tuberculosis (TB), caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), is a global infectious disease emergency. A major hurdle in combating TB is the fact Mtb is able to persist for long periods of time in host tissues, in a quiescent state. These bacilli are able to reactivate and cause pulmonary TB, when the immune system is compromised. Hence, a complete understanding of TB latency and reactivation is required for the effective control of TB. The research models and tools necessary to perform these studies are now available.   Nonhuman Primates (NHPs) are excellent models of TB, especially to study the progression of experimental infection to latency, and to study the pathology and biology of granulomatous lesions - the hallmarks of TB infections. We have established a model of human TB, by exposing NHPs to true Mtb aerosols. While many research groups focus on the bacterial factors of latency and reactivation, we would like to leverage our highly tractable model to identify host signatures and mediators of this process.    We  show  that  pro-inflammatory  immune  signaling  pathways,  initially  induced  in  NHP  TB  lesions,  are  overwhelmingly  silenced  over  the  course  of  next  several  weeks.  This transcriptional reprogramming could be a host response to changes in bacterial replication and physiology. Further, these  responses  could  reflect  the  efforts  of  the  pathogen  to  prevent  excessive  immunopathology  during  the  infection of lungs. The central hypothesis of our proposal is that host granuloma responses can be used to predict latent and reactivation TB. We propose to perform a systematic study of the ""transcriptome"" and the ""miRNAome"" of NHP lung lesions. Temporal profiles will be obtained from NHPs infected with a low-dose of Mtb aerosols, accurately modeling long-term latent infection.  Profiles will also be obtained from NHPs in which latent TB is reactivated by simian AIDS. These system-wide profiles, in conjugation  with  the  clinical,  microbiological  and  immunological  data  obtained  from  infected  NHPs  will  generate  statistical learning algorithms and mixed effects computational models of latent and reactivation TB.    The relevance of some of the most informative set of genetic predictors available from the data collected will be tested back in both the NHP model, as well as in human patients. The expression profiles of CCL24, CCL25 and CCL27 show negative correlation with all other chemokine ligands and receptors in primate TB granulomas. The expression of these three chemokines is significantly increased in late, rather than early lesions. We hypothesize that these chemokines are important for the long-term maintenance of primate lesions harboring latent Mtb bacilli. The expression of LAG3 was induced more than 40-fold in early primate lesions relative to late ones. LAG3 is a novel marker of Treg cells. We hypothesize that LAG3 is responsible for negatively regulating protective immune responses generated by effector T cells in primate TB lesions.  The expression of ""latency"" specific genes CCL24/25/27 and the ""active-TB: specific  gene  LAG3  will  be  silenced  in  NHPs  using  a  novel  lipidated-siRNA  nanoparticle  based  approach.  The progression of latent disease and its immunological and molecular correlates will then be studied in these animals. Finally, the expression of an immune response to these and other ""latency"" and ""reactivation""- specific  profiles  will  be  determined  in  human  patients  of  latent  and  active  TB,  as  well  as  TB/AIDS  co- infected patients. These systems-biology studies will likely exponentially enhance our understanding of TB latency and reactivation in a host that mimics both TB and AIDS in the closest possible manner to humans.  Eventually, these advances may empower clinicians better to detect and treat latent TB.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Tuberculosis (TB), caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), is a global infectious disease emergency. A major hurdle in combating TB is the fact Mtb is able to persist for long periods of time in host tissues, reactivating when the immune system is compromised.

"Discovering hidden groups across tuberculosis patient and pathogen genotype data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       The principal objective of this project is to develop methods that combine pathogen genotyping and patient epidemiology data that can be used in the control, understanding, and tracking of infectious diseases. This work focuses on the modeling of large international collections of patient epidemiology and strain data for the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTC), the causative agent of tuberculosis disease (TB), because of the urgent global need and the unique data availability due to the National TB genotyping program. Specifically, the project addresses the following problem: given MTC DNA fingerprinting and TB patient data being accumulated nationally and internationally, identify hidden groups capturing MTC genetic families and TB epidemiology using machine learning, and use these hidden groups to address problems in the control, understanding, prevention, and treatment of tuberculosis at city, state, national, and international levels. To address this objective, we identify several aims. The first aim is to gather and merge large databases of MTC patient-isolate genotypes as well as associated patient information from the New York City, New York State, United States, and the rest of the world. The second aim is to identify MTC strain families based on multiple genotype methods using graphical models constrained to reflect background knowledge. The third aim is to identify hidden host-pathogen groups within TB patient demographics and MTC genotypes using a combination of probabilistic graphical models and deterministic multi-way tensor analysis methods designed to capture the temporal dynamics of TB. The fourth aim answers public health questions posed by TB experts by transforming the questions into quantifiable metrics applied to the hidden groups. The hidden group models and metrics will be embedded in analysis methods, and then evaluated by TB experts. The proposed models and analysis methods will capture and share knowledge embedded in large TB patient and MTC genotyping databases without necessarily sharing the actual data.          n/a",Discovering hidden groups across tuberculosis patient and pathogen genotype data,7805478,R01LM009731,"['Address', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Biology', 'Boxing', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Cities', 'Collection', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Complex', 'Country', 'DNA Fingerprinting', 'DNA Insertion Elements', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Epidemiology', 'Exercise', 'Family', 'Fingerprint', 'Gender', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Guadeloupe', 'Healthcare', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'International', 'Investigation', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Metric', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Epidemiology', 'Mycobacterium tuberculosis', 'Nature', 'New York', 'New York City', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phylogeny', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Principal Investigator', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Research Institute', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Restriction fragment length polymorphism', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Social Network', 'Source', 'Stream', 'Structure', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Trees', 'Tuberculosis', 'United States', 'Visual', 'Work', 'base', 'demographics', 'design', 'disorder control', 'family genetics', 'fight against', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic variant', 'global health', 'improved', 'mycobacterial', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'patient privacy', 'programs', 'prototype', 'public health research', 'relational database', 'success', 'theories', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'trend', 'tuberculosis treatment']",NLM,RENSSELAER POLYTECHNIC INSTITUTE,R01,2010,339537,0.04804501107576973
"Ontology-based Information Network to Support Vaccine Research    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Since the introduction of Edward Jenner's smallpox vaccine in 1796, vaccines have proven invaluable for their ability to stimulate the immune system and to confer protection against pathogenic organisms. Progress in modern vaccine research has been accompanied by a dramatic increase in the number of vaccine-related papers in the published literature. It has become increasingly challenging to identify and annotate vaccine data from this large and diverse literature which no one scientist or team can fully master. Although vaccine databases exist that emphasize commercialized vaccines, no public central repository is available to store research data concerning commercial vaccines, vaccines in clinical trials, or vaccine candidates in early stages of development, in a fashion that render such data available for advanced analyses. To fill this need, we have developed VIOLIN (http://www.violinet.org), a web-based database system for annotation, storage, and analysis of published vaccine data. An ontology represents consensus-based controlled vocabularies of terms and relations, with associated definitions which are logically formulated in such a way as to promote automated reasoning. A bottleneck of vaccine research and further VIOLIN development is the lack of a vaccine ontology, which in turn makes a significant obstacle for vaccine data standardization, retrieval, integration, and advanced analysis and prediction. Our goal is to develop the community-based Vaccine Ontology (VO) and apply it to efficient vaccine literature mining and analysis of protective immune mechanisms. We will focus on two model pathogens: Escherichia coli and Brucella species. This project contains three specific aims: (1) develop a community-based Vaccine Ontology (VO), and apply it to establish a vaccine knowledgebase and to promote vaccine data integration and query through Semantic Web. The VO development will be achieved through collaboration with vaccine researchers, the Infectious Disease Ontology (IDO) Initiative, and the National Center for Biomedical Ontology (NCBO); (2) develop a VO-based natural language processing (NLP) system and apply it for more efficient retrieval of Brucella and E. coli vaccine information, automated annotation of journal articles with VO terms, and VO improvement. This task will be achieved by collaboration with the National Center for Integrative Biomedical Informatics (NCIBI). (3) analyze and predict vaccine targets and protective immune networks attributable to the interactions between host and vaccine. This will be achieved mainly by VO-based literature mining and a novel genome- and literature-based statistical methodology. This project will be implemented by a strong collaborative team and supported from a large user community. The Vaccine Ontology and its applications to literature mining and for studying protective immunity against Brucella spp. and E. coli will lay a strong foundation for further advanced informatics research on vaccines against infectious diseases in the post-genomics and information era.            Narrative: Vaccines stimulate the immune system and confer protection against pathogenic microorganisms. A bottleneck of vaccine research is the lack of an ontology (consensus- based controlled vocabularies of terms and relations) to ensure consistency of literature curation and support automated reasoning.

"Transcriptomics of Tuberculosis Latency and Reactivation in Primates    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Tuberculosis (TB), caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), is a global infectious disease emergency. A major hurdle in combating TB is the fact Mtb is able to persist for long periods of time in host tissues, in a quiescent state. These bacilli are able to reactivate and cause pulmonary TB, when the immune system is compromised. Hence, a complete understanding of TB latency and reactivation is required for the effective control of TB. The research models and tools necessary to perform these studies are now available.   Nonhuman Primates (NHPs) are excellent models of TB, especially to study the progression of experimental infection to latency, and to study the pathology and biology of granulomatous lesions - the hallmarks of TB infections. We have established a model of human TB, by exposing NHPs to true Mtb aerosols. While many research groups focus on the bacterial factors of latency and reactivation, we would like to leverage our highly tractable model to identify host signatures and mediators of this process.    We  show  that  pro-inflammatory  immune  signaling  pathways,  initially  induced  in  NHP  TB  lesions,  are  overwhelmingly  silenced  over  the  course  of  next  several  weeks.  This transcriptional reprogramming could be a host response to changes in bacterial replication and physiology. Further, these  responses  could  reflect  the  efforts  of  the  pathogen  to  prevent  excessive  immunopathology  during  the  infection of lungs. The central hypothesis of our proposal is that host granuloma responses can be used to predict latent and reactivation TB. We propose to perform a systematic study of the ""transcriptome"" and the ""miRNAome"" of NHP lung lesions. Temporal profiles will be obtained from NHPs infected with a low-dose of Mtb aerosols, accurately modeling long-term latent infection.  Profiles will also be obtained from NHPs in which latent TB is reactivated by simian AIDS. These system-wide profiles, in conjugation  with  the  clinical,  microbiological  and  immunological  data  obtained  from  infected  NHPs  will  generate  statistical learning algorithms and mixed effects computational models of latent and reactivation TB.    The relevance of some of the most informative set of genetic predictors available from the data collected will be tested back in both the NHP model, as well as in human patients. The expression profiles of CCL24, CCL25 and CCL27 show negative correlation with all other chemokine ligands and receptors in primate TB granulomas. The expression of these three chemokines is significantly increased in late, rather than early lesions. We hypothesize that these chemokines are important for the long-term maintenance of primate lesions harboring latent Mtb bacilli. The expression of LAG3 was induced more than 40-fold in early primate lesions relative to late ones. LAG3 is a novel marker of Treg cells. We hypothesize that LAG3 is responsible for negatively regulating protective immune responses generated by effector T cells in primate TB lesions.  The expression of ""latency"" specific genes CCL24/25/27 and the ""active-TB: specific  gene  LAG3  will  be  silenced  in  NHPs  using  a  novel  lipidated-siRNA  nanoparticle  based  approach.  The progression of latent disease and its immunological and molecular correlates will then be studied in these animals. Finally, the expression of an immune response to these and other ""latency"" and ""reactivation""- specific  profiles  will  be  determined  in  human  patients  of  latent  and  active  TB,  as  well  as  TB/AIDS  co- infected patients. These systems-biology studies will likely exponentially enhance our understanding of TB latency and reactivation in a host that mimics both TB and AIDS in the closest possible manner to humans.  Eventually, these advances may empower clinicians better to detect and treat latent TB.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Tuberculosis (TB), caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), is a global infectious disease emergency. A major hurdle in combating TB is the fact Mtb is able to persist for long periods of time in host tissues, reactivating when the immune system is compromised.

We will employ a systems biology approach to study the host granulomatous response to Mtb latency and reactivation, using our NHP model.

Specifically, the project addresses the following problem: given MTC DNA fingerprinting and TB patient data being accumulated nationally and internationally, identify hidden groups capturing MTC genetic families and TB epidemiology using machine learning, and use these hidden groups to address problems in the control, understanding, prevention, and treatment of tuberculosis at city, state, national, and international levels. To address this objective, we identify several aims. The first aim is to gather and merge large databases of MTC patient-isolate genotypes as well as associated patient information from the New York City, New York State, United States, and the rest of the world. The second aim is to identify MTC strain families based on multiple genotype methods using graphical models constrained to reflect background knowledge. The third aim is to identify hidden host-pathogen groups within TB patient demographics and MTC genotypes using a combination of probabilistic graphical models and deterministic multi-way tensor analysis methods designed to capture the temporal dynamics of TB. The fourth aim answers public health questions posed by TB experts by transforming the questions into quantifiable metrics applied to the hidden groups. The hidden group models and metrics will be embedded in analysis methods, and then evaluated by TB experts. The proposed models and analysis methods will capture and share knowledge embedded in large TB patient and MTC genotyping databases without necessarily sharing the actual data.          n/a",Discovering hidden groups across tuberculosis patient and pathogen genotype data,7848604,R01LM009731,"['Address', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Biology', 'Boxing', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Cities', 'Collection', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Complex', 'Country', 'DNA Fingerprinting', 'DNA Insertion Elements', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Epidemiology', 'Exercise', 'Family', 'Fingerprint', 'Gender', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Guadeloupe', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'International', 'Investigation', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Metric', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Epidemiology', 'Mycobacterium tuberculosis', 'Nature', 'New York', 'New York City', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phylogeny', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Principal Investigator', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Research Institute', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Restriction fragment length polymorphism', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Social Network', 'Source', 'Stream', 'Structure', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Trees', 'Tuberculosis', 'United States', 'Visual', 'Work', 'base', 'demographics', 'design', 'disorder control', 'family genetics', 'fight against', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic variant', 'improved', 'mycobacterial', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'patient privacy', 'programs', 'prototype', 'public health research', 'success', 'theories', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'trend', 'tuberculosis treatment']",NLM,RENSSELAER POLYTECHNIC INSTITUTE,R01,2009,170861,0.04804501107576973

"Ontology-based Information Network to Support Vaccine Research    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Since the introduction of Edward Jenner's smallpox vaccine in 1796, vaccines have proven invaluable for their ability to stimulate the immune system and to confer protection against pathogenic organisms. Progress in modern vaccine research has been accompanied by a dramatic increase in the number of vaccine-related papers in the published literature. It has become increasingly challenging to identify and annotate vaccine data from this large and diverse literature which no one scientist or team can fully master. Although vaccine databases exist that emphasize commercialized vaccines, no public central repository is available to store research data concerning commercial vaccines, vaccines in clinical trials, or vaccine candidates in early stages of development, in a fashion that render such data available for advanced analyses. To fill this need, we have developed VIOLIN (http://www.violinet.org), a web-based database system for annotation, storage, and analysis of published vaccine data. An ontology represents consensus-based controlled vocabularies of terms and relations, with associated definitions which are logically formulated in such a way as to promote automated reasoning. A bottleneck of vaccine research and further VIOLIN development is the lack of a vaccine ontology, which in turn makes a significant obstacle for vaccine data standardization, retrieval, integration, and advanced analysis and prediction. Our goal is to develop the community-based Vaccine Ontology (VO) and apply it to efficient vaccine literature mining and analysis of protective immune mechanisms. We will focus on two model pathogens: Escherichia coli and Brucella species. This project contains three specific aims: (1) develop a community-based Vaccine Ontology (VO), and apply it to establish a vaccine knowledgebase and to promote vaccine data integration and query through Semantic Web. The VO development will be achieved through collaboration with vaccine researchers, the Infectious Disease Ontology (IDO) Initiative, and the National Center for Biomedical Ontology (NCBO); (2) develop a VO-based natural language processing (NLP) system and apply it for more efficient retrieval of Brucella and E. coli vaccine information, automated annotation of journal articles with VO terms, and VO improvement. This task will be achieved by collaboration with the National Center for Integrative Biomedical Informatics (NCIBI). (3) analyze and predict vaccine targets and protective immune networks attributable to the interactions between host and vaccine. This will be achieved mainly by VO-based literature mining and a novel genome- and literature-based statistical methodology. This project will be implemented by a strong collaborative team and supported from a large user community. The Vaccine Ontology and its applications to literature mining and for studying protective immunity against Brucella spp. and E. coli will lay a strong foundation for further advanced informatics research on vaccines against infectious diseases in the post-genomics and information era.            Narrative: Vaccines stimulate the immune system and confer protection against pathogenic microorganisms. A bottleneck of vaccine research is the lack of an ontology (consensus- based controlled vocabularies of terms and relations) to ensure consistency of literature curation and support automated reasoning.

"Mathematical Techniques for Control of Epidemic Trypanosoma cruzi Transmission    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Chagas disease, caused by the unicellular parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, is a preventable disease. Nevertheless more people in the Americas die from Chagas disease than any other parasitic infection. This application will provide tutorial-based training to the applicant in mathematical modeling and modern computer science at the University of Pennsylvania and the Bloomberg School of Public Health of Johns Hopkins University. Training will be geared towards developing the skills necessary to address complex problems hindering the control of Chagas disease. The long term goal of the research is to integrate diagnostic testing of children at high risk of T. cruzi infection into control programs focused mainly on vector elimination, and to better guide vector elimination campaigns. In addition to tutorial-based training in the United States, entomologic and clinical research will be conducted in Peru in coordination with a research grant awarded by   the Fogarty International Center to Dr. Cesar Naquira and collaborators. In Arequipa, a city of nearly one million inhabitants in southern Peru, T. cruzi and Chagas disease have become urban problems. A quiet epidemic of Chagas disease infection is progressing across the city. The specific aims of this application are: 1) To develop techniques to understand and control T. cruzi transmission in epidemic situations, and, 2. To optimize the spatio-temporal ordering of the Chagas disease vector control   campaign in Arequipa, and to elucidate best-practice strategies for vector control elsewhere. In developing these mathematical techniques the candidate will receive quantitative training that will complement his previous work on infectious disease and allow him to develop into a well-rounded independent investigator. RELEVANCE: Integrating diagnosis of children for T cruzi infection into Chagas control campaigns has the potential to greatly reduce morbidity and mortality due to Chagas disease in Peru and elsewhere. Optimizing the spatio-temporal order of vector control campaigns can increase the probability that these eliminate future transmission of T cruzi.          n/a",Mathematical Techniques for Control of Epidemic Trypanosoma cruzi Transmission,7656889,K01AI079162,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Americas', 'Area', 'Award', 'Brazil', 'Capital', 'Chagas Disease', 'Child', 'Chile', 'Cities', 'Clinical Research', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Disease Vectors', 'Ecology', 'Empirical Research', 'Epidemic', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Housing', 'Infection', 'Infection Control', 'Insect Vectors', 'Insecticides', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Mentors', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Parasites', 'Parasitic Diseases', 'Parasitic infection', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pennsylvania', 'Peru', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Principal Investigator', 'Probability', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Public Health Schools', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Residual state', 'Retinal Cone', 'Running', 'Rural Community', 'Solutions', 'South America', 'Techniques', 'Training', 'Triatoma', 'Tropical Medicine', 'Trypanosoma cruzi', 'Tuberculosis', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Work', 'base', 'chemotherapy', 'computer science', 'disease transmission', 'disorder control', 'high risk', 'international center', 'killings', 'mathematical model', 'mortality', 'novel', 'programs', 'pyrethroid', 'rural area', 'skills', 'success', 'theories', 'transmission process', 'urban area', 'vector', 'vector control']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,K01,2009,96901,0.01445589553419772

"Computational Models of Infectious Disease Threats DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Microbial threats, including bioterrorism and naturally emerging infectious diseases, pose a serious challenge to national security in the United States and to health worldwide.  This proposal describes the creation of a center for computational modeling of infectious diseases at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, with the collaboration of key experts at the Brookings Institution, the National Aeronautic and Space Administration, the University of Maryland, and Imperial College (London).  The overarching aim of this project is to integrate the most advanced and powerful techniques of epidemiological data analysis with those of computer simulation (agent-based modeling) to produce a unified computational epidemiology that is scientifically sound, highly visual and user-friendly, and responsive to biosecurity and public health policy requirements.  Data analysis will be guided by the insight that epidemic patterns over space and time can be approached as nearly decomposable systems, in which frequency components of the incidence signal can be isolated and studied.  Wavelet transforms, and empiric mode decomposition using Hilbert-Huang Transforms, will be used to sift nonlinear, nonstationary epidemiological data, allowing frequency band patterns to be defined.  Isolated frequency modes will then be associated with external forcing (weather, social contact patterns) and internal dynamics (Kermack-McKendrick predator-prey models).  Results of the epidemiological data decomposition analysis, along with the knowledge of infectious disease experts, will instruct the creation and development of agent-based models.  Such models feature populations of mobile individuals in artificial societies that interact locally with other individuals.  Features of the basic model include variable social network structures, individual susceptibility and immunity, incubation periods, transmission rates, contact rates, and other selectable parameters.  After the agent-based model is calibrated to generate epidemic patterns consistent with real world epidemiology, preventive strategies including vaccination, contact tracing, isolation, quarantine, and other public health measures will be systematically introduced and their impact evaluated.  Methods will be developed for assessing the utility of individual models, and for making decisions based on combined results from more than one model.

"Computational Models of Infectious Disease Threats DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Microbial threats, including bioterrorism and naturally emerging infectious diseases, pose a serious challenge to national security in the United States and to health worldwide.  This proposal describes the creation of a center for computational modeling of infectious diseases at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, with the collaboration of key experts at the Brookings Institution, the National Aeronautic and Space Administration, the University of Maryland, and Imperial College (London).  The overarching aim of this project is to integrate the most advanced and powerful techniques of epidemiological data analysis with those of computer simulation (agent-based modeling) to produce a unified computational epidemiology that is scientifically sound, highly visual and user-friendly, and responsive to biosecurity and public health policy requirements.  Data analysis will be guided by the insight that epidemic patterns over space and time can be approached as nearly decomposable systems, in which frequency components of the incidence signal can be isolated and studied.  Wavelet transforms, and empiric mode decomposition using Hilbert-Huang Transforms, will be used to sift nonlinear, nonstationary epidemiological data, allowing frequency band patterns to be defined.  Isolated frequency modes will then be associated with external forcing (weather, social contact patterns) and internal dynamics (Kermack-McKendrick predator-prey models).  Results of the epidemiological data decomposition analysis, along with the knowledge of infectious disease experts, will instruct the creation and development of agent-based models.  Such models feature populations of mobile individuals in artificial societies that interact locally with other individuals.  Features of the basic model include variable social network structures, individual susceptibility and immunity, incubation periods, transmission rates, contact rates, and other selectable parameters.  After the agent-based model is calibrated to generate epidemic patterns consistent with real world epidemiology, preventive strategies including vaccination, contact tracing, isolation, quarantine, and other public health measures will be systematically introduced and their impact evaluated.  Methods will be developed for assessing the utility of individual models, and for making decisions based on combined results from more than one model.

"Development of rapid detection tests for Brucella species    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Brucellosis is a re-emerging zoonotic disease that affects humans and a variety of farm animals. As well as a threat to public health it has considerable economic importance. The etiologic agent responsible for human infection, Brucella melitensis, is classified by both NIAID and CDC as a Category B biothreat pathogen. Antibiotics are only partially effective at controlling the disease and there is no vaccine approved for use in humans. Thus, prompt and accurate diagnosis is the key to containing infection. Currently, the most common diagnostic tests for Brucella are based on indirect serology which are lacking in specificity and sensitivity as well as speed of execution. Thus, there is a pressing need to develop improved diagnostics, especially technologies that may be used at field level. This investigation proposes to address this issue and develop a superior and robust technique for diagnosing Brucella infection with highly specific, non-cross reactive antibody reactions. We will achieve this goal by screening the Brucella genome using novel proteomic chip technology to identify unique antigens that will yield highly specific and accurate diagnoses. This work will be undertaken in Phase 1 of the application. In Phase 2, when antigens have been selected, we anticipate that we will proceed to develop ELISA and immunoblot assays. In parallel, both ELISA and lateral flow ""dipstick"" tests for Brucella antigen will be constructed. We envisage that the antigen assays will have particular utility in detecting Brucella disseminated in the context of the bioterrorism event. The diagnostic tools developed within this application will be rigorously evaluated for sensitivity and specificity using large and diverse panels of human and animal Brucella-positive sera available through our collaborators. The project proposes to develop a highly sensitive and robust diagnostic test for brucellosis, also known as ""undulant fever"", an infectious disease that causes serious illness in farm animals and humans. The current techniques for diagnosing infection are somewhat unreliable and based on outmoded methods. This investigation will use state- of-the-art technology to identify new structures or antigens on Brucella bacteria that may be used to develop a test with superior diagnostic performance.          n/a",Development of rapid detection tests for Brucella species,7278655,R43AI068166,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Antibiotics', 'Antibodies', 'Antigen Targeting', 'Antigens', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Arts', 'Bacteria', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Bioterrorism', 'Brucella', 'Brucella abortus', 'Brucella melitensis', 'Brucellosis', 'Categories', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Economics', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Event', 'Fluorescence', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Immune Sera', 'Immunoassay', 'Immunoblotting', 'Immunodominant Antigens', 'Infection', 'Investigation', 'Lateral', 'Livestock', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease', 'Peptides', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Phase I Clinical Trials', 'Phase II Clinical Trials', 'Printing', 'Proteomics', 'Public Health', 'Reaction', 'Sampling', 'Screening procedure', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Serologic tests', 'Serum', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'Study of serum', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Vaccines', 'Work', 'Yersinia enterocolitica', 'base', 'biothreat', 'disorder control', 'improved', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'prototype', 'rapid detection', 'response', 'tool']",NIAID,"INBIOS INTERNATIONAL, INC.",R43,2007,278818,0.04306878397747765

"Nosocomial infections: Automated typing and data mining   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Nosocomial infections cause about 90,000        deaths annually in the U.S. and have an associated medical care cost of about        3.5 billion dollars. Despite being the fourth leading cause of death, there has      been limited development of rapid, integrated tools for determination of             outbreaks of hospital-acquired infections. The goal of the proposed research is      to test feasibility of development of software algorithms for identifying            clusters of bacteria involved in nosocomial infections. This will be                 accomplished by creation of new algorithms for clustering bacterial fatty acid       composition data to detect infection clusters and through the creation of a          ""data mining"" algorithm to provide patient demographic information needed to         distinguish nosocomial outbreaks from community-acquired infections or               pseudo-outbreaks. These software algorithms will be integrated into the MIDI         Sherlock Microbial Identification System as a fully automated real-time              epidemiology tool.

"Development of a joint machine learning/de novo assembly system for resolving viral quasispecies PROJECT SUMMARY Viral hepatitis from hepatitis B (HBV) establishes chronic infections in >250M people worldwide; chronicity is on the rise, and approximately one-third of the world’s population (2 billion) has serologic evidence of exposure. HBV coinfection with HCV and HIV is a hidden consequence of the substance use disorder epidemic. Viral populations have extremely high sequence diversity and rapidly evolve, which explains the vaccine failure rates and viral resistance to existing therapies and makes discovering lasting therapies extremely challenging. Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) is the method of choice to assess the intra-host virus population, termed a “quasispecies”. While a large set of short DNA sequencing reads are acquired that represent the virions in the quasispecies, computational technologies are limited in their analysis capabilities, resulting in particularly low resolution of complex HBV genomic structures. Another challenge is assembling NGS reads representing short fragment of the host genome into full strains (haplotypes) without knowledge of their true occurrence in the samples. To meet these challenges, GATACA is developing pathogen-specific bioinformatics software, GAT-ML (GATACA Assembly Tool – machine learning [ML]) to support treatment discovery and improve infection control. Its specifically designed algorithm utilizes novel ML methodologies adapted and modified for assisting genome assembly that will allow GAT-ML to reconstruct complete viral haplotypes and populations by learning the ‘language’ of the sequences. Tailored initially for HBV samples, GAT and its new ML system will be integrated for feasibility testing in this Phase I with the following Specific Aims: 1. Specific Aim 1. Build a joint learning system. Train and test natural language processing (NLP) methods on HBV genetic variation. 2. Specific Aim 2. Implement and test the machine learning methods in GAT (GAT-ML). We anticipate a working tool for characterizing HBV haplotypes, validated with multi-sourced datasets, and extensive testing and benchmarking of offline and integrated methods. The proposed project will develop and increase the capabilities of our novel computational tool, GAT, to help researchers identify the full spectrum of genetic features of a viral population—such as emergence and persistence of resistance or baseline polymorphisms regardless of their frequencies—and translate these findings to the development of new or improved antiviral drugs and other applications requiring high analytic sensitivity. GAT will particularly benefit researchers working in preclinical stages of drug development who require rapid, sensitive, and reliable results to inform decisions about which targets to advance to clinical trial testing.",Development of a joint machine learning/de novo assembly system for resolving viral quasispecies,10011686,R43AI152894,"['Adoption', 'Algorithm Design', 'Algorithms', 'Antiviral Agents', 'Benchmarking', 'Bioinformatics', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Hepatitis', 'Classification', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'DNA Structure', 'DNA sequencing', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Epidemic', 'Failure', 'Frequencies', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'HIV', 'HIV/HCV', 'Haplotypes', 'Healthcare', 'Hepatitis B', 'Hepatitis B Virus', 'Infection Control', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Language Development', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Liver diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Metagenomics', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mutation', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Population Analysis', 'Privatization', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Semantics', 'Serological', 'Serotyping', 'Source', 'Speed', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Trust', 'Vaccines', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Viral', 'Viral hepatitis', 'Virion', 'Virus', 'base', 'chronic infection', 'co-infection', 'commercialization', 'computerized tools', 'contig', 'design', 'drug development', 'improved', 'insertion/deletion mutation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'machine learning method', 'multiple data sources', 'neural network', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'pre-clinical', 'structural genomics', 'syntax', 'tool', 'viral resistance']",NIAID,"GATACA, LLC",R43,2020,267225,-0.012943248909279805
"Blending deep learning with probabilistic mechanistic models to predict and understand the evolution and function of adaptive immune receptors Project Summary Scientific understanding of adaptive immune receptors (i.e. antibodies and T cell receptors) has the potential to revolutionize prophylaxis, diagnosis, and treatment of disease. High‐throughput DNA sequencing and functional experiments have now brought the study of adaptive immune receptors into the big‐data era. To realize this potential of these data they must be matched with appropriately powerful analytical techniques. Existing probabilistic and mechanistic models are insufficient to capture the complexities of these data, while a naïve application of machine learning cannot leverage our profound existing knowledge of the immune system. The goal of this project is to blend deep learning with mechanistic modeling in order to predict and understand the evolution and function of adaptive immune receptors. Aim 1: Develop generative models of immune receptor sequences that capture the complexity of real adaptive immune receptor repertoires. These will combine deep learning along with our knowledge of VDJ recombination, and provide a rigorous platform for detailed repertoire comparison. Aim 2: Develop quantitative mechanistic models of antibody somatic hypermutation that incorporate the underlying biochemical processes. Estimate intractable likelihoods using deep learning to infer important latent variables, and validate models using knock‐out experiments in cell lines. Aim 3: Develop hybrid deep learning models to predict binding properties from sequence data, combining large experimentally‐derived binding data with even larger sets of immune sequences from human immune memory samples. Incorporate structural information via 3D convolution or distance‐based penalties. These tools will reveal the full power of immune repertoire data for medical applications. We will obtain more rigorous comparisons of repertoires via their distribution in a relevant space. These will reveal the effects of immune perturbations such as vaccination and disease, allowing us to pick out sequences that are impacted by these perturbations. We will have a greater quantitative understanding of somatic hypermutation in vivo, and statistical models that appropriately capture long‐range effects of collections of mutations. We will also have algorithms that will be able to combine repertoire data and sparse binding data to predict binding properties. Put together, these advances will enable rational vaccine design, treatment for autoimmune disease, and identification of T cells that are promising candidates for cancer immunotherapy. Project Narrative Adaptive immune receptors (i.e. antibodies and T cell receptors) enable our body to fight off disease, “remember” pathogens, and train the immune system through vaccination. Immunologists have learned via high‐throughput sequencing that adaptive immune receptors have a truly remarkable diversity. In this proposal, we develop machine‐learning methods for these sequence data, which will allow us to predict the maturation, statistical distribution, and binding properties of adaptive immune receptors, and thus to better design vaccinations, autoimmune disease treatment, and immunotherapy treatment for cancer.",Blending deep learning with probabilistic mechanistic models to predict and understand the evolution and function of adaptive immune receptors,9938424,R01AI146028,"['3-Dimensional', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Model', 'Antibodies', 'Antibody Affinity', 'Antigens', 'Architecture', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Automobile Driving', 'Big Data', 'Binding', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemical Process', 'Categories', 'Cell Line', 'Characteristics', 'Collection', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dependence', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Entropy', 'Evolution', 'Exposure to', 'Foundations', 'Gene Conversion', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'High-Throughput DNA Sequencing', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immune system', 'Immunoglobulin Somatic Hypermutation', 'Immunologic Memory', 'Immunologic Receptors', 'Immunological Models', 'Immunologics', 'Immunologist', 'Immunology', 'Immunotherapy', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Knock-out', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Mutation', 'Pathway interactions', 'Population', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Property', 'Prophylactic treatment', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Statistical Distributions', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'T-Cell Receptor', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'T-cell receptor repertoire', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Update', 'V(D)J Recombination', 'Vaccination', 'Vaccine Design', 'Vaccines', 'Validation', 'Work', 'algorithm training', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'biochemical model', 'cancer immunotherapy', 'cancer therapy', 'complex data ', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'deep sequencing', 'design', 'experimental study', 'fighting', 'functional group', 'in vivo', 'insertion/deletion mutation', 'large datasets', 'machine learning method', 'markov model', 'pathogen', 'progenitor', 'receptor', 'repaired', 'response', 'success', 'three dimensional structure', 'tool']",NIAID,FRED HUTCHINSON CANCER RESEARCH CENTER,R01,2020,710049,-0.007822641814889352
"Identifying individuals at risk of progression to active tuberculosis Project Summary Almost 2 billion people are infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), the causative agent of tuberculosis (TB). Approximately 10% of these individuals will progress to active TB disease over their lifetimes, but there is currently no clinical test to distinguish those that will progress to active TB disease, from those that will not. If we are to realize the World Health Organization's (WHO) goal of a world free of TB by 2035, the massive reservoir of TB infection must be addressed with a cost-effective, ethical therapy for preventing progression, based on treating only those most likely to progress. A diagnostic test that can accurately predict the risk of progression is critical for treating these high-risk individuals and the eradication of TB. Our goal is to develop such an assay. Our central hypothesis is that five independent host immune biomarkers, combined into a single multimetric signature will predict progression from latent to active TB with at least 90% sensitivity and specificity. We will test this hypothesis and achieve our goal by implementing the following specific aims: Aim 1: Compile a comprehensive dataset of biomarkers in a prospective cohort of individuals who are at risk of progressing to active TB. Working with the Moldova Ministry of Health's National TB Program, we will enroll 3,685 close contacts of active TB cases. All participants will be followed for two years to determine who progresses to active TB. We expect to identify ≥ 140 progressors. We will assess three previously established blood-based predictors of active TB progression, and two novel assays. We will verify the performance of previously published biomarkers in this population to discriminate progressors from non-progressors and identify new candidate biomarkers using RNA-Seq of antigen stimulated PBMC and detection of Mtb-peptides by NanoDisk MS. Aim 2: Use a discovery set of samples to develop predictive models of progression to active TB. Using data from 140 progressors and 140 non-progressors from Aim 1 we will (1) Verify the performance of existing biomarkers, (2) Use a cross-validation to identify new candidate biomarkers, and (3) derive predictive models using logistic regression and machine learning methods to identify optimal biomarker signatures that best predict progression to active TB within 12 months. Aim 3: Verify the ability of the model to predict progression to active TB disease. Using the same approach as Aim 1, we will enroll a new set of 1,340 household contacts of active TB and identify at least 60 progressors and 60 matched non-progressors and verify clinically the sensitivity/specificity of our models and biosignatures (Aim 2) to predict progression to active disease. A combined host biomarker signature that can predict TB progression from a small blood volume will have significant impact on the WHO End TB Program. PROJECT NARRATIVE Almost 2 billion people are infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the causative agent of tuberculosis (TB). Approximately 10% of these individuals will progress to active TB disease over their lifetimes, but there is currently no test to distinguish those that will progress from those that will not. We propose to develop a multimetric signature of host biomarkers that together will have a sensitivity and specificity of ≥ 90% for predicting progression to active TB in one year, a critical first step to developing cost-effective and ethical treatment plans in order to reach the World Health Organization goal of Ending TB by 2035.",Identifying individuals at risk of progression to active tuberculosis,9852419,R01AI137681,"['Address', 'Antigens', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood Volume', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Sensitivity', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Enrollment', 'Ethics', 'Event', 'Filtration', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Foundations', 'Freezing', 'Frequencies', 'Gender', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Household', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immunologic Markers', 'Individual', 'Interferons', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Lymphocyte', 'Modeling', 'Moldova', 'Mycobacterium tuberculosis', 'Mycobacterium tuberculosis antigens', 'National Health Programs', 'Organizational Objectives', 'Outcomes Research', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Peptide Fragments', 'Peptides', 'Performance', 'Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell', 'Plasma', 'Population', 'Procedures', 'Production', 'Prospective cohort', 'Proteins', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'RNA', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Specificity', 'T cell response', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Testing', 'Tuberculosis', 'Validation', 'World Health Organization', 'age group', 'base', 'biobank', 'biomarker performance', 'biosignature', 'blood-based biomarker', 'candidate marker', 'classification algorithm', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'cohort', 'cost effective', 'deep neural network', 'enzyme linked immunospot assay', 'falls', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'machine learning method', 'monocyte', 'nanodisk', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive test', 'prevent', 'programs', 'progression marker', 'random forest', 'research clinical testing', 'support vector machine', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transmission process', 'treatment planning']",NIAID,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2020,711592,0.0434325364802885
"Deep learning based antibody design using high-throughput affinity testing of synthetic sequences Project Summary We will develop and apply a new high-throughput methodology for rapidly designing and testing antibodies for a myriad of purposes, including cancer and infectious disease immunotherapeutics. We will improve upon current approaches for antibody design by providing time, cost, and humane benefits over immunized animal methods and greatly improving the power of present synthetic methods that use randomized designs. To accomplish this, we will display millions of computationally designed antibody sequences using recently available technology, test the displayed antibodies in a high-throughput format at low cost, and use the resulting test data to train molecular dynamics and machine learning methods to generate new sequences for testing. Based on our test data our computational method will identify sequences that have ideal properties for target binding and therapeutic efficacy. We will accomplish these goals with three specific aims. We will develop a new approach to integrated molecular dynamics and machine learning using control targets and known receptor sequences to refine our methods for receptor generalization and model updating from observed data (Aim 1). We will design an iterative framework intended to enable identification of highly effective antibodies within a minimal number of experiments, in which our methods automatically propose promising antibody sequences to profile in subsequent assays (Aim 2). We will employ rounds of automated synthetic design, affinity test, and model improvement to produce highly target-specific antibodies. (Aim 3). ! Project Narrative We will develop new computational methods that learn from millions of examples to design antibodies that can be used to help cure a wide variety of human diseases such as cancer and viral infection. Previous antibody design approaches used a trial and error approach to find antibodies that worked well. In contrast our mathematical methods will directly produce new antibody designs by learning from large-scale experiments that test antibodies for function against disease targets. !",Deep learning based antibody design using high-throughput affinity testing of synthetic sequences,9878070,R01CA218094,"['Affinity', 'Animals', 'Antibodies', 'Antibody Affinity', 'Antigens', 'Architecture', 'Binding', 'Biological Assay', 'Budgets', 'Classification', 'Cloud Computing', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Computing Methodologies', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Fc Receptor', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Immunize', 'Immunotherapeutic agent', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Machines', 'Oligonucleotides', 'Output', 'Performance', 'Phage Display', 'Property', 'Randomized', 'Research', 'Services', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Specificity', 'Statistical Models', 'Technology', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Thinness', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Update', 'Virus Diseases', 'Work', 'base', 'cloud based', 'commercialization', 'computing resources', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'design', 'experimental study', 'human disease', 'improved', 'iterative design', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning method', 'mathematical methods', 'molecular dynamics', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'outcome prediction', 'predictive test', 'receptor']",NCI,MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2020,591130,0.026470134697052745
"Synergistic integration of topology and machine learning for the predictions of protein-ligand binding affinities and mutation impacts Project Summary The success of the ongoing battle with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) depends crucially on the availability of effective diagnostics, vaccines, antibody therapeutics, and small-molecular drugs. Although SARS-CoV-2 mutates slower than the viruses that cause the flu and the common cold, it has had more than 8300 observed single mutations on its genome of 29,900 nucleotides by June 1, 2020. We show that these mutations might have devastating effects on COVID-19 diagnostics, vaccines, antibody therapeutics, and small-molecular drugs (J. Chem. Inf. Model. In press). We will develop new artificial intelligence (AI) to forecast SARS-CoV-2 future mutations. Leveraging on state-of-art methods developed under the present R01 award, we will design mutation- resistant vaccines, antibody therapeutics, and small-molecular drugs. The CPUs and GPUs requested in this supplement will be essential for my lab to continue the research of the present R01 award and to apply the methods developed in this award to attack fundamental problems in combating COVID-19.

"The Environmental and Human Factors that Determine Ixodes scapularis-borne Diseases Incidence Project Summary Vector-borne diseases (VBDs) are the most common types of emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases in the world. VBD epidemics have been increasing over recent decades, with tickborne diseases having doubled in the last decade in the United States. Despite the increase in public health burden, over 80% of vector-control organizations lack preventative capabilities. Understanding the interplay between the environment, vectors, pathogens, and humans that expedite disease spread remains a challenge. The overarching goal of this project is to identify the key environmental and human drivers that have led to the emergence of VBDs. Current models that predict tickborne disease risk have oversimplified the process by focusing only on the vector, i.e. risk of tick exposure. A human’s risk of infection is not only a function of entomological risk but also of factors inherent to the individual including behavior or characteristics that increase susceptibility to disease. This project proposes a novel approach to tickborne disease prediction by developing a comprehensive model that incorporate pathogen population dynamics and human factors to predict disease risk. This study will investigate several pathogens vectored by the black-legged tick (Ixodes scapularis): Borrelia burgdorferi (Lyme disease), Anaplasma phagocytophilum (human granulocytic anaplasmosis), and Babesia microti (babesiosis). The central hypothesis is that the prediction of tickborne disease risk can be improved by using sophisticated statistical methods to identify environmental drivers that impact pathogen population dynamics while incorporating human demographic characteristics. The hypothesis will be addressed in the following aims: (1) Determine the current and historical population dynamic patterns of pathogens vectored by I. scapularis to predict pathogen distribution; (2) Determine the association between human characteristics and tick-borne disease risk in order to develop an improved spatial disease risk model. This model will allow the identification and quantification of factors that are associated with the emergence of tickborne diseases in New York State, which is geographically advantageous because it is representative of much of the natural environment that ticks encounter in the northeastern US including rapid and recent changes in climate and landscapes. The results of this project will be used to develop a public disease warning system that will use contemporary and future climate forecasts to monitor tick populations and predict potential disease outbreaks for areas with vulnerable populations. With climate forecasts predicting an increase in 2-3°C in temperature by 2100, there is uncertainty in how diseases will shift and a warning system will allow preparation accordingly. At the completion of the proposed research project, the applicant will have acquired the following skillsets through intensive, interdisciplinary mentorship: big data analysis, advanced statistics including Bayesian and machine learning methods, spatial analyses, and risk analysis. This will enable the applicant to succeed as an independent investigator to address the challenges posed by emerging infectious diseases. Project Narrative Vector-borne diseases are the most common types of emerging infectious diseases in the world and constitute major threats to public health. My project uses advanced statistical methods to uncover how interactions between environmental factors affecting pathogen population dynamics and human demographic characteristics determine human risk for three tick-borne diseases: Lyme disease, human granulocytic anaplasmosis, and babesiosis. The results of my project will be used to create a risk map to predict the spatial and temporal occurrence of tickborne diseases, which can inform public health strategies in order to mitigate disease burden.",The Environmental and Human Factors that Determine Ixodes scapularis-borne Diseases Incidence,10018461,F31AI133871,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Affect', 'Anaplasma phagocytophilum', 'Anaplasmosis', 'Area', 'Award', 'Babesia microti', 'Babesiosis', 'Bayesian Analysis', 'Bayesian learning', 'Behavior', 'Big Data', 'Big Data Methods', 'Black-legged Tick', 'Borrelia burgdorferi', 'Characteristics', 'Climate', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Contracts', 'Dangerousness', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Decision Trees', 'Disease', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Ecological Change', 'Ecology', 'Emerging Communicable Diseases', 'Entomology', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemic', 'Epidemiological trend', 'Future', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Human Characteristics', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Linear Regressions', 'Link', 'Lyme Disease', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'New York', 'Pattern', 'Population', 'Population Dynamics', 'Predisposition', 'Preparation', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Statistical Methods', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Temperature', 'Tick-Borne Diseases', 'Tick-Borne Infections', 'Ticks', 'Time', 'Training', 'Uncertainty', 'United States', 'Variant', 'Vector-transmitted infectious disease', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'anthropogenesis', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'cost effective', 'decision tree learning', 'demographics', 'disorder risk', 'environmental change', 'geographic population', 'granulocyte', 'human disease', 'human pathogen', 'improved', 'infection risk', 'machine learning method', 'model design', 'novel strategies', 'pathogen', 'pathogen exposure', 'predictive modeling', 'regression trees', 'spatial temporal variation', 'statistics', 'tick bite', 'tick-borne pathogen', 'trend', 'vector', 'vector control', 'vector transmission']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,F31,2020,38185,0.01754175273569207
"EVOLVING VIRUS-SPECIFIC sACE2 MIMICS FOR COMPETITIVE INHIBITION OF SARS-CoV-2 PROJECT SUMMARY The rapid spread of the highly-pathogenic, novel SARS-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused a global health emergency. Thus, there is a desperate need for effective antiviral therapeutics to counteract this virus. The SARS-CoV-2 virus enters cells using the ACE2 receptor1 which binds the viral spike protein2. In its soluble form, ACE2 (sACE2) has the potential to be used as a stable and non-immunogenic competitive inhibitor to SARS-CoV-2 and is presently being explored in clinical trials3. Due to the potential negative side effects of anti-spike mAbs18, and the fact that ACE2 exhibits other biological roles4–6 including integrin signaling regulation7,8, spike-specific receptor mimics would yield novel therapeutics for SARS-CoV-2 and potentially other highly infectious diseases. This proposal seeks to use machine learning and directed evolution to develop high affinity, yet endogenously-inactive mimics of sACE2 in order to create rapidly implementable therapeutics to combat SARS-CoV-2 and potential corona-like viruses. This approach would allow for the generation of scalable and translatable biologics, and provide a platform to rapidly course-correct for potential mutations that may arise in the future. Utilizing deep-learning with UniRep49, will design and generate sACE2 variants that tightly bind the SARS-CoV2-2 spike protein but do not cross-interact with endogenous targets such as integrins [Aim 1]. Simultaneously, we will perform directed evolution to optimize spike-binding and select against variants that bind endogenous proteins [Aim 2]. Finally, we will identify lead candidates and evaluate the tolerance and immunogenicity of engineered sACE2 variants in mice [Aim 3]. Collectively, this proposal will develop highly-specific ACE2 receptor mimics in order to create novel antivirals with minimal immunogenicity in time to save lives and prevent future outbreaks. 10 Project Narrative There is desperate need for novel, effective, and scalable antiviral medicines to combat the COVID-19 pandemic. The SARS-CoV-2 virus enters human cells by binding to the ACE2 receptor, and a soluble version of that receptor is being explored in clinical trials as a potential “competitive inhibitor”: the virus will bind to the decoy instead of the real receptor. The goal of this project is to combine computational and laboratory evolution to create superior receptor decoys that more tightly bind to the virus but don't affect any other functions of the human body, enabling them to be safely delivered at high levels with minimal side effects.",EVOLVING VIRUS-SPECIFIC sACE2 MIMICS FOR COMPETITIVE INHIBITION OF SARS-CoV-2,10175307,R21AI158169,"['2019-nCoV', 'Affect', 'Affinity', 'Albumins', 'Antiviral Agents', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'COVID-19 pandemic', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Data', 'Directed Molecular Evolution', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Dose', 'Effectiveness', 'Engineering', 'Evolution', 'Exhibits', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Human body', 'Integrin Binding', 'Integrins', 'Laboratories', 'Left', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Medicine', 'Mus', 'Mutation', 'Pathogenicity', 'Patients', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Recombinants', 'Safety', 'Signal Transduction', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Viral', 'Virus', 'Virus Diseases', 'Virus Inhibitors', 'base', 'combat', 'cross reactivity', 'deep learning', 'design', 'global health emergency', 'immunogenicity', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'lead candidate', 'mutant', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'prevent', 'receptor', 'side effect']",NIAID,MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R21,2020,399346,-0.017331067011230737
"Using data science to measure the impact of opioid agonist therapy in patients admitted with Staphylococcus aureus bloodstream infections PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT This career development award will provide early career support for investigation of the management of infec- tious diseases in the setting of addiction in hospitals. The award will provide support for the candidate to develop expertise in the following areas: 1) addiction science research; 2) natural language processing; 3) machine learn- ing; 4) professional development; and 5) responsible conduct of research. For this, Dr. Goodman-Meza will be mentored by a multidisciplinary, cross-institutional team with expertise in addiction, infectious diseases, and data science. His primary mentor, Dr. Steve Shoptaw, has an extensive track record in addiction-related research and training of future independent investigators. His co-mentors include Dr. Alex Bui and Dr. Matthew B. Goetz. Dr. Bui is an expert in biomedical data science and heads NIH training programs in this field. Dr. Goetz has broad experience of productive infectious diseases clinical research within the Veterans Health Administration (VHA). The current opioid epidemic in the United States has been associated with an increase in infections, in particular hepatitis C and bacterial infections. Bacterial infections are the leading infectious diagnosis leading to hospitali- zation in individuals with an opioid use disorder (OUD), and incur significant healthcare expenditures. Despite the availability of opioid agonist therapy (OAT) in the form of methadone or buprenorphine, less than 20% of people with OUD actually receive OAT. Hospitalization for a bacterial infection may be an ideal time to initiate OAT, but the benefits of this practice are unknown. In this proposal, the candidate will assess the impact of initiating OAT in people who inject opioids admitted to the VHA due to a Staphylococcus aureus blood stream infection (bacteremia) – the most common bacterial pathogen among people who inject opioids. Using data already collected for 36,868 cases of S. aureus bacteremia (SAB) from the VHA electronic data repository, the candidate will address three research questions: 1) is a natural language processing algorithm (NLP) more ac- curate than a standard International Classification of Diseases (ICD) code-based approach at screening records to correctly identify individuals who inject opioids in a cohort of patients admitted with SAB; 2) what are the temporal and geographic trends of SAB in people who inject opioids and those who receive OAT at the facility- level; and 3) using a machine learning framework, what are the estimated impacts of OAT on patient centered outcomes – death, readmissions, leaving against medical advice, and subsequent outpatient engagement in OAT. These formative data will help the candidate to establish a productive early career as a physician-scientist and advise development of an OAT-delivery strategy to mitigate infectious complications of injection opioid use. Through this award, Dr. Goodman-Meza will establish himself as an expert physician-scientist at the intersection of infectious disease and addiction, poised to make significant contributions to this important area of medicine. PROJECT NARRATIVE Serious, life-threatening bacterial infections in people who inject drugs are increasing with the current national opioid epidemic. Hospitalization of people who use opioids for treatment of infectious complications may be an ideal time to initiate opioid agonist therapy (OAT), an evidence-based practice that has been historically underuti- lized. This project will use innovative data science methods to estimate the impact of initiating OAT in the hospital for patients with a history of opioid injection admitted for treatment of blood stream infections caused by Staph- ylococcus aureus in the Veterans Health Administration.",Using data science to measure the impact of opioid agonist therapy in patients admitted with Staphylococcus aureus bloodstream infections,9951022,K08DA048163,"['Acute suppurative arthritis due to bacteria', 'Address', 'Admission activity', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Award', 'Bacteremia', 'Bacteria', 'Bacterial Infections', 'Behavior', 'Blood', 'Brain', 'Buprenorphine', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical Research', 'Coagulation Process', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease Outcome', 'Distant', 'Drug usage', 'Economic Burden', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Embolism', 'Endocarditis', 'Epidemic', 'Equipment', 'Evidence based practice', 'Future', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'HIV risk', 'Head', 'Health', 'Health Expenditures', 'Heart', 'Hepatitis C', 'Hepatitis C Transmission', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Immunosuppression', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Injecting drug user', 'International Classification of Disease Codes', 'Investigation', 'Joints', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Kidney', 'Life', 'Location', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Methadone', 'Methods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Practice Guidelines', 'Predisposition', 'Recording of previous events', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Sepsis', 'Services', 'Staphylococcus aureus', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stream', 'Testing', 'Thrombus', 'Time', 'Training Programs', 'Travel', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Veterans', 'Water', 'Work', 'addiction', 'base', 'biomedical data science', 'blood treatment', 'career', 'classification algorithm', 'cohort', 'data format', 'data warehouse', 'efficacy testing', 'electronic data', 'experience', 'health administration', 'heroin use', 'hospital readmission', 'improved', 'injection drug use', 'innovation', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'opioid agonist therapy', 'opioid epidemic', 'opioid injection', 'opioid misuse', 'opioid use', 'opioid use disorder', 'opioid user', 'overdose death', 'pathogenic bacteria', 'pathogenic virus', 'prescription opioid', 'responsible research conduct', 'screening', 'skin microbiota', 'time interval', 'treatment services', 'trend', 'viral transmission']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,K08,2020,203040,0.039508245625350616
"Making antibody generation rapid, scalable, and democratic through machine learning and continuous evolution Project Summary/Abstract It is hard to overstate the importance of monoclonal antibodies in the life sciences. Antibodies are critical tools in biomedical research and diagnostics (e.g. western blotting, immunoprecipitation, cytometry, biomarker discovery, and histology), are one of the most rapidly growing class of therapeutics, and are the basis for myriad new strategies in cancer therapy, such as checkpoint inhibitors that are revolutionizing treatment. Unfortunately, current methods for the generation of custom antibodies, including animal immunization and phage display, are slow, costly, inaccessible to most researchers, and often unsuccessful. We propose Autonomously EvolvinG Yeast-displayed antibodieS (AEGYS), a system for the continuous and rapid evolution of high-quality antibodies against custom antigens that requires only the simple culturing of yeast cells. We believe this can be achieved by combining cutting-edge generative machine learning algorithms for antibody library design with a new technology for in vivo continuous evolution and a yeast antigen-presenting cell that we will engineer. If successful, AEGYS should have a transformative impact across the whole of biomedicine by turning monoclonal antibody generation into a rapid, scalable, and accessible process where any lab with standard molecular biology capabilities can generate custom antibodies on demand simply by “immunizing” a test tube of yeast cells with an antigen. We anticipate that this democratization of antibody generation will also result in an explosion of crowdsourced antibody sequence data that will train our machine learning algorithms to design better antibody libraries for AEGYS, starting a virtuous cycle. We ourselves will use AEGYS to generate a panel of subtype- and conformation-specific nanobodies against biogenic amine receptors including those that respond to acetylcholine, adrenaline, dopamine, and other neurotransmitters, so that we can understand their role in neurobiology and addiction.! Project Narrative This proposal will provide a system for the scalable continuous evolution and computational design of antibodies against user-selected antigens. Antibodies are critical tools in medical research and are the basis for numerous therapies, but the generation of custom antibodies against new targets is a difficult and specialized task. The system proposed will turn antibody generation into a routine and widely accessible process for researchers in almost any field.","Making antibody generation rapid, scalable, and democratic through machine learning and continuous evolution",10021311,R01CA260415,"['Acetylcholine', 'Affinity', 'Animals', 'Antibodies', 'Antibody Affinity', 'Antibody Formation', 'Antigen Targeting', 'Antigen-Presenting Cells', 'Antigens', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Back', 'Biogenic Amine Receptors', 'Biological Sciences', 'Biomedical Research', 'Cell Surface Receptors', 'Cells', 'Chemistry', 'Clinic', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Cultured Cells', 'Custom', 'Cytometry', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detergents', 'Diagnostic', 'Directed Molecular Evolution', 'Docking', 'Dopamine', 'Elements', 'Engineering', 'Epidemic', 'Epinephrine', 'Evolution', 'Explosion', 'G-Protein-Coupled Receptors', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Histology', 'Human', 'Hybridomas', 'Image', 'Immune checkpoint inhibitor', 'Immune system', 'Immunization', 'Immunize', 'Immunoglobulin Fragments', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical Research', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Biology', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Monoclonal Antibodies', 'Neuraxis', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurotransmitters', 'Nobel Prize', 'Outcome', 'Pathogen detection', 'Phage Display', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pheromone', 'Play', 'Problem Solving', 'Process', 'Production', 'Protein Engineering', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Public Health', 'Reagent', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specificity', 'Speed', 'Surface', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Studies', 'Training', 'Tube', 'Update', 'V(D)J Recombination', 'Western Blotting', 'Yeasts', 'addiction', 'antibody engineering', 'antibody libraries', 'antigen binding', 'base', 'biomarker discovery', 'cancer therapy', 'cost', 'crowdsourcing', 'decision research', 'design', 'empowered', 'experimental study', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'machine learning algorithm', 'nanobodies', 'new technology', 'novel', 'receptor', 'response', 'scaffold', 'structural biology', 'tool']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA-IRVINE,R01,2020,1690552,0.01631211815941409
"Digital High Resolution Melt and Machine Learning for Rapid and Specific Diagnosis in Neonatal Sepsis Project Summary Blood culture sensitivity in neonates is poor but is the “Gold Standard” for the diagnosis of sepsis. Universal genotyping of pathogen genomic sequences using High Resolution Melt (U-HRM) provides a simple, low cost, rapid, and modern alternative to blood culture testing. By measuring the fluorescence of an intercalating dye as PCR-amplified pathogen DNA fragments are heated and disassociate, sequence defined melt curves are generated with single-nucleotide resolution in a closed-tube reaction. We have advanced U- HRM into a digital PCR format (U-dHRM), where DNA sequences that are present in mixtures are individually amplified and identified as is needed for polymicrobial infections. We have also established unique signature melt curves for 37 bacterial species that commonly infect older children and adults and automatically identify them using machine learning technology. With the goal of creating an accurate and valid test for the timely diagnosis of neonatal sepsis, we will advance this technology to identify unique fungal, viral, and bacterial HRM signatures along with antibiotic resistance genes with an accuracy of 99-100% on minimal blood volume (1mL). Our aims are: Aim 1. Optimize and assess the U-dHRM platform for neonatal bacteremia diagnosis by expand our bacterial database (13 additional bacteria) to detect causes of >99% of neonatal bacterial infections, expand our antibiotic resistance gene database to include five clinically actionable genes, and assessing the performance of the system for bacteremia diagnosis in mock and clinical whole blood samples; Aim 2. Advance the U-dHRM platform for simultaneous detection of fungal and viral pathogens by upgrading our optical system to enable expansion to fungal and viral detection in a high-throughput format, multiplexing the assay to expand to viral and fungal pathogens causing >99% non-bacterial infections, and conducting analytical validation of the multiplexed platform using mock whole blood samples; and Aim 3. Advance the machine learning algorithm for detection of emerging pathogens by developing and integrating an anomaly detection algorithm for reporting emerging pathogens that are not included in our database and validating the algorithm using data generated in Aims 1 and 2. Thus, this proposal directly addresses the funding call by applying a multidisciplinary approach to overcome the biomedical challenge of rapidly diagnosis sepsis, a hidden public health disaster. Project Narrative Digital High Resolution Melting (dHRM) of DNA combined with machine learning creates unique “fingerprints"" for microbes and antibiotic resistance, allowing for faster and more precise detection and treatment of pathogen(s) causing sepsis. This project will advance and test the clinical performance of dHRM technology in the diagnosis of neonatal sepsis. Our goal is to rapidly and accurately identify pathogens and their resistance markers to facilitate accurate antimicrobial therapy, reducing antibiotic overuse in non-infected infants.",Digital High Resolution Melt and Machine Learning for Rapid and Specific Diagnosis in Neonatal Sepsis,9915874,R01AI134982,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Antibiotic Resistance', 'Antibiotics', 'Bacteremia', 'Bacteria', 'Bacterial Antibiotic Resistance', 'Bacterial Infections', 'Biological Assay', 'Birth Weight', 'Blood', 'Blood Volume', 'Blood specimen', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disasters', 'Dyes', 'Emerging Technologies', 'Exposure to', 'Fingerprint', 'Fluorescence', 'Funding', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Hour', 'Immune response', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Microbe', 'Modernization', 'Neonatal', 'Nucleotides', 'Optics', 'Organism', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Predisposition', 'Public Health', 'RNA', 'Reaction', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Sepsis', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Training', 'Tube', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Very Low Birth Weight Infant', 'Viral', 'Whole Blood', 'Woman', 'antimicrobial', 'base', 'circulating DNA', 'clinically actionable', 'clinically relevant', 'cost', 'diagnosis standard', 'digital', 'early onset', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'intrapartum', 'machine learning algorithm', 'melting', 'microbial', 'neonatal sepsis', 'neonate', 'overtreatment', 'pathogen', 'pathogen genome', 'pathogen genomics', 'pathogenic fungus', 'pathogenic virus', 'point of care', 'premature', 'rapid diagnosis', 'resistance gene', 'sample collection', 'septic', 'therapy resistant', 'viral detection']",NIAID,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2020,486161,0.05184298994494773
"Identifying Risk Factors for Antibiotic Resistance via Integration of Epidemiology and Metagenomics PROJECT SUMMARY Given the growing burden of antimicrobial resistance (AR) and lack of effective therapies for multi-drug resistant organisms, the development of new tools or models which risk-stratify patients for colonization and infection by AR bacteria is of paramount importance, particularly in high-risk populations. The significance of the gut microbiome in mediating colonization resistance against drug resistant pathogens as well as the role of microbiota-depleting antibiotics in the development of AR infections is being increasingly appreciated. However, there is currently a deficiency of methods integrating microbiome and antibiotic factors into AR- predictive algorithms. Thus, the overall objective of the proposed research is to improve understanding of the factors driving the epidemiology of AR-colonization and infection by incorporating metagenomic and antibiotic administration data of a well-defined clinical cohort. In this proposal, we focus on patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (from whom we have already collected extensive longitudinal stool samples and performed 16S rRNA gene sequencing) because of the high rates of AR pathogen colonization and severe risk for infection. The overarching hypothesis that will be tested is that the baseline presence of a limited number of key bacterial species and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) are critical for the risk of colonization and/or infection with an AR pathogen when combined with the administration of specific antimicrobials. We will begin our research by comprehensively determining the epidemiology of AR pathogen colonization and AR infection in our cohort via culture based stool sample analyses and clinical chart review, respectively. Using shotgun metagenomics, we will establish whether the baseline intestinal microbiome species and resistome characteristics are associated with the acquisition of AR pathogens colonizing or causing infection. Similarly, we will ascertain the relationship between antimicrobial exposure, microbiome disruption, and subsequent AR emergence. The data from these studies will be integrated into Decision Tree (DT) and Random Forest (RF) models to improve the prediction of AR pathogen colonization and AR infection outcomes. The proposed career development award, which utilizes the expertise of a superlative mentorship team and a uniquely designed research and training plan, will enable me the opportunity to build upon my current expertise in microbiology, genomics, and molecular epidemiology by adding advanced training in shotgun metagenomic analyses, bioinformatics, and biostatistical modeling. Moreover, the numerous resources and support provided by my institution and mentoring team will ensure my successful transition to an independent investigator as well as establish a strong foundation for my long-term goals of understanding and mitigating the impact of antimicrobial resistance in human health via integration of multiple –omics platforms and provision of personalized genomic-based medicine. PROJECT NARRATIVE Antibiotic resistant (AR) infections are one of the most serious public health threats and a leading cause of morbidity and mortality, particularly in immunocompromised patients. The proposed research will use a combination of culture-based techniques and high-throughput approaches to determine the epidemiology of colonization and infectious events by AR-pathogens, characterize the gut microbiome, and mine clinical data of acute leukemia patients receiving chemotherapy in order to identify microbial species, antibiotic resistance genes, patient features, and antibiotic administration factors that affect the risk for colonization and/or infection with an AR pathogen. The ultimate goal of the proposed research is to exploit metagenomics as an epidemiological tool for understanding susceptibility to AR outcomes and to build predictive risk models which can be potentially incorporated into prevention and intervention strategies to mitigate AR infection events in high-risk patients.",Identifying Risk Factors for Antibiotic Resistance via Integration of Epidemiology and Metagenomics,9851830,K01AI143881,"['16S ribosomal RNA sequencing', 'Acute Myelocytic Leukemia', 'Acute leukemia', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Anti-Infective Agents', 'Antibiotic Resistance', 'Antibiotics', 'Antimicrobial Resistance', 'Area', 'Automobile Driving', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biometry', 'Blood Circulation', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Decision Trees', 'Development', 'Elements', 'Ensure', 'Epidemiology', 'Event', 'Foundations', 'Freezing', 'Future', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hematologic Neoplasms', 'Human', 'Immunocompromised Host', 'Infection', 'Infection Control', 'Institution', 'Intestines', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Longitudinal cohort study', 'Mediating', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Metadata', 'Metagenomics', 'Methods', 'Microbiology', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Epidemiology', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Prevention', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Public Health', 'ROC Curve', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Resistance to infection', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Studies', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Shotguns', 'Source', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Trees', 'Validation', 'Weight', 'antibiotic resistant infections', 'antimicrobial', 'bacterial resistance', 'base', 'career', 'chemotherapy', 'cohort', 'colonization resistance', 'commensal microbes', 'drug resistant pathogen', 'effective therapy', 'emerging antimicrobial resistance', 'genomic epidemiology', 'gut microbiome', 'gut microbiota', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'improved', 'infection risk', 'leukemia', 'metagenomic sequencing', 'microbial', 'microbiome', 'microbiota', 'mortality', 'multi-drug resistant pathogen', 'multiple omics', 'pathogen', 'patient stratification', 'patient subsets', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'rRNA Genes', 'random forest', 'resistance gene', 'skills', 'stool sample', 'tool']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF TX MD ANDERSON CAN CTR,K01,2020,110387,0.07579682747475547
"Machine Learning to Optimize Management of Acute Hydrocephalus Patients 37,000 patients a year receive an external ventricular drain (EVD) in the setting of acute hydrocephalus in the US, generating in-hospital charges of $151,672 per patient, or $5.6 billion dollars a year. There is great motivation in the neurointensive care unit for the optimization of EVD management to reduce infection rates, accurately determine need for permanent shunting, and to do so efficiently in order to minimize duration of drainage and length of stay (LOS). Risk factors for ventriculitis include EVD duration, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) sampling frequency, presence of intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH), and insertion technique. Severe CSF disturbances in patients with IVH and EVDs limit the value of routine CSF analysis for ventriculitis prediction. And ventriculitis diagnosis is imprecise, with only a minority declaring culture positivity while all still demanding antibiotic treatment and delay of permanent shunt. This leads to unnecessary empiric antibiotic treatment and increased LOS (30.8 vs 22.6 days), with the associated cost ($30,335 more) and morbidity (e.g. Clostridium difficile infection, emergence of drug-resistant pathology). The process of determining permanent shunt dependence is variable between institutions, particularly around the decision of when to begin weaning the EVD or predicting delayed resolution. These decisions in the subacute period determine LOS and associated adverse events, exposure to radiography, and commitment to potentially unnecessary permanent foreign materials in the CNS, which then carry lifelong risks for infection and blockage. There is no accurate noninvasive test (that does not further introduce infection) to diagnose ventriculitis nor is there a timely method to predict need for permanent shunt after acute hydrocephalus. To fill this gap, we propose developing a quantitative model from intracranial pressure (ICP) waveform analysis to increase precision in the diagnosis of ventriculitis and accurately predict need for permanent shunt. In previous work, we were able to predict with good accuracy who would need permanent shunt placement using ICP waveform analysis collected during a 24 hour clamp trial. However, a complex model can only be justified if it achieves a diagnosis earlier or more accurately than traditional clinical methods. In preliminary work, we clustered raw ICP waveforms and found a pattern of waveforms specific for ventriculitis that appears 1 day before diagnostic cultures are sent. Our central hypothesis is that there is a temporal quantitative signal in ICP waveform reflective of intracranial dynamics that can be harvested to optimize acute hydrocephalus management. Impact and Significance: Noninvasive quantitative models based on ICP waveform analysis that diagnose ventriculitis and accurately predict need for permanent shunt would decrease the duration of EVD and the frequency of CSF sampling, two of the risk factors for ventriculitis, while also decreasing LOS, associated adverse events of ICU stay, and empiric antibiotics. There is no accurate noninvasive test to diagnose ventriculitis nor is there a timely method to predict need for permanent shunt after acute hydrocephalus. To fill this gap, we propose developing a quantitative model from intracranial pressure waveform analysis to increase precision in the diagnosis of ventriculitis and accurately predict need for permanent shunt. Accurate noninvasive sequential machine learning models could decrease external ventricular drain duration and cerebrospinal fluid sampling frequency, two of the risk factors for ventriculitis, while also decreasing length of stay and empiric systemic antibiotics.",Machine Learning to Optimize Management of Acute Hydrocephalus Patients,10057040,R21NS113055,"['Acute', 'Adverse event', 'Antibiotic Therapy', 'Antibiotics', 'Caring', 'Cerebral hemisphere hemorrhage', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid Proteins', 'Clinical', 'Clostridium difficile', 'Closure by clamp', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Drainage procedure', 'Drug resistance', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Exposure to', 'Frequencies', 'Harvest', 'Healthcare', 'Hospital Charges', 'Hour', 'Hydrocephalus', 'Infection', 'Inflammatory', 'Information Retrieval', 'Institution', 'Intracranial Pressure', 'Learning', 'Length of Stay', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Morphology', 'Motivation', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neuraxis', 'Neurosurgeon', 'Output', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Process', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Shunt Device', 'Signal Transduction', 'Subarachnoid Hemorrhage', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Ventricular', 'Weaning', 'Work', 'base', 'cost', 'improved', 'infection rate', 'infection risk', 'intraventricular hemorrhage', 'long short term memory', 'recurrent neural network', 'vector']",NINDS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R21,2020,445500,0.00037746071166100143
"Leveraging Neural Imaging for Automated Neonatal Infection Diagnosis PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Post-infectious hydrocephalus (PIH) is a leading cause of neonate mortality in the developing world, but there are limited resources in place for appropriately diagnosing and monitoring the infections that lead to hydrocephalus. There is often a lack of personnel and laboratory resources available for the gathering and processing of lumbar puncture and blood cultures, which are the gold-standard for diagnosing the infectious agents at play in sepsis and PIH. In order to overcome this obstacle, CSF and blood samples were taken from a cohort of septic neonates in Mbale, Uganda, as well as a cohort of neonates and infants who had already progressed to PIH. Cranial ultrasounds (CrUS) were taken from the cohort of septic neonates, and head CT scans were gathered from the PIH cohort. This proposal hypothesizes that the pathogens determined from RNA and DNA sequencing of the blood and CSF samples can be used to train supervised machine learning algorithms to recognize imaging phenotypes characteristic of the underlying pathogen. Therefore, PIH can be prevented by providing pathogen-specific diagnosis and targeted treatment recommendations at the bedside for septic neonates using CrUS. Furthermore, surgical treatment success for PIH can be optimized using CT for the purpose of identifying the underlying pathogen and providing management plan recommendations. This project provides an ideal training environment for a fellow interested in pediatric neurosurgery with a research emphasis on engineering and machine learning applied to image analysis. The interdisciplinary and global nature of the project encourages development of a collaborative and innovative research approach. The home institution of Penn State provides multiple clinical opportunities for growth in pediatric neurosurgery, the MD/PhD program is supportive of truly translational research efforts, and the sponsor and co-sponsor are more than adequately prepared to provide all aspects of training mentorship necessary to accomplish the aims of this project and develop a well-rounded physician-scientist. PROJECT NARRATIVE Post-infectious hydrocephalus is a devastating condition with a global impact, but diagnostic options and available treatment plans are limited in the developing world in particular. This project aims to design machine learning algorithms that leverage cranial ultrasound and head CT for the diagnosis of pathogen-specific sepsis and hydrocephalus in neonates, and propose treatment paradigms based on the diagnostic output.",Leveraging Neural Imaging for Automated Neonatal Infection Diagnosis,10066656,F30HD102120,"['Africa', 'Africa South of the Sahara', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents', 'Antiviral Agents', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Blood', 'Blood specimen', 'Brain', 'Caregivers', 'Cauterize', 'Central Nervous System Infections', 'Cephalic', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Coupled', 'DNA sequencing', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease Management', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Endocrine', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Failure', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Growth', 'Head', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Home environment', 'Human Resources', 'Hydrocephalus', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imagery', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Infant', 'Infection', 'Infectious Agent', 'Institution', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Mentorship', 'Microbiology', 'Monitor', 'Nature', 'Neonatal', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neuraxis', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Output', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Play', 'Prevention', 'Procedures', 'Protocols documentation', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Secondary to', 'Sepsis', 'Shunt Device', 'Spinal Puncture', 'Structure of choroid plexus', 'Survivors', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Uganda', 'Ultrasonography', 'Ventriculostomy', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'cerebrospinal fluid flow', 'cohesion', 'cohort', 'design', 'diagnosis standard', 'disease classification', 'genome sequencing', 'hands-on learning', 'improved', 'innovation', 'intelligent algorithm', 'interest', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mortality', 'neonatal infection', 'neonatal sepsis', 'neonate', 'neurosurgery', 'non-invasive imaging', 'optimal treatments', 'pathogen', 'prevent', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'septic', 'success', 'supervised learning', 'targeted treatment', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'treatment planning', 'treatment strategy']",NICHD,PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIV HERSHEY MED CTR,F30,2020,32183,0.015233740420630656
"A priori adaptive evolution predictions for antibiotic resistance through genome-wide network analyses and machine learning SUMMARY Adaptive evolution (AE) is both a “force of good” as it can help to optimize biological processes in industry, but it is also a “force of frustration” when infectious diseases exploit AE to escape the host immune system or become resistant to drugs. It has long been assumed close to impossible to make predictions on AE due to the presumed predominating influences of random forces and events. However, the observation that evolutionary repeatability across traits and species is far more common than previously thought, suggests that AE, with the right data and approach, may become (partially) predictable. Indeed, we found through experiments with the bacterial pathogen Streptococcus pneumoniae on its response to antibiotics and the emergence of antimicrobial resistance, that in order to make AE predictable a detailed understanding of at least two aspects of the bacterial system are required: 1.) the genetic constraints of the system (i.e. the architecture of the organismal network); and 2.) where and how in the system stress is experienced and processed. We showed that by mapping out ~25% of the bacterium's network, determining phenotypic and transcriptional antibiotic responses, applying network analyses to capture and quantify the responses in a network context, and exploiting experimental evolution to pin-point adaptive mutations in the genome it becomes possible, by means of machine learning, to uncover hidden patterns in the data that make AE predictions feasible. This means that the network in interaction with the environment shapes the adaptive landscape, it limits available solutions and makes some solutions more likely than others, thereby driving repeatability and enabling predictability. In this proposal we build on these exciting developments with the goal to map out the constraints of S. pneumoniae's entire network and develop a machine learning model that can forecast adaptive evolution a priori, and on a genome-wide scale. To accomplish this, we combine in aim 1 parts of Tn-Seq, dTn-Seq and Drop-Seq to finalize a new tool Tn-Seq^2 (Tn-Seq squared) that is able to map genetic-interactions in high-throughput and genome-wide. We use Tn-Seq^2 to reconstruct the first genome-wide genetic interaction network for S. pneumoniae in the presence of 20 antibiotics. In aim 2 we create 85 HA-tagged Transcription factor induction (TFI) strains and: a) Determine with ChIP-Seq the DNA-binding sites for all 85 TFs in S. pneumoniae; b) By overexpressing each TFI strain followed by RNA- Seq we determine each TFs regulatory signature; c) Use a Transcriptional Regulator Induced Phenotype screen in the presence of 20 antibiotics to untangle environment specific links between genetic and transcriptional perturbations and their phenotypic outcomes. Lastly, in aim 3, we train and test a variety of machine learning approaches to design an optimal model that predicts which genes in the genome are most likely to adapt in the presence of a specific antibiotic. The development of this predictive AE model, will not only be useful in predicting the emergence of antibiotic resistance, but the strategy should be valuable for most any biological field for which adaptive changes are important, ranging from biological engineering to cancer. NARRATIVE Adaptive evolution (AE) is the driving force behind the emergence of antibiotic resistance and if it were possible to predict AE before it happens, it could help in preventing resistance. Here we use cutting-edge existing and newly designed genomics tools and analytical approaches to develop a machine learning model that can predict AE a priori, and on a genome-wide scale.",A priori adaptive evolution predictions for antibiotic resistance through genome-wide network analyses and machine learning,10049219,R01AI148470,"['Achievement', 'Affect', 'Antibiotic Resistance', 'Antibiotics', 'Architecture', 'Automobile Driving', 'Bacteria', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Biomass', 'ChIP-seq', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Complex', 'DNA Binding', 'Data', 'Development', 'Drug resistance', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Escherichia coli', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Exposure to', 'Fermentation', 'Frustration', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Immune system', 'Immunotherapeutic agent', 'Industry', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Microfluidics', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Organism', 'Outcome', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Photosynthesis', 'Planet Earth', 'Process', 'Resistance', 'Shapes', 'Streptococcus pneumoniae', 'Stress', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Yeasts', 'design', 'driving force', 'droplet sequencing', 'emerging antibiotic resistance', 'emerging antimicrobial resistance', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'genetic architecture', 'genome-wide', 'genomic tools', 'network architecture', 'novel', 'overexpression', 'pathogenic bacteria', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'process optimization', 'programs', 'response', 'tool', 'trait', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transposon sequencing']",NIAID,BOSTON COLLEGE,R01,2020,391250,0.012713342552715827
"Accelerating viral outbreak detection in US cities using mechanistic models, machine learning and diverse geospatial data Project Abstract/Summary Our interdisciplinary research team will develop algorithms to accelerate the detection of respiratory virus outbreaks at an unprecedented local scale in US cities. We propose to advance outbreak detection by combining machine learning data integration methods and spatial models of disease transmission. The dynamic models that will be developed will provide mechanistic engines for distinguishing typical from atypical disease trends and the optimization methods evaluate the informativeness of data sources to achieve specified public health goals through the rapid evaluation of diverse input data sources. Working with local healthcare and public health leaders, we will translate the algorithms into user-friendly online tools to support preparedness plans and decision-making. Our proposed research is organized around three major aims. In Aim 1, we will apply machine learning and signal processing methods to build systems that track the earliest indicators of emerging outbreaks within seven US cities. We will evaluate non-clinical data reflecting early and mild symptoms as well as clinical data covering underserved communities and geographic and demographic hotspots for viral emergence. In Aim 2, we will develop sub-city scale models reflecting the syndemics of co-circulating respiratory viruses and chronic respiratory diseases (CRD) that can exacerbate viral infections. We will infer viral transmission rates and socio-environmental risk cofactors by fitting the model to respiratory disease data extracted from millions of electronic health records (EHRs) for the last nine years. We will then partner with clinical and EHR experts to translate our models into the first outbreak detection system for severe respiratory viruses that incorporates EHR data on CRDs. Using machine learning techniques, we will further integrate other surveillance, environmental, behavioral and internet predictor data sources to maximize the accuracy, sensitivity, speed and population coverage of our algorithms. In Aim 3, we will develop an open-access Python toolkit to facilitate the integration of next generation data into outbreak surveillance models. This project will produce practical early warning algorithms for detecting emerging viral threats at high spatiotemporal resolution in several US cities, elucidate socio-geographic gaps in current surveillance systems and hotspots for viral emergence, and provide a robust design framework for extrapolating these algorithms to other US cities. Project Narrative We will develop innovative algorithms for detecting emerging respiratory viruses within US cities. To do so, we will model the syndemic dynamics of respiratory viruses and chronic respiratory diseases and apply machine learning to combine geospatial data that track early indicators of emerging threats. Working with local public health and healthcare collaborators, we will translate this research into practical tools for addressing socio- geographic gaps in surveillance and accelerating the detection, prevention and mitigation of severe outbreaks.","Accelerating viral outbreak detection in US cities using mechanistic models, machine learning and diverse geospatial data",9946212,R01AI151176,"['Absenteeism', 'Address', 'African', 'Age', 'Algorithm Design', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Articulation', 'Bayesian Method', 'Behavioral', 'Caring', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Cities', 'Climate', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Collaborations', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Disease', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Disease Surveillance', 'Disease model', 'Ebola', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Epidemic', 'Evaluation', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Influenza', 'Influenza A Virus, H1N1 Subtype', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'International', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Location', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mexico', 'Modeling', 'Neighborhoods', 'Pollution', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Public Health', 'Pythons', 'Readiness', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Rural', 'Schools', 'Sentinel', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Social Environment', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Speed', 'Subgroup', 'Surveillance Modeling', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Uncertainty', 'Validation', 'Viral', 'Virus', 'Virus Diseases', 'Visualization', 'Work', 'World Health Organization', 'austin', 'base', 'cofactor', 'comorbidity', 'dashboard', 'data acquisition', 'data integration', 'design', 'digital', 'disease transmission', 'diverse data', 'epidemiologic data', 'epidemiological model', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'global health', 'health care availability', 'health goals', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'influenza outbreak', 'influenzavirus', 'innovation', 'insight', 'metropolitan', 'next generation', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'pandemic disease', 'public health intervention', 'respiratory virus', 'school district', 'signal processing', 'simulation', 'social media', 'sociodemographic group', 'socioeconomics', 'sound', 'spatiotemporal', 'stem', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'trend', 'user-friendly', 'viral transmission']",NIAID,YALE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,611043,-0.004353553135592205
"A New Tool to Rapidly Diagnose Sepsis using Flow Imaging Microscopy and Machine Learning Project Summary  Sepsis is a serious condition induced by an infection, often by a bacterial pathogen, leading to organ damage or even death. Despite numerous advances in medicine over the years, the condition still affects millions of people in both developed and developing countries. In the US, sepsis affects 1.7M and kills over 265,000 people annually. Sepsis mortality rates in developing countries are substantially higher. In terms of demographics, sepsis affects humans of all age and race, but it is most pronounced at the age extremes (infants and the elderly) and patients whose immune system is already under strain due to other illnesses or immune system-weakening therapies, e.g., cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy.  Blood cultures are currently the default technique used in detecting and diagnosing the root cause of sepsis. However, blood-cultures can take upwards of 24-48 hours in order to obtain results. In that time, the patient can experience irreversible harm due to the condition if not treated properly. Unfortunately, precise and effective antibiotic treatment requires knowledge of the pathogen causing sepsis. Beyond a long time to get an answer, blood cultures often exhibit alarmingly high false negatives (failure to detect a pathogen causing sepsis) and typically do not precisely identify the pathogen causing sepsis.  Hence there have been several efforts aimed at detecting and identifying the broad range of potential pathogens causing sepsis and circumventing the need for blood cultures. However, many of the recently proposed methods for detecting and diagnosing sepsis exhibit one or more of the following drawbacks: (i) they lack high sensitivity (ability to detect a pathogen); (ii) they cannot accurately identify a broad range of pathogens from a single sam- ple; (iii) take a (relatively) long time; (iv) require a large volume of blood; or (v) cannot be used in the real-time monitoring of sepsis (either detecting pathogens known to cause sepsis or quantifying the patient's response to antimicrobial treatment).  We are proposing a new sepsis detection method, combining ﬂow imaging microscopy (a high-throughput technique for imaging millions of microscopic particles) and deep learning based image analysis (techniques leveraged in facial recognition and self-driving cars) to overcome the above mentioned limitations. The approach has proven capable of detecting a variety of bacterial species in low concentrations of mouse blood in less than 1 hour of processing time with as little as 50 L of blood. In this proposal, one of our aims is to optimize our approach and quantify the accuracy and limits of detection in human blood. Our patent pending approach has also been licensed to a major manufacturer of ﬂow imaging microscopes. Another aim of this research is to begin integration of our technology with an existing commercial instrument with the intention of providing a compact self- contained device that can be deployed at numerous hospitals world-wide. The implementation of our platform should have a major impact on antimicrobial treatment in all areas of the hospital. Project Narrative  Sepsis affects 1.7M US citizens (causing roughly 270k deaths) each year; the condition is also the most expensive condition treated in US hospitals costing approximately 24B USD each year.

"Statistical methods for real-time forecasts of infectious disease: expanding dynamic time-series and machine learning approaches for pandemic scenarios PROJECT SUMMARY The emergence and global expansion of SARS-CoV-2 as a human pathogen over the last four months represents a nearly unprecedented challenge for the infectious disease modelling community. This pandemic has benefitted from huge volumes of data being generated, but the rate of dissemination of these data has often outpaced existing data pipelines. While the last decade has seen significant advances in real-time infectious disease forecasting — spurred by rapid growth in data and computational methods — these methods have primarily focused on seasonal endemic diseases based, are based on historical data, and so do not apply easily to this novel pathogen, or to pandemic scenarios. New methods are needed to leverage the wealth of surveillance data at fine spatial granularity, together with associated information about policy interventions and environmental conditions over space and time, to reason directly about the mechanisms to forecast and understand the transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 transmission. These methods must use sound statistical and epidemiological principles and be flexible and computationally efficient to provide real- time forecasts to guide public health decision-making and respond to changing aspects of this global crisis. The central research activities of this project are (1) to develop scalable, computationally efficient Bayesian hierarchical compartmental models to flexibly respond to state-level public health forecasting needs, and (2) to design models and conduct analyses to draw robust inference about the effectiveness of interventions in impacting the reproductive rate of SARS-CoV-2 infections within the US to build an evidence-base for continued responses to COVID-19 and future pandemics. PUBLIC HEALTH NARRATIVE The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is an emerging public health crisis. A fundamental challenge is how to turn data into evidence that can inform decision-making about managing resources, improving health outcomes, and controlling further spread of SARS-CoV-2. Real-time forecasting and flexible mechanistic models to understand the disease dynamics can provide policy-makers tools to manage public response. The goal of the proposed research is to adapt existing statistical modeling frameworks and develop new ones for making forecasts of COVID-19 in real-time and integrating these forecasts into public health decision making.",Statistical methods for real-time forecasts of infectious disease: expanding dynamic time-series and machine learning approaches for pandemic scenarios,10150377,R35GM119582,"['2019-nCoV', 'Award', 'Budgets', 'COVID-19', 'Calibration', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Cessation of life', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Contracts', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Reporting', 'Data Sources', 'Decision Making', 'Dengue', 'Dengue Fever', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Effectiveness of Interventions', 'Endemic Diseases', 'Epidemic', 'Epidemiology', 'Evaluation Methodology', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Hospitalization', 'Infection', 'Influenza', 'Influenza prevention', 'Intervention', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Natural experiment', 'Outcome', 'Performance', 'Policies', 'Policy Maker', 'Programmed Learning', 'Public Health', 'Recurrence', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Resources', 'Series', 'Social Distance', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Thailand', 'Time', 'Work', 'base', 'data dissemination', 'data pipeline', 'deep learning', 'evidence base', 'flexibility', 'human pathogen', 'improved', 'infectious disease model', 'influenza epidemic', 'machine learning method', 'model design', 'novel', 'pandemic disease', 'pathogen', 'predictive modeling', 'rapid growth', 'real world application', 'reproductive', 'response', 'seasonal influenza', 'sound', 'statistical and machine learning', 'surveillance data', 'tool', 'transmission process']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF MASSACHUSETTS AMHERST,R35,2020,78507,0.03878761380404461
"Mobile Genetic Elements and Clinical Outcomes in Staphylococcus aureus Bacteremia Project Summary Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and its impact on health has been recognized as one of the most serious public health threats facing society. Significantly, the vast majority of acquired AMR genes are carried on mobile genetic elements (MGEs), which include plasmids, insertion sequences, and transposons. One of the most important hospital and community-associated pathogens harboring resistance genes is Staphylococcus aureus, which causes more than 80,000 infections and 11,000 deaths each year in the United States. S. aureus readily acquire MGEs, which encompass more than 20% of the genome for most strains, and these elements have been central to the establishment and broad spread of resistance to antibiotics such as oxacillin and vancomycin. Additionally, S. aureus is capable of causing a wide range of infections, including bacteremia, with a mortality rate up to 30%. Utilizing an unparalleled collection of S. aureus strains from a cohort of patients in Central and South America with bacteremia, I seek to develop a framework for the identification and comparison of circulating MGEs through the use of bacterial phylogenetics, clinical epidemiology, and machine learning. This dataset will serve as the foundation for my training to become an independent scientist. To begin interrogating this exceptional strain collection, we have generated Illumina short-read whole genome sequencing data on 1,087 S. aureus bacteremia isolates to identify MGEs, and will leverage novel ultra-long read sequencing methodologies to fully characterize the position and variations of these elements. The three aims within this proposal are designed to elucidate the role of MGEs in driving the genetic diversification of endemic S. aureus clades, and identify if they serve as adaptation hotspots when put under selective pressure from the host immune system or antibiotics. First, I will characterize the repertoire of MGEs within this large cohort of isolates and apply gene-order and Bayesian time-measured phylogenetics to identify the predominant MGEs within each clade and how frequently they are acquired and lost. Second, I will assess the MGE diversity within isolates collected serially from the same individual. I hypothesize these MGEs will be the primary variation points and will be more important than single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to the adaptation to selective pressures such as antibiotics. Third, I will identify the clinical (age, BMI, and present comorbidities) and genomic (SNPs, MGEs, and genes) features that are predictive of the 30-day mortality in the predominant clades of S. aureus within our dataset. I theorize these genetic and clinical signatures will be different for each clade as they possess different repertoires of MGEs. The Center for Antimicrobial Resistance and Microbial Genomics in The University of Texas Health Sciences Center at Houston has a firm commitment to understanding and reducing AMR and AMR infections. This provides an exceptional environment to conduct my research elucidating the role of MGEs in the clinical outcomes of S. aureus bacteremia, and to develop as an investigator and participate in the training offered to make the transition to independence. Project Narrative Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and its impact on health has been recognized as one of the most serious global public health threats facing our society. This proposal aims to clarify the role mobile genetic elements play in transmitting antimicrobial resistance and driving genetic diversity within endemic Staphylococcus aureus lineages causing bacteremia.

"Rapid fungal identification and antifungal susceptibility testing through quantitative, multiplexed RNA detection PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT  Timely diagnostics for fungal infections are sorely needed to guide effective therapy. Invasive fungal infections are increasing in prevalence, causing millions of deaths each year worldwide, and drug resistance poses a rising threat. Due in large part to slow, outmoded diagnostics that require days of culture to identify the pathogen and report its antifungal susceptibility profile, mortality from invasive fungal infections can exceed 40%. This in turn leads clinicians to rely on empiric and prophylactic use of antifungals that may be ineffective, cause needless toxicity, and select for resistance. Rapid precision diagnostic assays are critically needed to improve patient outcomes and guide efficient deployment of our limited antifungal arsenal.  To address this urgent public health need, in response to a specific funding opportunity announcement on “Advancing Development of Rapid Fungal Diagnostics” (PA-19-080), this proposal describes a strategy for rapid fungal identification and antifungal susceptibility testing based on RNA signatures. This approach relies on a novel paradigm for pathogen diagnostics, recently validated in bacteria and implemented on a simple, robust, quantitative, multiplexed fluorescent hybridization assay on the NanoString platform. Detection of highly abundant, conserved ribosomal RNA (rRNA) sequences enables broad-range, ultrasensitive pathogen identification. Meanwhile, quantifying key messenger RNA levels following antimicrobial exposure enables phenotypic antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST), relying on the principle that cells that are dying or growth- arrested are transcriptionally distinct within minutes from those that are not (Bhattacharyya et al, Nature Medicine, in press). Because this approach to AST measures gene expression as an early phenotypic change in susceptible strains, it does not rely on foreknowledge of the genetic basis of resistance in order to classify susceptibility, and can thus be generalized to any pathogen-antimicrobial pair.  This proposal aims to first computationally design and experimentally validate a set of hybridization probes to uniquely recognize the 18S and 28S rRNA from each of 48 clinically significant fungal pathogens that together cause the vast majority of invasive fungal infections in humans. Preliminary data show that these rRNA targets are abundant enough to detect a single fungal cell without amplification, enabling ultrasensitive detection in <4 hours directly from clinical samples. Next, RNA-Seq will be used to profile transcriptional changes in 12 common fungal pathogens for which resistance has important clinical consequences in response to treatment with the three major classes of antifungals. Antifungal-responsive transcripts that best classify fungal isolates as susceptible or resistant will be chosen by adapting machine learning algorithms that were developed for this purpose in bacteria. Finally, both approaches will be piloted on simulated and real clinical fungal samples. Preliminary data suggest that these approaches can identify fungi within <4 hours from a primary sample, and deliver AST results within <6 hours of a positive fungal culture. PROJECT NARRATIVE Fungal infections are common, increasing in frequency and severity, and cause considerable morbidity and mortality. Early recognition of invasive fungal infection, and prompt initiation of effective antifungal therapy, are key to improving patient outcomes. This proposal aims to adapt a novel paradigm for rapid pathogen identification and antimicrobial susceptibility testing through the quantitative detection of RNA signatures to transform fungal diagnostics.","Rapid fungal identification and antifungal susceptibility testing through quantitative, multiplexed RNA detection",10034036,R01AI153405,"['Address', 'Advanced Development', 'Antibiotics', 'Antifungal Agents', 'Antifungal Therapy', 'Antimicrobial susceptibility', 'Aspergillus', 'Azoles', 'Bacteria', 'Bacterial Infections', 'Bacterial RNA', 'Biological Assay', 'Biopsy Specimen', 'Blood', 'Bronchoalveolar Lavage', 'Candida', 'Candida auris', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Class Zygomycetes', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Microbiology', 'Collaborations', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Drug resistance', 'Frequencies', 'Funding Opportunities', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Messenger RNA', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Multi-Drug Resistance', 'Mycoses', 'Nature', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Phylogenetic Analysis', 'Polyenes', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predisposition', 'Prevalence', 'Public Health', 'RNA', 'RNA Sequences', 'RNA, Ribosomal, 28S', 'Reporting', 'Resistance', 'Ribosomal RNA', 'Sampling', 'Severities', 'Skin', 'Specimen', 'Speed', 'Sputum', 'Swab', 'Symptoms', 'Taxonomy', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Transcript', 'Urine', 'Work', 'antimicrobial', 'base', 'clinically significant', 'computational pipelines', 'design', 'diagnostic assay', 'effective therapy', 'efflux pump', 'experience', 'fungus', 'improved', 'machine learning algorithm', 'microbial', 'mortality', 'nano-string', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'overexpression', 'pathogen', 'pathogenic fungus', 'patient population', 'personalized diagnostics', 'prophylactic', 'random forest', 'resistance mechanism', 'response', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'treatment response']",NIAID,"BROAD INSTITUTE, INC.",R01,2020,645818,0.04285561038980613
"Seroepidemiologic methods to identify hotspots of trachoma and predict future  infection Project Summary / Abstract Background: Trachoma, caused by ocular infection with Chlamydia trachomatis, is the leading cause of infectious blindness worldwide and has been targeted for global elimination as a public health problem by 2020. This goal will be achieved in many countries, but some regions in Ethiopia maintain persistently high levels of infection despite >10 years of intensive control activities. A small proportion of the population likely harbors the majority of trachoma infections, with foci of infection (“hotspots”) at or below the village scale; the operational challenge is accurately predicting where they are with existing data. Advances in machine learning and spatial data science have demonstrated marked improvements in the spatial resolution of predictions for diseases like malaria. Among available biomarkers of trachoma, IgG antibody responses in children could enable more accurate predictions because they integrate exposure over time and reflect recent transmission. Aims: The principal aims of this study are to evaluate whether antibody measurements can identify stable hotspots of trachoma infection, and whether a novel machine learning approach can accurately predict village- level trachoma infection forward in time (up to 3 years). We hypothesize that infection will be concentrated in the population and that hotspots of infection will be at the village level. We further hypothesize that antibody measurements in young children will provide a stable source of information about trachoma transmission that will enable us to accurately predict villages with high levels of future C. trachomatis infection. Methods: To test our hypotheses, we will draw on measurements from a well characterized population across 40 villages enrolled in a NIH-funded cluster randomized trial in Ethiopia’s Amhara Region (U10-EY023939). The three-year trial is designed to measure the effect of improved water, sanitation, and handwashing (WASH) on trachoma infection in the absence of azithromycin treatment. The trial has collected clinical and biomarker measurements from approximately 2,400 children ages 0-9 years at enrollment and in annual visits over 3 years. We will characterize the spatial scale of transmission using the !-statistic, which equals the relative risk of infection within different distances of cases. We will use a permutation-based, spatial scan statistic to identify hotspots using IgG antibody and PCR measures in each year, and will determine if they are stable over time. Using geospatial ensemble machine learning, we will predict trachoma seroprevalence as a function of remotely sensed, geospatial information and limited enrollment characteristics. We will rank order villages by predicted seroprevalence, and will assess the proportion of PCR C. trachomatis infections in top-ranked villages 1, 2, and 3 years later. We will repeat the analysis using predicted clinical symptoms as a comparator. The development of methods to make accurate, fine-scale predictions of future C. trachomatis infection will lay the groundwork for a future adaptive randomized trial that preferentially allocates more intensive intervention to villages predicted at enrollment to have high future levels of infection. Project Narrative / Lay Language Description Trachoma is the leading cause of infectious blindness worldwide and has been targeted for global elimination as a public health problem by 2020. Trachoma control programs target and monitor activities at the level of districts, but it is likely that infection hotspots are concentrated at much smaller scales and could be missed in district-level averages. We propose to combine antibody-based measures of exposure with state-of-the-art machine learning to develop predictions of trachoma infection at the scale of individual villages in the Amhara region of Ethiopia, which would represent a substantial increase in the resolution of information available to guide control and monitoring efforts.",Seroepidemiologic methods to identify hotspots of trachoma and predict future  infection,9974479,R03AI147128,"['Age', 'Antibiotics', 'Antibodies', 'Antibody Response', 'Area', 'Azithromycin', 'Biological Markers', 'Blindness', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Chlamydia trachomatis', 'Cholera', 'Clinical', 'Cluster randomized trial', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Enrollment', 'Ethiopia', 'Eye Infections', 'Face', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Handwashing', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hygiene', 'Immunoglobulin G', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Intervention', 'Language', 'Machine Learning', 'Malaria', 'Masks', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Public Health', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Relative Risks', 'Resolution', 'Sanitation', 'Scanning', 'Serological', 'Seroprevalences', 'Source', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Trachoma', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Visit', 'Water', 'Work', 'World Health Organization', 'base', 'clinical biomarkers', 'clinical predictors', 'design', 'high risk population', 'improved', 'infection risk', 'machine learning method', 'method development', 'novel', 'population based', 'programs', 'randomized trial', 'remote sensing', 'sample collection', 'sex', 'transmission process']",NIAID,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R03,2020,87707,0.03198358969481502
"NeoChip for specific and rapid identification of congenital CMV and neonatal HSV infections on minimal sample volume Project Summary  Congenital cytomegalovirus (cCMV) and neonatal herpes simplex virus (nHSV) impose major health threats on neonates. Although CMV and HSV are lifelong infections with periods of latency and reactivation, most maternal infections remain undiagnosed due to nonspecific or absent clinical symptoms. In the United States, a child is permanently disabled by cCMV infection every hour, even though 9 of 10 infants are asymptomatic after birth and remain undiagnosed. Invasive nHSV, on the other hand, is a rare neonatal infection that presents with a broad range of clinical symptoms, including those that may be life-threatening. Viral culture and DNA detection by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) have become the “Gold Standard” for the diagnosis of cCMV and nHSV infection, despite poor sensitivity of PCR assays in neonates and time consuming culture techniques (up to 5-7 days).  Universal genotyping of pathogen genomic sequences using High Resolution Melt (U-HRM) provides a simple, low cost, rapid, and modern alternative to viral cultures and PCR techniques. By measuring the fluorescence of an intercalating dye as PCR-amplified pathogen DNA or RNA fragments are heated and disassociate, sequence defined melt curves, or “fingerprints”, are generated with single-nucleotide resolution in a closed-tube reaction. These unique microbial “fingerprints” are then automatically identified and quantified using machine learning technology, with an accuracy of 99-100% on minimal blood volume (1 mL), in a platform called NeoChip. Presently, we have established unique signature melt curves for 40 bacterial species and antimicrobial resistance genes that commonly infect neonates. Additionally, NeoChip has been expanded to distinguish individually amplified melt curve signatures for multiple pathogen identification and quantification, as required for polymicrobial infection.  In this proposal, we will build out NeoChip’s comprehensive database by incorporating clinical strains of CMV and HSV with actionable antiviral resistance genes. Because NeoChip identifies variances in nucleic acid sequences, individual differentiation and quantification of CMV and HSV strains are possible. We will also translate the NeoChip for specific and rapid diagnosis of cCMV and nHSV infection in a large prospective clinical study of pregnant women and their offspring(s), as well as directly compare the platform to standard quantitative nucleic acid test (QNAT) assays, IgG/IgM antibody testing, and clinical outcome measures for statistical concordance (predictive value). Finally, we will validate and translate NeoChip for cCMV detection and clinical correlation using dried blood spot (DBS) samples for incorporation into standard universal newborn screening programs. NeoChip’s goal is to provide an accurate and valid test for the timely diagnosis of pathogen etiology (viral, bacterial, and fungal) in a single test with efficacy on broad tissue matrices and capacity to inform microbial resistance, thereby facilitating early administration of targeted antimicrobials and therapeutics. This proposal directly addresses the funding call by applying a multidisciplinary approach to address the biomedical challenges of rapidly and accurately diagnosing cCMV and nHSV to facilitate disease prognostication and early therapeutic or intervention programs. Project Narrative NeoChip combines real-time PCR, digital High Resolution Melting (dHRM) of DNA and RNA, and machine learning to create unique “fingerprints"" for microbes and antimicrobial resistance, allowing for faster and more precise detection of pathogen(s) causing neonatal infection. This project will build out NeoChip’s melt curve database to include clinically relevant strains of cytomegalovirus and herpes simplex virus infections, while concordantly assembling updated epidemiologic timelines and prevalence of perinatal CMV and HSV transmission. Our goals are to validate NeoChip for the rapid and specific diagnosis of congenital CMV and neonatal HSV infection on multiple tissue matrices and translate the NeoChip platform for incorporation into standard universal newborn screening for the diagnosis of congenital cytomegalovirus on dried blood spot samples.",NeoChip for specific and rapid identification of congenital CMV and neonatal HSV infections on minimal sample volume,10050866,R01HD099250,"['Address', 'Advocate', 'Antibiotics', 'Antibodies', 'Antimicrobial Resistance', 'Antiviral Agents', 'Antiviral resistance', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Base Sequence', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Birth', 'Blinded', 'Blood', 'Blood Volume', 'Blood specimen', 'California', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Congenital herpes simplex', 'Consumption', 'Culture Techniques', 'Cytomegalovirus', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disabled Persons', 'Disease', 'Dyes', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Enrollment', 'Epidemiology', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Failure', 'Fingerprint', 'Fluorescence', 'Funding', 'Genome', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Hour', 'Immunoglobulin G', 'Immunoglobulin M', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Infection', 'Investigation', 'Laboratories', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Microbe', 'Modality', 'Modernization', 'Molecular', 'Mothers', 'Neonatal', 'Neonatal Screening', 'Newborn Infant', 'Nucleic Acid Amplification Tests', 'Nucleotides', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Pathogen detection', 'Pathogenicity', 'Patients', 'Perinatal', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Predictive Value', 'Pregnant Women', 'Prevalence', 'RNA', 'Reaction', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Saliva', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Simplexvirus', 'Spottings', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'TimeLine', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Tube', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Update', 'Urine', 'Variant', 'Viral', 'Viral Load result', 'Virus Diseases', 'accurate diagnosis', 'antimicrobial', 'base', 'biobank', 'clinical database', 'clinically relevant', 'congenital cytomegalovirus', 'cost', 'diagnosis standard', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'digital', 'intelligent algorithm', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'intervention program', 'machine learning algorithm', 'melting', 'microbial', 'multidisciplinary', 'neonatal infection', 'neonate', 'next generation sequencing', 'offspring', 'pathogen', 'pathogen genomics', 'pathogenic virus', 'point of care', 'postnatal', 'prevent', 'prognostic', 'prospective', 'rapid diagnosis', 'resistance gene', 'screening program', 'single molecule', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'viral detection']",NICHD,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2020,671761,0.05572986785623268
"An Integrated Multilevel Modeling Framework for Repertoire-Based Diagnostics Immune-repertoire sequence, which consists of an individual's millions of unique antibody and T-cell receptor (TCR) genes, encodes a dynamic and highly personalized record of an individual's state of health. Our long- term goal is to develop the computational models and tools necessary to read this record, to one day be able diagnose diverse infections, autoimmune diseases, cancers, and other conditions directly from repertoire se- quence. The key problem is how to find patterns of specific diseases in repertoire sequence, when repertoires are so complex. Our hypothesis is that a combination of bottom-up (sequence-level) and top-down (systems- level) modeling can reveal these patterns, by encoding repertoires as simple but highly informative models that can be used to build highly sensitive and specific disease classifiers. In preliminary studies, we introduced two new modeling approaches for this purpose: (i) statistical biophysics (bottom-up) and (ii) functional diversity (top-down), and showed their ability to elucidate patterns related to vaccination status (97% accuracy), viral infection, and aging. Building on these studies, we will test our hypothesis through two specific aims: (1) We will develop models and classifiers based on the bottom-up approach, statistical biophysics; and (2) we will de- velop the top-down approach, functional diversity, to improve these classifiers. To achieve these aims, we will use our extensive collection of public immune-repertoire datasets, beginning with 391 antibody and TCR da- tasets we have characterized previously. Our team has deep and complementary expertise in developing computational tools for finding patterns in immune repertoires (Dr. Arnaout) and in the mathematics that under- lie these tools (Dr. Altschul), with additional advice available as needed regarding machine learning (Dr. AlQuraishi). This proposal is highly innovative for how our two new approaches address previous issues in the field. (i) Statistical biophysics uses a powerful machine-learning method called maximum-entropy modeling (MaxEnt), improving on past work by tailoring MaxEnt to learn patterns encoded in the biophysical properties (e.g. size and charge) of the amino acids that make up antibodies/TCRs; these properties ultimately determine what targets antibodies/TCRs can bind, and therefore which sequences are present in different diseases. (ii) Functional diversity fills a key gap in how immunological diversity has been measured thus far, by factoring in whether different antibodies/TCRs are likely to bind the same target. This proposal is highly significant for (i) developing an efficient, accurate, generative, and interpretable machine-learning method for finding diagnostic patterns in repertoire sequence; (ii) applying a robust mathematical framework to the measurement of immuno- logical diversity; (iii) impacting clinical diagnostics; and (iv) adding a valuable new tool for integrative/big-data medicine. The expected outcome of this proposal is an integrated pair of robust and well validated new tools/models for classifying specific disease exposures directly from repertoire sequence. This proposal in- cludes plans to make these tools widely available, to maximize their positive impact across medicine. The proposed research is relevant to public health because B cells/antibodies and T cells play vital roles across such a vast range of health conditions, from infection, to autoimmunity, to cancer, that the ability to de- code what they are doing would be an important step forward for diagnosing these conditions.

"Point-of-care antimicrobial susceptibility testing based on simultaneous tracking of multi-phenotypic features of single bacterial cells ABSTRACT Antibiotic resistance has become a significant public health threat. To combat the problem, a rapid pathogen identification (ID) and antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) technology is needed to provide timely diagno- sis of resistant infections and delivery of accurate antibiotic treatment at primary health-care settings, includ- ing hospitals and point-of-care (POC). The present project aims to develop a point-of-care AST (POCASTTM) technology based on a large-image-volume microscopy technique that enables direct detection of individual bacterial cells in clinical samples without culturing or pathogen isolation, and a machine-learning model that allows fast determination of pathogen and susceptibility. To establish the technology, the project will focus on urinary tract infections (UTIs). UTIs affect millions of people annually, and the pathogens that usually cause UTIs are the organisms that pose the highest threat of antimicrobial resistance, including carbapenem- resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) and extended spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Enterobacteri- aceae. This project will focus on: 1) developing the large-image-volume microscopy and machine learning model for simultaneous tracking of multi-phenotypic features of single bacterial cells directly in patient urine sample, and performing rapid automatic pathogen ID and AST for UTIs; 2) building prototype instrument, and 3) validating the instrument for UTIs using large scale clinical samples. Successful development and validation of the tech- nology will enable precise antibiotic prescription on the same day of patient visit. The project will be carried out by a multidisciplinary team with expertise in biosensors (Biodesign Center for Bioelectronics and Biosensors, ASU), microbiology and infectious diseases (Biodesign Center for Immuno- therapy, Vaccines and Virotherapy, ASU), biomedical instrument development and production (Biosensing Instrument Inc.), and clinical testing (Clinical Microbiology Laboratory, Mayo Clinic). ! PROJECT NARRATIVE This project will develop a culture-independent technology for point-of-care diagnosis of antimicrobial-resistant bacteria in urinary tract infections within 3 hours, by imaging urine samples directly with an innovative large- image-volume imaging technique and analyzing the data with a machine-learning model. Successful devel- opment of the technology will enable precise antibiotic prescriptions and accurate treatment of the patient on the same day of visit. !",Point-of-care antimicrobial susceptibility testing based on simultaneous tracking of multi-phenotypic features of single bacterial cells,9970170,R01AI138993,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Antibiotic Resistance', 'Antibiotic Therapy', 'Antibiotics', 'Antimicrobial Resistance', 'Antimicrobial susceptibility', 'Arizona', 'Bacterial Infections', 'Biosensing Techniques', 'Biosensor', 'Blood Cells', 'Care Technology Points', 'Categories', 'Cells', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Microbiology', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Computer software', 'Crystallization', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Device or Instrument Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Enterobacteriaceae', 'Extended-spectrum β-lactamase', 'Face', 'Growth', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Immunotherapy', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Microbiology', 'Microscope', 'Microscopy', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Motion', 'Optics', 'Organism', 'Pathogen detection', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Pilot Projects', 'Predisposition', 'Primary Health Care', 'Production', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Specificity', 'Speed', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Urinary tract infection', 'Urine', 'Vaccines', 'Validation', 'Virotherapy', 'Visit', 'Work', 'antimicrobial', 'automated algorithm', 'bacterial resistance', 'base', 'carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinically relevant', 'combat', 'density', 'design', 'health care settings', 'image processing', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'light scattering', 'machine learning algorithm', 'multidisciplinary', 'pathogen', 'point of care', 'prototype', 'research clinical testing', 'technology development', 'technology validation']",NIAID,ARIZONA STATE UNIVERSITY-TEMPE CAMPUS,R01,2020,991540,0.055476258874413945
"Estimating Cholera Burden with Cross-sectional Immunologic Data Project Summary/Abstract Cholera is an acute dehydrating diarrheal disease caused by infection with Vibrio cholerae. It is endemic in over 50 countries, affecting up to 3 million people and causing more than 100,000 deaths annually. A renewed global effort to fight cholera is underway, catalyzed by the large on-going epidemic in Haiti and now aided by new generation oral cholera vaccines. Identifying key populations at high risk of cholera is essential to guide these activities. Current methods to estimate cholera burden are largely based on clinical reporting with infrequent microbiological confirmation. These methods are limited by the sporadic nature of outbreaks, poor surveillance infrastructure, and fundamental uncertainties in the number of asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic cases. Improved methods of detecting cholera exposure and risk are urgently needed. Detection of immune responses in serum (serosurveillance) can provide a new avenue for rapid and accurate estimates of cholera exposure and risk. We currently do not understand what immunological and clinical parameters are most predictive of recent exposure, nor whether immune responses in areas with different levels of endemicity are similar. In preliminary studies, we have used machine learning methods on antibody response data from cholera patients in Bangladesh to classify whether individuals had been exposed in the previous 30-, 90-, or 360-days with high sensitivity and specificity. In this application, we propose to use longitudinal antibody response kinetics, from populations with diverse genetic and epidemiologic profiles, paired with novel statistical and machine learning approaches to provide generalizable tools to estimate the incidence of exposure to Vibrio cholerae from cross sectional serosurveys. In Aim 1, we will develop models to estimate the time since exposure to Vibrio cholerae and exposure incidence from cross-sectional antibody profiles and demographic data using previously collected data from a cohort in Bangladesh. These results will allow us to identify the antibodies and demographic factors that are most useful for prediction of time-since-exposure. In Aim 2, we will collect longitudinal antibody data from a cohort of cholera cases and household contacts in Haiti to develop models for estimating exposure incidence from cross-sectional serosurveillance. This cohort will also enable us to compare the models developed for moderate/severe cases and mild/asymptomatic cases. In Aim 3, we will optimize and validate field-adapted methods to measure cholera-specific antibodies, including the use of dried blood spot and lateral flow assays. We will conduct a proof-of-concept cross-sectional serosurvey using these methods in rural Haiti. Upon the completion of these aims, we will have provided a number of new tools for measure of susceptibility to cholera in a population. These tools will have the potential to transform cholera control efforts from the current reactive strategies to proactive ones, with the potential to contribute to disease elimination. Project Narrative Cholera is a diarrheal disease affecting millions of people worldwide each year, with the majority of deaths due to cholera occurring in places with poor disease surveillance infrastructure. To optimize cholera control efforts, accurate estimates of cholera exposure and risk are needed. We propose studies using computational methods to determine how antibody decay data may help us estimate cholera exposure incidence.",Estimating Cholera Burden with Cross-sectional Immunologic Data,9912094,R01AI135115,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Africa', 'Antibodies', 'Antibody Response', 'Area', 'Bangladesh', 'Bangladeshi', 'Biological Assay', 'Blood', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Cholera', 'Cholera Vaccine', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Computer Models', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Country', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Demographic Factors', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diarrhea', 'Disease', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Disease Surveillance', 'Enrollment', 'Epidemic', 'Epidemiology', 'Exposure to', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Haiti', 'Haitian', 'Health care facility', 'Health system', 'Household', 'Immune response', 'Immunologics', 'Immunology', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Infrastructure', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Kinetics', 'Laboratories', 'Lateral', 'Link', 'Logistics', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Microbiology', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Oral', 'Patients', 'Population', 'Populations at Risk', 'Predisposition', 'Reporting', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Rural', 'Sanitation', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Serological', 'Serum', 'Specificity', 'Spottings', 'Standardization', 'Surveillance Methods', 'System', 'Time', 'Translations', 'Uncertainty', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vibrio cholerae', 'Vibrio cholerae O1', 'Vibrio cholerae infection', 'Water', 'age related', 'base', 'cohort', 'diarrheal disease', 'disorder risk', 'fighting', 'high risk', 'improved', 'insight', 'machine learning method', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'predictive modeling', 'statistical and machine learning', 'statistics', 'tool']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,R01,2020,667663,0.021470059069470655
"Precision immunoprofiling to reveal diagnostic biomarkers of latent TB infection PROJECT SUMMARY  Tuberculosis (TB) is among the leading causes of mortality worldwide with an estimated 2 billion individuals currently infected. Latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) is the most common form of TB infection affecting 13 million Americans. While many with LTBI remain asymptomatic, an estimated 10% of immunocompetent patients with LTBI will reactivate to active TB, and will become infectious. LTBI is treatable with a prolonged antibiotic treatment; however, potential side effects motivate the development of new diagnostic approaches that can identify with high specificity patients at the highest risk of reactivation, for who therapy would be most beneficial.  The tuberculin skin test (TST) and interferon-γ release assays (IGRAs) are commonly used for TB and LTBI screening. Both tests provide good measures of TB exposure; however, neither is effective at diagnosing LTBI (positive predictive values <5%). Moreover, neither provide any prognostic stratification based upon reactivation risk. Both the TST and IGRAs probe immunological memory to TB-related antigen challenges and we hypothesize that a more nuanced and personalized approach to monitoring immune responses to both TB- specific and non-specific antigens might reveal new approaches to LTBI diagnosis and patient stratification.  Enabling a new, individualized approach to LTBI diagnostics, we propose to combine high throughput, multiplexed inflammatory biomarker detection strategies and powerful bioinformatics tools that allow for the identification of previously obscured multi-marker diagnostic signatures of LTBI status and reactivation risk. Silicon photonic microring resonators are an enabling technology for biomarker analysis due to their intrinsic scalability and multiplexing capabilities. Applied to the detection of cytokine panels, this technology supports the rapid immune profiling of individual samples under both TB-specific and non-specific antigen stimulation conditions. Machine learning algorithms will be utilized to analyze the resulting dense data streams to facilitate selection of key diagnostic signatures forming the basis for predictive model development and deployment. This powerful analytical combination is supplemented by deep expertise in clinical diagnosis and treatment of TB and LTBI, and an enabling collaboration and connection to subjects from an international location with high TB burden and exposure in a healthcare worker population subjected to regularly-scheduled and repeated LTBI screening.  The resulting diagnostic workflow and machine learning feature selection approaches will reveal multiplexed biomarker signatures that have strong positive predictive correlation with LTBI status (+ or -). This approach will also further stratify LTBI+ subjects on the basis of reactivation potential, thus providing a fundamentally new approach to identifying subjects that are most likely to benefit from therapeutic intervention. The end result of this project will be a new precision medicine-based diagnostic strategy that is vastly superior to the current state-of-the-art and offers the potential to transform current clinical practice. PROJECT NARRATIVE Tuberculosis (TB) affects an estimated one third of the world’s population and an asymptomatic latent state of tuberculosis infection (LTBI) is extremely common. Unfortunately, there are not any good clinical tests that can definitely diagnose LTBI, making it difficult to identify patients that should be treated to prevent reactivation to active TB, which is infectious. We will integrate cutting edge measurement technologies and machine learning bioinformatic approaches to identify and test multiplexed biomarker signatures that will transform clinical TB management by enabling personalized diagnosis of LTBI and the stratification of individuals with the highest potential for reactivation.",Precision immunoprofiling to reveal diagnostic biomarkers of latent TB infection,10006790,R01AI141591,"['Affect', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Antibiotic Therapy', 'Antibiotics', 'Antigens', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Cytokine Network Pathway', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Eligibility Determination', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health Personnel', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immunocompetent', 'Immunologic Markers', 'Immunologic Memory', 'Immunologic Monitoring', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Inflammatory', 'Informatics', 'Interferons', 'International', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Patients', 'Peripheral', 'Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell', 'Plasma', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Prevention strategy', 'Regimen', 'Residual state', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Schedule', 'Silicon', 'Specificity', 'Stratification', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Translations', 'Tuberculin Test', 'Tuberculosis', 'Whole Blood', 'antigen challenge', 'base', 'bioinformatics tool', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinical practice', 'cytokine', 'data streams', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'feature selection', 'high risk', 'immune function', 'immunoregulation', 'improved', 'individual variation', 'latent infection', 'machine learning algorithm', 'model development', 'monocyte', 'mortality', 'novel diagnostics', 'novel strategies', 'patient stratification', 'personalized approach', 'personalized diagnostics', 'photonics', 'precision medicine', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'prognostic', 'prospective', 'response', 'screening', 'side effect', 'targeted treatment', 'tool', 'treatment strategy', 'tuberculosis treatment']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2020,722295,0.04797789291304337
"Automated Surveillance of Postoperative Infections (ASPIN) PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Our long term goal is to reduce postoperative infections. We will start by developing a system to accurately and completely identify their occurrence by applying machine learning algorithms to electronic health record (EHR) data. We will utilize a comprehensive audit and feedback system to create reports of risk-adjusted rates and specific details of postoperative infectious complications that are shared with surgeons and other healthcare providers to facilitate their awareness. We call this system the Automated Surveillance of Postoperative Infections (ASPIN). ASPIN will be piloted in the four major hospitals of the University of Colorado Health system (UCHealth) with a combined surgical volume of approximately 80,000 patients per year. We expect this will supersede the costly and laborious manual partial sampling of postoperative infectious complications which is current utilized by many hospitals. Specific Aim 1. Expand and enhance models for preoperative risk prediction and postoperative identification of surgical infections using EHR and ACS NSQIP data from patients who underwent operations at four UCHealth hospitals.  Specific Aim 1a) Enhance previously-developed models for identification of postoperative infections by controlling Type-I errors via “knockoffs,” a recent statistical innovation for high dimensional model selection using false discovery rate correction. Specific Aim 1b) Deploy natural language processing methods using EHR text reports of these patients to identify additional indicators of postoperative infections and further refine the models. Specific Aim 1c) Create preoperative risk models for infection using EHR data - similar to the models  implemented in the AHRQ-funded Surgical Risk Preoperative Assessment System - but that do not require  additional data entry by the health care providers. Specific Aim 2. From the beginning of the study, develop ASPIN with input from an Advisory Committee composed of administrators and surgeons from all four UCHealth hospitals. Additional feedback from surgeons will be obtained through focus groups and semi-structured interviews at several steps of ASPIN development and implementation planning. Specific Aim 3. A pilot implementation of ASPIN will utilize the RE-AIM framework to guide and examine the preliminary effectiveness and feasibility of ASPIN at UCHealth. We will recruit 30 surgeon participants from all four UCHealth hospitals to use ASPIN, and we will evaluate the reach, effectiveness, adoption, and implementation of ASPIN.  This research responds to AHRQ priorities by utilizing existing data to develop a learning health system with a distinct focus on improving surveillance and reporting of postoperative healthcare-associated infections. PROJECT NARRATIVE Infectious complications of surgery (surgical site infection, pneumonia, urinary tract infection, and sepsis) are common, occurring in about 8% of major surgical procedures, and are costly. Currently used surveillance techniques require extensive human participation, resulting in delays of at least six months before the data are available to care providers, and the data represent only a small sample of all operations. We propose to develop a machine learning-based, near real-time recurring audit and feedback system for identification of postoperative infections that will inform providers about infectious outcomes of their patients.",Automated Surveillance of Postoperative Infections (ASPIN),10117905,R01HS027417,[' '],AHRQ,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,R01,2020,392599,-0.004264813683347536
"Statistical methods for real-time forecasts of infectious disease: dynamic time-series and machine learning approaches PROJECT SUMMARY The past decade of biomedical research has borne witness to rapid growth in data and computational methods. A fundamental challenge for the scientific community in the 21st century is learning how to turn this deluge of data into evidence that can inform decision-making about improving health and preventing illness at the individual and population levels. The emerging field of real-time infectious disease forecasting is a prime example of a research area with great potential for leveraging modern analytical methods to maximize the impact on public health. Infectious diseases exact an enormous toll on global health each year. Improved real- time forecasts of infectious disease outbreaks can inform targeted intervention and prevention strategies, such as increased healthcare staffing or vector control measures. However we currently have a limited understanding of the best ways to integrate these types of forecasts into real-time public health decision- making. The central research activities of this project are (1) to develop and validate a suite of robust, real-time statistical prediction models for infectious diseases, (2) we will develop and evaluate an ensemble time-series prediction methodology for integrating multiple prediction models into a single forecast, and (3) to develop a collaborative platform for dissemination and evaluation of predictions by different research teams. Additionally, we will develop a suite of open-source educational modules to train researchers and public health officials in developing, validating, and implementing time-series forecasting, with a focus on real-time infectious disease applications.

"Designing neutralization antibodies against Sars-Cov-2 Project Summary COVID-19 has become a worldwide pandemic whose rapid spread and mortality rate threatens millions of lives and the global economic system. Developing effective treatment such as neutralization antibodies is an urgent need. We propose here to develop a new method to design antibodies strongly bind to the SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain (RBD) that is necessary for viral entrance to human cells. We will develop a novel approach that combines directed evolution, deep sequencing and interpretable neural network models to efficiently identify strong and specific antibodies. This method will allow analyzing large sequencing data sets of antibody variants against the SARS-CoV-2 RBD in order to derive superior binders that do not exist in the original library. Iteration through directed evolution and computational design will efficiently identify neutralization antibody candidates that can be used as potent therapeutics to treat COVID-19.

"Signature of profiling and staging the progression of TB from infection to disease. Project Summary/Abstract Tuberculosis (TB) is the leading cause of infectious disease mortality worldwide. Nearly one-third of the world's population is infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB). More than 10.4 million new cases of active TB disease develop annually, leading to 1.4 million deaths due to the disease each year. Despite widespread efforts to study of the etiology of disease, the development and global introduction of an effective treatment regimen, and sensitive diagnostics for identifying pulmonary TB disease, efforts to control this pandemic are falling short, largely due to a lack of a clear understanding of the pathogenic progression from MTB infection to active clinical disease. In addition, Existing gene expression studies have presented more than three dozen biomarkers to predict TB related outcomes such as identifying active TB disease, predicting risk of treatment failure, or predicting which patients will progress to active TB disease. These have been developed and refined using multiple technologies and using a diverse set of computational and machine learning prediction algorithms, but most are focused on two-class comparison (e.g. TB vs. LTBI). In this proposal, we propose to compile and harmonize dozens of existing RNA-sequencing datasets for TB outcomes. We will use these compiled data to develop a computational platform and interactive visualization tools for profiling TB signatures across all existing datasets. We plan to use this curated data and software platform to develop a more refined molecular map of progression from TB infection to active disease. Consistent with a recently presented models for TB disease development, we hypothesize that we will be able to identify gene expression patterns associated with stages on the TB disease spectrum, including: uninfected or eliminated infection, controlled or truly latent infection, future progressors or incipient disease, subclinical TB disease, and active clinical TB disease. We believe that existing gene expression data and signatures will allow us to identify distinct transcriptional profiles for each stage, and hence develop a multi-class machine learning approach for classifying patients into their corresponding stage. Overall, this proposal contributes to the field by compiling existing gene expression data and developing a wholistic map of TB progression from infection to active disease. In addition, we will provide a curated dataset and metadata in an accessible format for more than three dozen existing TB studies, and allow others to access and explore these data through a user-friendly profiling platform.

"Antibodies as Drugs ABSTRACT Support is requested for a Keystone Symposia conference entitled Antibodies as Drugs organized by Drs. Pierre Bruhns, Patrick C. Wilson, Esther Breij and David P. Humphreys. The conference will be held in Whistler, British Columbia from January 27-30, 2021. Therapeutic antibodies continue to largely populate the list of top biologic drugs. They revolutionize the treatment of pathologies falling into major disease areas, which include cancer, chronic inflammatory diseases, allergy and infectious diseases. As more antibodies are being tested to treat an expanding number of pathologies, there has also been a concomitant increase in the frequency of resistance and escape mechanisms. Thus, researchers are exploring alternative concepts to prevent unresponsiveness or treat resistant patients. Therefore, not only are new methodological and technological advances being developed, paradigm-shifting concepts are being developed in order to face these challenges. This conference in the Keystone Symposia series on Antibodies as Drugs aims to present the state-of-the-art in antibody therapeutics, repertoires and deep learning, bispecific antibodies and engineering. This conference will provide a forum for extensive interactions between investigators from both industry and academia. Goals of this conference include discussion of recent breakthroughs in identifying therapeutics from patients, understanding vaccination and mode of delivery, modalities for half-life extensions and involvement of complement in antibody mode of action. It is anticipated that research in the field will showcase the rise of bispecific antibodies and highlight the technologies to develop them, improve their functionalities, and boost clinical efficacies, particularly in immune-oncology. PROJECT NARRATIVE The success of early antibody approaches has been tremendous and now they have revolutionized treatment for many major disease areas, such as cancer, chronic inflammatory diseases, allergy and infectious diseases. However, as more antibodies are being tested to treat an expanding number of pathologies, then more resistance and escape mechanisms are being found, forcing scientists to search for alternative concepts to prevent unresponsiveness or treat resistant patients. Therefore, this conference will gather scientists from many different disciplines, including structural and cellular immunology, biology, engineering, chemistry and medicine, to share ideas and help develop novel antibody therapeutics.",Antibodies as Drugs,10071067,R13AI154980,"['Academia', 'Antibodies', 'Area', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Bispecific Antibodies', 'British Columbia', 'Cellular Immunology', 'Chemistry', 'Collaborations', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Complement', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Educational workshop', 'Engineering', 'Face', 'Goals', 'Half-Life', 'Hypersensitivity', 'Immunooncology', 'Industry', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Life Extension', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Modality', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic antibodies', 'Vaccination', 'antibody engineering', 'career', 'chronic inflammatory disease', 'clinical efficacy', 'clinical practice', 'deep learning', 'falls', 'improved', 'insight', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'posters', 'prevent', 'resistance frequency', 'success', 'symposium']",NIAID,KEYSTONE SYMPOSIA,R13,2020,11500,0.019315389080766368
"Development of a Universal Influenza Vaccine ABSTRACT Influenza virus (flu) ranks highest in disease burden of all infectious diseases as measured in disability-adjusted life years. Seasonal epidemics cause 200,000-500,000 worldwide deaths annually. The total economic burden of seasonal flu is estimated to range from approximately $26B to $87B each year in the US in terms of direct medical expenses and lost work and productivity. Additionally, at least six known flu pandemics have become global human catastrophes, most notably the Spanish Flu pandemic of 1918, which killed 3-5% of the world’s population. Any reduction in the infection rate, transmission, and severity of flu infection would greatly reduce our healthcare expenditures and improve the quality of life for millions of people every year. The current vaccines are formulated annually based on predictions of which circulating flu strains may be prevalent in a given season. The effectiveness of these vaccines varies from year to year based on the circulation of unexpected antigenic variants and other factors. Vaccine design is complicated the by the multiplicity of flu strains, each with rapidly-evolving dominant antigen epitopes (“decoy” epitopes) that largely stimulate strain- restricted immunity. One strategy for rational antigen design, termed Immune Refocusing Technology (IRT), involves introducing mutations that reduce the immunogenicity of these decoy epitopes thus shifting the immune response to target more widely-conserved subdominant epitopes. BMI has previously applied this IRT approach with some notable successes to other viral antigens (e.g. HRV and the RSV F protein), and we now focus on the major flu surface antigen glycoprotein HA using H1, H3, and B vaccine strains as parental antigens. The anticipated effort to design a suitably modified antigen would ordinarily involve a protracted process of trial-and-error testing of many potential candidates. However, we have recently developed the ANATOPE automated B cell epitope prediction software package with algorithm parameters tuned using methods in artificial intelligence. Our algorithm identifies epitopes with a significantly higher success rate than previously available prediction programs. This breakthrough allows us to assign immunogenicity “strength” scores to particular antigen surface patches and will further guide and accelerate the design of mutant antigens that refocus the immune response to cross-strain conserved epitopes. In this application, we propose to engineer and test the immunogenicity of rationally-designed HA antigens containing mutations that both 1) dampen the immunogenicity of dominant strain-restricted decoy epitopes and 2) enhance the immunogenicity of conserved subdominant epitopes associated with broadly neutralizing antibodies. Follow- up studies will assess the rationally-designed antigens in a ferret challenge study and prepare the approach for translation into humans as a universal vaccine that does not require annual reformulation. NARRATIVE Influenza is among the most important pathogens in terms of negative impact upon human health and healthcare expense. The current seasonal vaccines have a mixed record in terms of preventing illness and death. Development of improved vaccines is complicated by the rapid antigenic evolution of circulating viruses and the strain-restricted protections developed by our immune systems. In this proposal, we combine two novel technologies to develop universal influenza vaccines. The first, the Immune Refocusing Technology, is used to alter antibody binding sites, epitopes, such that the immune system can produce a broadened, cross-strain protective response. The second, a computational B cell epitope analysis program called ANATOPE, is used to guide the rational design of antigenic mutants bearing amino acid substitutions that stimulate improved immune responses. This project will focus on improving the breadth of protection stimulated by the three major components of the seasonal vaccine to reduce the need for annual reformulations.

"Merging Temporal Changes in Clinical Informatics, Transcriptomics, and Cytokine Profiles to Understand the Host Response to Bacteremia As an ICU physician and an immunologist, I have devoted my research career to understanding sepsis,  a disease that affects nearly 2 million people annually in the USA. Sepsis is a life-threatening  condition that arises when the body's response to infection injures its own tissues. Great strides  have been made towards improving the clinical care of the septic patient, but the mortality rate  remains >20% for several reasons: First, each sepsis-causing pathogen, be it bacterial, viral, or  fungal, carries its own virulence factors that affect the host response, but unfortunately, much  research has focused on studying septic patients as a group, rather than distinguishing patients  based on microbiologic cause. Second, researchers often study patients once they manifest  sepsis-induced organ failure yet many people sustain infections due to common sepsis  pathogens, like Staphylococcus aureus, but never develop sepsis; understanding the ""appropriate""  response to a pathogen is critical to understanding the ""inappropriate"" response of  sepsis. Finally, much sepsis research occurs in silos; clinician researchers focus on the  electronic medical record, while basic scientists analyze biologic data. Too often, these  groups do not collaborate to share information, even though understanding the biologic  significance of clinical data may be of great value. To address these issues, I propose a unique  approach to understand the host response to infection that incorporates both biologic data and  clinical electronic medical record (EMR) data from patients with S. aureus bacteremia.  By limiting analysis of the host response to infections caused by a single pathogen at a single  site, we can control for the variability induced by pathogen-specific factors. In addition,  by studying all patients with S. aureus bacteremia, and not simply those patients with  sepsis, we can understand both the appropriate host response as well as the inappropriate host  response that characterizes the development of sepsis. With our bank of samples collected from S.  aureus bacteremia patients we will analyze both cellular mRNA transcripts and plasma  protein/cytokine levels, collected at different time points from each patient. We will  combine the results of these analyses with clinical data found in the EMR to provide a correlation  between the biology of the host response and its clinical manifestations. Our per-patient  data, then, will have unprecedented granularity which we can then use to apply machine learning  techniques to identify multi-faceted endotypes that predict outcomes (such as mortality). Once we  have built these endotype models, we will validate them using pilot data collected from newly  enrolled patients with either S. aureus or E. coli bacteremia. This approach will allow  us to identify factors common to the dysregulated host response across all infections, as well as  those that may be specific to the type of infection. Understanding both the  appropriate and the inappropriate host response to infection, and understanding which  aspects of the host response are pathogen-specific (and which are not) will allow development  of novel therapies for this devastating disease. The mortality rate due to severe sepsis exceeds 20%, yet in spite of 3 decades of research, we  still have a very limited understanding of the dysregulated host response that drives  this mortality. I will use my experience as a PhD-trained immunologist and ICU physician to  study the host response to the two most common causes of bacteremia in hospitalized patients, S.  aureus and E. coli. Understanding both appropriate and dysregulated host responses to infections as  manifested in both biological and clinical data will allow me to develop precision therapy to treat  this deadly disease.","Merging Temporal Changes in Clinical Informatics, Transcriptomics, and Cytokine Profiles to Understand the Host Response to Bacteremia",10022505,R03HL148295,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Allergic', 'Award', 'Bacteremia', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Blood', 'Blood specimen', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Consent', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Enrollment', 'Escherichia coli', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression', 'Goals', 'Hour', 'Immune', 'Immune Targeting', 'Immune response', 'Immunologist', 'Infection', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Leukocytes', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Messenger RNA', 'Microbiology', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Organ', 'Organ failure', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Plasma', 'Plasma Proteins', 'Precision therapeutics', 'Proteins', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Sepsis', 'Site', 'Staphylococcus aureus', 'Subgroup', 'Supportive care', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Transcript', 'Validation', 'Viral', 'Virulence Factors', 'Work', 'base', 'biobank', 'career', 'clinical care', 'clinically significant', 'comorbidity', 'cytokine', 'experience', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'insight', 'machine learning method', 'mortality', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'outcome prediction', 'pathogen', 'patient subsets', 'personalized therapeutic', 'prospective', 'response', 'septic', 'septic patients', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics']",NHLBI,KAISER FOUNDATION RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R03,2020,79000,0.025470375834198155
"Enhanced Detection System for Healthcare-Associated Transmission of Infection ABSTRACT Despite recent progress in reducing the incidence of healthcare-associated infections (HAIs), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimated that 722,000 HAIs occurred in U.S. acute care hospitals in 2011, resulting in 75,000 deaths. Current methods for detecting outbreaks in hospitals are rudimentary and likely to miss some outbreaks altogether and result in substantial delays in detection of others. There are two major developments in healthcare that have the potential to revolutionize how healthcare associated outbreaks of bacterial pathogens are identified and controlled in hospitals. First, the Affordable Care Act mandates use of the electronic medical record (EMR), which has led to its widespread use in healthcare. Second, the costs of bacterial whole genome sequencing (WGS) have declined substantially, which is making its use by infection programs increasingly feasible. In this application, we propose to establish and evaluate the impact of the Enhanced Detection System for Healthcare Association Transmission (EDS-HAT) at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC). EDS-HAT uses a combination of WGS and analysis of the EMR for enhanced outbreak detection. Our specific aims are to 1a): Determine the utility of EDS-HAT to identify HAT that is not identified through routine infection prevention practice, 1b): Improve the efficiency and reduce the cost of EDS-HAT by using the EMR to restrict the use of WGS, 2a): Measure reductions in HAIs following implementation of EDS-HAT, and 2b): Estimate the number of infections and deaths prevented and healthcare costs averted by EDS-HAT. For Aim 1a, EDS-HAT will be performed retrospectively while routine infection prevention practice (requests for molecular typing when an outbreak is suspected) continues, thus allowing a direct comparison of the two approaches. For Aim 1b, we will improve the efficiency and reduce the cost of EDS-HAT by using machine learning and data mining of the EMR to select isolates for WGS. For Aim 2a, we will monitor changes in HAI rates both before and after implementation of EDS-HAT in real time, which will occur at the beginning of year 3. Finally, for Aim 2b, we will perform clinical and budget impact analyses to determine the overall impact of EDS-HAT. To accomplish these aims, we have assembled a team with expertise in infectious diseases, outbreak investigation, infection prevention, microbial genomics and genomic epidemiology, machine learning and data mining, economic analysis and modeling, epidemiology, and biostatistics. EDS-HAT will likely lead to substantial reductions in infections, deaths, and healthcare costs and can serve as a model for how HAT is detected in hospitals. PROJECT NARRATIVE Outbreak detection in most hospitals uses outdated methods. The declining costs of whole genome sequencing (WGS) of bacterial pathogens and the wide-spread use of the electronic medical record (EMR) provide a unique opportunity to enhance outbreak detection in hospitals and therefore reduce the number of infections. Accordingly, we propose to establish the Enhanced Detection System for Healthcare Association Transmission (EDS-HAT), which uses routine WGS of bacterial pathogens and machine learning and data mining of the EMR to dramatically increase capacity to detect healthcare-associated outbreaks.",Enhanced Detection System for Healthcare-Associated Transmission of Infection,9984252,R01AI127472,"['Acinetobacter baumannii', 'Affordable Care Act', 'Bacterial Infections', 'Biometry', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Cessation of life', 'Charge', 'Clinical', 'Clostridium difficile', 'Code', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Cost Savings', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Economic Models', 'Enterobacter cloacae', 'Enterococcus faecalis', 'Enterococcus faecium', 'Epidemiology', 'Escherichia coli', 'Event', 'Exposure to', 'Extended-spectrum β-lactamase', 'Genomics', 'Geographic Locations', 'Health Care Costs', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hospitals', 'Incidence', 'Infection', 'Infection prevention', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Investigation', 'Klebsiella aerogenes', 'Klebsiella oxytoca', 'Klebsiella pneumoniae', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Microbiology', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Nosocomial Infections', 'Patients', 'Period Analysis', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Presbyterian Church', 'Prevention', 'Prevention program', 'Procedures', 'Pseudomonas aeruginosa', 'Records', 'Research', 'Source', 'Time', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Vancomycin resistant enterococcus', 'acute care', 'bacterial genome sequencing', 'base', 'budget impact', 'cost', 'data mining', 'economic evaluation', 'enteric pathogen', 'foodborne outbreak', 'genome analysis', 'genome sequencing', 'genomic epidemiology', 'health care settings', 'healthcare-associated infections', 'improved', 'infection rate', 'innovation', 'meetings', 'methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus', 'microbial genomics', 'pathogen', 'pathogenic bacteria', 'prevent', 'programs', 'prospective', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'virtual', 'whole genome']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2020,728162,0.047270506818474146
"Host Proteomic Biosignatures for a Urine-based Diagnosis of Pulmonary Tuberculosis in Children PROJECT ABSTRACT Tuberculosis (TB) is a leading cause of mortality in children worldwide. Difficulty in obtaining sputum and a low sputum bacillary load are major barriers to diagnosis, and necessitate the development of a non-sputum, biomarker-based assay for childhood intrathoracic TB disease. Host biomarker discovery for childhood TB requires a greater focus on downstream proteins and their post-translational modifications (PTMs) that are more likely to be specific to a disease phenotype and can be more easily translated into a point-of-care test. With the support of this K23 award, Dr. Devan Jaganath will identify a host proteomic biosignature in urine that can achieve the goal accuracy for a triage and/or diagnostic test for pulmonary TB in children. To complete this objective, he will leverage an ongoing prospective cohort of symptomatic children being evaluated for intrathoracic TB in Kampala, Uganda, with the extensive proteomic facilities available at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF). In Aim 1, he will perform targeted mass spectrometry on urine samples from children with confirmed vs. unlikely TB, and examine the abundance and ubiquitylation of 10 host proteins that have prior evidence of specific interactions with M. tuberculosis (Mtb) proteins as candidate biomarkers. In Aim 2, he will use shotgun mass spectrometry on the urine samples to identify all host proteins and their PTMs that can differentiate TB status as novel biomarkers, and perform pathway analysis to determine the subset with functional relevance to Mtb pathogenesis. In Aim 3, he will apply machine learning analyses to identify the smallest combination of biomarkers that can achieve the target accuracy thresholds for a triage and/or diagnostic test for intrathoracic TB disease. He will then evaluate the performance of promising biosignatures in an independent, prospectively enrolled test set. Through this approach, Dr. Jaganath seeks to optimize biomarker discovery for childhood TB diagnosis by coupling prospective clinical cohorts with a targeted and untargeted high-throughput approach to comprehensively examine non-sputum samples for host biomarkers for children. Dr. Jaganath's career goal is to be a physician scientist who translates non-sputum biomarkers into clinical tools that can improve the care of children with TB. To support his path to independence, the proposed work will be paired with a dedicated, multidisciplinary mentorship team and training in international pediatric TB biomarker studies, bioinformatics for proteomic analysis, and machine learning. UCSF is an outstanding environment that is committed to junior investigators with extensive resources for research and career development, and Mulago National Referral Hospital in Uganda is a leader in pediatric TB research, and has the established infrastructure for ongoing enrollment and sample collection. The findings will support an NIH R01 application to validate the biomarkers and biosignatures in large, diverse cohorts in comparison to existing non-sputum diagnostics. Thus, the K23 award will provide Dr. Jaganath with the critical mentorship, training, resources and experience to become an independent investigator who can make important contributions to the field of childhood TB. PROJECT NARRATIVE More than half of the estimated tuberculosis (TB) disease cases in children worldwide have not been reported to the health system, and 96% of pediatric TB deaths are in children not started on treatment. The proposed project seeks to address the key barriers in diagnosing pulmonary TB in children through discovery of a host proteomic biosignature in urine. The findings will be relevant to the public health efforts to reduce the burden of TB in children and will support the development of a non-invasive, non-sputum based assay for childhood TB disease at the point-of-care.",Host Proteomic Biosignatures for a Urine-based Diagnosis of Pulmonary Tuberculosis in Children,10038668,K23HL153581,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Bedside Testings', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'California', 'Cessation of life', 'Child', 'Child Care', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Consensus', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Sensitivity', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Goals', 'Health system', 'Hospital Referrals', 'Human', 'Immune response', 'Immunoassay', 'Infection', 'Infrastructure', 'International', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measures', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Mycobacterium tuberculosis', 'Nested Case-Control Study', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Post-Translational Protein Processing', 'Prospective cohort', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Proteomics', 'Public Health', 'Pulmonary Tuberculosis', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'San Francisco', 'Scientist', 'Shotguns', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'Sputum', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Triage', 'Tuberculosis', 'Uganda', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Urine', 'Work', 'accurate diagnosis', 'base', 'biomarker discovery', 'biomarker panel', 'biosignature', 'candidate marker', 'career', 'career development', 'cohort', 'disease phenotype', 'experience', 'improved', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'point of care', 'pre-clinical', 'prospective', 'protein biomarkers', 'research and development', 'sample collection', 'tool']",NHLBI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",K23,2020,209400,0.022939770421122163
"Sepsis phenotypes at risk for infections caused by multidrug resistant Gram-negative bacilli: elucidating the impact of sepsis definition and patient case mix on prediction performance PROJECT ABSTRACT Sepsis is a devastating syndrome that represents a leading cause of death, morbidity, and healthcare costs. Its impact is amplified by rising rates of antimicrobial resistance. Improving sepsis outcomes primarily results from prescribing timely antibiotics based on the estimated risk of multidrug resistance (MDR). Previous models grossly overestimated the MDR risk and exacerbated the escalating rates of antimicrobial resistance and excess mortality. The overall goal of this proposed K08 research is to identify common sepsis phenotypes that will enable better prescribing practices and standardized comparisons across hospitals, which will help practicing clinicians, researchers, healthcare institutions, and policy makers. These themes correlate with NIGMS's interest in finding innovative methods and leveraging big data to improve sepsis outcomes. Our three specific aims reflect these goals: (1) establish resistance thresholds for MDR Gram- negative bacilli (GNB) that cause sepsis, (2) assess the impact of sepsis definition on the performance of risk prediction models for MDR GNB, and (3) identify sepsis phenotypes at high risk for MDR GNB in a well-balanced cohort and assess the impact of case mix on risk prediction model performance. We will mathematically derive resistance thresholds that link population resistance rates to individual patient risk of death in sepsis caused by MDR GNB, assess factors that impact prediction performance, and incorporate rich clinical data from 15 hospitals in our healthcare system to identify stable common sepsis phenotypes. Dr. Vazquez Guillamet has training in Infectious Diseases and Critical Care Medicine and experience in antimicrobial resistance in critically ill patients. This proposal will build on her clinical work and previous research experience in finding innovative methods to solve challenging problems at the intersection of infectious diseases and critical care medicine. Dr. Vazquez Guillamet has six career objectives: (1) pursue advanced training in clinical epidemiology; (2) acquire skills in advanced linear regression and multilevel modeling; (3) learn supervised machine learning methods; (4) acquire skills in big data management in healthcare and methods to handle missing data; (5) improve scientific communication, grantsmanship, and leadership, and (6) participate in training in the responsible conduct of research. She will achieve these goals through didactic coursework, hands-on research experience, and active mentoring from experts in Infectious Diseases, Critical Care Medicine, and applied clinical informatics. She will continue to develop innovative methods to mitigate the antimicrobial resistance crisis, especially in critically ill patients, and become an analytics translator at the intersection of clinical medicine and clinical applied informatics. The fertile research environment at Washington University in St. Louis, the experienced mentorship team, and a well-crafted career development plan will enable Dr. Vazquez Guillamet to achieve her long-term goal of becoming an independently funded clinician-investigator utilizing big data to develop applications for risk prediction, surveillance, and outcome comparisons in antimicrobial resistance and sepsis. PROJECT NARRATIVE The significant burden of sepsis augmented by the escalating rates of antimicrobial resistance has incited many national performance improvement initiatives. Research efforts have focused on predicting patients at risk for infections caused by multidrug resistant pathogens but existing models have led to risk overestimation thus promoting indiscriminate antimicrobial use and further fueling the emergence of resistance. The candidate, Dr. Vazquez Guillamet has focused on innovative ways to assess the impact of antimicrobial resistance and to develop generalizable useful risk prediction models. The current proposed research expands her previous work with the overall goal to develop clinical decision support tools that will improve antibiotic prescribing practices and will allow valid, case-mix adjusted comparisons across hospitals in terms of resistance prevalence rates and antimicrobial use.",Sepsis phenotypes at risk for infections caused by multidrug resistant Gram-negative bacilli: elucidating the impact of sepsis definition and patient case mix on prediction performance,10106044,K08GM140310,"['American', 'Antibiotic Therapy', 'Antibiotics', 'Antimicrobial Resistance', 'Bacillus', 'Big Data', 'Case Mixes', 'Cause of Death', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Clinical Research', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communication', 'Critical Care', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Empiricism', 'Environment', 'Etiology', 'Excess Mortality', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hospitals', 'Infection', 'Informatics', 'Institution', 'Leadership', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Linear Regressions', 'Link', 'Mathematics', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Multi-Drug Resistance', 'National Institute of General Medical Sciences', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Policy Maker', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Probability', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Risk', 'Risk Estimate', 'Risk stratification', 'Role', 'Sepsis', 'Standardization', 'Surveys', 'Syndrome', 'Testing', 'Theoretical model', 'Time', 'Training', 'Uncertainty', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Washington', 'Work', 'antimicrobial', 'attributable mortality', 'base', 'big data management', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical care', 'clinical database', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical epidemiology', 'cohort', 'combat', 'experience', 'hands on research', 'high risk', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'infection risk', 'innovation', 'interest', 'machine learning method', 'mortality', 'mortality risk', 'multi-drug resistant pathogen', 'multilevel analysis', 'novel', 'personalized risk prediction', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive tools', 'primary outcome', 'response', 'responsible research conduct', 'risk prediction model', 'septic patients', 'skills', 'supervised learning', 'support tools', 'tool', 'user-friendly']",NIGMS,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,K08,2020,167942,0.0039433133327849085
"Defining humoral correlates of immunity against COVID-19 Since 2002, several coronaviruses have emerged able to cause severe respiratory disease, however no vaccine is available to prevent these rapidly spreading pathogens. Vaccine design has specifically lagged due to our lack of understanding of the correlates of immunity against these pathogens. Both cellular and humoral immune responses have been implicated in resolution of disease, but to date only the passive transfer of antibodies has been shown to confer complete protection in mice. Interestingly, the transfer of both “neutralizing” and non- neutralizing antibodies have shown protective efficacy, highlighting the role of multiple humoral mechanisms in limiting viral infection/spread. The precise mechanism of action of these antibodies that have the most profound impact on limiting disease is currently unclear, but if elucidated could provide critical insights for the development of effective vaccines against COVID-19 and other coronaviruses. Thus, here we aim to take a systematic approach to dissect and define both the polyclonal and monoclonal mechanisms by which antibodies confer protection against COVID-19. Specifically, samples from DNA- and adenovirus 26 (Ad26)- COVID-19 Spike protein (S) immunized animals, that will be challenged with COVID-19, will be comprehensively profiled using Systems Serology, to define the functional humoral immune responses linked to protection from infection/disease in mice, ferrets, and macaques. Machine learning modeling will be employed to discern key immune response features that translate usefully across these diverse animal contexts. Coupled to a novel systems-Fc-engineering approach, the COVID-19 CR3022 monoclonal antibody will be engineered to specifically define the Fc-effector functions that provide the greatest impact on limiting disease. Collectively, these studies will not only define correlates of immunity across vaccines and species, but also provide mechanistic insights into the precise mechanisms by which antibodies may confer protection in the context of future vaccines.

"Reducing the incidence of febrile neutropenia in cancer patients treated with chemotherapy with PointCheck: a portable non-invasive neutropenia analyzer Every year in the US, 650,000 cancer patients are treated with chemotherapy. As a side effect,  their neutrophil counts (number of white blood cells that aid in fighting infections) become low  (referred to as neutropenia) and expose them to febrile neutropenia (FN) which are episodes  of serious infection that entail costly hospitalization and sometimes death. If  neutropenia is detected early, FN can be avoided through timely delivery of  prophylactic antibiotics or growth stimulating factors. Currently, neutrophil measurements require  visits to healthcare centers. This increases infection risk (as measurements are taken infrequently  and low counts may not be detected before infections ensue) and reduces chemotherapy efficacy (as  chemotherapy levels are kept at the lower end of frequency and dose for safety). We aim to overcome  this limitation with PointCheck, a noninvasive neutrophil test that can be used frequently in  local health centers or at home, enabling physicians to minimize infections and  personalize chemotherapy planning. The basis for our technology is noninvasive optical imaging of  microcirculation in nailfold capillaries. We conducted a pilot clinical study where trained   nurses used PointCheck to acquire data from 46 chemotherapy patients. By manually analyzing  a training dataset (N=38 measurements from 16 patients), we built a labeled dataset of flow gaps in  the microcirculation that can be considered proxies of neutrophils and demonstrated their number  can be used to distinguish baseline patients (>500 neutrophils/mm3) from grade IV neutropenic ones  (<500/mm3). However, the need for manual analysis makes the technology inaccessible to patients on  its current status. With support from SBIR Phase I, we will (a) develop algorithms that automatize  the manual data processing workflow employed on our training set, (b) test those algorithms on our  acquired and unanalyzed testing database (N=103 measurements from 30 patients) and (c) generate  additional performance data including further intermediate neutrophil ranges (>500 and <1,500  neutrophils/mm3), thus fulfilling the requirements for a minimum viable product. The consecution of  these milestones will enable, in Phase II, using PointCheck in a multi-site diagnostic validation  trial to confirm, under clinical conditions, that the management of FN can be improved with this  new paradigm. Development of a portable optical imaging device that can noninvasively  detect neutropenia-related immunosuppression, to enable more frequent monitoring of  chemotherapy patients so that timely medical interventions can be staged before  life-threatening infections develop.",Reducing the incidence of febrile neutropenia in cancer patients treated with chemotherapy with PointCheck: a portable non-invasive neutropenia analyzer,10091634,R43CA228920,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Algorithms', 'Antibiotics', 'Area', 'Autologous Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Blinded', 'Blood capillaries', 'Blood specimen', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Colony-Stimulating Factors', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnostic', 'Dose', 'FPS-FES Oncogene', 'Fever', 'Fingers', 'Frequencies', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hematology', 'Home environment', 'Hospital Costs', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Imaging Device', 'Immunosuppression', 'Incidence', 'Infection', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Label', 'Letters', 'Leukocytes', 'Life', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Medical', 'Microcirculation', 'Monitor', 'Neutropenia', 'Nurses', 'Oncology', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Pilot Projects', 'Process', 'Proxy', 'ROC Curve', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Site', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'System', 'Systems Analysis', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Side Effects', 'Triage', 'Validation', 'Visit', 'base', 'chemotherapy', 'cohort', 'computerized data processing', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'experience', 'fighting', 'improved', 'infection risk', 'learning strategy', 'man', 'mortality', 'movie', 'neutrophil', 'non-invasive optical imaging', 'non-invasive system', 'optical imaging', 'personalized chemotherapy', 'point of care', 'portability', 'prophylactic', 'prototype', 'side effect']",NCI,"LEUKO LABS, INC.",R43,2020,55000,0.00925109061135182
"Mapping host-microbe-metabolite interactions in 3D to find diet-derived enhancers of immunity Project Summary Antimicrobial resistance is an increasing problem, and current drug pipelines are not keeping pace with the rise of antimicrobial resistance. An alternative strategy is to boost host immunity. An often overlooked side-effect of the vitamin and mineral supplementation projects of the 1940s is that these supplements greatly reduced infectious disease burden. Recent work has shown that further gains may be possible, especially in adding phytochemicals back to highly processed diets typically consumed in the United States. However, we lack a fundamental understanding of how these components are processed by the microbiome, and how diet-derived molecules, microbiome and host immune system work together to resist infectious disease. A key barrier preventing us from making these discoveries is that each individual assay (microbiome, host gene expression metabolome, dietary compounds) is expensive and highly multivariate. Three key insights that enable the current project are the miniaturization of DNA and RNA sequencing assays on advanced nanoliter- scale liquid handling robots, greatly reducing the cost, the combination of untargeted and targeted mass spectrometry on the same samples in high throughput to enable discovery of a much greater chemical space, and the ability to use explicitly spatial maps on multiple scales to integrate the dataset throughout the body and enable both visual analytics and deep learning approaches based on spatial data. These breakthroughs will provide a fundamentally new understanding of how dietary metabolites promote disease resistance, and will allow us to develop a new infrastructure to integrate results from many investigators in different laboratories studying various aspects of these systems. Additionally, the results will allow us to choose biomaterials and biomarkers in human subjects that provide maximum information about internal nutritional and immune status. Results will be tested against the NHANES and American Gut cohorts. The results of this project will therefore be: 3D maps of mouse models showing how the microbiome, diet, and host gene expression produce immunity; an infrastructure for creating and sharing these maps; and a preliminary test of whether the results extend to large human populations. Project Narrative The public health relevance of this proposal is that it will provide an infrastructure for analyzing impacts of dietary components and microbiomes throughout the body. The analysis of these maps will help us identify dietary components that improve resistance to infectious disease.",Mapping host-microbe-metabolite interactions in 3D to find diet-derived enhancers of immunity,10015205,DP1AT010885,"['3-Dimensional', 'American', 'Antimicrobial Resistance', 'Back', 'Biocompatible Materials', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Chemicals', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Consumption', 'DNA sequencing', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diet', 'Dietary Component', 'Disease Resistance', 'Enhancers', 'Gene Expression', 'Human', 'Immune system', 'Immunity', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Laboratory Study', 'Liquid substance', 'Maps', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Metabolite Interaction', 'Microbe', 'Minerals', 'Miniaturization', 'National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey', 'Nutritional status', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phytochemical', 'Population', 'Process', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Robot', 'Sampling', 'Supplementation', 'System', 'Testing', 'United States', 'Visual', 'Vitamins', 'Work', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'cohort', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'human subject', 'immunological status', 'improved', 'insight', 'metabolome', 'microbiome', 'mouse model', 'nanolitre scale', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'side effect', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NCCIH,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",DP1,2020,885000,0.0059054770395107516
"Investigating the impact and patterns of homologous recombination and adaptive evolution on bacterial genomes Project summary In contract to sexual organisms, the mechanisms of population genetics in bacteria are far less understood. Two fundamental aspects of bacterial population genetics remain sorely understudied: i) the impact of DNA exchange on the evolution of bacterial genomes and populations is largely unknown. ii) the prominence of adaptive evolution has not been comprehensively assessed in bacteria. Determining how recombination and adaptive evolution impact bacteria is key to understand the biology of these organisms and to develop relevant models of their evolution. Although bacteria reproduce clonally, there is increasing evidence that the vast majority of these organisms are capable of homologous recombination by exchanging pieces of DNA in a process similar to gene conversion in animals and plants. This process enhances microbial capacity to adapt to stresses or changing environments and the exchange of DNA between bacterial strains is a major concern for human health as exemplified by the transfer of virulence and antibiotic resistance genes. Despite the central role of this process, the rates and patterns of recombination remain unresolved in bacteria. The extent of recombination often varies greatly from one study to another and, as a result, the same bacterial species can be perceived as clonal in one study and highly recombining in another. In this project, we propose to re-evaluate the landscape of recombination rates and patterns along the genomes of hundreds of bacterial species. Using new methodological frameworks based on Approximate Bayesian Computation and Deep Learning, we will identify the factors shaping the variation in recombination rate across bacteria. We will also uncover recombination rate variation across bacterial chromosomes (i.e. hot spots and cold spots). Our rate estimates will also allow us to study how recombination drives the evolution of genomic architecture of bacteria, including turnover in gene content. Finally, we will quantify the impact of adaptive evolution in bacteria, which may be substantially larger than in other organisms due to large bacterial effective population sizes. We will also investigate the relationship between adaptation and recombination, and identify the genes/pathways responsible for adaptation. In summary, this study will evaluate the rates and patterns of recombination across hundreds of species, determine the factors driving the evolution of the recombination process, reveal the role of adaptive evolution in bacteria, and the interplay between recombination and adaptation. Project narrative Homologous recombination and adaptive evolution are key mechanisms driving bacterial adaptation to new environments and new treatments. The proposed study aims to apply new approaches to determine the rates and patterns of recombination across genomic data in order to identify the factors shaping the rates and landscapes of recombination as well as the impact of adaptive evolution on bacteria. Upon completion, this project will provide a global view of the interplay between recombination and adaptative evolution across hundreds of bacterial species.",Investigating the impact and patterns of homologous recombination and adaptive evolution on bacterial genomes,9968563,R01GM132137,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Animals', 'Antibiotic Resistance', 'Architecture', 'Automobile Driving', 'Bacteria', 'Bacterial Chromosomes', 'Bacterial Genome', 'Bacterial Infections', 'Bayesian Analysis', 'Biology', 'Chromosomes', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Contracts', 'DNA', 'Data Set', 'Ecology', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Epidemic', 'Evolution', 'Fibrinogen', 'Frequencies', 'Gene Conversion', 'Genes', 'Genetic Models', 'Genetic Recombination', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Health', 'Hot Spot', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Maps', 'Mediating', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Organism', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Plants', 'Play', 'Population', 'Population Genetics', 'Population Sizes', 'Process', 'Prokaryotic Cells', 'Recombinants', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Shapes', 'Spottings', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Virulence', 'Virulent', 'Work', 'base', 'deep learning', 'gene function', 'genome analysis', 'genomic data', 'high throughput screening', 'homologous recombination', 'innovation', 'large datasets', 'microbial', 'novel strategies', 'resistance gene', 'tool', 'trait']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA GREENSBORO,R01,2020,294378,-0.005312927240598622
"Optimization of efflux avoidance and inhibition for antibiotic development Project Summary Failures of antibiotic therapy occur with increasing frequency in clinics due to the spread of multidrug resistant bacterial pathogens. The major challenge are infections caused by Gram-negative bacteria that are protected from antibiotics by the concerted action of multidrug efflux pumps and the low permeability barrier of outer membranes. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, an opportunistic human pathogen responsible for a variety of infectious diseases, is notorious for its antibiotic impermeability. A handful of clinical antibiotics used against this pathogen are beginning to fail due to the emergence of multidrug resistant strains. New antibiotics are needed to address this growing threat. Decades of antibiotic discovery and optimization perfected empirical approaches for improvement of antibiotic action and avoidance of class-specific resistance mechanisms. The current critical challenge is to develop approaches that will enable antibiotic penetration across non-specific permeability barriers of Gram-negative bacteria, which present an urgent and serious threat to public health. This project responds to this challenge and proposes the development of a new technology for optimization of efflux avoidance and inhibition in clinical and investigational antibacterial agents that will be effective against Gram-negative bacteria. The proposed approach targets simultaneously the multidrug efflux mechanism of P. aeruginosa and its outer membrane barrier and combines cutting edge technologies in experimental analyses of efflux inhibition and drug penetration, kinetic modeling of drug accumulation, computer simulations of drug efflux and transmembrane diffusion, synthetic chemistry and machine learning analyses. The central objective of the proposal is to create a mechanism-based predictive model that integrates physicochemical properties of compounds, kinetics of their intracellular accumulation and transmembrane diffusion, and a molecular level description of the interaction of efflux transporters with their substrates and inhibitors. The model will be validated by focused medicinal chemistry efforts to generate antibacterial agents that combine the traits of effective antibiotics and potent efflux pump inhibitors or avoiders. This multi-disciplinary approach is enabled by the collaborative efforts of PIs on the project: Helen Zgurskaya (biochemistry of drug uptake and efflux), Valentin Rybenkov (kinetic modeling), Paolo Ruggerone (computational biophysics of efflux), Gnanakaran (computational simulations of membrane permeation) and John Walker (medicinal chemistry). Narrative This project addresses a current critical challenge in the discovery and development of antibiotics effective against multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa. These studies will create a new powerful technology for accelerated antibiotic development targeting diverse bacteria and give rise to new families of antibiotics.",Optimization of efflux avoidance and inhibition for antibiotic development,9853719,R01AI136799,"['Address', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents', 'Antibiotic Resistance', 'Antibiotic Therapy', 'Antibiotics', 'Area', 'Bacteria', 'Biochemistry', 'Biophysics', 'Cells', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Computational Biology', 'Computer Models', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diffusion', 'Drug Efflux', 'Drug Modelings', 'Failure', 'Family', 'Frequencies', 'Gram-Negative Bacteria', 'Infection', 'Kinetics', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Measures', 'Membrane', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Multi-Drug Resistance', 'Nature', 'Outcome', 'Penetration', 'Permeability', 'Pharmaceutical Chemistry', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Property', 'Pseudomonas aeruginosa', 'Public Health', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Role', 'Structure', 'Synthesis Chemistry', 'Technology', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Walkers', 'antibiotic efflux', 'base', 'cell envelope', 'clinical investigation', 'efflux pump', 'experience', 'experimental analysis', 'human pathogen', 'improved', 'industry partner', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'kinetic model', 'molecular dynamics', 'molecular modeling', 'multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa', 'new technology', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'pathogenic bacteria', 'predictive modeling', 'resistance mechanism', 'resistant strain', 'success', 'tool', 'trait', 'uptake']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF OKLAHOMA NORMAN,R01,2020,1048793,0.02642230756781565
"Identifying Coronavirus B-cell Epitopes Associated with COVID-19 Illness Severity Identifying Coronavirus B-cell Epitopes Associated with COVID-19 Infection and Illness The new coronavirus outbreak that begin in December 2019 has created a global public health emergency. This has led to an intense search to identify factors that contribute to the susceptibility and severity of illness. We recently developed an array to identify antibody-binding epitopes for rhinoviruses. Data from these arrays can be combined with information about viral protein structure to identify highly immunogenic regions for respiratory viruses. We propose to expand this array to include linear epitopes that represent the entire proteome of SARS- CoV-2 and all other common coronaviruses that infect humans (OC43, NL63, etc.). The study population will include children from the COAST, WISC and URECA birth cohort studies who are also participating in the HEROS SARS-CoV-2 surveillance study. As part of routine cohort activities, these children undergo serial sampling of blood and nasal secretions that we can analyze using the array to determine individual patterns of antiviral antibody epitope recognition. We hypothesize that the pattern and quantity of antibody specific for epitopes of common coronaviruses contributes to the susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection and illness. We propose three specific aims that will utilize sera obtained from children before and after HEROS-confirmed infection with SARS-CoV-2. First, in specimens obtained pre-infection we will use the array to identify patterns of antibody epitope recognition to common childhood coronaviruses, assess cross-reactivity with SARS-CoV-2, and determine whether cross-reactivity is associated with protection against infection or illness. In the second aim, we will determine whether the diversity of antibody responses to common respiratory viruses is associated with a reduced risk of infection or illness. Finally, in the third aim we will describe antibody binding patterns before and after known COVID-19 cases to identify candidate regions that are immunogenic and neutralizing. To accomplish this aim, we will perform micro-neutralization assays (available in the BSL3 laboratory of Dr. Kristen Bernard, UW Madison) on convalescent sera or nasal secretions from children who developed symptomatic infection. This information will be analyzed together with pre- and post-infection array data using machine learning approaches to identify neutralizing epitopes. Identifying patterns of serologic responses that are cross- protective could help to identify susceptible individuals in the population and direct the design of vaccines to current and future viruses. PROJECT NARRATIVE (from parent grant) The morbidity and cost to society from childhood viral respiratory illnesses (VRI) is staggering, and allergic respiratory disease is rampant. In the search for prevention for these common and high-burden diseases, perhaps the solutions are on the farm. Our main hypothesis is that microbes in farming environments promote immune development in early life, and thereby reduce the severity of VRI and protect against allergies. We will test this hypothesis by expanding studies in the Wisconsin Infant Study Cohort (WISC), a birth cohort in dairy farm country consisting of children and their families who were enrolled before birth and then monitored for farm exposures, development of the immune system, respiratory illnesses and allergies. We hope to identify farm-related exposures, including microbes, that promote healthy immune development, and ultimately, healthy children. Completion of these studies will lead to development of new strategies for raising children who get fewer respiratory illnesses and avoid developing respiratory allergies.",Identifying Coronavirus B-cell Epitopes Associated with COVID-19 Illness Severity,10170660,U19AI104317,"['2019-nCoV', 'Allergic', 'Antibodies', 'Antibody Diversity', 'Antibody Response', 'Asthma', 'B cell repertoire', 'B-Lymphocyte Epitopes', 'Binding', 'Biological Assay', 'Birth', 'Blood specimen', 'COVID-19', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Cohort Studies', 'Common Epitope', 'Coronavirus', 'Country', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Enrollment', 'Epitopes', 'Family', 'Farming environment', 'Future', 'Human', 'Hypersensitivity', 'Immune', 'Immune system', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Infection', 'Laboratories', 'Life', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Microbe', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Nose', 'Pattern', 'Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Prevention', 'Proteome', 'Rhinovirus', 'Serological', 'Serum', 'Severities', 'Severity of illness', 'Societies', 'Specimen', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Vaccine Design', 'Viral', 'Viral Antibodies', 'Viral Structural Proteins', 'Virus', 'Wisconsin', 'burden of illness', 'cohort', 'cost', 'cross reactivity', 'immunogenic', 'infection risk', 'new technology', 'novel coronavirus', 'parent grant', 'public health emergency', 'respiratory', 'respiratory virus', 'response', 'study population', 'surveillance study']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,U19,2020,406048,0.016162776467890168
"Improving predictive capacity of models for universal influenza vaccine development The need for improved and more universally protective influenza vaccines is well recognized. Central to efforts towards improvements is the development of animal models more predictive of the human response to immunization and/or infection. Indeed, this need has been highlighted by the NIAID Strategic Plan for a Universal Influenza Vaccine. While animal models may never be able to fully predict the human response, understanding their full strengths and weaknesses and identifying the optimal models for different purposes is a significant public health need and is the scientific premise behind our proposed objectives. These objectives, which are built upon our extensive use of influenza animal models, are to optimize animal modeling of immunologic imprinting, to improve vaccine efficacy testing, and to identify immune correlates of protection and boosting immune responses. Our overall goal is to provide superior preclinical models to support universal influenza vaccine development. We will achieve this goal through three complementary and interrelated specific aims, 1) optimal modeling of human serologic responses to repeat influenza antigen exposure in animal models; 2) improving the quantitative nature of the ferret influenza challenge model; and 3) defining serologic correlates of influenza virus induced clinical symptoms. Our ability to conduct these aims is supported through our participation in, and collaboration with, a recently NIAID-funded human infant cohort, the DIVINCI study. We will mirror the influenza antigen exposures of a selection of these infants in three animal models and compare immunologic data sets to identify which most accurately reflects the human response (Aim 1). This marriage of human and animal data sets and samples offers an innovative way forward and will provide a unique set of differentially primed animals with which to determine immune correlates of novel physiologic parameters of infection and immune responses (Aim 2) using original machine learning algorithms (Aim 3). Current models for influenza vaccine development suffer from poor predictability of the human response. Through an innovative combination of approaches that use data from longitudinal human cohorts, we intend to greatly enhance the reliability and value of these models in universal influenza vaccine testing.",Improving predictive capacity of models for universal influenza vaccine development,9950635,R01AI150745,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Antigens', 'Antiviral Agents', 'Area', 'Cavia', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Dose', 'Ensure', 'Exposure to', 'Family suidae', 'Ferrets', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Hamsters', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immunity', 'Immunization', 'Immunological Models', 'Immunologics', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Infection', 'Influenza', 'Influenza A Virus, H3N2 Subtype', 'Information Systems', 'Lasso', 'Lung', 'Marriage', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Mus', 'National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease', 'Natural History', 'Nature', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Pathogenesis', 'Performance', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Pre-Clinical Model', 'Predictive Value', 'Primates', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Reagent', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Seasons', 'Serological', 'Strategic Planning', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Telemetry', 'Time', 'United States', 'Upper respiratory tract', 'Vaccinated', 'Vaccine Production', 'Vaccines', 'Virulence', 'Virus Replication', 'Whole Body Plethysmography', 'animal data', 'animal model development', 'cohort', 'efficacy testing', 'flexibility', 'human data', 'human model', 'imprint', 'improved', 'influenza virus vaccine', 'influenzavirus', 'innovation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mouse development', 'multitask', 'next generation', 'novel', 'preclinical evaluation', 'product development', 'research and development', 'response', 'safety study', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'universal influenza vaccine', 'universal vaccine', 'vaccine candidate', 'vaccine development', 'vaccine effectiveness', 'vaccine efficacy', 'vaccine evaluation']",NIAID,ST.

"Influenza host specific glycan motif identification through systems biology Project Summary Influenza A viruses (IAVs) have caused large losses of life around the world and continue to present a great public health challenge. IAVs can cause infections in birds, sea mammals, lower mammals (e.g., pigs, dogs, and horses), and humans. Previous studies have demonstrated that the structures of the carbohydrate receptors determine influenza host and tissue tropisms. Thus, it is necessary to understand the receptor- binding properties for IAVs and monitor changes to them, especially for IAVs at the animal–human interface. However, this understanding is hampered by our lack of detailed knowledge of IAV glycan substructures; most of our knowledge is limited to SA2,3Gal-like and SA2,6Gal-like structures. The goals of this project are to develop and validate a machine learning method to identify host-specific glycan substructures for IAVs by using glycan array data and to identify and validate the glycan motifs associated with the host tropisms of IAVs, including those for zoonotic IAVs. The study will focus on natural hosts of IAVs: humans, swine, canines, equines, and various avian species, including common domestic poultry species and wild bird species. We expect to identify structural determinants for receptor binding with human-, swine-, canine-, and avian-origin IAVs. Such knowledge will help us understand the factors that contribute to influenza infection and transmission and thereby facilitate development of an effective influenza vaccine to prevent virus infection and block virus transmission. This knowledge will also help us develop rapid assays for monitoring emerging influenza threats at the animal–human interface. We also expect to develop a computational method for identifying glycan motifs associated with influenza host tropisms; this method will be able to be adapted to determine functional glycan motifs for other proteins, lectins, antibodies, antisera, and microorganisms, including those of other infectious pathogens, by using glycan arrays. Project Narrative This project will develop and apply a computational tool to identify glycan motifs associated with influenza host tropisms, and the derived knowledge will help us develop effective strategies for influenza prevention and control.",Influenza host specific glycan motif identification through systems biology,9895377,R21AI144433,"['Affect', 'Animals', 'Antibodies', 'Area', 'Avian Influenza A Virus', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biosensor', 'Birds', 'Canis familiaris', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Domestic Fowls', 'Equus caballus', 'Family suidae', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Hemagglutinin', 'Human', 'Immune Sera', 'Infection', 'Influenza', 'Influenza A virus', 'Influenza prevention', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Lectin', 'Life', 'Link', 'Mammals', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Mutation', 'National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease', 'Natural History', 'Pathogenesis', 'Performance', 'Play', 'Polysaccharides', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sea', 'Sialic Acids', 'Signal Transduction', 'Slide', 'Strategic Planning', 'Streptavidin', 'Structure', 'Systems Biology', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Trees', 'Tropism', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Virus Diseases', 'Zoonoses', 'base', 'carbohydrate receptor', 'carbohydrate structure', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'experimental study', 'flu transmission', 'improved', 'in silico', 'influenza virus vaccine', 'influenzavirus', 'large datasets', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning method', 'microorganism', 'multi-task learning', 'multitask', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'prevent', 'protein profiling', 'receptor', 'receptor binding', 'respiratory', 'response', 'swine influenza', 'tissue tropism', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'universal influenza vaccine', 'viral transmission', 'wild bird']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI-COLUMBIA,R21,2020,239725,0.02850971729802851
"Coordinating Research on Emerging Arboviral Threats Encoing the Neotropics (CREATE-NEO) Project Summary In recent decades, Central and South America have experienced spillover of endemic arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses) from wildlife reservoirs into humans, exchange and recombination of emerging arboviruses within the region, resurgence of arboviruses previously controlled by vaccination or vector control, introduction and spread of novel arboviruses, and exportation of viruses to other regions. Furthermore, there is great concern that newly-introduced Zika virus may spill back into an enzootic transmission cycle in the Americas. Central and South America encompass enormous vertebrate and invertebrate biodiversity, and these species harbor a broad range of arboviruses whose risk of spillover and spread in humans is presently unknown. Increases in the rates of global travel, invasion of novel vector species, urban expansion, deforestation, and global climate change all elevate the risk of further arbovirus emergence, as does the breakdown of public health structures in Venezuela.  The Coordinating Research on Emerging Arboviral Threats Encompassing the Neotropics (CREATE- NEO) project will provide a network of surveillance sites in the neotropics coupled to cutting-edge modeling approaches in order to anticipate and counter emerging arboviruses. Aim 1 will identify novel and known arboviruses as well as the host-vector networks that sustain transmission of these viruses within the neotropics, map the spatial distribution of these transmission networks, and characterize virus transmission dynamics within these networks. To do so, we will collect mosquitoes and other vectors as well as non-human primates and other vertebrate hosts at multiple sites in areas of high and varied biodiversity in Panama and Brazil and screen these samples for known and novel arboviruses. These data will then be analyzed using niche modeling, machine learning to predict undiscovered hosts and vectors, and dynamical transmission models. Aim 2 will focus on prospective and retrospective analysis of human infection and disease. To do so, we will leverage ongoing human clinical cohorts at multiple sites in Brazil and Panama. We will extend and expand these cohorts, with a particular focus on the immune-mediated interactions among multiple arboviruses at sites of hyperendemicity. We will also develop novel diagnostics to capture known and novel arboviruses and model the impact of human and non-human primate movement on spillover and spillback of target arboviruses.  Data and models generated via these two aims will forewarn local, regional and global public health agencies of arboviruses within Central and South America that pose particularly high risk of spillover, emergence into transmission among humans, and/or international spread. Moreover CREATE-NEO will build local capacity to predict, detect and respond to emerging arboviruses at their point of origin, thereby maximizing the potential to avert full-blown emergence. Project Narrative Arthropod-borne viruses, such as dengue, Zika and Mayaro, are emerging at an accelerating rate in Central and South America.

"Altering Hepatitis B Virus assembly through pharmacological intervention Project Summary/Abstract Viruses are one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide, with Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) being one of the most infectious and prevalent among them. Roughly 250 million people worldwide suffer from chronic HBV infection, including 1-2 million in the United States. Of those infected, approximately 15-25% will develop se- rious liver problems, including cirrhosis, cancer, and ultimately failure, leading to 600,000 deaths annually. While therapies exist to manage chronic HBV infection, all target viral genomic processes such as reverse transcription and DNA replication, and none provide a cure due to viral persistence and resistance. A promising orthogonal approach to eliminating infection is to target HBV's capsid, the protein shell that encapsulates the viral genome. The Finn laboratory has previously developed compounds that induce the misdirected assembly of non-functional HBV capsids, showing that small molecules have the power to affect the structures of these large multi-protein assemblies. While much is known about the structures of the intermolecular interactions with these compounds identiﬁed after the fact, little about the dynamics of such interactions has been explored, and a predictive under- standing of functional (antiviral) binding has yet to be developed. Both deﬁciencies will begin to be addressed in this program. Using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations coupled with in vitro experiments on HepAD38 cells, the PIs have identiﬁed seven compounds based on motifs previously unknown to interact with HBV that target the capsid assembly process. These compounds bind in a known pocket at the interface of two capsid-protein (Cp) dimers, possess moderate antiviral activity, and low toxicity. In the ﬁrst aim, using docking, free-energy perturba- tion, and synthetic chemistry, the PIs will optimize the lead compound to improve its efﬁcacy against HBV. In the second aim, using molecular dynamics simulations, advanced free-energy calculations, and experimental assays on different HBV protein oligomers, up to and including the whole virus capsid, the PIs will determine how small molecules interfere with capsid assembly. Both aims will beneﬁt from using a machine-learning-based classiﬁ- cation scheme as well as novel enhanced sampling methods. The lessons learned here concerning how small molecules can re-direct the assembly pathway into unproductive conformations can be generalized for application to other viruses. Project Narrative In spite of the dramatic increase in our understanding of the structure and properties of hepatitis B virus (HBV), this pathogen remains a major threat to human health. That knowledge also makes HBV an important test case for new antiviral strategies. This project aims to limit the impact of HBV by using computer simulations and synthetic chemistry to develop an improved understanding of the assembly process of HBV as well as new drugs that can eliminate HBV infection in ways that may be generalized to other pathogenic viruses.",Altering Hepatitis B Virus assembly through pharmacological intervention,10051923,R01AI148740,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Antiviral Agents', 'Binding', 'Biological Assay', 'Capsid', 'Capsid Proteins', 'Cations', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic Hepatitis B', 'Cirrhosis', 'Classification', 'Classification Scheme', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Coupled', 'Cryoelectron Microscopy', 'DNA biosynthesis', 'Development', 'Docking', 'Encapsulated', 'Equilibrium', 'Failure', 'Free Energy', 'Goals', 'HIV-1', 'Health', 'Hepatitis B Virus', 'Human', 'Image', 'In Vitro', 'Infection', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Liver', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methods', 'Modification', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pharmacology', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protein Conformation', 'Protein Dynamics', 'Resistance', 'Reverse Transcription', 'Sampling', 'Scheme', 'Structure', 'Synthesis Chemistry', 'Testing', 'Toxic effect', 'United States', 'Viral', 'Viral Genome', 'Virus', 'Virus Assembly', 'Virus Diseases', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'design', 'dimer', 'drug development', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'intermolecular interaction', 'lead optimization', 'molecular dynamics', 'mortality', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'pathogen', 'pathogenic virus', 'programs', 'protein oligomer', 'protein protein interaction', 'protein structure', 'simulation', 'small molecule', 'success', 'viral genomics']",NIAID,GEORGIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2020,407510,-0.005287393946403814
"Investigating bacterial contributions to TB treatment response: a focus on in-host pathogen dynamics Project Summary/Abstract Rapid and accurate methods to monitor tuberculosis (TB) treatment response do not currently exist. Efforts to improve outcomes have focused on early identification of rifampicin susceptibility followed by prompt treatment initiation and adherence monitoring. The rapid molecular susceptibility tests most often used give dichotomous cutoffs. Recent studies though show that minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) just below these breakpoints also predict poor outcomes. Even if a patient takes most of their therapy, clinical response can still vary substantially. Delays in sputum clearance (culture conversion from growth to no growth) can range from a few days to 5 months and failure or relapse rates can be as high as 20% in drug-susceptible TB. During the weeks to months of human infection and antibiotic treatment, in host Mtb populations experience substantial measurable genetic changes. These changes may be neutral or allow pathogen adaption to immune, antibiotic or metabolic pressure, e.g. low iron or cobalamin levels that may result in heritable drug tolerance and resistance phenotypes. Here we propose to study in host longitudinal pathogen dynamics including changes in population diversity over time and identify genes under selection to shed light on host-pathogen interactions. The study of in host pathogen dynamics can improve our understanding of cure from infection and pave the way for the use of whole genome sequencing for monitoring treatment response, circumventing the delays and biohazards of traditional culture-based approaches. We additionally propose the development of a genome- based predictor of MIC and to assess if MIC predictions are associated with delays in culture conversion and poor clinical response. We will systematically study pathogen samples from a well characterized TB treatment patient cohort (NIAID TRUST TB cohort in Worcester, South Africa -PI Dr. Jacobson) combining long and deep short-read sequencing to resolve full genome assemblies and variants at low allele frequency. We have strong preliminary data that long-read sequencing unmasks more Mtb genetic diversity than detectable by short-read sequencing alone and have previously characterized directional selection in a subset of genes including resistance loci, the B12 biosynthesis pathway, and PPE genes known to interact with host innate defense. The proposed work is enabled by our methodological expertise in population genetics, machine learning and resistance prediction for clonal bacteria like Mtb and will allow, for the first time, the study of directional and diversifying selection on the full repertoire of Mtb genetic variation. It will also allow the training of an MIC prediction model on a large ~17,000 isolate dataset curated across studies and geographies. Both study aims promise to inform our understanding of how pathogen genetic variation affects Mtb survival in host and the response to treatment. Project Narrative Patients with tuberculosis (TB) can benefit greatly if we could identify signs of poor response earlier and adjust therapy intensity accordingly. Innovations in DNA isolation and sequencing technologies now enable the study of TB pathogen populations in an individual patient with very high resolution.

"A pipeline for prioritizing and evaluating multidrug regimens for Mycobacterium abscessus PROJECT SUMMARY Mycobacterium abscessus complex (MABSC) is a group of closely related nontuberculous mycobacteria, which primarily cause infections in persons with underlying lung disease, compromised immunity or other risk factors. MABSC organisms are intrinsically resistant to many antibiotics and treatment requires many months of multiple antibiotics, often with significant toxicity and low cure rates. One of the difficulties in optimizing the treatment of MABSC infections is the lack of a robust pipeline for the identification of multidrug regimens that may be more efficacious than the current standard of care. A strategy for prioritizing multidrug regimens is necessary, because the number of combinations to test can be overwhelming. For example, with even just 12 drugs to select from there are 220 potential 3 drug combinations. This project proposes to develop INDIGO (INferring Drug Interactions using chemo-Genomics and Orthology), a machine learning modeling approach, to identify drug combinations with strong potential synergistic activity against MABSC and to test these regimens in an animal model. The specific aims of this project are: 1) Build and refine an INDIGO-MABSC model through the collection of transcriptomic data from drug treated MABSC cultures, subsequent experimental verification of antibiotic synergy and antagonism followed by model refinement with iterative rounds of model building and testing; 2) Assess the efficacy of top predicted synergistic multidrug regimens in a zebrafish model for MABSC infection. INDIGO modeling is modular, so as new agents become available they may be incorporated into the model to make predictions for how these agents may be best combined into multidrug regimens. The overall goal of this project is to provide a streamlined pipeline for identifying regimens that can be pushed into advanced pre-clinical and clinical trials for treatment of MABSC infections. PROJECT NARRATIVE Bacteria from the Mycobacterium abscessus group cause lung and other infections in persons with underlying medical comorbidities, which are incredibly difficult to treat due to the bacteria's intrinsic resistance to many antibiotics. This project uses gene expression profiling, computer modeling, and a zebrafish infection model to identify new combination antibiotic regimens that may be more effective against Mycobacterium abscessus. Results from these studies could prompt future clinical trials to test these regimens in humans for efficacy.",A pipeline for prioritizing and evaluating multidrug regimens for Mycobacterium abscessus,9898274,R21AI144536,"['Adjuvant', 'American', 'Amikacin', 'Animal Model', 'Antibiotic Therapy', 'Antibiotics', 'Bacteria', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Models', 'Bronchiectasis', 'Caring', 'Chest', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collection', 'Combined Antibiotics', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Cystic Fibrosis', 'Data', 'Drug Antagonism', 'Drug Combinations', 'Drug Interactions', 'Drug Synergism', 'Drug resistance', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Escherichia coli', 'Exhibits', 'Exposure to', 'Fishes', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'High Prevalence', 'Human', 'Imipenem', 'Immunity', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Injections', 'Label', 'Larva', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Macrolides', 'Medical', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mycobacterium Infections', 'Mycobacterium abscessus', 'Mycobacterium avium Complex', 'Mycobacterium tuberculosis', 'New Agents', 'Organism', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Population', 'Preclinical Testing', 'Predisposition', 'Prevalence', 'Regimen', 'Resistance', 'Risk Factors', 'Societies', 'Testing', 'Toxic effect', 'Training', 'Treatment-related toxicity', 'Triage', 'Triplet Multiple Birth', 'Tuberculosis', 'Veins', 'Vertebral column', 'Work', 'Zebrafish', 'comorbidity', 'cystic fibrosis patients', 'data registry', 'design', 'drug candidate', 'drug testing', 'high risk', 'improved outcome', 'in silico', 'in vitro activity', 'in vivo', 'in vivo Model', 'model building', 'non-tuberculosis mycobacteria', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'patient screening', 'pre-clinical', 'preclinical trial', 'predictive modeling', 'resistant strain', 'response', 'standard of care', 'success', 'synergism', 'tool', 'transcriptomics', 'transmission process', 'treatment optimization']",NIAID,SEATTLE CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,R21,2020,212873,0.012781321353713638
"Dissecting host-pathogen interactions through the lens of genomics Summary: Dissecting host-pathogen interactions through the lens of genomics Current investigation of mechanisms underlying many diseases relies on the acquisition of multi-dimensional genomics data. The utility of these data is, however, offset by the lag in development of tools and models to fully interrogate them. In the context of infectious diseases, such data contains molecular information including gene transcription, regulation, and variations from both the infecting pathogen and the host cell, providing a snapshot of the host and pathogen interactions (HPIs). These HPIs determine infection outcomes. For instance, when a pathogen evades, or evolves resistance to defensive host immunity via a multifaceted HPI, it can result in persisting infection, chronic inflammation, malignant transformation, and/or elevated mortality. Recent successes in overcoming immune-evasion of infected tumor cells with checkpoint inhibitors exemplifies the clinical gains that can be made by identifying and specifically targeting essential mechanisms of HPIs. Hence, precisely identifying new mode(s) of HPIs is critical for development of effective and personalized interventions. The molecular mechanisms of HPIs underpinning disease can be identified from genomics data. For example, information on whether a transcription factor (TF) regulates genes from either host or pathogen, or both, can be captured by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) sequencing of infected host cells. This means that integrative analysis of genome-scale data can provide a platform for large-scale and unbiased detection of often multi- dimensional and novel facets of HPIs in host cells. However, there is a lack of data mining tools and models to extract such information. More importantly, the available analysis tools typically focus on data from either the host or the pathogen and not on the interactions occurring between the two, excluding us from investigating the full HPI spectrum. Thus, novel methods to determine HPIs by simultaneously modeling both host and pathogen data are critical for understanding key cellular mechanisms and developing treatment strategies. My lab specializes in developing computational models to construct HPI maps and to experimentally validate them. As proof-of-principle, we produced a comprehensive HPI map from sequencing samples from large numbers of tumors caused by Epstein–Barr virus. This map delivered unprecedented insights, identifying novel viral integrations, mutations linked to viral reactivation and providing molecular classification of tumors expected to yield individualized cancer therapy. Therefore, my lab is uniquely positioned to uncover mechanistic insights from HPIs. Our program seeks to develop new models and machine learning tools to construct HPI maps in several diseases by focusing on the following major questions: 1) how do expression, integration, and mutational landscapes of host and pathogen affect pathogenesis of disease?; 2) what is the nature of physical HPIs and cross-regulation by major host and pathogen factors that modulate gene expression, such as TFs and RNA binding proteins?; 3) how do HPIs define molecular subtypes to guide personalized treatments? We expect to identify novel HPIs and provide systems-level understanding of mechanisms critical to cell biology. Narrative Understanding how host cells and pathogens interact is key to developing new and individualized therapeutics. Here, we will develop novel computational tools and models to analyze existing and newly generated high throughput data and construct multi-dimensional host pathogen interaction maps. These maps will provide detailed mechanisms underpinning multi-faceted interactions occurring between host and pathogen and will delineate molecular subtypes that can be utilized for novel and personalized treatment options.",Dissecting host-pathogen interactions through the lens of genomics,10028454,R35GM138283,"['Affect', 'Cells', 'Cellular biology', 'ChIP-seq', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Computer Models', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genomics', 'Human Herpesvirus 4', 'Immune Evasion', 'Immune checkpoint inhibitor', 'Immunity', 'Infection', 'Inflammation', 'Investigation', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Classification of Tumors', 'Mutation', 'Nature', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Positioning Attribute', 'RNA-Binding Proteins', 'Regulation', 'Resistance', 'Sampling', 'System', 'Therapeutic', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Variant', 'Viral', 'Virus Integration', 'computerized tools', 'data mining', 'effective intervention', 'genome analysis', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'insight', 'lens', 'molecular subtypes', 'mortality', 'neoplastic cell', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'personalized cancer therapy', 'personalized intervention', 'personalized medicine', 'programs', 'success', 'tool', 'tool development', 'transcription factor', 'treatment strategy', 'tumor']",NIGMS,PURDUE UNIVERSITY,R35,2020,381824,0.008563963832750257
"Predictive Models for Small-Molecule Accumulation in Gram-Negative Bacteria PROJECT SUMMARY Predictive Models for Small-Molecule Accumulation in Gram-Negative Bacteria. Antibiotic-resistant Gram-negative bacterial infections are increasing in incidence and novel antibiotics are urgently needed to combat this growing threat to public health. A major roadblock to the development of novel antibiotics is our poor understanding of the structural features of small molecules that correlate with bacterial penetration and efflux. As a result, while potent biochemical inhibitors can often be identified for new targets, developing them into compounds with whole-cell antibacterial activity has proven challenging. To address this critical problem, we propose herein a comprehensive, multidisciplinary approach to develop quantitative models to predict small-molecule penetration and efflux in Gram-negative bacteria. We have pioneered a general platform for systematic, quantitative evaluation of small-molecule accumulation in bacteria, using label-free LC-MS/MS detection and multivariate cheminformatic analysis. We have also developed unique isogenic strain sets of wild-type, hyperporinated, efflux-knockout, and doubly-compromised E. coli, P. aeruginosa, and A. baumannii that allow us to dissect the individual contributions of outer/inner membrane penetration and active efflux to net accumulation, using a kinetic model that accurately recapitulates available experimental data. Moreover, we have developed machine learning and neural network approaches to QSAR (quantitative structure–activity relationship) modeling of pharmacological properties that will now be used to develop predictive cheminformatic models for Gram-negative accumulation, penetration, and efflux. This project will be carried out by a multidisciplinary SPEAR-GN Project Team (Small-molecule Penetration & Efflux in Antibiotic-Resistant Gram-Negatives, “speargun”) involving the labs of Derek Tan (MSK, PI), Helen Zgurskaya (OU, PI), Bradley Sherborne (Merck, Lead Collaborator), Valentin Rybenkov (OU, Co-I), Adam Duerfeldt (OU, Co-I), Carl Balibar (Merck, Collaborator), and David McLaren (Merck, Collaborator), comprising extensive combined expertise in organic and diversity-oriented synthesis, biochemistry, microbiology, high- throughput screening, mass spectrometry, biophysical modeling, cheminformatics, and medicinal chemistry. Herein, we will design and synthesize chemical libraries with diverse structural and physicochemical properties; analyze their accumulation in the isogenic strain sets in both high-throughput and high-density assay formats; extract kinetic parameters for penetration and efflux from the resulting experimental datasets; develop and validate robust QSAR models for accumulation, penetration, and efflux; and demonstrate the utility of these models in medicinal chemistry campaigns to develop novel Gram-negative antibiotics against three targets. This project will provide a major advance in the field of antibacterial drug discovery, providing powerful enabling tools to the scientific community to address this major threat to public health. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Predictive Models for Small-Molecule Accumulation in Gram-Negative Bacteria. Antibiotic-resistant Gram-negative bacteria pose a growing threat to public health in the U.S. and globally. A major obstacle to the development of new antibiotics to combat such infections is our poor understanding of the chemical requirements for small molecules to enter Gram-negative cells and to avoid ejection by efflux pumps. The proposed comprehensive, multidisciplinary research program aims to develop predictive computational tools to identify such molecules by carrying out large-scale, quantitative analyses of the accumulation of diverse small molecules in Gram-negative bacteria. These tools will then enable medicinal chemistry campaigns to develop novel antibiotics.",Predictive Models for Small-Molecule Accumulation in Gram-Negative Bacteria,9982190,R01AI136795,"['Acinetobacter baumannii', 'Address', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents', 'Antibiotic Resistance', 'Antibiotics', 'Architecture', 'Bacteria', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemistry', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Availability', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Effectiveness', 'Escherichia coli', 'Gram-Negative Bacteria', 'Gram-Negative Bacterial Infections', 'Human', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Kinetics', 'Knock-out', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Mammalian Cell', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Membrane', 'Microbiology', 'Modeling', 'Oral', 'Partner in relationship', 'Penetration', 'Pharmaceutical Chemistry', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Property', 'Pseudomonas aeruginosa', 'Public Health', 'Quantitative Evaluations', 'Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Role', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Variant', 'analog', 'base', 'biophysical model', 'cell envelope', 'cheminformatics', 'combat', 'computerized tools', 'density', 'design', 'drug discovery', 'efflux pump', 'high throughput screening', 'improved', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'kinetic model', 'lead optimization', 'learning network', 'multidisciplinary', 'neural network', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'screening', 'small molecule', 'small molecule libraries', 'success', 'tool']",NIAID,SLOAN-KETTERING INST CAN RESEARCH,R01,2020,1239304,0.00361189279585225
"Network modeling and robust estimation of the intraclass correlation coefficient to inform the design and analysis of cluster randomized trials for infectious diseases 7. Project Summary/Abstract There is an urgent need to support research that generates high-quality evidence to inform clinical decision making. Cluster randomized trials (CRTs) achieve the highest standard of evidence for the evaluation of community-level effectiveness of intervention strategies against infectious diseases. However, there is a need to develop new methods to improve the design and analysis of CRTs because unique and complicated analytical challenges arise in such settings. One such issue relates to the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), the degree to which individuals within a community are more similar to one another than to individuals in other communities. Design and analysis of CRTs must take into account the ICC. Lack of accurate information on the ICC jeopardizes the power of CRTs, leads to suboptimal choices of analysis methods and complicates the interpretation of study results. However, reliable information on the ICC is difficult to obtain. A robust and efficient approach for estimating ICCs is based on the second-order generalizing estimating equations. However, its use has been limited by considerable computational burden and poor convergence rates associated with the existing algorithms solving these equations. The first aim addresses these computational challenges. Missing data are ubiquitous and can lead to bias and loss of efficiency. The second aim proposes to develop novel robust and efficient methods for estimating ICCs in the presence of informative missing data. For infectious diseases, the underlying contact/transmission networks give rise to complicated correlation structure. The third aim is to develop network and epidemic models to project the ICC. User-friendly software will be developed to facilitate the implementation of new methods. An immediate application of the proposed methods is their application to the Botswana Combination Prevention Project to improve the estimation of intervention effect and to generate reliable ICC estimates for designing future CRTs in the same population. The proposed methods can be applied to other ongoing and future CRTs, and more broadly, to longitudinal studies and agreement studies where ICCs are also of great interest. The proposed research is significant, because success in addressing these issues will improve the ability to design efficient and well-powered CRTs and the precision in estimating the effects of intervention strategies. Innovation lies in the development of improved computing algorithms adapting approaches from deep learning, the use of semiparametric efficiency theory, and the integration of network modeling, epidemic modeling and statistical inference. The results of the proposed research will benefit both ongoing and future CRTs, permit more efficient use of the resources, and ultimately expedite the control of infectious diseases. 8. Project Narrative The proposed research is relevant to public health because improved methodologies for the design and analysis of cluster randomized trials will benefit both ongoing and future studies, permit more efficient use of the resources, and ultimately improve public health response intended to control the spread of infectious diseases. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to the part of NIAID’s mission that pertains to conducting and supporting research to prevent infectious diseases and to respond to emerging public health threats.",Network modeling and robust estimation of the intraclass correlation coefficient to inform the design and analysis of cluster randomized trials for infectious diseases,10011756,R01AI136947,"['AIDS prevention', 'Accounting', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Americas', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Botswana', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Cluster randomized trial', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Contracts', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Ebola', 'Effectiveness of Interventions', 'Epidemic', 'Equation', 'Evaluation', 'Future', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Individual', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease', 'Nosocomial Infections', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Prevention strategy', 'Probability', 'Public Health', 'Publications', 'Randomized', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Research Support', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Running', 'Science', 'Societies', 'Structure', 'System', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'clinical decision-making', 'collaboratory', 'deep learning', 'design', 'effectiveness evaluation', 'experience', 'high standard', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'intervention effect', 'mathematical model', 'network models', 'novel', 'prevent', 'response', 'semiparametric', 'success', 'systems research', 'theories', 'transmission process', 'user friendly software']",NIAID,"HARVARD PILGRIM HEALTH CARE, INC.",R01,2020,247413,0.02745922735931247
"Pan-vaccine Analysis to Test the Impact of Cytomegalovirus on Vaccine Efficacy PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infects around 50% of the US population. Even though the CMV exists in a latent state in healthy individuals, it profoundly shapes the immune system. Recent studies suggest that the CMV infection alters the immune response to influenza vaccine. However, the exact effect of CMV on the efficacy of the influenza vaccine remains controversial. In addition, how CMV shapes the immune responses toward other vaccines are unknown. We hypothesize that latent CMV infection induces critical changes in the immune system, which alters the efficacy of multiple types of vaccines. The ImmPort database currently hosts 133 vaccine studies, covering 21 types of vaccines, creating an unprecedented opportunity for us to test our hypothesis. We will perform a comprehensive meta-analysis to test the relationship between CMV and vaccine efficacies, and will use state-of-art statistical models (e.g., Dynamic Bayesian Network) to identify the mechanism by which CMV alters the vaccine response. Leveraging the group's expertise in computational immunology and rich datasets on ImmPort, we will address the following aims. Aim1: Test the effect of CMV on influenza vaccine outcome. We will perform a meta-analysis of 60 influenza studies available on ImmPort to test the impact of CMV. We will quantify and standardize the efficacy of influenza vaccine across studies, which are measured by hemagglutinin inhibition (HAI) assays before and after the vaccination. We will also determine the CMV infection status in subjects, either directly from serological tests or indirectly from immune- phenotyping data using cutting-edge machine learning tools. We will then test if CMV increases the response to influenza vaccine by analyzing data from all studies in a unified statistical framework while taking the heterogeneity between studies into account. Aim2: Bayesian network analysis of influenza vaccine response. We will harmonize multimodal immune-phenotyping data from the influenza vaccine studies, including transcriptomics data, cytometry data, and cytokine measurements. We will use state-of-art network analysis methods (e.g., Dynamic Bayesian network) to model the interplay between the immune components over time. Using the Bayesian network, we will investigate the mechanism by which CMV shapes the outcome of influenza vaccination. Aim3: Explore the effect of CMV infection on other vaccines. We will extend our analysis to vaccines other than influenza vaccine, (e.g., West Nile, Hepatitis B, yellow fever, malaria, and Tuberculosis). We will quantify the vaccine efficacy using assays specific to the vaccine type, such as Controlled Human Malaria Infection (CHMI) for the malaria vaccine and Plaque Reduction Neutralization Test for the yellow fever vaccine. We will perform separate network analyses to characterize the relationship between CMV and the immune response of individual vaccines. We will then perform joint analysis across vaccine types to identify the common impact of CMV across vaccine types. PROJECT NARRATIVE Infectious diseases remain an urgent problem, resulting in an estimated 3 million deaths worldwide and more than 110,000 deaths in the United States annually, but the efficacy of vaccines against many infectious diseases remains suboptimal, including malaria, influenza, and dengue. To improve the vaccines, it is crucial to understand the factors that affect the immune response toward vaccines. In this study, we investigate how cytomegalovirus affects the efficacy of multiple vaccines, providing valuable information for improving the design of vaccines.",Pan-vaccine Analysis to Test the Impact of Cytomegalovirus on Vaccine Efficacy,10026284,UH2AI153016,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Bayesian Analysis', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Bayesian Network', 'Biological Assay', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Computer Models', 'Cytomegalovirus', 'Cytomegalovirus Infections', 'Cytomegalovirus Vaccines', 'Cytometry', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Dengue', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Goals', 'Hemagglutinin', 'Hepatitis', 'Hepatitis B', 'Herpesviridae', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immune system', 'Immunology', 'Individual', 'Influenza', 'Influenza vaccination', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Malaria', 'Malaria Vaccines', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neutralization Tests', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Population', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Serologic tests', 'Shapes', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Models', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tuberculosis', 'United States', 'Vaccination', 'Vaccine Design', 'Vaccines', 'Validation', 'Virus', 'Virus Latency', 'West Nile virus', 'Yellow Fever', 'Yellow Fever Vaccine', 'cytokine', 'design', 'improved', 'individual response', 'influenza virus vaccine', 'malaria infection', 'multimodality', 'network models', 'pathogen', 'phenotypic data', 'response', 'tool', 'transcriptomics', 'vaccine efficacy', 'vaccine response', 'vaccine trial']",NIAID,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",UH2,2020,242126,-0.025481887961305787
"Preventing antimicrobial resistance and infections in hospitalized neonates in low resource settings Project Summary/Abstract Annually, 2.5 million babies die within the first four weeks of life, nearly a quarter due to infectious causes. Newborns admitted to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) are especially vulnerable, due to such factors as prematurity, an immature immune system, and need for life-sustaining invasive procedures and devices. In low and middle income countries (LMIC), an increasing number of NICUs care for premature and critically ill newborns. Healthcare-associated bloodstream infections (HA-BSI) in LMIC are more common due to inadequate infection prevention and control (IPC) and more difficult to treat due to high rates of antimicrobial resistance (AMR). Previous research in this setting focuses primarily on outbreak investigations and does not adequately describe risk factors for HA-BSI. Healthcare facilities lack effective tools to assess maternal and neonatal IPC and create improvement strategies. Preliminary data from the applicant's ongoing prospective cohort study that has enrolled over 6600 neonates in three NICUs in Pune, India, reinforces the high incidence of HA-BSI in this setting with a rate of 7.6 per 1000 patient-days, as well as high rates of AMR. Among Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates, the most common BSI pathogen, 96% are resistant to third-generation cephalosporins and 38% to carbapenems. Among neonates with BSI, mortality is 22%. Within the framework of this study, the following are proposed: (1) To identify modifiable risk factors for HA-BSI in the NICU; (2) To develop a model for predicting infection with carbapenem-resistant organisms (CRO); and (3) To develop and pilot a novel tool to assess IPC practices in the NICU and Labor & Delivery. Identifying risk factors for HA-BSI in the NICU will promote development of targeted IPC strategies. Creation of a prediction model using a decision tree algorithm will help identify babies at highest risk of CRO infections. Such a model can support NICU clinicians in selecting the right antibiotics when infection is suspected, reducing time to appropriate therapy and decreasing unnecessary use of last resort antibiotics such as colistin. Development of an IPC assessment tool that incorporates human factors engineering (HFE) principles will enable healthcare facilities to optimize IPC and reduce risk of hospital-acquired infections and associated mortality. This mentored research will train the applicant in advanced epidemiologic methods and application of IPC in LMIC. The applicant is a neonatologist at Johns Hopkins University committed to patient-oriented research in resource-limited settings. Her long-term goals are to become a leader in neonatal IPC in low resource settings and devise interventions to reduce global burden of HA-BSI and associated mortality. This K23 will facilitate skill development in longitudinal data analysis, prediction models, survey development, HFE, and qualitative data analysis. Training will include formal coursework, supervised data analysis, and mentorship by a team with expertise in infectious diseases, IPC, biostatistics, epidemiology, patient safety, and HFE. Collectively, the activities of this K23 will provide a pathway to an independent career as a clinical investigator with expertise in healthcare epidemiology and IPC in low resource settings. Project Narrative Worldwide, more than 600,000 newborns die from infections each year. India has one of the highest burdens of newborn deaths due to bacterial infections, which are commonly resistant to antibiotics. In this study, I will identify risk factors for newborn bloodstream infections, develop a method for predicting antibiotic-resistant infections, and create an infection prevention survey to reduce risk of infections in hospitalized babies in Indian Neonatal Intensive Care Units.",Preventing antimicrobial resistance and infections in hospitalized neonates in low resource settings,9871398,K23HD100594,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Antibiotic Resistance', 'Antibiotics', 'Antimicrobial Resistance', 'Assessment tool', 'Bacterial Infections', 'Biometry', 'Birth', 'Blood', 'Carbapenems', 'Caring', 'Cephalosporins', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Cohort Studies', 'Colistin', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Trees', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Engineering', 'Enrollment', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Epidemiology', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Gram-Negative Bacteria', 'Hand', 'Health care facility', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Hygiene', 'Immune system', 'Incidence', 'India', 'Infection', 'Infection Control', 'Infection prevention', 'Intensive Care', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Klebsiella pneumoniae', 'Length of Stay', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mechanical ventilation', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Neonatal', 'Neonatal Intensive Care Units', 'Neonatal Mortality', 'Newborn Infant', 'Nosocomial Infections', 'Organism', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pneumonia', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevalence', 'Principal Investigator', 'Procedures', 'Prospective cohort', 'Prospective cohort study', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Resistance to infection', 'Resort', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sepsis', 'Site', 'Supervision', 'Surveys', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Work', 'antibiotic resistant infections', 'bacterial resistance', 'base', 'biobank', 'carbapenem resistance', 'career', 'classification trees', 'clinical investigation', 'cohort', 'critically ill newborn', 'health care model', 'healthcare-associated infections', 'high risk', 'i(19)', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'infection risk', 'low and middle-income countries', 'modifiable risk', 'mortality', 'neonatal care', 'neonatal death', 'neonatal infection', 'neonatal sepsis', 'neonate', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'patient oriented research', 'patient safety', 'predictive modeling', 'premature', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'rectal', 'regression trees', 'skill acquisition', 'skills', 'tertiary care', 'tool', 'treatment strategy']",NICHD,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,K23,2020,170696,0.04568453956692262
"Effects of Host Metabolic Variation on Antibiotic Susceptibility ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Host variation affects the pathogenicity of, susceptibility to, and recovery from infectious diseases. Elucidating how the host environment alters antibiotic susceptibility is therefore a critical step towards the long-term goal of realizig precision medicine for the clinical management of infectious diseases. The overall objective of this project is to identify the metabolic pathways participating in antibiotic susceptibility and t determine how host metabolism may affect antibiotic treatments at the site of infection. The working hypothesis is that metabolic processes can function as bacterial control mechanisms for antibiotic susceptibility and that the host metabolome can act on these processes to affect the outcome of antibiotic treatment. This hypothesis will be tested in three specific aims: (1) identif metabolic pathways involved in antibiotic susceptibility (K99 phase); (2) characterize changes in the host metabolome elicited by antibiotic administration (K99 phase); (3) evaluate effects of the host metabolome on antibiotic killing (R00 phase). During the mentored K99 phase, bactericidal antibiotics will be counterscreened with various metabolites to identify metabolic perturbations that can affect antibiotic susceptibility. Metabolic pathways contributing to antibiotic lethality ill be identified by combining this data with metabolic modeling and machine learning. Additionally, plasma and peritoneal fluid will be sampled and metabolomically profiled from a mouse peritoneal infection model, with and without antibiotic treatment. These profiles will be used to determine if antibiotics can alter the host metabolism in ways that may affect antibiotic susceptibility at the site of infection. During the independent R00 phase, the effects of host metabolic variation on antibiotic killing will be systematically tested by quantifying antibiotic susceptibility in synthesized media defined by metabolomic profiles from published and measured human and mouse plasma samples. A better understanding of how the host metabolic environment participates in antibiotic treatment fits NIH's public health mission and has direct implications for the clinical management of infectious diseases. Work from the proposed studies will form a quantitative framework for directly evaluating how host metabolism may affect antibiotic treatment outcomes and guide improved antibiotic stewardship in clinical practice. Although the applicant has significant expertise in systems biology, this award will provide the applicant research training to gain new experimental skills and an opportunity for continued career training and mentorship from an advisory committee comprised of international leaders in systems biology, metabolomics, chemical biology and infectious diseases. The support and training provided by this award and by the advisory committee will provide the applicant tools and expertise critical to his future independent research program. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE (provided by applicant): Host variation alters the clinical response to antibiotic treatment for infectious disease, but the pathways underlying differences in patient outcome have not yet all been elucidated. The proposed research is relevant to public health because it is the first systematic investigation of how host metabolites may act on bacterial pathogen metabolism and alter antibiotic susceptibility. This work is relevant to NIH's public health mission by providing a quantitative framework for establishing precision medicine for the treatment of infectious diseases.",Effects of Host Metabolic Variation on Antibiotic Susceptibility,10088499,R00GM118907,"['Adjuvant', 'Advisory Committees', 'Affect', 'Antibiotic Resistance', 'Antibiotic Therapy', 'Antibiotic susceptibility', 'Antibiotics', 'Award', 'Bacteria', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Biology', 'C57BL/6 Mouse', 'Carbon', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Chemicals', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Culture Media', 'Data', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease Resistance', 'Environment', 'Escherichia coli', 'Formulation', 'Future', 'Germ-Free', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Human', 'Immunity', 'In Vitro', 'Infection', 'Innovative Therapy', 'International', 'Investigation', 'Knock-out', 'Knowledge', 'Light', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Pathway', 'Metabolism', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Nitrogen', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Peritoneal', 'Peritoneal Fluid', 'Peritoneal lavage', 'Phase', 'Phosphorus', 'Plasma', 'Predisposition', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Research Training', 'Sampling', 'Serum', 'Site', 'Source', 'Sulfur', 'Supplementation', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'Virulence', 'Work', 'bacterial metabolism', 'bactericide', 'base', 'biological adaptation to stress', 'career', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'commensal microbes', 'counterscreen', 'desensitization', 'genome-wide', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'infectious disease treatment', 'insight', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'microbial', 'novel therapeutics', 'overexpression', 'pathogen', 'pathogenic bacteria', 'precision medicine', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'respiratory', 'response', 'skills', 'tool', 'treatment strategy']",NIGMS,RBHS-NEW JERSEY MEDICAL SCHOOL,R00,2020,249000,0.05951414856600832
"Predictive Personalized Public Health (P3H): A Novel Paradigm to Treat Infectious Disease Challenge, Innovation and Impact: In recent years, we have demonstrated that it is feasible to predict epidemic disease outbreaks from retrospective seasonal and geographical case data and to show that we can take climate factors into account in our predictive models. We are moving closer to real-time prediction at the population level. But we have never used prediction at point-of-care for treating the individual patient.  Presently, personalized medicine uses delayed results of laboratory testing of individuals. For infectious disease, most of such testing has targeted the pathogen in the host-pathogen interaction. The role of laboratory testing is to modify therapy after a variable period of time delay. Personalized medicine today is reactive. Complicating matters further, many infectious epidemic diseases are strongly dependent on environmental factors and climate. Lastly, we want to name the pathogens we are fighting, but we really need to know the resistance characteristics to select therapy for patients effectively. Both speciation and resistance can now be determined from molecular data, which can be integrated into point-of-care treatment predictions.  We here propose a radically different approach to the treatment of infectious diseases. Our hypothesis is that the alternative to time-delayed and expensive laboratory analysis of specimens from individual patients, is to use predictive modeling to forecast point-of-care treatment. Time-delayed personalized testing can be conducted as surveillance, and that data used for real-time prediction to guide point-of-care treatment.  We will introduce predictive personalized public health (P3H) policy at the individual patient level, with the potential to substantially improve patient outcomes compared with our present reactive approaches. Our key rationale is to expand population infectious disease predictive modeling in order to achieve prediction for treatment at point-of-care. Our primary insight is that we can reposition the delayed reactive personalized testing from the urgent medical decision-making process, and into a predictive modeling framework. The gaps and opportunities in technology that we will address are four-fold. First, we will employ individual case geospatial mapping at a fine scale to take into account infection spread and environmental factors. Second, our ability to perform pan-microbial analysis using molecular techniques is now feasible. Third, modeling our novel fusion of data has no simple low-dimensional solution – but machine learning technologies are now capable of handling such big data assimilation, model discovery and prediction. Fourth, our proposal is not an academic exercise. We have a partnership with the economic planners within a developing country to design and implement our new methods. We will prospectively tune and validate our algorithms in real-time. Our deliverable will be an open-source framework ready for clinical trials testing and adaptation to the public health infrastructure in any country. Project Narrative We have made substantial progress in our abilities to track and predict infectious disease epidemics at the population level, but prediction has never been used at the individual level to guide treatment at point-of-care. The individual treatment for all infectious disease syndromes at point-of-care is presently empirical, because laboratory testing is reactive and time delayed. We here propose a novel framework to use rigorous prediction strategies to guide point-of-care treatment for infectious diseases, and to validate this approach under real-world conditions.",Predictive Personalized Public Health (P3H): A Novel Paradigm to Treat Infectious Disease,10006784,R01AI145057,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Antigens', 'Assimilations', 'Bacterial Meningitis', 'Bacteriology', 'Big Data', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Cholera', 'Climate', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Complex', 'Country', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Developed Countries', 'Developing Countries', 'Diagnostic', 'Diarrhea', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Economics', 'Engineering', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemic', 'Equilibrium', 'Exanthema', 'Exercise', 'Fever', 'Frequencies', 'Genus staphylococcus', 'Geography', 'HIV', 'Hand', 'Health Policy', 'Hospitals', 'Hybrids', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Infection', 'Infrastructure', 'Investments', 'Laboratories', 'Leadership', 'Leptospirosis', 'Machine Learning', 'Malaria', 'Measles', 'Medical', 'Medical emergency', 'Melioidosis', 'Meningitis', 'Methods', 'Microbiology', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Names', 'Newborn Infant', 'Paralysed', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Preventive', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Reaction', 'Resistance', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Sepsis', 'Specimen', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Uganda', 'Work', 'acute infection', 'antimicrobial', 'authority', 'climate data', 'cost', 'cost outcomes', 'data fusion', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'fighting', 'flu', 'global health', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'infectious disease model', 'infectious disease treatment', 'innovation', 'insight', 'microbial', 'mortality', 'neonatal infection', 'novel', 'open source', 'pathogen', 'personalized medicine', 'personalized predictions', 'point of care', 'predictive modeling', 'prospective', 'resistance gene', 'spreading factor', 'surveillance data']",NIAID,PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIV HERSHEY MED CTR,R01,2020,1627982,0.03837620758696576
"MS Diagnostic Bacterial Identification Library PROJECT SUMMARY Infectious diseases have a substantial global health impact. Clinicians need rapid and accurate diagnoses of infections to direct patient treatment and improve antibiotic stewardship, but current methodologies face severe limitations in this regard. In the first funding cycle of our MPI grant “GM111066 - MS diagnostic bacterial identification library,” we produced a novel diagnostic platform in which microbial membrane glycolipids analyzed by mass spectrometry represent chemical “fingerprints” that were then used to differentiate Gram- negative and –positive and fungal isolates after mono- or poly-microbial growth in standard laboratory medias or complex biological (urine, blood bottles, and would effluent). In the second funding cycle, we aim to improve the diagnostic as discussed below.  At the start this project, it had not been previously shown that bacterial or fungal membrane lipids could provide a unique chemical signature or barcode that could be used for reliable pathogen identification. The fact that these lipids (Gram-: LPS/lipid A, Gram+: Lipoteichoic acid/cardiolipin, Fungi: glycerophospholipids, sphingolipids, and sterols) are present in high abundance (~106 copies per cell) makes them easily extractable with a single rapid LPS-based protocol (less than 60 minutes from sample to MS identification). Importantly, for clinical use, we successfully used our platform to solve these four major unmet needs from the protein-based phenotyping approach: 1) removed the need for growth prior to MS analysis, 2) identification of bacterial and fungal isolates with a single extraction protocol, 3) identification directly from complex biological fluids, including urine, BAL fluid, wound effluent, and blood bottles, and 4) antimicrobial resistant strains could be distinguished from the related susceptible strain. Finally, based on our thirteen peer-reviewed publications from the first funding period and extensive preliminary data, we believe we have proven our highly innovative original hypothesis and even advanced it past the original aims by using a design of experiment (DOE) process to allow identification in under an hour direct from specimen.  In the second funding cycle, we propose to further innovate by i) using DOE to improve limit of detection (LOD) from 106 to 103 which is the threshold for urinary tract infections; ii) extend the assay to direct analysis of urine and stool samples without culture; iii) develop machine learning approaches to improve identification of individual bacteria from polymicrobial infections; iv) expand detection of antimicrobial resistance beyond colistin; v) develop a method for identification and structure analysis of lipids isolated from 100-1000 cells; and vi) vastly expand our ability to identify pathogenic fungi, which are a growing healthcare issue, and Gram- positive organisms. PROJECT NARRATIVE Failure to identify bacterial and fungal infections rapidly places an enormous financial burden on the U.S. health system totaling billions annually with complications from minor events extending hospital stays to death from sepsis. We have developed a lipid-based MS method for bacterial and fungal identification that can be carried out in under an hour direct from specimen. Here, we will further develop this method for use in the study of complex biological fluids, including stool, urine, and blood bottles without culture. Specifically, we will improve the limit of detection in order to distinguish microbial load at or below 103 CFU/ml ! !",MS Diagnostic Bacterial Identification Library,9969799,R01AI147314,"['Address', 'Animal Model', 'Antibiotics', 'Antimicrobial Resistance', 'Bacteria', 'Bacterial Infections', 'Bacterial Proteins', 'Bar Codes', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Blood', 'Cardiolipins', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Chemicals', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Microbiology', 'Colistin', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Escherichia coli', 'Event', 'Face', 'Failure', 'Feces', 'Financial Hardship', 'Funding', 'General Hospitals', 'Glycerophospholipids', 'Glycolipids', 'Grant', 'Growth', 'Health care facility', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Hour', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Intensive Care', 'Ions', 'Laboratories', 'Laboratory Research', 'Length of Stay', 'Libraries', 'Lipid A', 'Lipids', 'Liquid substance', 'MALDI-TOF Mass Spectrometry', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Membrane', 'Membrane Lipids', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Microbe', 'Minor', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mycoses', 'Organism', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Peer Review', 'Phenotype', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publications', 'Rivers', 'Sampling', 'Sepsis', 'Solid', 'Specimen', 'Speed', 'Sphingolipids', 'Sterols', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Urinary tract infection', 'Urine', 'Work', 'accurate diagnosis', 'antimicrobial', 'base', 'biodefense', 'chemical fingerprinting', 'chemotherapy', 'clinically relevant', 'combat', 'cost', 'design', 'experimental study', 'feature extraction', 'fungus', 'global health', 'improved', 'innovation', 'lipoteichoic acid', 'microbial', 'mortality', 'new technology', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'novel therapeutics', 'pathogen', 'pathogenic fungus', 'point of care', 'rapid diagnosis', 'resistant strain', 'simulation', 'software development', 'stool sample', 'tandem mass spectrometry', 'tool', 'ward', 'wound']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND BALTIMORE,R01,2020,463500,0.03325467457264244
"Fluomics: The Next Generation Influenza A virus is a major human respiratory pathogen, and available vaccines and antivirals are of limited efficacy. In order to identify novel targets for therapeutic intervention during influenza virus infection, we have assembled an interdisciplinary team that uses a highly integrated systems level approach to identify and validate key genes/networks involved in virus pathogenesis. The overarching theme of our multidisciplinary proposal “FluOMICS: The NEXT Generation” is to obtain multiple OMICS-based systems level measurements and integrate them using modeling approaches and machine learning algorithms to identify and validate 1) host-virus networks that modulate influenza A virus disease severity, 2) biomarkers in blood that reflect the activation states of these networks and 3) novel host targets for therapeutic interventions. Our underlying main hypothesis is that host networks involved in viral replication and early host responses regulate disease outcomes and represent targets for therapeutic intervention. The proposed studies leverage on our previous collaborations that generated global datasets and models that predict severity of disease caused by three influenza virus strains with different levels of virulence. While our previous studies gave many novel insights in influenza pathogenesis, they likely provide a narrow window on the determinants of disease severity in humans. Thus, it is necessary expand beyond the specific virus strains that were used to study pathogenesis, and explore a broader context of viral and host perturbations linked to clinical outcomes. In order to identify clinically relevant networks involved in influenza virus pathogenesis we propose to integrate into predictive and comprehensive models global responses during influenza virus infection in three systems 1) human blood from a human cohort of patients with documented influenza virus infection and diverse clinical outcomes (Project 1); 2) mouse blood and tissues from experimentally infected animals under a variety of conditions and perturbations resulting in diverse disease outcomes (Project 1) and 3) relevant primary human cells (Project 2). Samples will be processed and send to the Technology Core for global transcriptomics, proteomics and metabolomics analysis. OMICS data sets will be integrated and compared by the Modeling Core to generate network models of disease, uncover blood biomarkers and identify key drivers as targets for therapeutic intervention. Predicted network regulators will be used as a source for subsequent iterative rounds of perturbations to refine existing and to identify new network disease models. Data and models will be managed and disseminated by the Data Management and Bioinformatics Core. We expect that these studies will uncover and validate novel pathogenic networks, blood biomarkers associated with them, and specific therapeutic targets to revert pathogenic networks. In summary, our modeling approaches will find correlates and associations between diverse experimental systems that will help us define human blood biomarkers, and link them to in vivo and ex vivo signatures for both companion diagnostics and personalized therapies.

"Systems Biology Approach to Redefine Susceptibility Testing and Treatment of MDR Pathogens in the Context of Host Immunity   Project Summary    For something as complex and multifaceted as bacterial antibiotic resistance (AR), our drug evaluation  paradigm is strikingly narrow and homogenous: MIC/MBC testing in standardized bacteriologic media. We  have shown that this drug evaluation paradigm is inadequate, even misleading, as changes in the media  conditions of the procedure lead to dramatically different results. A more holistic definition of antibiotic therapy  that centers on understanding antibiotic activity in synergy with host innate immune factors such as cationic  antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), serum and phagocytic cells (e.g. neutrophils) reveals therapeutic options  unrecognized in standard testing. The proposed U01 program represents a groundbreaking approach to use  systems biology approaches and inform more effective antibiotic utilization in the context of host innate  immunity. We propose to: 1) build an iterative systems biology workflow that integrates multiple experimental  and computational approaches to give a comprehensive assessment of AR; and 2) apply this workflow to high  priority pathogens to systematically elucidate AR mechanisms and their condition­dependency. The iterative  workflow includes: (i) omics and physiological data generation.  Clinically isolated strains of the selected  pathogens will be grown under conventional testing (bacteriologic media) and more physiologic conditions  (tissue culture media, serum, and in presence of AMPs and neutrophils) to probe for advantageous gain of  activity.  The omics data types collected are: DNA resequencing, RNAseq, and metabolomics.  (ii)  Bioinformatics and data modeling analysis involves three approaches: big data analysis for data set  dimensionality and coarse grained variable dependencies assessment, genome­scale modeling for  mechanistic elucidation and analysis, and machine learning that uses AR­related metadata to classify the  overall biological functions. This analysis will lead to understanding of AR mechanisms.  (iii) Multi­scale  validation from animal models, to laboratory evolution, to cytology, to gene expression alteration, to structural  protein analysis of putative targets. The validation thus ranges from host behavior to atomistic detail of  ligand­target interactions. The iterative loop then closes, comparing computational prediction to experimental  outcomes. False­negative and false­positive predictions are then algorithmically analyzed by a hypothesis  generating family of algorithms that then makes suggestions about what conditions to use in the next iteration  of the loop.  The pathogens that we will focus on are methicillin­resistant ​Staphylococcus aureus ​(MRSA), the  carbapenem­resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) Klebsiella ​pneumoniae ​and ​Acinetobacter baumannii,​ and  Pseudomonas aeruginosa​. The team of investigators has made the foundational observations and led the  development of the technologies on which the iterative workflow is based. A multi­ and genome­scale methods  of systems biology fulfills requirements of RFA­AI­14­064 to which it responds.

"Successful Clinical Response In Pneumonia Therapy (SCRIPT) Systems Biology Center Modified Project Summary/Abstract Section  This innovative integrated systems biology application seeks to delineate the complex host/pathogen interactions occurring at the alveolar level that lead to unsuccessful response to therapy in serious pneumonia, including serious viral pneumonia. To achieve this objective, we will leverage our unique access to alveolar fluid collected as part of routine clinical care in mechanically ventilated patients with suspected pneumonia in our medical intensive care unit. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid will be obtained serially from well characterized mechanically ventilated patients with serious viral or Pseudomonas or Acinetobacter bacterial pneumonias. Both of these CDC-designated serious hazard level bacterial pathogens have clinical failure rates as high as 50%. A robust clinical definition will allow comparison of both host and pathogen signatures associated with failure of therapy vs. success. These clinical specimens and extensive patient phenomics will anchor two mutually supportive and iterative research projects. Project One will deploy robust tools for flow sorting macrophage and lymphocyte subset populations, isolating RNA from these populations, and performing transcriptomic and epigenomic analysis to compare successful and unsuccessful host response. Project Two will focus on both specific pathogen genomic profiles associated with unsuccessful outcome and the differential microbiome response. Specific pathogen genomic profiles identified will be tested for causality in a unique humanized alveolar macrophage mouse model by the Technology Core. Changes in microbiome communities will be comprehensively assessed by shotgun deep sequencing to detect bacteriophage, other virus, and fungal DNA, in addition to bacterial. A Technical Core will perform cell sorting of BAL macrophage and lymphocyte subsets, RNA sequencing, and whole genome methylation, as well as perform the mouse pneumonia model studies. A Data Management and Bioinformatics Core will develop tools to reduce the dimensionality of these large comprehensive datasets, including the clinical phenomics, and provide them to the Modeling Core. The Modeling Core will then use an ecosystem-based approach to this complex adaptive system combined with unique machine learning tools and neural networks to generate biomarkers of host, pathogen and/or microbiome patterns predictive of successful pneumonia outcome. Predictive biomarkers developed in the Modeling Core will then be validated in a prospective confirmatory cohort of patients in whom analogous data will be generated. Biomarkers will also be tested for causality the mouse model. The Administrative Core will perform the outward- facing role of education and outreach to the community and sponsor, as well as regularly exchanging datasets, analytic tools, and specimens with NIH-sponsored/approved repository sites.

"Modeling of infectious network dynamics for surveillance, control and prevention enhancement (MINDSCAPE) PROJECT SUMMARY: Mathematical analysis, computational statistics, and machine learning are increasingly being deployed to understand and predict the dynamics of healthcare associated infections (HAI) and antimicrobial-resistant infections (ARI). However, the utility of these models to guiding clinical and health policy decisions often remains unclear. One challenge is that model calibration quickly becomes obsolete as the epidemiology of HAI and ARI changes. To address this gap, we propose to use mathematical modeling and machine learning approaches to build decision-making technologies that improve the risk assessment, prevention, and control of HAI and ARI. Our proposed technologies account for spatial and temporal dynamics, provide continuous, real-time feedback to clinicians and are robust to changes in risk factors and disease prevalence over time. We anticipate that implementation of these technological improvements will help healthcare institutions to substantially reduce the burden of HAI and ARI. We concentrate our efforts on two of the most important HAI: methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Clostridioides difficile infections. To conduct these studies, we assembled a team of mathematical modelers, machine learning specialists, health economists, clinical informaticists, infectious disease physicians, and hospital epidemiologists based in California, New York, and Texas. Clinical, microbiological and environmental data to train our models will come from three academic quaternary medical centers and an expanding network of community hospitals. The first aim is to calculate the patient-specific risk of acquiring or transmitting a HAI or ARI. We hypothesize that the risk of acquiring an HAI or ARI is more accurately determined when data on patient movement and pathogen exposure are integrated into predictive models. This type of analysis is also expected to improve the risk assessment of automated systems used to detect HAI and ARI outbreaks. The second aim is to prevent invasive methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections. One objective is to show that cost-effective reduction of invasive MRSA infections and hospital-based transmission can be achieved via personalized decisions for who should be screened for asymptomatic carriage and decolonized. Our third aim is to control the spread of Clostridioides difficile infections (CDI). We hypothesize that by calculating the number of CDI averted and the cost saved, models of disease transmission will demonstrate the benefit pre- emptive adoption of contact precautions for patients who are at high risk of transmitting CDI. We also expect to identify environmental pathways that contribute to the risk of CDI superspreading and would benefit from enhanced surveillance and decontamination. Finally, to better understand the importance of antibiotic stewardship programs, we characterize the specific role a patient's antibiotic, infection, social, exposure and colonization history plays in the personal risk of acquiring an invasive MRSA infection and CDI. PROJECT NARRATIVE We propose to use mathematical modeling, agent-based simulation and machine learning approaches to build decision-making technologies that improve the risk assessment, prevention and control of healthcare- associated infections and antibiotic-resistant infections. Our proposed technologies will account for spatial and temporal dynamics, provide continuous, real-time feedback to clinicians and are robust to changes in risk factors and disease prevalence over time.

"Molecular Signatures of Early-Onset Neonatal Sepsis in Umbilical Cord Blood PROJECT SUMMARY Early-onset sepsis (EOS) due to invasive bacterial infection is a leading cause of morbidity in infants and disproportionately affects those born preterm. Accurate diagnosis of EOS remains inadequate. The low sensitivity and delayed time to culture results combined with the poor predictive values of available laboratory markers leads to our inability to rule-out EOS. Thus, infants are exposed to extended duration broad-spectrum empiric antibiotics, which have serious associated adverse consequences such as necrotizing enterocolitis, antibiotic resistant infections, and an altered microbiome. The proposed research will apply proteomics to identify gestational age-specific umbilical cord blood markers toward development of a proposed diagnostic tool with strong negative risk prediction for EOS. Cord blood is promising to identify EOS as it reflects the intrauterine environment where infection originates in preterm birth. In previous work, we found that inflammatory proteins serum amyloid A, C-reactive protein and haptoglobin are substantially elevated in cord blood of preterm infants with culture-confirmed EOS. These data inform our hypothesis that a combination of cord blood proteins provides a signature to differentiate impending EOS and uninfected states. Archived cord blood from infants in an existing longitudinal cohort will be used in a nested case-control design. Aim 1 will measure the cord blood proteome of uninfected infants (controls) across gestational ages using an untargeted proteomics approach to characterize the developmental spectrum. Aim 2(a) will then determine the cord blood proteome signatures of infants with confirmed EOS (cEOS) and culture-negative presumed sepsis (PS). cEOS will be compared to matched controls to identify differentially expressed proteins and candidate markers. PS proteomes will be analyzed to help delineate true infection versus inflammatory subtypes in this heterogeneous group. Bioinformatics pathway analysis may provide novel insights into fetal immune response. Aim 2(b) will determine the best combination of markers to exclude EOS through machine learning decision analysis of proteomics data. Paired placental proteomics in Aim 2(c) will explore origins of fetal inflammation. Aim 3(a) will quantify candidate proteins by an orthogonal immunoassay method. In a validation set of new subjects, Aim 3(b) will measure candidate markers by targeted proteomics and test application of the proposed diagnostic tool. With formal didactics and a mentorship team at Northwestern University with expertise in prematurity, sepsis, biomarker discovery, biostatistics, and decision modeling led by Patrick Seed MD Ph.D., the candidate will gain advanced translational research experience and skills in perinatal research study design, advanced immunology, proteomics, and bioinformatics to further her research agenda. The proposed research and career development will be fundamental towards achieving the candidate’s career goals to: 1) lead a clinical-translational research program on the pathophysiology and host responses of perinatal infection and 2) bring new, reliable sepsis diagnostics to clinical practice, to improve neonatal outcomes through targeted treatment of EOS and antibiotic stewardship. PROJECT NARRATIVE Invasive bacterial infections in newborns carry a high risk of complications and death, yet current diagnostic methods are inaccurate, resulting in the harmful overuse of antibiotics. The proposed work will develop a multi- factor diagnostic model for early-onset neonatal sepsis using umbilical cord blood proteins as biomarkers and enhance our understanding of fetal immune response.

"Improving Empiric Antimicrobial Therapy for Gram-Negative Infections through a Personalized Smart Antibiogram Project Summary/Abstract Increasing antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is one of the most urgent public health threats. In 2019, the Center for Diseases Control and Prevention (CDC) estimated that infections with AMR affect at least 2.8 million people and are associated with at least 35,900 excessive deaths annually in the US. This threat is particularly problematic among Gram-negative rod (GNR) pathogens in which high-rates of resistance to last-line antimicrobials have emerged globally, while our efforts to develop new antimicrobials have stumbled. To decelerate the emergence of AMR among GNR pathogens, it is essential to guide clinicians away from choosing unnecessarily broad-spectrum antimicrobials. An antibiogram, a facility-level summary of antimicrobial susceptibility data, is a common local reference tool which clinicians use when choosing empiric therapy. However, antibiograms have major limitations. First, little is known about how clinicians are currently using them when making empiric therapy decision. Second, antibiogram data is aggregated at the facility-level, and data may be skewed based on the type of practice or geographic area. Lastly, but most importantly, an antibiogram does not consider any patient-level factors. Therefore, there are strong, and pressing needs to understand 1) how an antibiogram is used by the clinician, 2) how much an antibiogram reflects the risk of AMR for individual patients and 3) how we can overcome limitations of antibiogram to optimize empiric therapy and reduce AMR. The overall goal is to create a novel, real-time personalized antibiogram (“Smart Antibiogram”) to overcome current limitations of antibiogram and to optimize clinician choice of empiric therapy for GNRs by providing a “predicted risk of AMR” based on a machine learning model incorporating patient- and facility-level data. This goal will be accomplished through (a) Master of Science in Health Informatics coursework, (b) a Mentorship Advisory Committee, (c) carefully selected conferences and workshops, and (d) a mentored research study. Our specific aims are to (1) Characterize the current use of antibiograms in clinical practice and measure the acceptable risk of resistance when clinicians make empiric therapy decisions for Gram-negative bloodstream infections and urinary tract infections within diverse clinical settings; (2) Assess the accuracy of currently-used antibiograms to predict the risk of resistance for individual patients in a large retrospective microbiology cohort for GNR infections; (3) Develop a machine learning model to predict the individualized risk of AMR for patients infected with GNR pathogens and validate prospectively and externally. This will lead to the future development of a personalized decision support tool (“Smart Antibiogram”). The expected outcomes of this AHRQ K08 Award will be the comprehensive understanding of the effectiveness and limitations of antibiogram, and the informatics toolkits to develop Smart Antibiogram. At the end of this K08 Award, the candidate will be well-prepared to become an independent investigator with expertise in AMR and health informatics, with specific strength in AMR prediction model decision-support system. Project Narrative Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) among Gram-negative rod organisms is one of the most urgent public health threats in the United States and globally. By using series of survey of clinicians, retrospective cohort analyses, and machine learning prediction analytics, this study elucidates the current perceptions for AMR among providers and creates a machine learning model to accurately predict AMR risk at patient-level. The findings from this study will help create a decision-support system to guide clinicians for appropriate empiric therapy to treat infections due to Gram-negative rod organisms and prepare the applicant for a career as an independent infectious diseases health service investigator.",Improving Empiric Antimicrobial Therapy for Gram-Negative Infections through a Personalized Smart Antibiogram,10124644,K08HS027472,[' '],AHRQ,UNIVERSITY OF IOWA,K08,2020,144640,0.02924910034639903
"Optimized identification of therapeutic bacterial strains in ulcerative colitis PROJECT SUMMARY Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic gut inflammatory condition thought to be caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Therapeutic options are only partially effective in inducing and maintaining remission, and there is currently no cure for UC. Recent studies have found the microbiome of UC patients is distinct compared to that of healthy controls, suggesting that the microbiome could be a promising therapeutic target. Fecal microbiota transplant (FMT) has been extremely successful in the treatment of colitis caused by Clostridium difficile infection, further demonstrating the potential for bacterial therapeutics. The recently completed FOCUS (Faecal Microbiota Transplantation in Ulcerative Colitis) trial has demonstrated that FMT from healthy donors can induce clinical remission in 27% of UC patients compared to only 8% in the placebo group. However, we still lack an understanding of the exact mechanisms by which FMT is able to modulate disease pathogenesis. The overarching hypothesis of this proposal is that UC remission after FMT is induced by specific bacteria, and that accurate identification of bacterial strains will be paramount to develop microbial therapeutics for UC. To test this hypothesis, we will first develop a novel ensemble method to identify bacterial species and strains from deep metagenomic data. This method combines software tools using a voting algorithm that is weighted based on the accuracy of each tool. The accuracy of this method will be tested using microbial culture collections from UC patients, in silico simulations, and a bacterial mock community as gold standards. We will then apply this approach to metagenomic data generated from the FOCUS study in order to identify bacterial strains that are associated with UC remission. This will be performed by using established supervised learning techniques, as well as through a novel method based on co- occurrence network analysis that identifies clusters of bacteria that act synergistically. Based on these results, we will finally validate our findings using a gnotobiotic model of colitis. The prophylactic and/or therapeutic potential of candidate bacteria will be tested by inoculating them to gnotobiotic mice colonized with the microbiota of UC patients and with colitis induced through the transfer of naïve T cells. Our proposal will be the first to address the question of how specific bacteria modulate disease progression in a randomized trial of FMT in UC through the development of more sensitive and accurate methods for strain characterization that can be experimentally validated. The rational design of our strategy to identify therapeutic bacteria will produce highly translational results that can be used to guide future clinical trials in UC. PROJECT NARRATIVE Finding novel approaches to prevent and treat ulcerative colitis (UC) is a pressing clinical need. This project investigates the role of bacterial strains as predictors of UC remission after fecal microbiota transplant, and presents novel methods to identify therapeutic strains that will be tested in a mouse model of colitis.",Optimized identification of therapeutic bacterial strains in ulcerative colitis,10017191,R01DK114038,"['Achievement', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Bacteria', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clostridium difficile', 'Colitis', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Disease remission', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Etiology', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Gnotobiotic', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Immune response', 'Incidence', 'Infection', 'Inflammatory', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Metagenomics', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Onset of illness', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Patients', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Probiotics', 'Property', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Shotguns', 'Societies', 'Software Tools', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Ulcerative Colitis', 'United States', 'Voting', 'bacterial community', 'base', 'clinical remission', 'cohort', 'design', 'fecal transplantation', 'improved', 'in silico', 'learning network', 'learning strategy', 'metagenome', 'metagenomic sequencing', 'method development', 'microbial', 'microbiome', 'microbiota', 'mouse model', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'outcome prediction', 'placebo group', 'potential biomarker', 'predicting response', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'probiotic therapy', 'prophylactic', 'randomized trial', 'response', 'simulation', 'supervised learning', 'therapeutic target', 'tool']",NIDDK,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R01,2020,254179,0.020206014286094014
"In silico Randomized Control Trial Framework for Assessing Infection Control and Prevention Interventions in the Hospital Project Summary/Abstract Multidrug-resistant organisms (MDROs), particularly carbapenem-resistant organisms (CROs), are a major cause of healthcare-associated infections (HAIs). Though studies have found multiple interventions addressing MDRO colonization and transmission to be effective at reducing HAIs, implementation has lagged due to uncertainty regarding the most efficacious combinations of interventions. As patients are connected within healthcare facilities by the movement of healthcare workers (HCWs) and mobile equipment, evaluation of an intervention's impact on transmission and infection must consider these network dynamics. Additionally, each institution has its own staffing ratios, equipment management, and cleaning practices that inform the efficacy of an intervention. To address knowledge gaps regarding the most effective combinations of intervention strategies at an individual hospital, we will build a model framework that will provide hospital administrators and infection control experts with tools for quantifying individual patient risk factors for colonization and infection and for comparing the potential effectiveness of interventions to control HAIs. The aims of the project are: (1) to develop models to predict which patients are at highest risk for colonization and infection with MDROs using clinically relevant information collected during the normal course of care combined with operational data on staffing and equipment movement; (2) to utilize hospital- level models to quantify the combinatorial relationship between, and marginal impact of, additional interventions to reduce HAIs; and (3) to build a framework for other hospitals and healthcare systems to examine the effectiveness of interventions parameterized by their own institution's data. Models will start with the patient at the center, utilizing the rich covariate data stored in electronic health records to develop prediction models based on advanced machine learning. These prediction models will be translatable tools that can be directly incorporated into clinical care to assist clinicians in preventing HAIs. Data on patient-connectedness will form the foundation of hospital-level models that will allow for detailed examinations of the effectiveness of different combinations of interventions. Finally, a generalizable framework will be constructed and tested across a network of healthcare facilities. These models will directly inform CDC guidelines about MDRO prevention and aid clinicians in reducing the risk of HAIs. Project Narrative The models developed through this proposal will improve understanding of how biological factors associated with the transmission of multidrug-resistant organisms (MDRO) impact interventions to reduce hospital-associated infections (HAIs). This will aid predictions of patients' risk for colonization and infection, as well as improve understanding of how interventions can most effectively be combined to reduce the likelihood that patients will suffer from these high-consequence pathogens.",In silico Randomized Control Trial Framework for Assessing Infection Control and Prevention Interventions in the Hospital,10110718,U01CK000589,[' '],NCEZID,"CENTER/ DISEASE DYNAMICS, ECONOM/POLICY",U01,2020,550000,0.011829627647599835
"An expert-guided machine-learning approach to estimate the incidence, risk and harms associated with diagnostic delays for infectious diseases. Project Summary / Abstract Diagnostic errors are increasingly recognized as a cause of pain, suffering and increased healthcare costs. Diagnostic delays are an important class of diagnostic errors. While many diagnostic errors occur in hospital settings, emergency departments visits may be especially important to consider because they treat critically ill patients and because most decisions to admit patients to the hospital are made in emergency departments. Thus, to enable a more complete understanding of diagnostic delays requires consideration of healthcare visits across a range of healthcare settings including clinic visits, emergency department visits and hospitalizations. Delays in diagnosing infectious diseases are important to consider. For contagious infectious diseases, diagnostic delays increase the risk of additional exposures, potentially generating more cases. Second, many infectious diseases can be effectively treated, but even short delays in treatment lead to worse clinical outcomes. However, with the exception of a few infectious diseases (e.g., tuberculosis), diagnostic delays for infectious diseases are understudied. Thus, there is a critical need to investigate the incidence, risk factors and clinical impact for diagnostic delays for infectious diseases. The overarching goal of our research is to investigate diagnostic delays associated with infectious diseases using existing data along with methods from the fields of computer science and statistics. While our research relies upon “big data”, we will also use clinical experts to review and contribute to all of our results. Our subject matter experts incorporate expertise in infectious diseases, emergency medicine, acute care, medical education, diagnostic reasoning, healthcare epidemiology, public health, industry, and professional infectious disease societies. Specifically, we will 1) determine the incidence of diagnostic delays for a wide range of infectious diseases; 2) identify the risk factors associated with diagnostic delays for infectious diseases that are frequently delayed or have serious outcomes; and 3) estimate the impact of diagnostic delays in terms of healthcare costs and mortality. With our data, methods and clinical experts, we will be able to translate our results into future interventions designed to decrease diagnostic delays and improve healthcare outcomes. In addition, while our proposal focuses on infectious diseases, the methods and approaches that we will develop can be adopted to investigate non-infectious diseases and conditions. Project Narrative Diagnostic delays for infectious diseases contribute to worse clinical outcomes, increased healthcare costs and, for some infectious diseases, outbreaks of great public health importance. We will use existing large data sets along with machine-learning techniques and expert clinical guidance to detect patterns of healthcare visits representing diagnostic delays. Our goal is to characterize the incidence, risk factors and clinical impact of diagnostic delays for a wide range of infectious diseases to inform future interventions.","An expert-guided machine-learning approach to estimate the incidence, risk and harms associated with diagnostic delays for infectious diseases.",10017203,R01HS027375,[' '],AHRQ,UNIVERSITY OF IOWA,R01,2020,496235,0.03948019480234192
"Neurovirulent HSV-1 Recombinants for vQTL Analysis Abstract Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) is a significant human pathogen and is the leading cause of sporadic encephalitis in the USA. Strains of virus display virulence phenotypes ranging from avirulent to highly pathogenic. There are indications that the virulence of a given strain of virus is actually determined by the “constellation” of genes carried by the virus and how they interact with each other; a phenomenon termed epistasis. Traditional methods for analyzing the function of viral genes are difficult to apply to studying epistatic interactions in virulence. Recently we described a novel approach, vQTLmap, that has allowed us to identify contributions of multiple genes to peripheral disease phenotypes. To date we have analyzed four quantitative phenotypes, blepharitis, stromal keratitis, corneal neovascularization, and weight loss. Surprisingly, there are distinct differences in the viral genes that appear to be driving each of these phenotypes. In order to carry out vQTLmap using quantitative measures of neurovirulence, we need to isolate additional neurovirulent recombinants between the OD4 and CJ994 parental viruses. The goals of this proposal are to generate the reagents (e.g., neurovirulent recombinants) needed to analyze neurovirulence genes driving HSV-1 encephalitis and identify epistatic interactions and carry out vQTLmap analysis of percent mortality, percent ataxia, percent head tilt, and percent limb paralysis. At the completion of this project, we will be able to submit an R01 application to carry out vQTLmap on features such as percent mortality, brain titers of virus, localization of the infection in the brain, and neuroinvasiveness. A better understanding of how viral genes work together to promote disease has the potential to identify novel targets that could assist antiviral drug or vaccine development efforts. Narrative The role played by viral genes in determining the outcome of infection is poorly understood, particularly for Herpes simplex virus, which is an important pathogen. We have validated a novel approach involving generating recombinant viruses, determining the sequence of their genomes, and using novel statistical methods to map viral genes that affect the severity of the infection. In order to extend the analysis to neurovirulence (encephalitis), we need to isolate more neurovirulent recombinants. The goal of this application is to isolate additional HSV-1 recombinants so we can identify genetic drivers of encephalitis in the HSV-1 genome. The project ultimately has the potential to identify novel therapeutic targets for drug or vaccine development.",Neurovirulent HSV-1 Recombinants for vQTL Analysis,9817679,R21AI137280,"['Affect', 'Animal Model', 'Antiviral Agents', 'Ataxia', 'Automobile Driving', 'Blepharitis', 'Blindness', 'Body Weight decreased', 'Brain', 'Central Nervous System Infections', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Corneal Neovascularization', 'Corneal Ulcer', 'Data', 'Digestion', 'Disease', 'Encephalitis', 'Eye Infections', 'Female', 'Focal Infection', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Epistasis', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Herpesvirus 1', 'Infection', 'Keratitis', 'Limb structure', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Mus', 'Nature', 'Outcome', 'Paralysed', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pattern', 'Peripheral', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Probability', 'Publishing', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Reagent', 'Recombinants', 'Role', 'Severities', 'Simplexvirus', 'Statistical Methods', 'Testing', 'Vero Cells', 'Viral Genes', 'Viral Physiology', 'Virulence', 'Virus', 'Work', 'disease phenotype', 'drug development', 'human pathogen', 'innovation', 'male', 'mortality', 'neurovirulence', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'pathogen', 'recombinant virus', 'vaccine development']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R21,2020,229500,-0.0023088221350978763
"Neutralization Fingerprinting Analysis of Polyclonal Antibody Responses against HIV-1 Project Summary HIV-1 poses a substantial health and economic burden, with more than 30 million people currently infected worldwide. The search for an effective HIV-1 vaccine remains a top priority, and a deeper understanding of how the immune system recognizes HIV-1 can help inform vaccine design. Lately, much effort has focused on understanding the antibody responses to HIV-1 infection. However, the polyclonal neutralizing antibody responses in an individual are very complex. Standard methods for mapping such responses include various experimental techniques, but more recently, computational methods were also developed. These computational methods, which we call NFP (neutralization fingerprinting), are based on analysis of serum neutralization data that is typically obtained in the very first stages of donor sample characterization, and are therefore an efficient technology for accurately mapping antibody specificities in polyclonal responses. The NFP algorithms have already become an important tool in the HIV field and are being used extensively by laboratories throughout the world, including Duke CHAVI-ID, CAPRISA, NIH VRC, and MHRP.  Here, we propose to develop next-generation NFP algorithms and apply them to address biological questions with important implications for understanding the interactions between HIV-neutralizing antibodies and the virus. Specifically, we will develop and apply novel algorithms for: (1) Antibody specificity prediction with significantly improved accuracy and reliability. These algorithms will immensely improve the utility of the NFP approach for prospective identification of antibody specificities in polyclonal sera. (2) Mapping broadly neutralizing antibody responses against novel epitopes on HIV-1 Env. We will use epitope- structural analysis and computational search algorithms to identify novel Env epitopes, and will screen donor samples for the presence of related NFP signals. Promising signals for novel antibody specificities will be characterized further through collaborations. (3) Population-level analysis of broadly neutralizing antibody responses to HIV-1. We will analyze large collections of samples from diverse HIV infection cohorts in order to determine common antibody specificities elicited in response to HIV-1, as well as patterns of potential association between features of the infecting virus sequence and the elicited epitope specificities.  The proposed NFP algorithms will be made available to the public, and will be useful in a number of high-impact areas in the HIV field, including mapping of antibody specificities in previously uncharacterized samples, identification of novel Env epitopes, and large-scale analysis of broadly neutralizing antibody responses within a cohort, or at a population level. Overall, this work will lead to a better understanding of the neutralizing antibody responses against HIV-1 and will build a more complete picture of the epitopes on Env. The proposed algorithmic framework should be generalizable to other important viruses, such as influenza and hepatitis C, and therefore has the potential for a far-reaching impact on public health. Project Narrative  This project aims at developing next-generation neutralization fingerprinting algorithms for the analysis of antibody specificities in polyclonal responses against HIV-1. Overall, this work will build a more complete picture of the broadly neutralizing antibody epitopes on Env, and will lead to a better understanding of the antibody responses against HIV-1 both at the individual and population levels. The proposed algorithmic framework should be generalizable to other important viruses, such as influenza and hepatitis C, and therefore has the potential for a far-reaching impact on public health.",Neutralization Fingerprinting Analysis of Polyclonal Antibody Responses against HIV-1,9936138,R01AI131722,"['Address', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Algorithms', 'Antibodies', 'Antibody Response', 'Antibody Specificity', 'Antigens', 'Area', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Characteristics', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Derivation procedure', 'Development', 'Donor Selection', 'Economic Burden', 'Epitope Mapping', 'Epitopes', 'Fingerprint', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'HIV', 'HIV Infections', 'HIV-1', 'HIV-1 vaccine', 'Hepatitis C', 'Immune system', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Influenza C Virus', 'Knock-out', 'Laboratories', 'Least-Squares Analysis', 'Letters', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Monoclonal Antibodies', 'Mutation', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Public Health', 'Sampling', 'Serum', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vaccine Design', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Virus', 'Work', 'base', 'cohort', 'health economics', 'improved', 'neutralizing antibody', 'next generation', 'novel', 'polyclonal antibody', 'prospective', 'response', 'sample collection', 'tool']",NIAID,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2020,617708,0.014743959775108914
"Consortium for Immunotherapeutics against Emerging Viral Threats SUMMARY: OVERALL  This proposal, Consortium for Immunotherapeutics Against Emerging Viral Diseases, addresses a critical gap in the biodefense portfolio by building an academic-industry partnership to advance effective, fully human, antibody-based immunotherapeutics against three major families of emerging/re-emerging viruses: Lassa virus, Ebola and other Filoviruses, and mosquito-transmitted Alphaviruses that threaten millions worldwide. This program follows directly from our significant body of preliminary data (the largest available for these families of viruses), therapeutics in hand, multidisciplinary expertise, and demonstrated collaborative success. Included in the proposed CETR portfolio are: (1) the only available immunotherapeutics against endemic Lassa virus, with reversal of late-stage disease and complete survival in infected non-human primates, (2) novel Ebola and pan- ebolavirus therapeutics that also completely protect non-human primates from disease, and that were built by the paradigm-shifting and comprehensive analysis of a global consortium, and (3) much needed, first-in-class therapeutics against the re-emerging alphaviruses that have tremendous epidemic potential in the United States and around the globe. These multidisciplinary studies, founded upon pioneering structural biology of the antigen targets, include innovations such as agnostic, high-throughput Fc profiling and optimization, coupled with Fv evolution to enhance potency and developability, as well as a sophisticated statistical and computational analysis core to evaluate thresholds and correlates of protection across the major families of pathogens. Together, we aim to understand what findings represent general rules and what data are specific to each virus family. We also aim to provide streamlined systems for antibody choice and optimization that do not yet exist, and to build a broadly applicable platform for mAb discovery and delivery against any novel pathogen as they emerge. The recent resurgence of Lassa, the epidemic nature of Ebola virus and other re-emerging filoviruses, as well as the major population at risk by global movement of mosquito-borne alphaviruses together demonstrate the tremendous global need for immunotherapeutics developed and advanced by this program. NARRATIVE Three major families of emerging viruses (Lassa and other arenaviruses, Ebola and other filoviruses, and mosquito-borne alphaviruses) threaten human health worldwide, but lack approved therapeutics or vaccines. The proposed multidisciplinary consortium, an academic-industry partnership, will advance safe and effective, fully human, monoclonal antibody therapies against these viruses, using candidate therapies that confer complete protection in non-human primates as our starting point. Our collaborative databases, multivariate analyses and innovative antibody optimization strategies will establish platforms for discovery and delivery of much-needed treatments against these and other infectious diseases.",Consortium for Immunotherapeutics against Emerging Viral Threats,9924443,U19AI142790,"['Address', 'Alphavirus', 'Antibodies', 'Antigen Targeting', 'Arenavirus', 'Arthritogenic', 'Biological Assay', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer Models', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Coupled', 'Culicidae', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Developed Countries', 'Developing Countries', 'Disease', 'Ebola', 'Ebola virus', 'Epidemic', 'Evolution', 'Family', 'Filovirus', 'Fostering', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Health', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immunotherapeutic agent', 'Lassa virus', 'Machine Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Mediating', 'Monoclonal Antibodies', 'Monoclonal Antibody Therapy', 'Movement', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Nature', 'Populations at Risk', 'Primate Diseases', 'Reagent', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resources', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'System', 'Talents', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Monoclonal Antibodies', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'United States', 'Vaccines', 'Viral', 'Virus', 'Virus Diseases', 'base', 'biodefense', 'chikungunya', 'clinical development', 'design', 'experience', 'human monoclonal antibodies', 'improved', 'industry partner', 'innovation', 'insight', 'mosquito-borne', 'multidisciplinary', 'nonhuman primate', 'novel', 'pandemic disease', 'pathogen', 'programs', 'research study', 'structural biology', 'success', 'synergism', 'tool']",NIAID,LA JOLLA INSTITUTE FOR IMMUNOLOGY,U19,2020,7143424,0.026757757864546435
"Identifying determinants of human immunity against influenza: a multiscale approach Project Summary Seasonal influenza is a significant public health concern, yet it is not clear why individuals and populations differ in their protection against influenza infection. The factors underlying protection can act at multiple scales, and thus building a more complete understanding of protection requires an approach that integrates data at the population, individual, and molecular levels. What factors influence population and individual risk of influenza infection? How different are the antibody responses of individuals against influenza and what factors drive those differences? Here, I propose to identify the relative influence of past infection, vaccination, and antigenic evolution on determining both individual and population susceptibility by quantitatively modeling high-resolution epidemiological and immunological data. In particular, I aim to determine the role of past influenza infection in shaping the susceptibility of different age groups, identify the specific targets of the human antibody response against influenza, and infer the relative importance of infection history, vaccination, and epitope immunogenicity on antibody specificity. This work will have a significant impact on our ability to predict future influenza infection and allow us to target interventions toward the most at-risk populations. Success of this project requires training in advanced computational and statistical methods and state-of-the-art immunological techniques by members of the Departments of Ecology & Evolution and Medicine at the University of Chicago. This interdisciplinary and collaborative training environment will provide a strong foundation for gaining more complete understanding of the interactions between influenza and the human immune system. Project Narrative Influenza infection is a significant public health concern resulting in thousands of deaths annually. Here, I propose to systematically identify how exposure history, vaccination, and other factors affect individual susceptibility to influenza infection. These insights will improve our ability to identify populations most at-risk for infection as well as allow us to tailor intervention and prevention efforts to more effectively combat seasonal influenza.",Identifying determinants of human immunity against influenza: a multiscale approach,10008955,F32AI145177,"['Affect', 'Affinity', 'Amino Acid Substitution', 'Antibodies', 'Antibody Avidity', 'Antibody Response', 'Antibody Specificity', 'Binding', 'Birth', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Chicago', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Ecology', 'Effectiveness', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Epitopes', 'Evolution', 'Exposure to', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Glycoproteins', 'Hemagglutinin', 'Hospitalization', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immune system', 'Immunity', 'Immunologic Techniques', 'Immunologics', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Influenza', 'Intervention', 'Link', 'Medicine', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Neuraminidase', 'Pattern', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Populations at Risk', 'Predisposition', 'Prevention', 'Preventive measure', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Seasons', 'Shapes', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'Statistical Methods', 'Surface Antigens', 'Testing', 'Training', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Vaccination', 'Variant', 'Virus', 'Work', 'adaptive immune response', 'age group', 'base', 'cohort', 'combat', 'design', 'immunogenicity', 'imprint', 'improved', 'individual response', 'infection risk', 'influenzavirus', 'insight', 'machine learning method', 'member', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'seasonal influenza', 'success', 'universal influenza vaccine']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,F32,2020,65310,0.039732871909672875
"Developing Computational Methods for Surveillance of Antimicrobial Resistant Agents PROJECT ABSTRACT  Antimicrobial resistance is a critical public health issue. Infections with drug resistant pathogens are estimated to cause an additional eight million hospitalization days annually over the hospitalizations that would be seen for infections with susceptible agents. The use of antibiotics (in both clinical and agricultural settings) is being viewed as precursor for these infections and thus, is a major public health concern—particularly as outbreaks become more frequent and severe. However, scientiﬁc evidence describing the hazards associated with antibiotic use is lacking due to inability to quantify the risk of these practices. One promising avenue to elucidate this risk is to use shotgun metagenomics to identify the AMR genes in samples taken through systematic spatiotemporal surveillance. The goal of this proposed work is to develop algorithms that will provide such a means for analysis. The algorithms need to be scalable to very large datasets and thus, will require the development and use succinct data structures.  In order to achieve this goal, the investigative team will develop the theoretical foundations and applied meth- ods needed to study AMR through the use of shotgun metagenomics. A major focus of the proposed work is developing algorithms that can handle very large datasets. To achieve this scalability, we will create novel means to create, compress, reconstruct and update very large de Bruijn graphs that metagenomics data in a manner needed to study AMR. In addition, we will pioneer the study of AMR through long read data by proposing new algorithmic problems and solutions that use data. For example, identifying the location of speciﬁc genes in a metagenomics sample using long read data has not been proposed or studied. Thus, the algorithmic ideas and techniques developed in this project will not only advance the study of AMR, but contribute to the growing domain of big data analysis and pan-genomics.  Lastly, we plan to apply our methods to samples collected from both agricultural and clinical settings in Florida. Analysis of preliminary and new data will allow us to conclude about (1) the public risk associated with antimicro- bial use in agriculture; (2) the effectiveness of interventions used to reduce resistant bacteria, and lastly, (3) the factors that allow resistant bacteria to grow, thrive and evolve. A–1 PROJECT NARRATIVE  Antibiotic use in agriculture is a major public health concern that is receiving a lot of media attention, par- ticularly as antibiotic-resistant infections in become more frequent and severe. This research will build a novel bioinformatics framework for determining how antimicrobial resistant genes evolve, grow, and persist in a system that has been affected by antibiotic use. This will, in turn, facilitate the development of effective intervention methods that reduce resistant pathogens in clinical and agricultural settings.

"Omics for TB:  Response to Infection and Treatment Abstract – Overview With about 10 million new cases of active disease and 1.8 million deaths annually, TB is a global health emergency. A distinguishing feature of TB disease is its biological heterogeneity, which manifests at the clinical level chiefly in 2 forms: disease progression and treatment response. The premise of this Program is that the heterogeneous outcomes of TB infection and treatment are determined by the interplay of competing regulatory networks between the pathogen and the host. Our primary goal is to apply systems biology approaches to elucidate the biological control underlying the variability of disease outcome and response to treatment. Our first specific aim is to define novel host regulators of TB disease progression in vivo, and the innate and adaptive networks they control. We will also seek to define novel Mtb regulators of TB treatment response, and the Mtb regulatory networks that they control. This work will allow us to produce and validate host and Mtb models of TB disease progression and treatment response. Altogether, this program addresses key unanswered questions that stymie efforts to combat the TB pandemic. Our team has perfected the required platforms and scientific approaches to execute this ambitious research plan in a timely and cost- effective manner. All the participating investigators have strong records of interacting productively, and of disseminating their data and reagents to the scientific community. Project Narrative - Omics for TB: Response to Infection and Treatment Mycobacterium tuberculosis causes ~10 million new cases of active disease and 1.8 million deaths each year, and our tools to combat tuberculosis (TB) disease are universally outdated and overmatched.

"A ""Culture"" Shift: Integrated Bacterial Screening and Antibacterial Susceptibility Test on Microfluidic Digital Array for Bloodstream Infections PROJECT SUMMARY The ability for clinicians to effectively treat bacterial infections with targeted antibacterials in the acute-care settings hinges on diagnostics capable of identifying the pathogen broadly and determining its susceptibility to antibacterials in a timely manner. Bloodstream infection (BSI) is a particularly representative disease because it is the leading cause of death due to infections with rapid disease progression. Unfortunately, the inconvenient delay of blood culture for definitive diagnosis contributes to widespread empiric use of broad- spectrum antibacterials and emergence of multi-drug-resistant pathogens. Toward addressing this critical unmet need, we propose to develop a new molecular diagnostic platform that integrates bacterial detection, species identification (ID), and antibacterial susceptibility testing (AST) from blood samples in a streamlined test. The expected sample-to-answer turnaround time is 90 min for ID and as early as 2-3 hr for AST. Such integrated diagnostic solution within the proposed timeframe will transform acute-care clinicians’ ability to establish diagnosis of bacterial infections, need for infection control, and antibacterial treatment based on objective data to improve clinical outcome. Using an innovative microfluidic digital array chip for assaying single cells as a backbone technology, we propose to develop a new molecular diagnostic platform which promises rapid ID and AST and allows customizable workflow and assay tailored to the clinical scenario while adjustable based on real-time results. The array chip seamlessly integrates digitization of cells, brief incubation (under various drug conditions), single-cell PCR (scPCR) or reverse transcriptase PCR (scRT-PCR) and single-cell high-resolution melt (scHRM). Thereby, bacterial pathogen can be detected at the level of single-cells, identified based on species- specific melt curves, and their antibacterial susceptibility profile subsequently assessed by measuring changes in rRNA level as a biosynthetic marker of cell viability. ScPCR/scRT-PCR enables sensitive detection and absolute quantification of rRNA of individual cells critical to rapid and reliable differentiation between viable and no-viable cells; while scHRM overcomes a key limitation of bulk HRM to resolve multiple species for diagnosing polymicrobial infections or discarding contaminations. Since both ID and AST do not rely on culture, they reduce total turnaround time from days to minutes/hours. We have assembled a superb team of multi-disciplinary investigators and industry advisors with complementary expertise and strong track record of team science. We propose the following aims:1) to develop a streamlined BSI diagnostic protocol for integrated ID and AST; 2) to develop a microfluidic array chip that enables ID and AST with single-cell resolution; 3) to develop instrument and analysis programs for single- cell ID and AST; and 4) to demonstrate the single-cell diagnostic platform, we will perform analytical and pilot clinical validation studies. PROJECT NARRATIVE The main goal of this research project is to develop a single-cell pathogen diagnostic platform which integrates broad-range bacterial detection, species identification (ID) and antibacterial susceptibility testing (AST) in a streamlined test.","A ""Culture"" Shift: Integrated Bacterial Screening and Antibacterial Susceptibility Test on Microfluidic Digital Array for Bloodstream Infections",9878741,R01AI137272,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents', 'Bacterial Infections', 'Biological Assay', 'Blood', 'Blood Cells', 'Blood Tests', 'Blood specimen', 'Cause of Death', 'Cell Separation', 'Cell Survival', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Cytolysis', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Hour', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Infection', 'Infection Control', 'Libraries', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Microbiology', 'Microfluidics', 'Nutritional', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Predisposition', 'Preparation', 'Protocols documentation', 'RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase', 'Recombinant DNA', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Ribosomal RNA', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Sepsis', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Transcript', 'Validation', 'Vertebral column', 'Whole Blood', 'acute care', 'automated algorithm', 'base', 'chromatin immunoprecipitation', 'classification algorithm', 'clinical decision-making', 'design', 'digital', 'empowered', 'imager', 'improved', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'melting', 'molecular diagnostics', 'mortality', 'multi-drug resistant pathogen', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'pathogenic bacteria', 'programs', 'prospective', 'prototype', 'rRNA Precursor', 'screening', 'validation studies']",NIAID,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,721177,0.023588715156569257
"Integrating epidemiologic and environmental approaches to understand and predict Coccidioides exposure and coccidioidomycosis emergence Project Summary Coccidioidomycosis is an infection caused by inhalation of spores from the soil-dwelling fungi Coccidioides immitis or C. posadasii, and can lead to chronic lung infection, meningitis, or death. Southwestern states are currently experiencing among the highest incidence rates of coccidioidomycosis ever recorded. The disease has levied a substantial human and economic burden throughout the southwest, totaling an estimated $2.2 billion in charges in California alone for coccidioidomycosis-associated hospitalizations from 2000-2011. Critical gaps in understanding have hindered the public health response, including how dust, pathogen, and individual risk factors interact to determine disease incidence, as well as how environmental factors influence the distribution of the pathogen and dust. To address these gaps, this project investigates the impacts of dust exposure, environmental variability, and sociodemographic change on Coccidioides spp. proliferation, dispersion, and coccidioidomycosis infection rates in California. The research focuses on three main aims: 1) investigate the influence of climate variation and dust exposure on the spatiotemporal distribution of cocci incidence using >65,000 geolocated surveillance records from 2000 to 2018 and a case-crossover design; 2) identify environmental sources of C. immitis at high spatial and temporal resolution in disturbed and undisturbed soil, and determine how wind, rainfall, soil disturbance and other factors influence spore dispersion through longitudinal sampling of C. immitis in air and soil; and 3) predict changes in pathogen density over space and time and estimate the exposure-response relationship between pathogen density and risk of infection using a case-crossover approach with prospective surveillance for incident cases. In pursuit of these aims, the research will combine georeferenced coccidioidomycosis case data across California since 2000 at an unprecedented spatial resolution with fine-scale dust concentration estimates and environmental data from a combination of remote sensing, modeling and ground monitors. We will use novel field and laboratory methods to conduct longitudinal sampling of C. immitis in air and soil, determining how microenvironmental conditions and cyclical patterns of rainfall and drought determine pathogen source dynamics, and identifying conditions that support pathogen dispersion through the air. Through these activities, we will identify the specific dust conditions that pose the greatest risk for infection, estimate pathogen exposure and the dose- response relationship, and evaluate heterogeneity in this relationship across risk groups and regions. The results will elucidate drivers of the current epidemic, enhance understanding of the distribution and dispersion of Coccidioides spp. in the environment, and identify high risk regions and subpopulations. The knowledge gained will support decision-makers in targeting, designing and implementing protective measures for vulnerable populations. Project Narrative This project addresses gaps in our understanding of the kinds of dust exposures, and the environmental and social conditions, that increase the incidence of coccidioidomycosis in the southwest. The findings will have wide-ranging benefits for public health, including a better understanding of how people are exposed to the pathogen, the identification of areas and people that are at the highest risk, and predictions of future coccidioidomycosis that can be used to prevent infection in vulnerable groups.",Integrating epidemiologic and environmental approaches to understand and predict Coccidioides exposure and coccidioidomycosis emergence,9865174,R01AI148336,"['Address', 'Air', 'Area', 'California', 'Cessation of life', 'Charge', 'Chronic', 'Climate', 'Climatology', 'Coccidioides', 'Coccidioides immitis', 'Coccidioides posadasii', 'Coccidioidomycosis', 'Crossover Design', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Dose', 'Droughts', 'Dust', 'Economic Burden', 'Economics', 'Elderly', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Environmental Wind', 'Epidemic', 'Epidemiology', 'Event', 'Exposure to', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'High temperature of physical object', 'Hospitalization', 'Human', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Infection prevention', 'Influenza', 'Inhalation', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Lung infections', 'Measures', 'Meningitis', 'Meteorology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Pathogen detection', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Periodicity', 'Population', 'Population Analysis', 'Public Health', 'Records', 'Reproduction spores', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Retrospective cohort', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Social Conditions', 'Soil', 'Source', 'Subgroup', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Time', 'TimeLine', 'Variant', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'burden of illness', 'density', 'design', 'environmental intervention', 'experience', 'fungus', 'high risk', 'infection rate', 'infection risk', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'pathogen exposure', 'predictive modeling', 'prospective', 'remote sensing', 'response', 'sociodemographics', 'spatiotemporal', 'statistical and machine learning', 'temporal measurement', 'transmission process']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,R01,2020,774446,0.02924993258141266
"Accurate prediction of neutralization capacity from deep mining of SARS-CoV-2 serology ABSTRACT The goal of this project is to establish an accurate and sensitive method for predicting the neutralization capacity against SARS-CoV-2 of serum samples by deep mining of antibody profiles. The COVID-19 pandemic remains a global threat with nearly seven million cases and 400K deaths. In the absence of effective vaccines and therapeutics, immunity against SARS-CoV-2 is a main mechanism of protection against SARS-CoV-2 (re)infection. Our recent studies of convalescent serum samples revealed that their levels of neutralization capacity vary greatly (over 100-fold) and only a small subset has high neutralization capacity. Because viral neutralization assays are inherently low throughput, it is unrealistic to apply it to a high-risk population such as hospital workers in a timely manner. Unfortunately, there is only moderate correlation between the neutralization capacity and the level of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels determined using standard ELISA. Clearly, we still do not understand what types of antibodies contribute to viral neutralization. Our overarching hypothesis to be tested in this project is that by examining the antibody profile in patient serum more deeply and quantitatively in terms of antigens, epitopes and antibody types, we will be able to identify quantitative predictive markers for viral neutralization. To this end, we will develop multiplex assay for SARS-CoV-2 serology that will enable us to deeply characterize the antibody profile. We will then develop a predictive algorithm by utilizing. We have assembled a team of experts with truly complementary skills in antibody characterization, virology and data mining. We have access to a large number of convalescent serum samples, which will enable us to critically validate our technology. We will expeditiously execute the following aims. (1) We will develop multiplex serology assay for SARS-CoV-2 that can profile up to 15 antibody-antigen interactions in a single reaction. The main technical innovation is the introduction of multi-dimensional flow cytometry. We will produce multiple antigens including Spike, receptor-binding domain and nucleocapsid protein, and their natural and designed variants. We will refine and validate the assay using a large panel of convalescent serum samples. (2) We will develop an improved viral neutralization assay to better quantify the neutralization capacity. (3) We will develop a predictive algorithm for neutralization capacity that utilizes the antibody profiles from our multiplex assay. This analysis will identify serology parameters that contribute to neutralization. The end products of this project will include a high-throughput serology assay that gives far- richer antibody profiles than the current standard accompanied with an accurate predictive algorithm. Together, this platform will help advance a fundamental understanding of SARS-CoV-2 infection as well as the development of vaccines and therapeutics against this formidable pathogen. PROJECT NARRATIVE The level of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in blood samples of people exposed to the virus vary greatly, and current antibody testing methods do not accurately determine the level of neutralizing antibodies. This project will develop innovative platform for deep mining of antibody profiles from a small amount of blood samples and accurately predict their neutralization capacity.

"Mapping and dissecting the role of antibodies in Mtb control While a quarter of the world carries the burden of tuberculosis, emerging data suggests that those coinfected with HIV are at an elevated risk of reactivating the disease. However, the specific immunological perturbations that lead to loss of Tb control are poorly understood. One critical risk factor associated with HIV coinfection is the depletion of CD4 T cells, which has been linked to increased Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) uptake into macrophages and diminished granuloma integrity. However, even with the restoration of CD4 T cells with HAART, Mtb/HIV co-infected individuals continue to exhibit a higher risk of Mtb reactivation. However, CD4+ T cell loss/perturbations may also contribute to loss of Mtb containment through indirect mechanisms such as the loss of the requisite help to B cells required for the production of highly functional antibodies. Along these lines, mounting data point to an enrichment of anti-microbial antibody responses among latently infected individuals, able to contain bacterial growth in vitro and even control bacteria in vivo when transferred to mice prior to challenge. Thus, given our emerging appreciation for a role for antibodies in Mtb-control/killing, here we propose to use a systems serology profiling approach, to begin to define the specificities and functions of antibodies that contribute to longitudinal control of Mtb in both HIV uninfected and infected populations. Moreover, linked to B cell cloning, Fc-engineering, and in vitro/in vivo models, we also seek to divorce humoral biomarkers of Mtb control from mechanistic roles of antibodies in preventing progression to TB.

"Structure-Based Design of a Broadly Protective Group A Streptococcal Vaccine The overall goal of this project is to develop a safe, broadly effective, and affordable vaccine to prevent group A streptococcal infections. Antibodies against the N-terminal hypervariable region (HVR) of surface M (Emm) proteins of GAS are opsonic and are associated with protection against infection. Immunity has classically been described as “type-specific”, leading to the assumption that natural immunity confers protection against only one of the more than 200 different emm types of GAS. We now have new information that calls into question this classic view and serves as the basis for an entirely different approach to GAS vaccine design and development. A recent comprehensive sequence analysis of M proteins from a global collection of 175 emm types of GAS resulted in a new emm cluster typing system that classified 96.2% of all contemporary GAS isolates into 48 emm clusters containing structurally and functionally related M proteins. Moreover, 117 emm types contained in 16 clusters accounted for 94.4% of GAS infections in the world. Indeed, preclinical studies indicated that a multivalent vaccine containing N-terminal peptides from 30 prevalent M types cross-opsonized a significant number of non-vaccine emm types of GAS that co-localized in clusters with vaccine emm types. The frequency of cross-opsonic antibodies, combined with the emm cluster data, prompted us to conclude that there is a need for a paradigm shift away from the concept of “type-specific” immunity against GAS infections to one of “cluster-specific” immunity. Our overall hypothesis is that immunity to GAS infections is the result of both type-specific and cross-reactive antibodies against the N-terminal regions of M proteins and that a new approach employing computational predictions of peptide structures will result in a multivalent vaccine that will induce broadly protective immunity in populations throughout the world. Our preliminary results indicate the feasibility of using structure-based design to predict the antigenic relatedness of M peptides within a cluster. The specific aims of this proposal are to: 1) Apply computational structure-based design in an iterative process with immunological data from Aim 2 to predict the minimal number of M peptide sequences that are most representative of the structural and physicochemical properties of the peptides in one emm cluster containing 17 GAS emm types, 2) determine the cross-reactive immunogenicity of the selected peptides with all seventeen emm types of GAS in the cluster, and apply the results to refine the computational design predictions in Aim 1, 3) apply the refined computational parameters from Aims 1 and 2 to analyze the remaining epidemiologically important emm clusters, select a comprehensive panel of peptides representing all emm types, construct four multivalent recombinant vaccine proteins, and assess potential cross-protective immunogenicity using in vitro bactericidal assays against all 117 emm types of GAS, and 4) determine the protective immunogenicity of the final multivalent vaccine in unique transgenic mice expressing human C4BP and factor H that will be immunized and then challenged with multiple emm types of GAS. The world needs an effective, safe and affordable vaccine to prevent group A streptococcal (GAS) infections. Although most GAS infections are mild, there are more than 18 million people with a chronic complication of a severe GAS disease worldwide, over 15 million of whom have rheumatic heart disease, another 2 million cases of severe disease occur each year and a total of 517,000 deaths annually are estimated to be due to this organism.

"Multiplexed Antigen-Specific Antibody Fc Profiling on a Chip for Point-of-Care Diagnosis of TB in HIV-infected Children Abstract: Tuberculosis (TB) is a leading cause of death in children, with an estimated 1 million children affected, and more than 200,000 deaths in children yearly due to TB. HIV coinfection has been estimated to contribute to more than 35% of TB-related deaths in children in Africa, making the collision of the HIV and TB epidemics one of the most lethal to date. Both HIV infection as well as HIV-exposure in utero, among HIV-exposed but uninfected (HEU) children, have been linked to higher risks for the development of TB among young children. Failures to prevent TB disease and devastation has been attributed to the lack of an effective vaccine as well as our inability to diagnose children under the age of 5 due to the difficulty in obtaining sputum and the paucibacillary nature of the disease in young children. Thus, an inexpensive biomarker-based diagnostic test tailored for pediatric TB using non-sputum samples that could be used at the point of care in resource-limited settings could profoundly improve TB treatment and prevent deaths in children, especially in those under 5 years of age. While Mtb-specific antibody titer-based diagnostics have performed poorly in the past, due to the inability of accurately distinguishing between active TB disease from latent TB infection (LTBI), recent data from our group has shown that Mtb-specific antibody glycosylation shifts significantly across disease states. Moreover, this antigen-specific antibody glycosylation approach reliably classifies individuals into active and latent disease states across HIV infection status, across geographies and can even distinguish recent Typhoid infection among children in endemic areas. Based on these observations, a simple binding-based assay was developed that can rapidly, sensitively, and specifically detect changes in Mtb-specific antibody glycosylation from a small sample volume offering an opportunity for the first time to develop an antigen-specific antibody glycosylation diagnostic for pediatric TB from a microliter-scale sample. Given that HIV+, HEU, or unexposed children may target distinct Mtb antigens, here we have assembled a multi-disciplinary team and program termed FASTER-Kids (Fc Antibody Signatures for TubERculosis in children) that will: 1) Define the landscape of Mtb-specific antibody glycosylation responses that distinguish children with TB, 2) Develop a point-of-care test that will rapidly capture these specific antibody responses and glycosylation changes from microliters of blood. Ultimately, this collaborative structure will enable the iterative improvement and development of this simple, rapid, inexpensive diagnostic to manage TB infection in young children. Based on accumulating data pointing to highly significant shifts in TB-specific antibody glycosylation across latent and active TB disease, the goal of this proposal is to develop an inexpensive, simple, reliable TB-specific antibody-based point-of-care diagnostic to manage TB disease in children under the age of 5.",Multiplexed Antigen-Specific Antibody Fc Profiling on a Chip for Point-of-Care Diagnosis of TB in HIV-infected Children,9986268,R01AI152158,"['5 year old', 'Acute', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Africa', 'Age', 'Antibodies', 'Antibody Response', 'Antibody titer measurement', 'Antigen Targeting', 'Antigens', 'Area', 'Bedside Testings', 'Binding', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Drops', 'Electrical Engineering', 'Enrollment', 'Epidemic', 'Exposure to', 'Failure', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'HIV', 'HIV Infections', 'HIV/TB', 'Immunologist', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Infection', 'Inflammatory', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mycobacterium tuberculosis', 'Nature', 'Polysaccharides', 'Population', 'Preparation', 'Pulmonary Tuberculosis', 'Reporting', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Scheme', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Serologic tests', 'Serum', 'Severities', 'South Africa', 'Specificity', 'Sputum', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Tuberculosis', 'Typhoid Fever', 'Vaccines', 'base', 'co-infection', 'cohort', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'glycosylation', 'high risk', 'improved', 'microchip', 'miniaturize', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'pediatrician', 'point of care', 'point-of-care diagnostics', 'prenatal exposure', 'prevent', 'programs', 'prospective', 'response', 'sensor', 'tuberculosis treatment']",NIAID,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2020,974009,0.021160439419997894
"Computational and Experimental Resources for Virome Analysis in Inflammatory Bowel Disease (CERVAID) SUMMARY  While the role of the bacterial microbiome in human health and disease is well established, few studies have evaluated the contribution of the virome. Recently, we demonstrated that alterations in the enteric virome in adulthood are associated with diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and AIDS. In a cross- sectional comparison of IBD cases and household controls, a significant expansion of the Caudovirales, an order of phages, and anelloviruses, a family of eukaryotic DNA viruses, was observed. Advancing understanding of the IBD virome beyond this finding is limited by: (1) A lack of well defined longitudinal human cohorts to enable discovery of temporal associations of the virome with health and disease; (2) The challenge of viral “dark matter”. Dark matter refers to the typically >50% of the sequences present in purified virus preparations cannot be classified due to a lack of statistically significant alignment to known reference sequences. Thus, current virome studies effectively assess < 50% of the virome, thereby compromising our ability to detect important associations between the virome and disease; (3) Inadequate experimental systems to manipulate the virome. Although sequencing has identified many novel eukaryotic viruses, there are only cell culture systems for a limited number of viruses; moreover, there are no small animal infection models for newly described viruses. In addition while a tremendous diversity of phage has been identified, only a tiny fraction have known hosts and an even smaller fraction has been cultured. Thus, there are significant barriers that must be overcome to be able to experimentally test the impact of either eukaryotic viruses or phages in murine IBD models. These barriers to understanding the role of the IBD virome will be addressed as follows: Aim 1 will define the enteric virome and bacterial microbiome in a longitudinal cohort of IBD patients and household controls and identify virome associations with IBD. In Aim 2 novel computational tools to identify and characterize viruses present in enteric viromes will be developed, including approaches to classify dark matter. In Aim 3 novel experimental systems for functional virome analysis, including novel cultures of both eukaryotic viruses and phages as well as animal infection models, will be developed with the end goal of evaluating causal roles for the viruses and phage in existing muring IBD models. Together, these Aims will not only address significant barriers in understanding of IBD, but will provide a wealth of tangible computational and experimental resources to advance the general field of virome studies.   NARRATIVE The overall goal of this project is to develop novel computational and experimental tools to address challenges in understanding the role of viruses in inflammatory bowel disease. These tools will facilitate studies of not only inflammatory bowel disease, but also broader studies of the relationship of the human virome to other diseases.  ",Computational and Experimental Resources for Virome Analysis in Inflammatory Bowel Disease (CERVAID),10019521,RC2DK116713,"['Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Bacteria', 'Bacterial Infections', 'Bacteriophages', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biology', 'Caudovirales', 'Cell Culture System', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer software', 'DNA Viruses', 'Databases', 'Defect', 'Development', 'Digestive System Disorders', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Enteral', 'Family', 'Feces', 'Genome', 'Gnotobiotic', 'Goals', 'Health', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Household', 'Human', 'Immune system', 'Infection', 'Inflammatory Bowel Diseases', 'Longitudinal cohort', 'Machine Learning', 'Metabolic Diseases', 'Metadata', 'Metagenomics', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases', 'Norovirus', 'Open Reading Frames', 'Parasitic infection', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Play', 'Population', 'Preparation', 'Resource Development', 'Resources', 'Ribosomal RNA', 'Role', 'System', 'Taxonomy', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Viral', 'Viral Genes', 'Viral Genome', 'Virus', 'Virus Diseases', 'bacterial resistance', 'bacteriome', 'base', 'case control', 'cohort', 'computerized tools', 'contig', 'dark matter', 'early childhood', 'experimental analysis', 'genome annotation', 'gut microbiome', 'human virome', 'improved', 'metagenome', 'microbial', 'molecular sequence database', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'phenomenological models', 'protein function', 'software development', 'stool sample', 'tool', 'virology', 'virome']",NIDDK,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,RC2,2020,1832307,0.002249912336062263
"Predicting tuberculosis outcomes using genotypic and biomarker signatures PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Tuberculosis (TB) is caused by an infectious pathogen, Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb) in susceptible individuals, but we cannot yet classify or predict outcomes in those prone to pulmonary TB disease versus those prone to resistance. In part, this reflects knowledge gaps regarding genotypes that may increase susceptibility, and in validated disease correlates (e.g. serum of lung protein biomarkers) measured individually, or combined signatures. We address these knowledge gaps by using Diversity Outbred (DO) mice, a population with abundant genetic diversity and heterozygosity, like the human population. Also, like humans, a low dose M.tb infection of DO mice produces a spectrum of outcomes, from highly susceptible to highly resistant, and many intermediate outcomes. In this proposal, we use the DO population to: 1) Identify and test the capacity of genotypic (alleles and statistically significant loci) to predict outcomes such as diagnostic category (class); and 2) To identify and test lung and serum biomarker (protein) and granuloma signatures to determine diagnostic category (class); and 3) To identify and test serum biomarker (protein) signatures that can forecast disease onset, within a 3-week window before illness manifests clinically. The best performing signatures will be tested using samples from humans. Collectively, results from these studies will generate new translatable knowledge regarding correlates of pulmonary TB (useful for diagnostics), and genotypic and serum protein signatures (useful for prognostics). PROJECT NARRATIVE Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb) causes tuberculosis (TB) in millions of susceptible humans each year. It is well known that humans respond variably to M.tb infection, yet we are unable to predict outcomes with accuracy. Here, we use the Diversity Outbred (DO) mouse population to identify and test genotypic, serum, and lung biomarker signatures to accurately predict outcomes. Findings are also validated in samples from humans.",Predicting tuberculosis outcomes using genotypic and biomarker signatures,9849329,R01HL145411,"['AIDS/HIV problem', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Aerosols', 'Alleles', 'Animal Model', 'Bacillus', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Categories', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Dose', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genotype', 'Granuloma', 'Harvest', 'Heterozygote', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Inbred Strain', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lung', 'Malaria', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mus', 'Mycobacterium tuberculosis', 'Necrosis', 'Onset of illness', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Process', 'Production', 'Proteins', 'Pulmonary Tuberculosis', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Resistance', 'Sampling', 'Serum', 'Serum Proteins', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Tuberculosis', 'Vehicle crash', 'base', 'human pathogen', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'learning algorithm', 'model development', 'novel diagnostics', 'novel marker', 'outcome forecast', 'outcome prediction', 'pathogen', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'protein biomarkers', 'public health intervention', 'response', 'supervised learning', 'survival outcome', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'tuberculosis diagnostics']",NHLBI,TUFTS UNIVERSITY BOSTON,R01,2020,655091,-0.0028748344588757388
"Structure based design of trimer interface epitope focused universal influenza vaccines The “Computational Models of Immunity” projects in this application focus on development and implementation of new structure-based design tools for influenza hemagglutinin (HA) protein trimer interface specific antibodies or vaccine antigens. These projects will use knowledge about the structure and function of human neutralizing antibodies to the trimer interface of the HA head that we have in hand or will discover, in order to design new antibodies or vaccines in silico. We have access to peripheral blood cells from a diverse panels of subjects with prior natural infection, or exposure to experimental inoculation with vaccines encoding HA molecules with both seasonal vaccines and unusual experimental influenza subtypes, including H3variant, H5, H6, H7, H9, and H10 viruses. The immune B memory cell populations from these individuals are the ideal starting materials to isolate unusual heterosubtypic antibodies. Recently, we identified the HA head trimer interface as a major new site of vulnerability for universal influenza antibodies and candidate vaccines. Here, we will study existing and isolate additional broadly heterosubtypic human antibodies to the trimer interface of the HA head. We will determine the immunome of the responding heterosubtypic clones using high-throughput next generation sequencing of antibody gene repertoires that comprise the clonal lineages of the most heterosubtypic antibodies isolated. Once antibodies with unusual breadth or activity are isolated, the structure of these antibodies will be determined in complex with purified HA molecules in the Structural Core using crystallography and single particle electron microscopy (EM) studies. Such structures will provide the coordinates for the modeling experiments using Rosetta. We will in silico mature human antibodies to increase affinity for the HA antigen of specific virus types and use multi-state design to maximize breadth, i.e., create antibodies that recognize HAs of all clades, subtypes, groups, or even types. We then will synthesize and express these novel antibodies and determine neutralization activity, binding affinity, and competition binding groups of designed antibodies, using a diverse HA panel and pseudotyped viruses with all type A HAs in nature. The co-crystal structure of these human antibodies with HA will be the template for in silico design of structurally stable epitope-focused immunogens. We will first validate these designed immunogens by testing the interaction with the target human antibodies. Further, these immunogens will be experimentally tested by evaluating immune responses. Then, we will use the novel immunogens to isolate new antibodies from subjects naturally exposed to influenza, to show that the immunogens present antigens recognized by natural immune responses. The next generation of viral vaccines and biologics alike will be designed rationally, based on a structural understanding of how protective antibodies engage the epitope of the target. The multidisciplinary group in this application will develop and implement new structure based computational models, and then validate the power of the computational design approach with laboratory experiments focused on the structural basis of broad neutralization of influenza through recognition of the a novel site of vulnerability in the interface of the hemagglutinin head domain.",Structure based design of trimer interface epitope focused universal influenza vaccines,9950456,U01AI150739,"['Affinity', 'Antibodies', 'Antibody Repertoire', 'Antigens', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological', 'Blood Cells', 'Cells', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Crystallization', 'Crystallography', 'Development', 'Electron Microscopy', 'Engineering', 'Epitopes', 'Exposure to', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Glycoproteins', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Head', 'Hemagglutinin', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immunity', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Influenza', 'Influenza Hemagglutinin', 'Influenza vaccination', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Linear Programming', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Masks', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Memory B-Lymphocyte', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Polysaccharides', 'Population', 'Proteins', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Sequence Analysis', 'Site', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic antibodies', 'Vaccine Antigen', 'Vaccine Design', 'Vaccines', 'Validation', 'Viral', 'Viral Vaccines', 'Virus', 'Virus Diseases', 'X-Ray Crystallography', 'antibody engineering', 'base', 'combat', 'cross reactivity', 'design', 'experimental study', 'immunogenicity', 'in silico', 'in vivo', 'influenza virus vaccine', 'influenzavirus', 'innovation', 'laboratory experiment', 'molecular recognition', 'mouse model', 'multidisciplinary', 'nanoparticle', 'neutralizing antibody', 'next generation', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'pandemic disease', 'particle', 'programs', 'protective efficacy', 'receptor binding', 'response', 'scaffold', 'screening', 'structural biology', 'therapeutic vaccine', 'tool', 'universal influenza vaccine', 'vaccine candidate']",NIAID,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,U01,2020,1265006,0.018247253307737687
"A peptide-based point-of-care vertical flow assay for the rapid diagnosis of Lyme disease Project Summary There is an obvious need for new approaches and better assays for the laboratory diagnosis of Lyme disease. All attempts to develop a practical assay for the direct detection of Borrelia burgdorferi in infected patients have failed. Thus far, all proposed alternatives to serology have been unsuccessful, not cost-effective, or are still in early development. Improving serological detection in early disease is the fastest and most effective way to improve patient outcomes in Lyme disease. The antigen targets utilized in current serodiagnostic assays have considerable defects. They often contain conserved epitopes that cross-react with antibodies raised to other antigens, reducing specificity and requiring the use of a two-tier seroassay paradigm that preserves specificity at the cost of poor sensitivity in the detection of early disease. The use of peptides as serodiagnostic targets demonstrate improved efficacy, but the use of one or two peptides containing single epitopes still provides re- duced sensitivity in early disease. Putting the same old antigen targets into new platforms, no matter how in- novative the platform, will not succeed in improving serodiagnostics for Lyme disease. Both the target anti- gens and assays need an innovative approach. By incorporating unique peptides containing linear epitopes highly specific to B. burgdorferi, into a cutting-edge, multiplex, portable paper-based point-of-care diagnostic assay that uses a cost-effective smartphone-based reader, we aim to transform the diagnosis of Lyme disease. An ideal test for Lyme disease could be performed in a single step and yield an answer on the spot to support diagnosis and direct the course of clinical treatment. We have developed an innovative vertical-flow assay which allows for the multiplexed detection of IgM and IgG binding of up to 25 independent antigen targets in a point-of-care setting. The VFA design allows for uniform flow of sample across the target membrane, creating uniform binding conditions and maximizing developed signal. We coupled this design with a cost-effective portable smart-phone based reader allowing for quantitative measure of antibody binding, eliminating subjectiv- ity. By multiplexing peptide antigens each containing 1-2 epitopes unique to B. burgdorferi from multiple differ- ent antigens expressed at different stages during mammalian infection we can generate a single tier, POC as- say that can specifically and sensitively detect patient antibody at all stages of the disease. The assay can be completed in less than 25 min allowing for rapid in office results to support clinical diagnosis, thereby improving patient outcomes. Project Narrative Early diagnosis of Lyme disease is critical to prevent disease progression and sequelae; however current laboratory diagnostics that are used to support clinical diagnosis are insensitive during early infection, failing ~50% of the time. We propose the development of a sensitive and specific multi-antigen point-of-care assay that will provide immediate serological detection of antibodies against Borrelia burgdorferi, the causative agent of Lyme disease, to aid in physician diagnosis.

"Mathematical ecology models of host-microbiota interaction in auto microbiota transplants (auto-FMT) Project Summary Mathematical ecology models of host-microbiota interaction  in auto microbiota transplants (auto-FMT) We aim to develop mathematical models for the rational design of microbiota transplants that can restore compositional diversity and function to the damaged microbiota of antibiotic-treated patients. We will focus on hospitalized cancer patients receiving allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplants (allo-HSCT). Allo-HSCT is a potentially curative cancer treatment that compromises the immune system, and requires that patients receive massive antibiotic treatments to prevent and treat life-threatening infections. We will build on a vast clinical database, in vitro experiments in bioreactors and in vivo experiments with mice to develop dynamic mathematical models that describe how antibiotics cause changes in the microbial composition, and how that can impact the recovery of the host's immune system after allo-HSCT. The model expands approaches pioneered by our team—the Generalized Lotka Volterra Ecological Regression (GLOVER) and agent-based models—towards a model that can assist in the development of microbiota therapies for patients undergoing allo-HSCT.  In aim 1 we will use data from a unique clinical resource available at the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer center—a sample bank obtained from >1,500 allo-HSCT patients (including microbiome 16S rRNA and shotgun sequencing) and extensive clinical metadata (including time series of complete blood counts and time and doses of all drugs given while the patients are hospitalized); we will also use data from a first-of-its-kind controlled randomized trial of autologous fecal microbiota transplant (auto-FMT) undergoing in allo-HSCT patients. We will use these unique resources to parameterize our models and investigate how the microbiota composition influences the recovery of the host immune system. In aim 2 we will validate the microbial component of our mathematical model using experimental data from anaerobic laboratory reactors that recreate—in vitro—the human microbiota dynamics during antibiotic treatment and auto-FMT in the absence of a living host. In aim 3 we will develop mouse models to investigate those same microbiota dynamics experimentally but now in the context of a living host.  The data obtained from these clinical studies, in vitro experiments and in vivo models will refine our mathematical models in close cycles of simulation and quantitative experimentation. Our ultimate goal is to develop models that can define optimal microbial cocktails and reconstitute the perturbed microbiota of allo- HSCT patients.

"Childhood ‘Omics’ and Mycobacterium tuberculosis-derived BiOsignatures (COMBO) for TB diagnosis in high HIV prevalence settings PROJECT SUMMARY There is an urgent need to develop non-sputum biomarker-based triage and diagnostic tests for childhood tuberculosis (TB). This is particularly important for young children with HIV infection, who have high TB-related mortality but often cannot produce sputum and have lower sputum bacillary burden. Biomarker discovery for childhood TB requires ultra-sensitive platforms to measure low-abundant Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) proteins in clinical samples and greater investigation of host proteins, post-translational modifications of proteins, and metabolites that are more likely than upstream RNA expression to reflect the host-pathogen interactions that lead to TB disease. The overall objective of the proposed project is to identify Mtb- and/or host-derived biosignatures in children that can achieve World Health Organization (WHO) target product profile (TPP) accuracy thresholds for a non-sputum biomarker-based triage or diagnostic test for childhood TB. We hypothesize that biosignatures that combine Mtb proteins and host biomarkers with evidence of functional relevance to TB pathogenesis or immunity will have the best diagnostic performance. To assess this hypothesis, we will conduct biomarker discovery and initial clinical validation studies using samples from three well- characterized pediatric TB cohorts in Uganda, The Gambia and South Africa. In Aim 1, we will use an ultra- sensitive electrochemoluminescence (ECL)-based immunoassay to assess the presence of Mtb proteins ESAT- 6, CFP-10, MPT64, MPT32, and Ag85B in a discovery set of banked blood and urine samples from 100 children under 5 years old with confirmed TB and 200 with unlikely TB per NIH consensus definitions (50% HIV prevalence in both groups). In Aim 2, we will use the same discovery set to perform targeted and untargeted mass spectrometry with functional assessment through pathway analysis, in vitro models and in vivo mouse models to identify host proteins, post-translational modifications and metabolites that distinguish children with confirmed versus unlikely TB. In Aim 3, we will use the candidate Mtb and host biomarkers identified in Aims 1 and 2 to derive biosignatures with up to 10 analytes consisting of Mtb proteins only, host biomarkers only, and both Mtb- and host-derived biomarkers. Biosignatures that meet WHO TPP criteria in the discovery set will 1) be evaluated in an independent test set of banked samples from 300 children under 5 years old (100 with confirmed TB, 200 with unlikely TB; 50% HIV prevalence in each group) to verify diagnostic accuracy and establish cut- offs and 2) be evaluated in a prospective cohort of 350 children under 5 years old using the pre-select cut-offs and both microbiological and clinical reference standards. Completion of these aims will result in identification of promising biosignatures that can be further validated in large-scale field studies and translated into point-of-care triage and/or diagnostic tests for childhood TB. PROJECT NARRATIVE The inability to quickly and accurately diagnose tuberculosis (TB) in children and initiate treatment is a major contributor to the high mortality of childhood TB worldwide. This study will identify novel Mtb- and host-derived biomarkers, and determine the best biomarker panels (i.e., biosignatures) that can meet the World Health Organization-recommended diagnostic accuracy thresholds for a TB triage or diagnostic test. If successful, the results will the first step needed to make progress toward addressing the critical unmet need for non-sputum biomarker-based tests for childhood TB.",Childhood ‘Omics’ and Mycobacterium tuberculosis-derived BiOsignatures (COMBO) for TB diagnosis in high HIV prevalence settings,9986338,R01AI152161,"['5 year old', 'Address', 'Africa South of the Sahara', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood Banks', 'Cause of Death', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Enrollment', 'Evaluation', 'Failure', 'Gambia', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genetic Transcription', 'HIV', 'HIV Infections', 'HIV/TB', 'Human', 'Immunity', 'Immunoassay', 'In Vitro', 'Investigation', 'Knock-out', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Microbiology', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Mycobacterium tuberculosis', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Performance', 'Plasma', 'Post-Translational Protein Processing', 'Prevalence', 'Probability', 'Prospective cohort', 'Proteins', 'ROC Curve', 'Reference Standards', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'South Africa', 'Specificity', 'Sputum', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Triage', 'Tryptophan', 'Tuberculosis', 'Uganda', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Urine', 'Validation', 'World Health Organization', 'accurate diagnosis', 'base', 'bioinformatics pipeline', 'biomarker discovery', 'biomarker panel', 'biosignature', 'clinical research site', 'clinically relevant', 'co-infection', 'cohort', 'cost', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'field study', 'in vitro Model', 'in vivo', 'in vivo Model', 'ion mobility', 'macrophage', 'mortality', 'mouse model', 'multiple omics', 'next generation', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'point of care', 'point-of-care diagnostics', 'prospective', 'protein metabolite', 'success', 'targeted biomarker', 'transcriptomics', 'tuberculosis diagnostics', 'validation studies']",NIAID,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2020,1503586,0.011212176676903492
"Mentoring in Immunometabolic Dysregulation in TB and TB/HIV Tuberculosis (TB) is the leading cause of death among people living with HIV (PLWH) worldwide. Despite recent scientific advances, significant gaps remain in our understanding of the immune mechanisms responsible for control and eradication of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection. PLWH with latent TB infection (LTBI) have a ~10% annual risk of progressing to TB disease, however currently available tests for LTBI diagnosis have reduced sensitivity in this population and are not able to predict which latently infected individuals are at highest risk for developing TB for targeted preventive therapy. Emerging data from clinically relevant animal models suggest that LTBI and active TB represent a spectrum of immune responses and host pathology, with increasing metabolic changes and immune dysregulation during the transition to TB disease. We have identified unique serum metabolite and microRNA (miRNA) profiles that are able to discriminate between patients with TB and those with non-TB lung disease. However, these novel TB signatures have not been assessed prospectively to identify PLWH and HIV-negative persons with LTBI who are at increased risk for TB progression. In order to address this significant knowledge gap, in Aim 1 of the current research program, trainees will leverage the Indian and South African RePORT longitudinal biorepositories of household contacts of TB index cases to test the hypothesis that TB is a chronic inflammatory disease associated with profound changes in immune regulation and metabolism prior to the onset of clinical signs and symptoms. Another major barrier to global TB eradication efforts is the lengthy and complicated current anti-tubercular regimen, which is associated with medical nonadherence and the emergence of drug resistance. Recently, attention has focused on host-directed adjunctive therapies aimed at optimizing immune responses to the pathogen and improving lung damage. Lipid-laden macrophages (foam cells) are central to maintaining chronic TB infection by providing a favorable niche in which antimicrobial functions are down-regulated, and by inducing caseation and tissue damage. Recent work has shown that foam-cell-rich and necrotic areas of TB granulomas are particularly enriched in triglycerides. Mtb infection is associated with dysregulation of two cellular pathways involved in triglyceride homeostasis: a pro-lipogenic pathway involving protein kinase B and mTOR complex 1 (Akt/mTORC1), and an anti- lipogenic pathway involving AMP-activated protein kinase and the sirtuins (AMPK/SIRT). In Aim 2, trainees will use longitudinal clinical samples from RePORT study participants and experimental infections ex vivo to characterize: (i) the relationship between activation of these pathways and control of clinical Mtb infection, and the effect of anti-lipogenic treatments on antimycobacterial functions of human macrophages infected ex vivo. The research aims will be integrated with a mentoring strategy for mentees that fosters development of high impact patient-oriented research with a pathway to independence. Tuberculosis (TB) remains among the most deadly infections worldwide, especially among people living with HIV. Current available tests are not able to accurately detect persons at the highest risk of developing TB, and curing the disease requires at least 6 months of therapy because the TB bacteria can avoid being killed by the immune system and currently available drugs. In the current proposal, physician scientists will receive training in a variety of complementary disciplines, and use several cutting-edge experimental and modeling techniques to analyze samples from patients with TB and TB/HIV, with the ultimate goal of identifying new biomarkers that can predict TB disease and host-directed therapies that can shorten TB treatment.",Mentoring in Immunometabolic Dysregulation in TB and TB/HIV,9975724,K24AI143447,"['5&apos', '-AMP-activated protein kinase', 'Address', 'Animal Model', 'Antibiotics', 'Antimycobacterial Agents', 'Archives', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Automobile Driving', 'Bacteria', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Cause of Death', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Complex', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Drug resistance', 'Environment', 'Experimental Models', 'FRAP1 gene', 'Foam Cells', 'Fostering', 'Goals', 'HIV', 'HIV Seronegativity', 'HIV Seropositivity', 'HIV/TB', 'Homeostasis', 'Household', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immune system', 'Immunocompetent', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'International', 'Knowledge', 'Lesion', 'Lipid-Laden Macrophage', 'Lipids', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Mentors', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'MicroRNAs', 'Mycobacterium tuberculosis', 'Necrosis', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Preventive therapy', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt', 'Pulmonary Tuberculosis', 'Regimen', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Scientific Advances and Accomplishments', 'Scientist', 'Serum', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Sirtuins', 'South African', 'Specimen', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Triglycerides', 'Tuberculosis', 'Validation', 'Whole Blood', 'Work', 'World Health Organization', 'antimicrobial', 'biobank', 'biosignature', 'career', 'chronic inflammatory disease', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'cytokine', 'high risk', 'immunoregulation', 'improved', 'indexing', 'lifetime risk', 'lung injury', 'macrophage', 'monocyte', 'mycobacterial', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'patient oriented research', 'peripheral blood', 'prevent', 'programs', 'prospective', 'tool', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'tuberculosis granuloma', 'tuberculosis treatment']",NIAID,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,K24,2020,191195,0.043484181483423145
"Systematic Analysis of Morphogenesis, Commensalism, and Virulence in a Leading Human Fungal Pathogen The impact of fungal pathogens on human health is devastating. They infect billions of people worldwide, and kill more than 1.5 million each year. The most vulnerable are people with reduced immune function, such as those with HIV or those undergoing immune suppressing treatments for cancer or organ transplants. One of the most pervasive fungal pathogens is Candida albicans, which kills almost 40% of people suffering from bloodstream infections. Treating these infections is extremely difficult, as fungi are closely related to humans and there are very few drugs that kill the fungus without host toxicity. With the emergence of drug resistance, the development of new therapeutic strategies is now crucial. To address this important clinical need and identify new antifungal drug targets, it is critical to uncover mechanisms that enable C. albicans to cause life-threatening human disease.  We are one of the first academic labs to obtain a powerful resource that will allow us to test the function of almost every gene in the C. albicans genome. This resource includes a collection of double barcoded heterozygous mutants covering ~90% of the genome, and a collection of strains covering ~40% of the genome where the expression of the remaining wild-type allele of a gene is governed by the tetracycline-repressible promoter. This resource provides an unprecedented opportunity to identify genes that control key virulence traits such as morphogenesis. It also enables the identification of determinants of commensalism and virulence, and to further elucidate the molecular mechanisms involved. We have optimized a functional genomics platform for massively parallel analysis of fungal virulence traits using next generation sequencing to quantify the relative proportion of each barcoded strain in pooled assays. We have also optimized high- resolution image analysis of cellular morphology and structures, and assays for identifying genes important for commensalism, virulence, and interaction with host immune cells. Our studies will provide the first global analysis of C. albicans morphogenesis, commensalism, and virulence.  Our studies will: 1) develop a computational platform to predict C. albicans essential genes, and expand the collection of tetracycline-repressible conditional expression strains to cover most non-essential genes, since genes required for pathogen viability in vitro provide little insight into mechanisms of host adaptation or virulence; 2) identify novel regulators of key virulence traits such as morphogenesis; and 3) identify determinants of C. albicans host adaptation and virulence on a genome scale. This work will provide an expanded functional genomics resource to advance the field, and will leverage this resource to elucidate the genes and genetic networks governing morphogenesis and virulence. This will reveal new strategies to cripple fungal pathogens, and drug targets to improve clinical outcome. The focus of this proposal is to elucidate mechanisms governing morphogenesis, commensalism, and virulence of the fungal pathogen Candida albicans. This eukaryotic pathogen has a profound impact on human health, with a global incidence of Candida bloodstream infections of ~400,000 cases, associated with crude mortality rates of 42% and attributable mortality rates of 27%; C. albicans is the most prevalent Candida species in almost all patient populations. The central hypotheses that govern this proposal are that functional genomic analysis of C. albicans using genome-scale libraries of double barcoded heterozygous gene deletion mutants and tetracycline-repressible conditional expression strains will reveal novel circuitry governing morphogenesis, commensalism, and virulence, and that targeting this circuitry has therapeutic potential for combating life-threatening fungal infections.","Systematic Analysis of Morphogenesis, Commensalism, and Virulence in a Leading Human Fungal Pathogen",9985737,R01AI127375,"['Address', 'Alleles', 'Aneuploidy', 'Antifungal Agents', 'Antifungal Therapy', 'Ascomycota', 'Bar Codes', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Candida', 'Candida albicans', 'Cells', 'Cellular Morphology', 'Cellular Structures', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Cues', 'Cytolysis', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diploidy', 'Drug Targeting', 'Drug resistance', 'Environment', 'Essential Genes', 'Filament', 'Foundations', 'Gastrointestinal tract structure', 'Gene Deletion', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomic Library', 'Genomic approach', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'HIV', 'Health', 'Human', 'Image Analysis', 'Immune', 'Immune system', 'Immunocompromised Host', 'In Vitro', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Investments', 'Laboratories', 'Libraries', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Morphogenesis', 'Mus', 'Mutation', 'Mycoses', 'Nosocomial Infections', 'Organ Transplantation', 'Organism', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Process', 'Property', 'Publishing', 'Resistance development', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Sepsis', 'Solid', 'Symbiosis', 'Systemic infection', 'Testing', 'Tetracyclines', 'Therapeutic', 'Toxic effect', 'Virulence', 'Work', 'Yeast Model System', 'Yeasts', 'attributable mortality', 'cancer therapy', 'cancer transplantation', 'combat', 'computational platform', 'fitness', 'functional genomics', 'fungus', 'gene replacement', 'genome-wide', 'genomic platform', 'high resolution imaging', 'human disease', 'immune function', 'improved', 'insight', 'member', 'mortality', 'mucosal microbiota', 'mutant', 'new therapeutic target', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'novel therapeutics', 'pathogen', 'pathogenic fungus', 'patient population', 'programs', 'promoter', 'quantitative imaging', 'response', 'trait', 'unpublished works']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF TORONTO,R01,2020,545004,-0.007558456386749937
"The Vanderbilt Urologic Infection Repository, a Resource for Personalized Clinical Discovery SUMMARY - OVERALL In personalized medicine, the care of each patient is guided by his/her unique clinical circumstances. At its foundation, however, this paradigm holds a concurrent need for personalized science, in which technologies are developed and hypothesis explored in light of individual diversity. Critically, this diversity also includes unique microbial populations, which can augment the onset, progression, and treatment of disease. Within the field of benign urology, one of the most common pathologies—urinary tract infections (UTIs)—is also one of the most heterogenous, as the risk factors, symptomatology, and outcomes can vary significantly from patient to patient. Not surprisingly, the complexity of UTIs extends beyond the host, with tremendous genotypic and phenotypic diversity among the species/strains of microbes that elicit these infections. To better align the management of UTIs with the goals of precision care, our understanding of pathophysiology must become more nuanced, as we network in tandem the inherent diversity of host and microbe. To these ends, we propose a resource that provides an interconnected picture of both components, the Vanderbilt Urologic Infection Repository (VUIR). With our institution's unique foundation in medical informatics, we will create a searchable database of clinical parameters from bacteriuric patients (many thousands of cases annually), together with microbiologic data on the organisms. In parallel, the paired microbial strains will be stored permanently as a biobank for analysis and experimentation, together with linkage to anonymized versions of patient records within Vanderbilt's Synthetic Derivative (a filtered version of our electronic health data). The logistical infrastructure for clinical biobanking is also already in place at Vanderbilt via the institutionally-supported microVU initiative, in which microbial isolates from the diagnostic laboratory are repurposed as academic resources. As a basic expansion of these efforts, the VUIR will represent a first-in-kind tool for developing technologies to combat UTIs, while also investigating their underlying pathogenesis. In particular, it could facilitate functional genomic studies that bridge host and pathogen. Demonstrating the resource's value, we will conduct whole-genome sequencing of clinically underrepresented bacterial species, together with genome-wide association studies that focus on the infection phenotypes of the source-patients. In addition to novel virulence factors, we seek to identify elusive genomic determinants that distinguish cases of asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) and symptomatic UTI. The molecular basis of UTI-versus-ASB epitomizes a clinical challenge that requires integration of host and pathogen, as provided by the VUIR. Finally, to support the program and its discoveries, we propose an organizational structure of multidisciplinary content-area experts and dedicated support staff. Along with coordinating daily activities and assuring seamless dissemination of data/specimens, this Administrative Core (AdCore) will champion educational activities and additional pilot projects that build upon the resource. In sum, the VUIR stands to generate actionable discoveries from the human and microbial diversity of UTIs—not in spite of it. PROJECT NARRATIVE - OVERALL Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are not only a common urologic ailment, but one of the most widespread medical conditions facing women, men and children around the globe. In order for clinicians to better manage UTIs—and scientists to understand them more deeply—our clinical viewpoint must become personalized, as we study in tandem the afflicted patients and offending pathogens. To these ends, the Vanderbilt Urologic Infection Repository will provide a first-in-kind resource for the biomedical community, creating a massive network of patient-level clinical data and banked microbial strains from patients with real-world infections.","The Vanderbilt Urologic Infection Repository, a Resource for Personalized Clinical Discovery",10022297,P20DK123967,"['Acinetobacter baumannii', 'Advisory Committees', 'Antimicrobial susceptibility', 'Area', 'Bacteriuria', 'Benign', 'Caring', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Communities', 'Community Outreach', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Education and Outreach', 'Educational Activities', 'Educational workshop', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Escherichia coli', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genitourinary System Infection', 'Genitourinary system', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Genus staphylococcus', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Informatics', 'Infrastructure', 'Institution', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Light', 'Link', 'Location', 'Logistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Medical', 'Medical Informatics', 'Medical Records', 'Microbe', 'Microbiology', 'Molecular', 'Organism', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Physiology', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Published Comment', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Resources', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Services', 'Source', 'Specimen', 'Sum', 'Symptoms', 'Taxonomy', 'Technology', 'Urinary tract infection', 'Urine', 'Urologic Diseases', 'Urology', 'Uropathogen', 'Virulence Factors', 'Woman', 'base', 'biobank', 'biomedical resource', 'career development', 'clinical database', 'clinical infrastructure', 'clinical sequencing', 'combat', 'data dissemination', 'data mining', 'data space', 'data warehouse', 'demographics', 'functional genomics', 'genome sequencing', 'genome wide association study', 'health data', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'innovation', 'interest', 'member', 'men', 'microbial', 'microbial genome', 'microbiome', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'operation', 'organizational structure', 'outcome forecast', 'pathogen', 'pathogenic microbe', 'patient health information', 'personalized care', 'personalized medicine', 'precision medicine', 'prevent', 'programs', 'repository', 'symptomatology', 'tool', 'translational impact', 'urinary', 'urologic', 'whole genome', 'young woman']",NIDDK,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,P20,2020,340000,0.0357772854755248
"Developing a robust platform to identify unexpected and novel viruses in human brain tissue Project Summary / Abstract  Central nervous system infections with RNA viruses cause severe neurological deficits and death, and are extremely challenging to diagnose. This multiple PI proposal presents an innovative research program that will provide the foundation for a comprehensive viral diagnostics pipeline to rapidly diagnose RNA virus infections from surgical brain biopsies. The investigators will combine two cutting-edge techniques for viral detection, screening with double-stranded RNA immunohistochemistry (dsRNA IHC) to identify cases with a high likelihood of a viral etiology, and unbiased metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) for specific virus identification and genome analysis.  To develop the dsRNA IHC screening assay, six commercially available anti-dsRNA antibodies will be optimized in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) brain tissue and evaluated in a series of known infectious and non-infectious cases. The top candidates will be tested in a set of brain biopsies with inflammation of unclear etiology and compared to results of mNGS performed in parallel. The development of this assay will facilitate efficient screening of FFPE tissue samples from patients with neurological disease of unclear pathogenesis to identify those with a high likelihood of viral etiology. To improve mNGS methods for FFPE brain tissue, new laboratory techniques will be tested to increase the yield and quality of viral RNA extracted. In addition to virus identification, mNGS will be used to perform full-genome deep sequencing of viruses. These results can be applied to molecular epidemiology, disease surveillance, and understanding pathogen-host interactions. Overall, this project will enhance our understanding of RNA viruses that cause CNS infection, inform future studies of virus evolution and pathogenesis, and lay the foundation for the development of a comprehensive viral diagnostics pipeline that will substantially improve the care of patients with devastating CNS infections. This work aligns very well with the NINDS mission to seek and apply fundamental knowledge of the brain to reduce the burden of neurological disease.  This R21 Exploratory Neuroscience Research Grant proposal will support and expand the collaboration between the two PIs. The unique combination of expertise in neuropathology, infectious disease pathology, virology, clinical infectious disease, and metagenomic sequencing demonstrate the requisite skills and perspective needed to achieve the goals of this proposal. The stimulating environments of Brigham and Women’s Hospital, Harvard University, and Emory University are extremely well suited to the proposed research plan, which not only provide critical equipment and facilities infrastructure, but also mentorship, formal opportunities to present and discuss results, and eventual venues to implement this clinical testing prospectively. Project Narrative Viral infections of the central nervous system cause significant illness and death, and in many patients the specific virus causing infection is never found. This project will develop new tools to detect viruses in brain tissue, including previously unknown viruses, and sequence their genomes.

"Comprehensive analysis of human adaptive immune receptors to elucidate correlates of Epstein-Barr virus disease suppression Project Summary/Abstract This project will develop a new technological approach for the comprehensive analysis of adaptive immune responses, which holds the potential to catalyze new strategies to prevent and treat disease. Here we will apply immune profiling techniques recently invented by the PI to investigate the mechanisms of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) adaptive immune control in clinical cohorts of infected patients. EBV is a highly prevalent pathogen infecting >90% of the world’s population. Primary EBV infection often causes infectious mononucleosis (IM) and long-term sequelae include numerous malignancies, lymphoproliferative disorders, and a strong association with multiple sclerosis. No EBV vaccine is approved to date, and the molecular mechanisms of immune protection from EBV-associated diseases are unclear. Unfortunately, prior technical barriers in high- throughput immune profiling methods have prevented a comprehensive understanding of adaptive immune protection against EBV diseases. A technological approach that identifies the critical features of EBV immune protection will advance new solutions for vaccine and therapeutic development. Therefore, we developed an experimental pipeline to enable rapid and cost-effective analysis of B- and T-cell responses to EBV that is scalable to dozens of human patients per experiment. We hypothesize that a comprehensive B- and T-cell analysis of carefully selected patient cohorts that either can or cannot suppress symptomatic infection will reveal function-based correlates of EBV control. To test this hypothesis, we will apply quantitative immune profiling technologies to analyze cryopreserved longitudinal samples from recently completed prospective clinical studies of IM. Patient samples in our cohort span pre- and post-infection through convalescence and encompass the full range of clinical IM severity scores (from 0, asymptomatic primary infection, to 6, essentially bedridden with IM). Immune profile data will be used to establish adaptive immune correlates of IM disease severity. In addition, we will analyze immune responses in apparently immunocompetent patients with chronic active EBV (CAEBV) disease, or patients who do not adequately suppress EBV infection, to gain insight regarding adaptive immune function and dysfunction in CAEBV. Finally, we will develop a new computational toolkit to rapidly identify immune correlates from high-throughput datasets. Successful completion of this project will constitute the first comprehensive functional B- and T-cell receptor analysis in a human clinical cohort. Our efforts will provide a repertoire-scale, mechanistic understanding of adaptive immunity to EBV and suggest new strategies for treatment and prevention of EBV-associated diseases. Our long-term goal is to develop human immune profiling techniques as a platform approach to accelerate the rational design of vaccines and therapeutics against pathogens of high public health importance, beginning with EBV. Project Narrative This project will apply new high-throughput immune profiling technologies to elucidate the features of effective Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) immune control. EBV causes a range of human diseases including infectious mononucleosis and several forms of cancer; however, limited EBV treatment options are available and no approved preventive EBV vaccines exist. Our long-term objective is to apply enhanced understanding of adaptive immunity to accelerate the rational development of new vaccines and therapeutics.",Comprehensive analysis of human adaptive immune receptors to elucidate correlates of Epstein-Barr virus disease suppression,9996359,DP5OD023118,"['Address', 'Antibodies', 'Antibody titer measurement', 'B cell repertoire', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Burkitt Lymphoma', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes', 'Cells', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Convalescence', 'Cost Effectiveness Analysis', 'Cryopreservation', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'EBV-associated disease', 'Ensure', 'Epstein-Barr Virus Infections', 'Exhibits', 'Fatigue', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Herpesviridae', 'Herpesviridae Infections', 'Hodgkin Disease', 'Human', 'Human Herpesvirus 4', 'Immune', 'Immune System Diseases', 'Immune response', 'Immunocompetent', 'Immunologic Receptors', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Infectious Mononucleosis', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lymphoproliferative Disorders', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Nasopharynx Carcinoma', 'Oncogenic', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Preventive', 'Primary Infection', 'Public Health', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell', 'Recovery', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Serum', 'Severities', 'Severity of illness', 'Stomach Carcinoma', 'Symptoms', 'T cell response', 'T-Cell Receptor', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'T-cell receptor repertoire', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Teenagers', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic antibodies', 'Vaccine Design', 'Vaccines', 'Viral', 'Virus Diseases', 'Work', 'adaptive immune response', 'adaptive immunity', 'base', 'career', 'cohort', 'cost', 'design', 'disorder control', 'experimental study', 'high dimensionality', 'human disease', 'immune function', 'insight', 'lead candidate', 'multiple sclerosis patient', 'neutralizing monoclonal antibodies', 'next generation', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'novel vaccines', 'pathogen', 'pressure', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'response', 'therapeutic development', 'treatment strategy', 'vaccine development', 'vaccine trial', 'virology', 'young adult']",OD,UNIVERSITY OF KANSAS LAWRENCE,DP5,2020,363296,0.049814874127941326
"Systems Biology of Microbiome-mediated Resilience to Antibiotic-resistant Pathogens ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Infections caused by antibiotic-resistant bacterial pathogens are exceedingly common in immunocompromised hosts. Patients undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) are particularly susceptible to these infections and are the patient population our studies will focus upon. Our goal is to extend and further develop systems biology approaches that our group has pioneered to identify mechanisms by which the intestinal microbiota confers resistance to infection by Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE), antibiotic-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (arKp) and Clostridium difficile (C. diff). Aim 1 of our project is to establish a clinical database from the hospital recrds of allo-HSCT patients during their initial hospitalization that will include all laboratory values,vital signs, pharmacy data, dietary data, symptoms and physical exam findings. Aim 2 will expand our fecal bank by collecting fecal samples from approximately 160 allo-HSCT patients per year and determining the presence/absence of VRE, arKp and C. diff by culture and PCR. We will use NGS of 16S rRNA genes to determine microbiota composition on each sample, will perform metagenomic and RNA sequencing to determine the bacterial transcriptome and perform metabolomic analyses on a selected subset of fecal samples. Aim 3 is to extend our mathematical modeling to identify specific members of the microbiota, metabolic pathways and metabolic products that correlate with resistance to VRE or arKp expansion in the GI tract or are associated with resistance to C. diff infection. The clinical database will be used to establish correlations between clinical treatments or events and changes in the intestinal microbiota or the expression of bacterial metabolic pathways. Ultimately, the computational platforms developed in aim 3 will identify bacterial species or consortia that are associated with resistance to infection and Aim 4 will test these associations in germ-free mouse models. We will culture bacterial species associated with resistance, colonize mice with these protective bacteria and test for resistance against VRE, arKp and C. diff. Samples obtained from these experimental studies will be subjected to metagenomic and metabolomic analyses to further refine, in an iterative fashion, computational models developed in aim 3. Our proposed studies will develop new and extend existing computational models to identify bacterial species and molecular mechanisms that confer resistance to antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The normal bacteria inhabiting the human intestine provide a high level of resistance against antibiotic-resistant bacterial pathogens. We are investigating the intestinal flora of hospitalized patients and using mathematical modeling to identify bacterial species and their metabolic products that reduce the risk of infection by three prevalent antibiotic-resistant bacteria. These studies may lead to the development of new approaches to treat and prevent antibiotic-resistant infections.",Systems Biology of Microbiome-mediated Resilience to Antibiotic-resistant Pathogens,9922844,U01AI124275,"['16S ribosomal RNA sequencing', 'Allogenic', 'Antibiotic Resistance', 'Antibiotic Therapy', 'Antibiotics', 'Bacteria', 'Bacterial Antibiotic Resistance', 'Bacterial Infections', 'Categories', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Clostridium difficile', 'Collection', 'Computer Models', 'Data', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Diet', 'Dietary intake', 'Enrollment', 'Event', 'Feces', 'Gastrointestinal tract structure', 'Germ-Free', 'Gnotobiotic', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immunocompromised Host', 'Infection', 'Integration Host Factors', 'Intestinal Content', 'Intestines', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurable', 'Mediating', 'Medical Records', 'Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Pathway', 'Metagenomics', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacy facility', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Resistance', 'Resistance to infection', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Symptoms', 'Systems Biology', 'Testing', 'Toxic effect', 'Transplantation', 'Uncertainty', 'Vancomycin Resistance', 'Vancomycin resistant enterococcus', 'antibiotic resistant infections', 'antimicrobial drug', 'clinical database', 'clinically relevant', 'colonization resistance', 'commensal bacteria', 'commensal microbes', 'computational platform', 'computer studies', 'data warehouse', 'design', 'drug resistant pathogen', 'experimental study', 'falls', 'gut microbiota', 'host microbiome', 'immune activation', 'infection rate', 'infection risk', 'mathematical model', 'member', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'metagenome', 'metagenomic sequencing', 'microbiome', 'microbiota', 'microorganism interaction', 'mouse model', 'network models', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'parallel computer', 'pathogenic bacteria', 'patient population', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'rRNA Genes', 'resilience', 'resistance mechanism', 'resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae', 'text searching', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics']",NIAID,SLOAN-KETTERING INST CAN RESEARCH,U01,2020,1755886,0.06710694682823037
"Gut Microbial and Metabolic Mediators of Rotavirus Vaccine Response Abstract Rotavirus (RV) infection causes life-threatening, dehydrating diarrhea and is the leading cause of diarrheal deaths among children <5 years old despite availability of a vaccine. Critically, the oral vaccine is less effective in middle- and low-income countries where disproportionately more deaths occur compared to high-income countries. Addressing this disparity in vaccine effectiveness is a major public health priority. Correlates of protection do not exist, and cellular responses against RV in humans remain incompletely understood. Mounting evidence supports a direct role for the gut microbiota in modulating humoral and cellular immune responses to oral vaccines, but little is known about their actual mechanism of action. In our pilot study, vaccine responders had a significantly greater abundance of Bifidobacterium longum and higher content of microbial genes associated with folate transformation in their gut compared to nonresponders. These data suggest that infants may depend on microbes such as B. longum to synthesize folate de novo as a mechanism for RV-specific immune cell expansion. We hypothesize that de novo folate synthesis by microbes such as B. longum facilitates RV-specific immune cell expansion, and that levels of folate modulate vaccine immunogenicity. We propose to study 330 infants from the US, Panama, and Peru where vaccine efficacy is known to be high, medium and low, respectively, by using both stored and prospectively collected longitudinal samples of blood and stool from infants 0 to 12 months of age. We have designed a novel RV “megapool” of immunogenic peptides to define cellular immune responses to RV vaccination in addition to assessing traditional serum RV-specific IgA and stool RV shedding after immunization (Aim 1). We will characterize gut microbial composition and function using metagenomic sequencing at multiple pre-vaccination time points in vaccine responders and nonresponders to determine if the abundance of B. longum and capacity to synthesize folate predict vaccine immunogenicity (Aim 2). We will analyze the metabolic byproducts to identify if folate or other metabolites enhance vaccine response (Aim 3). Our unique team of experts in vaccinology, immunology, microbiology, biochemistry, and bioinformatics will ensure successful integrative analysis and interpretation of these immunologic and multi-omics data. Completion of the study will provide a comprehensive characterization of microbial and metabolic biomarkers of RV vaccine responses, paving the way for targeted immune augmentation strategies. Project Narrative Rotavirus vaccine was developed to prevent severe diarrhea and is especially important in low- and middle- income countries where 85% of deaths due to rotaviruses occur; unfortunately, vaccine efficacy is lower in these countries compared to high-income countries. This proposal will study infants from three countries with different socioeconomic levels and use sophisticated methods to determine how specific bacteria in the infant gut (microbiome) may change the response to the vaccine. If successful, this study will have a significant impact on this important public health disparity as a targeted intervention to improve vaccine response, even if small, could save tens of thousands of lives every year.",Gut Microbial and Metabolic Mediators of Rotavirus Vaccine Response,9862588,R01HD100542,"['5 year old', 'Address', 'Age-Months', 'Antibodies', 'Antibody titer measurement', 'Bacteria', 'Bifidobacterium', 'Biochemistry', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth', 'Blood', 'Blood specimen', 'Cell Differentiation process', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Child', 'Country', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diarrhea', 'Enrollment', 'Ensure', 'Feces', 'Folic Acid', 'Folic Acid Deficiency', 'Genes', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune Targeting', 'Immune response', 'Immunization', 'Immunoglobulin A', 'Immunologics', 'Immunology', 'Income', 'Infant', 'Infection', 'Intervention', 'Intestines', 'Life', 'Literature', 'Lymphocyte', 'Maintenance', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Memory', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Biotransformation', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Microbe', 'Microbiology', 'Multiomic Data', 'Nutrient', 'Oral', 'Panama', 'Pathway interactions', 'Peptides', 'Peru', 'Peruvian', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Production', 'Public Health', 'Regulatory T-Lymphocyte', 'Role', 'Rotavirus', 'Rotavirus Infections', 'Rotavirus Vaccines', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Serum', 'Shotguns', 'Specificity', 'T cell response', 'T memory cell', 'T-Cell Proliferation', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Vaccination', 'Vaccines', 'Vitamins', 'base', 'cell growth', 'design', 'folic acid supplementation', 'gut microbiome', 'gut microbiota', 'health disparity', 'immune function', 'immunogenic', 'immunogenicity', 'improved', 'infant gut microbiome', 'low and middle-income countries', 'low income country', 'metabolic profile', 'metabolomics', 'metagenomic sequencing', 'microbial', 'microbiome', 'novel', 'oral vaccine', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'public health priorities', 'response', 'sample collection', 'socioeconomics', 'statistical and machine learning', 'stool sample', 'vaccine effectiveness', 'vaccine efficacy', 'vaccine response', 'vaccinology']",NICHD,CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL OF LOS ANGELES,R01,2020,681780,0.019366412271757477
"Decoding the microbial burden in diabetic foot ulcers Chronic, non-healing wounds are common and costly complications of diabetes. Microbial colonization and biofilm formation are hypothesized to impair wound healing and contribute to severe complications such as osteomyelitis and amputation. Although all chronic wounds are colonized with microbiota, its importance, in the absence of clinical infection, is currently unknown. In this competitive renewal, we hypothesize that host response, wound healing, and clinical DFU outcomes are determined by 1) genomic diversification of the wound pathogen Staphylococcus aureus; 2) commensal interactions with wound pathogens; and 3) commensal interactions with the host. In the previous cycle, we developed a shotgun metagenomic sequencing pipeline to analyze the microbiota colonizing neuropathic, non-infected DFU (n=100; the “DFU100” cohort) in a longitudinal prospective cohort study. We observed that strain-level variation of the wound pathogen Staphylococcus aureus was associated with DFU outcomes. Therefore, in Aim 1, we will use a microbial genomic approach and matched clinical isolates from the DFU100 cohort to identify S. aureus genomic determinants of pathogenesis in DFU and their association with clinical outcomes. We also observed that species clinically regarded as “bystanders” (e.g. skin commensals, environmental contaminants) influence the virulence of wound pathogens and tune host tissue repair responses to promote healing in vivo. Aim 2 will determine if a skin commensal, Corynebacterium striatum, tunes the virulence of S. aureus and improves wound healing in murine and porcine models of S. aureus wound infection. Aim 3 is based on our observation that Alcaligenes faecalis wound isolates promote keratinocyte migration, cytokine secretion, and accelerated wound closure in a murine model of diabetic wound healing. We will establish the mechanism and therapeutic potential of A. faecalis-mediated host responses that lead to accelerated wound healing. The proposed research will use cutting-edge, cross-disciplinary approaches to investigate interactions between wound pathogens, wound “bystanders”, and the host; understanding these mechanisms will lead to improved DFU outcomes as our long-term objectives are to 1) develop novel microbiota-based interventions to improve healing that exploit microbial interactions with each other and the host; and 2) identify microbial biomarkers to classify patients at risk of complication. Chronic non-healing foot wounds develop in as many as 25% of persons with diabetes, and are often colonized or infected with microbes, though the role of microbes in healing and complications is unclear. The objective of this project is to establish the microbial basis of impaired healing and poor outcomes in diabetic foot ulcers by coupling cutting-edge microbial genomic and bioinformatic techniques with clinically relevant models. This knowledge will enable the development of novel microbiota-based therapeutic approaches and identification of patients at risk for complication.",Decoding the microbial burden in diabetic foot ulcers,9989920,R01NR015639,"['Adhesions', 'Alcaligenes', 'Amputation', 'Attenuated', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Markers', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Complication', 'Complications of Diabetes Mellitus', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Corynebacterium', 'Coupling', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diabetic Foot Ulcer', 'Enterococcus faecalis', 'Environmental Pollution', 'Family suidae', 'Fractionation', 'Gene Expression', 'Genetic', 'Genomic approach', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Grant', 'Growth', 'Immune response', 'Impaired healing', 'Impaired wound healing', 'In Vitro', 'Infection', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Length of Stay', 'Lower Extremity', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Mediating', 'Metadata', 'Microbe', 'Microbial Biofilms', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Neuropathy', 'Osteomyelitis', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Phenotype', 'Production', 'Prospective cohort study', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Series', 'Shotguns', 'Skin', 'Staphylococcus aureus', 'Staphylococcus aureus infection', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Toxic effect', 'United States', 'Variant', 'Virulence', 'Wound Infection', 'Wound models', 'antimicrobial', 'base', 'chronic wound', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'comparative', 'cost', 'cytokine', 'diabetic ulcer', 'diabetic wound healing', 'foot', 'genome analysis', 'genome sequencing', 'genome wide association study', 'healing', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'in vivo', 'keratinocyte', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'metagenomic sequencing', 'microbial', 'microbial colonization', 'microbial genomics', 'microbiota', 'microorganism interaction', 'migration', 'mortality', 'mouse model', 'non-healing wounds', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'phenotypic data', 'predict clinical outcome', 'predictive marker', 'response', 'tissue repair', 'tissue-repair responses', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'whole genome', 'wound', 'wound closure', 'wound healing']",NINR,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2020,511458,-0.009205630080063624
