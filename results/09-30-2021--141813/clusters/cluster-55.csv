"Statistical methods for healthcare in complex patients with diabetes ï»¿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Diabetes affects 8.3% of the US population, and lead to costly adverse healthcare outcomes. Unfortunately, there may be a quality gap in the care of complex diabetes patients, that is, older patients (age>65 years) and those with comorbid conditions. Current practices, relying primarily on the presence of several factors, are not effective in capturing the risk of poor prognosis, i.e., multiple hospitalization and/or emergency department visits, and death. Hence, little evidence exists so far to help prioritize care for thes patients. The diabetes guidelines recognize that tight control of glycosylated hemoglobin (A1c) may not be appropriate for complex patients, and recommend individualizations in tight A1c control. However, neither the outcomes of tight A1c control, nor the effects of the typical treatment regimens used to achieve tight A1c control can be evaluated in clinical trials, with minimal, if any, enrollment of complex diabetes patients due to either their restrictive inclusion criteria or lack of encouragement of the patient and/or clinical investigator to consider the RCT. In order to deliver more effective, efficient and accountable health cares, it is important to help clinicians to examine the relationship between patient complexity and patients' A1c control level, and to modify guideline appropriately with an evidence base. The proposed research will analyze a cohort of 8,304 Medicare beneficiaries with diabetes who were cared for by one of the country's 10 largest physician group practices, the University of Wisconsin Medical Foundation during 2003-2011 to address the following aims: (1) to conduct risk prediction incorporating longitudinal outcomes, (2) to inform guidelines for complex diabetes patients, and (3) to create a patient-centered surveillance tool for detecting short-term negative outcomes. Our analytic approach involves the use of state- of-the-art statistics and machine learning methods to take advantage of the large electronic health records data. The proposed methods and results will help clinicians to identify and quantify risks of tight A1c control in complex diabetes patients an potentially lead to improved patient experiences, and reduce medical expenditures from excess adverse events. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Sub-optimal glycosylated hemoglobin (A1c) control recommendations and treatment recommendations for diabetes patients can result in adverse events, and increased health care utilization. Unfortunately, current guidelines on the care for complex and/or older patients with diabetes are inadequate. We propose to develop an effective and patient-centered health care delivery system for complex diabetes patients, focusing on accurate prediction of adverse events, development of potential guidelines on targeting tight control of A1c and treatment regimens, and real-time monitoring of health conditions.",Statistical methods for healthcare in complex patients with diabetes,9749124,R01DK108073,"['Address', 'Adverse event', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Biometry', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Comorbidity', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emergency department visit', 'Enrollment', 'Exclusion Criteria', 'Expenditure', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Glean', 'Glycosylated Hemoglobin', 'Glycosylated hemoglobin A', 'Goals', 'Group Practice', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hospitalization', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Long-Term Care', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medical History', 'Medicare', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patient observation', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Privatization', 'Protocols documentation', 'Recommendation', 'Regimen', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Sampling', 'Statistical Methods', 'System', 'Time', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Trees', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Update', 'Wisconsin', 'Work', 'adverse event risk', 'base', 'beneficiary', 'care outcomes', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'cost', 'data resource', 'design', 'diabetes management', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'health care delivery', 'health care quality', 'health care service utilization', 'high risk', 'improved', 'inclusion criteria', 'learning algorithm', 'learning strategy', 'longitudinal dataset', 'mortality', 'older patient', 'optimal treatments', 'outcome forecast', 'patient oriented', 'patient population', 'population health', 'public health relevance', 'real time monitoring', 'statistics', 'tool', 'treatment guidelines', 'treatment planning', 'user friendly software']",NIDDK,FRED HUTCHINSON CANCER RESEARCH CENTER,R01,2019,283296,0.16066855366545255
"A Framework to Enhance Decision Support by Invoking NLP: Methods and Applications DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Electronic Health Records (EHRs) can improve the quality of healthcare delivery in the United States, by providing automated best-practice reminders to clinicians and patients. However such functionality is currently limited to narrow areas of clinical practice, as existing decision support systems can process only structured data, due to lack of a suitable framework and concerns about accuracy and portability. Preliminary work by the PI has shown that rule-based approach can be used to develop broad-domain reminder systems that can utilize free-text in addition to the structured data. The PI has developed prototype systems for cervical and colorectal cancer prevention. These systems consist of rule-based composite models of national guidelines, and rule-based Natural Language Processing (NLP) parsers. The NLP parsers extract the patient variables required for applying the guidelines. However further research is needed to extend the systems and to ensure their accuracy for clinical deployment. In the mentored phase, the PI will collaborate with clinicians to extend and iteratively optimize and validate the systems, and will make them available in open-source so that they can be adapted for deployment at other institutions (aim 1 - K99). In the independent phase, the PI will research methods to facilitate rapid development, deployment and cross- institutional portability of similar systems. Specifically, the PI will develp a hybrid design for the parsers and investigate domain adaptation and active learning methods, for reducing the manual effort for development and adaptation of the NLP parsers (aim 2 - R00). To enable other researchers to reuse the developed methodologies and software resources, a toolkit will be developed that will support the construction and deployment of similar systems (aim 3 - R00). The toolkit will consist of user-friendly tools and templates to replicate the processes engineered in the case studies, and will build on the SHARPn data normalization tooling and other open-source tools. The independent phase will be in collaboration with Intermountain Healthcare. The PI's career goal is to become a scientific leader in clinical informatics with a focus on optimizing clinical decision making. The PI has strong background in clinical medicine and medical informatics, and will receive mentoring from Drs. Hongfang Liu, Christopher Chute, Robert Greenes and Rajeev Chaudhry, who have complimentary areas of expertise. The mentored (K99) phase will be for 2 years at Mayo Clinic Rochester, wherein the PI will undertake courses on decision support and will get mentored training in NLP and health information standards. This will prepare the PI for independent research in R00 phase on portability and tooling. Completion of the proposed work will enable the PI to seek further funding for piloting clinical deployment of the developed systems, measuring their clinical impact, and for scaling the approach to other clinical domains and institutions.

"Automatic Generation of Computer Interpretable Guidelines PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Compliance with clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) has been demonstrated to markedly improve patient care, but the tools and processes available for physicians to rapidly and meaningfully leverage these guidelines are currently sub-optimal. Compliance improves greatly with the introduction of clinical decision support systems (CDSS), which implement guideline recommendations and are integrated into electronic health record (EHR) systems. Unfortunately, CPGs, as commonly distributed, contain recommendations for care of only a single disorder (or class of disorders) and are not easily consumable by computers for integration with CDSS. Recent work has focused on methods to resolve conflicts between guidelines, but only once they are in a computer interpretable form - a Computer Interpretable Guideline (CIG). We aim: to (1) develop a system for computational understanding of CPGs from the unstructured text; (2) to ground the clinical terms in each guideline in its definition so that the produced CIG can better integrate with electronic health record systems; (3) to generate CIGs in a format already developed which allows guidelines to be mediated with each other and allows the creation of CDSS. The project will focus on four clinical guidelines, relating to diabetes, heart disease, non-small cell lung and prostate cancers. Samples of each of the guidelines will be annotated by clinicians with the appropriate output of systems accomplishing each of the three aims. These samples will be split into datasets for testing and for evaluation, with the overall goal to achieve human levels of competence for each aim. PROJECT NARRATIVE Clinical practice guidelines are paramount to the goals of evidence-based medicine but, being unstructured free text, they are not well integrated with clinician workflows and are not consistently adhered to. We aim to automatically generate computer interpretable versions of textual guidelines in a format which allows for automatic mediation between guidelines for patients with multiple morbidities. Mediated computer interpretable guidelines could then be integrated with electronic medical record systems, providing immediate impact on population health.",Automatic Generation of Computer Interpretable Guidelines,9654971,R15LM013030,"['Belief', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Clinical Practice Guideline', 'Competence', 'Complex', 'Computational Linguistics', 'Computational Technique', 'Computer software', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Computers', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Drug Prescriptions', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Evaluation', 'Evidence Based Medicine', 'Frequencies', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Guidelines', 'Heart Diseases', 'Human', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Level of Evidence', 'Link', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Non-Small-Cell Lung Carcinoma', 'Ontology', 'Output', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Semantics', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Students', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Terminology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Work', 'clinical care', 'clinical practice', 'computer generated', 'design', 'electronic structure', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'improved', 'novel', 'phrases', 'population health', 'prescription procedure', 'syntax', 'tool', 'undergraduate student']",NLM,COLLEGE AT OSWEGO,R15,2018,325760,0.15546669948267378

"Optimal Methods for Notifying Clinicians about Epilepsy Surgery Patients Project Summary Epilepsy is one of the leading neurological disorders in the United States, affecting more than 479,000 children and over 2 million adults. Approximately 30% of epileptic patients have poor seizure control despite antiepileptic medications and are potential candidates for neurosurgical intervention. Early identification and referral of children who are potential surgical candidates is complex and while relevant guidelines exist, there is no standard process to efficiently identify those patients meeting criteria for neurosurgical intervention. Given the large corpus of note-based data available in the electronic health record (EHR), it is challenging for providers to efficiently retain and process all the pertinent patient information. Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques have been successfully used to evaluate clinical notes and make recommendations in the research setting. However, NLP techniques are rarely integrated into practice to provide real-time clinical decision support. We developed and retrospectively evaluated a NLP system to help identify those patients who meet neurosurgical criteria and therefore enable surgical consults and evaluations to occur sooner. Knowing clinical decision support can improve outcomes of care, our proposed research will implement NLP into clinical practice and develop a decision support mechanism to improve the time to surgery for eligible patients. The objective of this project is to implement NLP directly into clinical care and determine the most effective decision support mechanism for provider adherence to epilepsy surgical consult recommendations. The long- term goal of this project is to reduce the time to initial surgery evaluation for patients with intractable epilepsy by integrating NLP-classification criteria into clinical practice. This project is one of the first in the field to study the integration of NLP recommendations into clinical care. We will use a human factors engineering framework to design and to analyze two different alerting methodologies for the best-fit for clinical workflow to produce the optimum provider adherence while reducing alert fatigue. Epilepsy progress notes can be classified across hospitals, and if successful, the system will be implemented in additional pediatric institutions around the United States. Project Narrative Epilepsy affects more than 479,000 children; 30% of those are not controlled with medication and may require surgery. We developed a novel Natural Language Processing (NLP) algorithm that can be integrated into neurology practice to detect patients who may be eligible for epilepsy surgical consults. Once implemented, this research can help to drive successful implementations of NLP and identify and use ideal alerting mechanisms in neurological care.",Optimal Methods for Notifying Clinicians about Epilepsy Surgery Patients,9355161,R21HS024977,[' '],AHRQ,CINCINNATI CHILDRENS HOSP MED CTR,R21,2017,159334,0.0896139338508209

"Statistical methods for healthcare in complex patients with diabetes ï»¿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Diabetes affects 8.3% of the US population, and lead to costly adverse healthcare outcomes. Unfortunately, there may be a quality gap in the care of complex diabetes patients, that is, older patients (age>65 years) and those with comorbid conditions. Current practices, relying primarily on the presence of several factors, are not effective in capturing the risk of poor prognosis, i.e., multiple hospitalization and/or emergency department visits, and death. Hence, little evidence exists so far to help prioritize care for thes patients. The diabetes guidelines recognize that tight control of glycosylated hemoglobin (A1c) may not be appropriate for complex patients, and recommend individualizations in tight A1c control. However, neither the outcomes of tight A1c control, nor the effects of the typical treatment regimens used to achieve tight A1c control can be evaluated in clinical trials, with minimal, if any, enrollment of complex diabetes patients due to either their restrictive inclusion criteria or lack of encouragement of the patient and/or clinical investigator to consider the RCT. In order to deliver more effective, efficient and accountable health cares, it is important to help clinicians to examine the relationship between patient complexity and patients' A1c control level, and to modify guideline appropriately with an evidence base. The proposed research will analyze a cohort of 8,304 Medicare beneficiaries with diabetes who were cared for by one of the country's 10 largest physician group practices, the University of Wisconsin Medical Foundation during 2003-2011 to address the following aims: (1) to conduct risk prediction incorporating longitudinal outcomes, (2) to inform guidelines for complex diabetes patients, and (3) to create a patient-centered surveillance tool for detecting short-term negative outcomes. Our analytic approach involves the use of state- of-the-art statistics and machine learning methods to take advantage of the large electronic health records data. The proposed methods and results will help clinicians to identify and quantify risks of tight A1c control in complex diabetes patients an potentially lead to improved patient experiences, and reduce medical expenditures from excess adverse events.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Sub-optimal glycosylated hemoglobin (A1c) control recommendations and treatment recommendations for diabetes patients can result in adverse events, and increased health care utilization. Unfortunately, current guidelines on the care for complex and/or older patients with diabetes are inadequate. We propose to develop an effective and patient-centered health care delivery system for complex diabetes patients, focusing on accurate prediction of adverse events, development of potential guidelines on targeting tight control of A1c and treatment regimens, and real-time monitoring of health conditions.            ",Statistical methods for healthcare in complex patients with diabetes,9145732,R01DK108073,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adverse event', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Biometry', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emergency department visit', 'Enrollment', 'Exclusion Criteria', 'Expenditure', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Glean', 'Glycosylated Hemoglobin', 'Glycosylated hemoglobin A', 'Goals', 'Group Practice', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hospitalization', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Long-Term Care', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medical History', 'Medicare', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Protocols documentation', 'Recommendation', 'Regimen', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Sampling', 'Staging', 'Statistical Methods', 'System', 'Time', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Trees', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Update', 'Wisconsin', 'Work', 'base', 'beneficiary', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'cost', 'design', 'diabetes management', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'health care delivery', 'health care quality', 'health care service utilization', 'high risk', 'improved', 'inclusion criteria', 'learning strategy', 'meetings', 'mortality', 'older patient', 'outcome forecast', 'patient oriented', 'patient population', 'public health relevance', 'statistics', 'tool', 'treatment planning', 'user friendly software']",NIDDK,FRED HUTCHINSON CANCER RESEARCH CENTER,R01,2016,292485,0.16066855366545255
"Optimal Methods for Notifying Clinicians about Epilepsy Surgery Patients Project Summary Epilepsy is one of the leading neurological disorders in the United States, affecting more than 479,000 children and over 2 million adults. Approximately 30% of epileptic patients have poor seizure control despite antiepileptic medications and are potential candidates for neurosurgical intervention. Early identification and referral of children who are potential surgical candidates is complex and while relevant guidelines exist, there is no standard process to efficiently identify those patients meeting criteria for neurosurgical intervention. Given the large corpus of note-based data available in the electronic health record (EHR), it is challenging for providers to efficiently retain and process all the pertinent patient information. Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques have been successfully used to evaluate clinical notes and make recommendations in the research setting. However, NLP techniques are rarely integrated into practice to provide real-time clinical decision support. We developed and retrospectively evaluated a NLP system to help identify those patients who meet neurosurgical criteria and therefore enable surgical consults and evaluations to occur sooner. Knowing clinical decision support can improve outcomes of care, our proposed research will implement NLP into clinical practice and develop a decision support mechanism to improve the time to surgery for eligible patients. The objective of this project is to implement NLP directly into clinical care and determine the most effective decision support mechanism for provider adherence to epilepsy surgical consult recommendations. The long- term goal of this project is to reduce the time to initial surgery evaluation for patients with intractable epilepsy by integrating NLP-classification criteria into clinical practice. This project is one of the first in the field to study the integration of NLP recommendations into clinical care. We will use a human factors engineering framework to design and to analyze two different alerting methodologies for the best-fit for clinical workflow to produce the optimum provider adherence while reducing alert fatigue. Epilepsy progress notes can be classified across hospitals, and if successful, the system will be implemented in additional pediatric institutions around the United States. Project Narrative Epilepsy affects more than 479,000 children; 30% of those are not controlled with medication and may require surgery. We developed a novel Natural Language Processing (NLP) algorithm that can be integrated into neurology practice to detect patients who may be eligible for epilepsy surgical consults. Once implemented, this research can help to drive successful implementations of NLP and identify and use ideal alerting mechanisms in neurological care.",Optimal Methods for Notifying Clinicians about Epilepsy Surgery Patients,9222109,R21HS024977,[' '],AHRQ,CINCINNATI CHILDRENS HOSP MED CTR,R21,2016,137233,0.0896139338508209
"A Framework to Enhance Decision Support by Invoking NLP: Methods and Applications DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Electronic Health Records (EHRs) can improve the quality of healthcare delivery in the United States, by providing automated best-practice reminders to clinicians and patients. However such functionality is currently limited to narrow areas of clinical practice, as existing decision support systems can process only structured data, due to lack of a suitable framework and concerns about accuracy and portability. Preliminary work by the PI has shown that rule-based approach can be used to develop broad-domain reminder systems that can utilize free-text in addition to the structured data. The PI has developed prototype systems for cervical and colorectal cancer prevention. These systems consist of rule-based composite models of national guidelines, and rule-based Natural Language Processing (NLP) parsers. The NLP parsers extract the patient variables required for applying the guidelines. However further research is needed to extend the systems and to ensure their accuracy for clinical deployment. In the mentored phase, the PI will collaborate with clinicians to extend and iteratively optimize and validate the systems, and will make them available in open-source so that they can be adapted for deployment at other institutions (aim 1 - K99). In the independent phase, the PI will research methods to facilitate rapid development, deployment and cross- institutional portability of similar systems. Specifically, the PI will develp a hybrid design for the parsers and investigate domain adaptation and active learning methods, for reducing the manual effort for development and adaptation of the NLP parsers (aim 2 - R00). To enable other researchers to reuse the developed methodologies and software resources, a toolkit will be developed that will support the construction and deployment of similar systems (aim 3 - R00). The toolkit will consist of user-friendly tools and templates to replicate the processes engineered in the case studies, and will build on the SHARPn data normalization tooling and other open-source tools. The independent phase will be in collaboration with Intermountain Healthcare. The PI's career goal is to become a scientific leader in clinical informatics with a focus on optimizing clinical decision making. The PI has strong background in clinical medicine and medical informatics, and will receive mentoring from Drs.

The mentored (K99) phase will be for 2 years at Mayo Clinic Rochester, wherein the PI will undertake courses on decision support and will get mentored training in NLP and health information standards. This will prepare the PI for independent research in R00 phase on portability and tooling.

"NLP-enabled decision support for cervical cancer screening and surveillance DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Although cervical cancer is preventable, it still continues to be a leading cause of death. Following the evidence- based guidelines for cervical cancer prevention is challenging for healthcare providers, due to which many patients do not receive the optimal preventive care. Clinical decision support (CDS) systems can potentially improve the care delivery. However, the current CDS systems only identify patients overdue for screening, and do not suggest the optimal screening interval. Moreover they do not help with surveillance of patients with abnormal screening results. This is because the existing systems lack the capability to process free- text clinical reports that contain information needed for applying the guidelines. Hence there is a critical need for natural language processing (NLP)-enabled CDS systems that can utilize discrete as well as free-text patient information for enhancing the decision support. Our long-term goal is to improve healthcare delivery of cervical cancer prevention with guideline based reminders. The central hypothesis is that NLP- enabled CDS system will significantly improve the quality of care delivery for cervical cancer prevention. The rationale is that use of NLP will improve granularity of the guideline implementation, which will in-turn enhance care delivery. As preliminary work we have developed an NLP-enabled CDS system that automatically interprets the patient information from the electronic health record and applies the national guidelines to compute the optimal recommendation for screening and surveillance. We have performed validation of the system in a non-clinical setting.1 In this application we will proceed towards deployment of the system in the clinical setting, and will carry out studies for measuring the impact on the quality of care delivery. In ai one, we will validate the system in the clinical setting and will optimize its usability and workflw integration. In aim two, we will test the hypothesis that reminders from the NLP-enabled CDS system to primary care providers will improve the quality of care delivery, by performing a one year intervention control study across four sites of a primary care practice. In aim three, we will test the hypothesis that reminders to non-adherent high-risk patients will improve their surveillance rates, by performing a randomized intervention study for three months. In this study, care coordinators will utilize the CDS system for sending reminders to patients that are non-adherent and at high risk due to abnormal screenings. The main contribution of this project will be knowledge about the effectiveness of NLP in enhancing the impact of CDS systems for cervical cancer prevention, and for clinical practice in general. This project is innovative because the CDS system will utilize NLP to generate screening reminders for normal patients and surveillance reminders for patients with abnormal findings. This is a major advancement over existing systems that can only identify patients for screening. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research is relevant to public health because it will yield knowledge about the effectiveness of natural language processing (NLP) to enhance impact of CDS systems for cervical cancer prevention, and for clinical practice in general. This research will foster implementation of similar CDS systems across the nation for cervical cancer prevention and for other decision problems, which will improve the quality of healthcare delivery. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to AHRQ's mission to improve the quality, safety, efficiency, and effectiveness of health care for all Americans.",NLP-enabled decision support for cervical cancer screening and surveillance,8934087,R21HS022911,[' '],AHRQ,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,R21,2015,145229,0.11173009684870315
"Construction of Relation Detection Framework Empowered by Topic Modeling     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The availability of large volume of EHRs enhances the possibility for using them for health services, EBM and clinical research. However such functionality is currently limited to narrow areas of clinical practice, as relation detections between medical events among unstructured EHRs still pose a big challenge, consequently leading to the inaccuracy of patient cohort identification, especially for cross-institutional environment. Preliminary work by the PI has shown that topic modeling can discover data semantics, which can then be employed as significant cues for diverse relation detections among EHRs. Among them, co-referring, temporal relations and domain semantics are intertwined and positively correlated. Up to now, not much research is done to combine the three relations to build a better patient cohort identification system. Therefore, the PI proposes to develop a relation detection framework for EHRs empowered with topic modeling for more accurate patient cohort identification. In the mentored phase, the PI will implement the relation detection framework under the guidance of my mentor team and will make them available in open-source so that they can be adapted for deployment at other institutions (aim 1 - K99). In the independent phase, the PI will research methods to facilitate rapid development, deployment and cross-institutional portability of similar systems. Specifically, the PI will develo a hybrid design with ICD-9, RxNorm and MeSH ontologies for the data semantics discoveries from EHRs and MedLINE respectively and investigate categorization of data semantics aligning with medical ontologies (aim 2 - R00). To enable other researchers to reuse the developed methodologies and software resources and more importantly to make corrections or adjustments on data semantics, a toolkit will be developed that will support the construction and deployment of similar systems (aim 3 - R00). The independent phase will be in collaboration with both UTHealth and University of Maryland. The PI's career goal is to become a scientific leader in clinical informatics with a focus on relation detections among EHRs for efficient patient cohort identification. The PI has strong background in computational linguistics and rich experiences in medical clinical records processing and analyses, and will receive mentoring from Drs. Hongfang Liu, Christopher Chute, and Terry Therneau, who have complimentary areas of expertise. The mentored phase will be in Mayo Clinic Rochester where the PI will undertake courses in US healthcare system, health system engineering, clinical statistics and clinical epidemiology and will get mentored training in health informatics which is what he needs to continue to strengthen since he didn't get regular training in his PhD education. In the independent R00 phase, the PI will strive for making independent scientific contributions to the use of informatics for healthcare via the implementation of Aims 2 and 3 and via the independent collaborations internal and externally.

"INTELLIGENT CRITIQUING OF CLINICAL-GUIDELINE APPLICATION Clinical guidelines are a powerful method for standardization and uniform improvement of the quality of medical care.  In the proposed research project, which we call Asgaard/DeGel, we will design and implement software solutions that support the design, application, and, in particular, quality assessment of the application of clinical guidelines by care providers.  Our long-term objectives include provision of a standardized computational framework for specification, application, and runtime as well as retrospective quality assessment of clinical-guidelines. We will provide these solutions by using a novel framework for specification and interpretation of clinical guidelines.  The new framework encodes explicitly both the therapeutic actions indicated by the guideline and the intermediate clinical process and outcome goals of the guideline designers, which we refer to as intentions.  Intentions are represented as temporal patterns of care-provider actions or patient states to be maintained, achieved or avoided, using results from our previous work on interpretation and summarization of time-oriented clinical data.  Intentions include both the intermediate and overall process pattern (care provider actions) to follow and the expected intermediate and final outcome pattern (patient states). The tasks that we are focusing on include (1) design-time tasks, such as specification, validation, and verification of the guideline, and (2) runtime tasks such as automated support to application of the guideline, recognition of care providers' intentions from their actions, and real-time as well as retrospective critiquing and quality assessment of care providers' application of he guideline, given the guideline and its intentions, the patient's medical record, and the analysis of the care provider's perceived intentions.

Intentions include both the intermediate and overall process pattern (care provider actions) to follow and the expected intermediate and final outcome pattern (patient states). The tasks that we are focusing on include (1) design-time tasks, such as specification, validation, and verification of the guideline, and (2) runtime tasks such as automated support to application of the guideline, recognition of care providers' intentions from their actions, and real-time as well as retrospective critiquing and quality assessment of care providers' application of he guideline, given the guideline and its intentions, the patient's medical record, and the analysis of the care provider's perceived intentions. In our previous work, we have designed a formal, machine-interpretable language, called Asbru, to represent and to annotate guidelines based on our framework, and implemented a small prototype interpreter for it.  We will implement a full interpreter for the Asbru language and a set of software tools for specification, validation, and verification of Asbru guidelines.  We will also design and implement a set of computational methods for runtime (during application) and retrospective quality assessment of clinical guideline application, both for individual patients and for populations of patients, using our intention-based model. We will rigorously test, validate, and evaluate our methodologies using collaborators in clinical areas such as oncology, hypertension, and endocrinology.    n/a",INTELLIGENT CRITIQUING OF CLINICAL-GUIDELINE APPLICATION,6530776,R01LM006806,"['artificial intelligence', ' behavioral /social science research tag', ' clinical research', ' computer assisted medical decision making', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' experimental designs', ' health care quality', ' health services research tag', ' human data', ' medical records', ' vocabulary development for information system']",NLM,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2002,322761,0.15615217301181553

"TOOLS TO SUPPORT COMPUTER BASED CLINICAL GUIDELINES DESCRIPTION (Adapted from the applicant's abstract):                                                                                                              The proposed research will build, refine, and test in operational use, a set     of software tools designed to help support, maintain, and iteratively            revalidate computer-based clinical guidelines as they evolve over time.  The     project will focus on the domain of childhood immunization, and will build       upon IMM/Serve, a childhood immunization forecasting program that takes as       input a child's immunization history, and produces recommendations as to         which vaccinations are due and which vaccinations should be scheduled next.      The effort required to modify and validate such a program as the clinical        field evolves over time is a challenging task.  It will be extremely             important to have a robust set of tools to assist in this process.  Partial      prototype versions of certain of these tools already exist.                                                                                                       1.  The project will refine and extend computer-based tools for immunization     knowledge maintenance.  These tools will include:  a) IMM/Def, a program         which automatically generates the rule-based logic for the most complex          portion (""kernel"") of IMM/Serve's knowledge, and b) IMM/Test, a program          which automatically generates a set of test cases to help test the kernel        logic.  The project will also develop an organized set of strategies for         immunization test case generation, and implement those strategies in the         refined version of IMM/Test.                                                                                                                                      2.  The project will build a Web site to support immunization knowledge          maintenance.                                                                                                                                                      3.  The project will keep a detailed record of all modifications and             customization of the knowledge, and will represent all the variations of the     knowledge using a standardized format such as GLIF, the Guideline                Interchange Format being developed as a standard for exchanging guidelines       between sites.                                                                                                                                                    4.  The project will link IMM/Serve to a database designed to hold               IMM/Serve's analysis of a set of cases, so that the resulting package can be     used as a tool to perform compliance assessment.                                                                                                                  5.

"DECISION ANALYTIC SUPPORT FOR CLINICAL GUIDELINES DESCRIPTION (Taken from application abstract):  In the rapidly changing          health care environment the increasing prominence of managed care has            prompted a greater reliance on formal clinical guidelines to suppose             clinical decisions.  Guidelines have been advocated with increasing              frequency to reduce inappropriate care, control geographic variations in         practice patterns and make more effective use of health care resources.          However, guidelines often have little impact on clinical practice because        physicians are unaware of them, lack confidence in them because the              justification for their recommendations is not clear or because they are         inaccessible at the time of patient care or difficult to apply.  Guidelines      also quickly become out of date as new research data becomes available.                                                                                           In order to enhance the quality and usefulness of clinical guidelines, the       general goal of this project is to develop, deploy and evaluate interactive      computer based guidelines, supported by an integrated decision theoretic         model and a linked knowledge base.  This arrangement will use patient            characteristics to tailor guideline advice to the individual patient.  The       integrated decision model will provide recommendations for situations not        addressed by the guideline and also will help to justify guideline               recommendations by calculating the effectiveness and costs of various            strategies.  The proposed system also contains links to a knowledge base         containing the sources of data used in the guideline and the model, so that      physicians using the system can examine the studies supporting the guideline     recommendations.  Natural language explanations, generated automatically         based on the structure of the decision model and the guideline will justify      the recommendations.  A query capability will enable physicians to look up       specific data from the knowledge base.  The linked knowledge based also          ensures that the supported decision model and guideline will be updated          automatically as new research data is published.                                                                                                                  The computer system will be used to implement an interactive version of the      Guidelines for Medical Treatment for Stroke Prevention, developed by the         American College of Physicians.  The system will be bench tested using a         series of cases abstracted from the General Medicine practice at the Robert      Wood Johnson Medical School.  Faculty and house staff internists will serve      as research subjects to perform a field trial of the system.  This will          include the extent of previous compliance with the guideline, pre and            post-testing of medical knowledge pertinent to the guideline, and the degree     to which the computer-based guideline changes behavior compared to the           traditional guideline format.  A decision theoretic measure of potential         benefit will be calculated by comparing decision model evaluations of            physicians' unaided choices with those recommended by the guideline system.       n/a",DECISION ANALYTIC SUPPORT FOR CLINICAL GUIDELINES,6185218,R01LM006321,"['Internet', ' artificial intelligence', ' cardiovascular disorder prevention', ' clinical research', ' computer assisted medical decision making', ' computer assisted patient care', ' computer human interaction', ' computer program /software', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' human data', ' human subject', ' information systems', ' medical records', ' physicians', ' questionnaires', ' stroke']",NLM,UNIV OF MED/DENT NJ-R W JOHNSON MED SCH,R01,2000,248558,0.17567974441823367

"Quantifying Compliance to the New 2017 Hypertension Treatment Guidelines and Investigating the Association Between Guideline Compliance and Patients' Trajectory of Blood Pressure Project Summary/Abstract Blood pressure (BP) of Â³140/90 mm Hg doubles the risk of cardiovascular diseases (CVD) and the total cost of hypertension reaches as high as $51 billion per year. Despite the enormous risk and cost associated with hypertension, less than half (48.3%) of hypertensive patients have a controlled blood pressure (BP) in the United States. Clinical trials demonstrated that a high rate of BP control (up to 85%) can be achieved with currently available therapies and strictly following recommended treatment protocols. This suggests that a higher proportion of uncontrolled BP could be explained by less aggressive treatment, poorer follow-up, and use of fewer or less effective drugs. The 2017 guideline for high BP management was recently published and lowered the threshold for the initiation of medication and definition of uncontrolled BP to BP â¥130/80 mm Hg (from 140/90) for patients with CVD or higher risk of CVD. This challenges physicians to change their traditional hypertension management and could worsen the already low rate of compliance (range 25-65%) to hypertension treatment guidelines. Furthermore, conclusions from previous studies regarding compliance to older hypertension treatment guidelines were compromised due to failure to evaluate multiple aspects of hypertension care, such as comorbidities, follow-up and laboratory assessments; and use of subjective assessment such as physician self-report. The wide-spread adoption of electronic health record (EHR) technology and the vital patient information present in EHR data provide an exceptional opportunity to objectively evaluate several aspects of hypertension care, such as medications prescribed, laboratory procedures ordered, BP level achieved, follow-up monitoring examinations, demographic and comorbid information. We, therefore, propose to use the Northwestern Medicine Enterprise Data Warehouse (NMEDW) â an integrated EHR database of health information from 2.9 million patients to 1) assess compliance to the 2017 hypertension management guidelines for 5 years since its release (2018-2022); 2) investigate whether patientâs age, race, body mass index, history of diabetes, CVD, chronic kidney disease, medication adherence, presence of health insurance and regular physician, and physican speciality predict level of compliance to the new treatment guideline; and 3) examine the association between level of compliance to the 2017 hypertension treatment guidelines and prospective patient BP trajectory over 5 years (2019-2023). Newly diagnosed hypertensive patientsâ demographics, BP, medications, lab results, follow-up visit, and comorbid conditions will be assessed from the NMEDW and will be compared to criteria developed based on the 2017 hypertension treatment guidelines to quantify compliance to the guideline. The proposed study provides the candidate an opportunity to learn EHR data-mining skills to assess association between compliance to the new hypertension treatment guideline and patient BP trajectory and to identify predictors of this compliance, as a first step, in designing future targeted interventions to enhance guideline compliance and BP control. Project Narrative The 2017 hypertension treatment guideline lowered the threshold for the initiation of hypertensive medication and definition of uncontrolled blood pressure (BP) to BP â¥130/80 mm Hg (from â¥140/90). This could worsen the already low rate of compliance (25-65%) to treatment guidelines. In this study, we will evaluate physician compliance to the 2017 hypertension treatment guideline and its association with patient BP using electronic health record data that comprises information on several aspects of hypertension care. Findings of this study will help in designing future targeted interventions to enhance compliance to treatment guideline and BP control.",Quantifying Compliance to the New 2017 Hypertension Treatment Guidelines and Investigating the Association Between Guideline Compliance and Patients' Trajectory of Blood Pressure,9870519,K01HL145345,"['Address', 'Adherence', 'Adoption', 'Adult', 'Adverse drug effect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Blood Pressure', 'Body mass index', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Caring', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diastolic blood pressure', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'E-learning', 'Elderly', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Epidemiology', 'Failure', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Insurance', 'Hypertension', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Laboratory Procedures', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Minority', 'Monitor', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Obesity', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Predisposition', 'Prevalence', 'Procedures', 'Provider', 'Publishing', 'Race', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Titrations', 'Treatment Protocols', 'United States', 'Visit', 'aggressive therapy', 'base', 'blood pressure medication', 'blood pressure regulation', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'comorbidity', 'computerized', 'cost', 'data mining', 'data warehouse', 'demographics', 'design', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'hypertension control', 'hypertension treatment', 'improved', 'medication compliance', 'phenotyping algorithm', 'prospective', 'skills', 'treatment guidelines']",NHLBI,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,K01,2020,120966,0.1019225263178723
