"Learning Regulatory Drivers of Chromatin and Expression Dynamics during Nuclear Reprogramming PROJECT SUMMARY The deluge of sequencing-based functional genomic data profiling the transcriptome, regulome and epigenome in hundreds of diverse cellular contexts has spurred the development of powerful computational methods to learn integrative models of gene regulation. However, models learned on data from static cellular contexts only reveal correlative regulatory relationships. There is a paucity of tractable model systems and experiments profiling dynamic cellular processes and a corresponding lack of computational methods that can learn putative causal mechanisms controlling the precise timing and temporal order of changes in genomic chromatin state and gene expression. Here, we propose novel machine learning methods to learn dynamic models of transcription regulation in the context of cellular reprogramming. In Aim 1, we propose deep learning frameworks with new interpretation engines that can integrate dynamic chromatin accessibility and gene expression data to reveal networks of cis regulatory elements, transcription factor binding complexes and cascades of trans-acting regulatory factors that control cell fate. In Aim2, we will apply our modeling framework to investigate early dynamics of nuclear reprogramming of human fibroblasts to pluripotency. We will leverage a powerful heterokaryon cell fusion model system to generate global chromatin and gene expression profiles over a two day timecourse. In Aim 3, we perform perturbation experiments using RNAi and CRISPR/Cas9 technologies to validate hypotheses generated by our models and test the effectiveness of predicted pluripotency factors and regulatory elements in inducing reprogramming. The validation experiments will be further used to iteratively refine the computational models. We will integrate the time-course data generated in our model system with data from large reference compendia of functional genomic data such as the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) and The Roadmap Epigenomics Project. Our analyses will reveal molecular mechanisms crucial to early and transient stages of nuclear reprogramming, providing novel contributions to our fundamental knowledge of regenerative medicine. Finally, the proposed end-to-end integrative framework is highly generalizable and will be of broad utility to learn dynamic models of transcriptional regulation from time-course datasets in other model systems. NARRATIVE Understanding how cells precisely control the timing and order of gene expression changes during dynamic cellular processes remains a challenge. Here, we propose the development of novel machine learning methods based on deep neural networks to decipher dynamic regulatory networks controlling cell fate decisions. We will generate genome-wide temporal profiles of chromatin state and gene expression during nuclear reprogramming, learn integrative models of dynamic gene regulation and perform experiments to validate biological hypotheses generated by the model.",Learning Regulatory Drivers of Chromatin and Expression Dynamics during Nuclear Reprogramming,9722284,R01HG009674,"['3-Dimensional', 'ATAC-seq', 'Back', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'Cell Differentiation process', 'Cell Fate Control', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cell fusion', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'ChIP-seq', 'Chromatin', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computing Methodologies', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Effectiveness', 'Encyclopedia of DNA Elements', 'Event', 'Expression Profiling', 'Fibroblasts', 'Frequencies', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Order', 'Gene Silencing', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genomics', 'Human', 'Knock-out', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Pattern', 'Pluripotent Stem Cells', 'RNA Interference', 'Regenerative Medicine', 'Regulatory Element', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Series', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Transcription Factor 3', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Validation', 'base', 'c-myc Genes', 'combinatorial', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'embryonic stem cell', 'epigenome', 'epigenomics', 'experimental study', 'feeding', 'functional genomics', 'genetic regulatory protein', 'genome editing', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'heterokaryon', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'loss of function', 'novel', 'nuclear reprogramming', 'pluripotency', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NHGRI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,703311,0.041524057158647994
"Computational modeling of DNA methylation-mediated gene regulation Abstract Large numbers of complete methylomes are being acquired through clinical sequencing projects, such as through The Cancer Genome Atlas, Blueprint Epigenome Project, and International Cancer Genome Consortium. Furthermore, third-generation nanopore sequencers, which detect DNA methylation and genetic variation in a single experiment, are nearly ready for routine clinical sequencing and will provide complete methylomes for all patients where whole-genome sequencing is indicated. Current analysis tools however only perform preliminary methylome processing and catalogue differentially methylated regions (DMRs). In order to transform methylome analysis into a clinically useful diagnostic/prognostic test, we need to develop predictive tools to interpret the functional and pathological consequences of identified methylation changes. Towards this goal, we have published a series of papers demonstrating that machine-learning based models utilizing high- resolution signatures of all methylation changes around a promoter vastly outperform conventional DMR methods. Our models accurately predict expression states at genes potentially regulated by methylation and reveal predictive methylation signatures that facilitate mechanistic interpretation. Nonetheless, several challenges remain before we can achieve our goals of translating genome-wide methylation data for routine clinical use: (1) To our knowledge, no current models integrate distal enhancers, whose activation is affected by DNA methylation. Such integrative analysis is necessary to understand consequences of methylation changes in cancers, whose genomes frequently undergo wide-spread methylation changes. In addition, such modelling will be essential to understand the role of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC), which may play both repressive and activating roles in neurons depending on whether it is found at promoters or enhancers. (2) Our current models (and conventional approaches) represent methylation data independent of DNA sequence despite mechanistic studies demonstrating that methylation changes can have different functional effects depending on which sequences change and depending on the context of the local regulatory grammar. In this proposal, we will meet these challenges by first developing a predictive model that incorporates 5-methylcytosine and 5hmC at promoters and enhancers to determine how these marks act in concert. In particular, we will examine the hypothesized dual role of 5hmC as a repressor at promoters and as an activator at enhancers in cortical neurons. We will then use new advances in natural language processing to model DNA sequence and methylation to predict expression states. Our results will reveal which regulatory elements and transcription factors binding sites are affected by DNA methylation and how changes at different sites collaborate to affect expression changes. We will experimentally validate our in silico predictions using a combination of reporter assays and CRISPR- based epigenome-editing tools. Thus, the software tools we develop will form an important toolkit for the analysis and mechanistic interpretation of whole-genome methylation studies, both in the laboratory and clinic. Public Narrative DNA normally undergoes a variety of chemical modifications including the addition of methyl- and hydroxymethyl- groups to cytosines (DNA methylation). Though we are unsure how to interpret them, abnormal patterns of DNA methylation are often found in human diseases and will likely soon be routinely measured in the clinic. In this proposal, we will develop advanced computational approaches to predict the functional and pathological consequences of DNA methylation changes in disease. In the future, the approaches we develop will lead to software that suggests individualized therapies for patients based on clinical methylation data.",Computational modeling of DNA methylation-mediated gene regulation,9896942,R01LM013096,"['Affect', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological Assay', 'Brain', 'Cataloging', 'Catalogs', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Chemicals', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Communities', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Cytosine', 'DNA', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA Sequence', 'DNA sequencing', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Distal', 'Elements', 'Enhancers', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Etiology', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Glioma', 'Goals', 'Individual', 'International', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Mus', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neurons', 'Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'Paper', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Play', 'Publishing', 'Recurrence', 'Regulation', 'Regulatory Element', 'Reporter', 'Resolution', 'Retrieval', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Software Tools', 'Testing', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Training', 'Translating', 'base', 'cancer genome', 'cancer type', 'clinical sequencing', 'cofactor', 'demethylation', 'embryonic stem cell', 'epigenetic therapy', 'epigenome', 'epigenome editing', 'epigenomics', 'experimental study', 'genome sequencing', 'genome wide methylation', 'genome-wide', 'histone modification', 'human disease', 'individualized medicine', 'long short term memory network', 'methylation pattern', 'methylome', 'mutant', 'nanopore', 'network architecture', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive tools', 'prognostic', 'prognostic assays', 'promoter', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'success', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'whole genome']",NLM,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,362352,0.10122686594160074
"Computational modeling of spatial genome organization and gene regulation PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The three-dimensional (3D) organization of the genome plays an essential role in genome stability, gene regulation, and many diseases, including cancer. The recent development of high-throughput chromatin conformation capture (Hi-C) and its variants provide an unprecedented opportunity to investigate higher-order chromatin organization. Despite the rapidly accumulating resources for investigating 3D genome organization, our understanding of the regulatory mechanisms and functions of the genome organization remain largely incomplete. Hi-C analyses and 3D genome research are still in their early stage and face several challenges. First, high-resolution chromatin contact maps require extremely deep sequencing and hence have been achieved only for a few cell lines. Second, it is computationally challenging to complement 3D genome structure with one-dimensional (1D) genomic and epigenomic features. Third, recent studies have just begun to infer associations between chromatin interactions and genetic variants and to identify potential target genes of those variants at the genome-wide scale. Given these challenges and my unique multi-disciplinary training, my long-term research goal is to develop innovative computational and statistical methods to uncover the interplay between 3D genome structure and function. Speciﬁcally, in the next ﬁve years, I will i) develop computational approaches to enhance the resolution of existing Hi-C data and investigate ﬁne-scale 3D genome architecture as well as its spatiotemporal dynamics and ii) build scalable and interpretable machine learning models that leverage 1D epigenomic data to predict cell type-speciﬁc 3D chromatin interactions and gene expression and elucidate the function of 3D genome organization in gene regulation and human diseases. The completion of the proposed work will deepen our knowledge of 3D genome architecture as well as its functions in gene regulation and disease. PROJECT NARRATIVE The overarching mission of my research is to understand the interplay between genome architecture and gene regulation. Recent development of high-throughput chromatin conformation capture techniques has allowed us to look beyond the nucleotide sequence of DNA and investigate the principles of higher-order chromatin organization.

"Visualization, modeling and validation of chromatin interaction data The three dimensional (3D) organization of mammalian genomes is tightly linked to gene regulation, as it can reveal the physical interactions between distal regulatory elements and their target genes. Several recent high- throughput technologies based on Chromatin Conformation Capture (3C) have emerged (such as 4C, 5C, Hi-C and ChIA-PET) and given us an unprecedented opportunity to study the higher-order genome organization. Among them, Hi-C technology is of particular interest due to its unbiased genome-wide coverage that can measure chromatin interaction intensities between any two given genomic loci. However, Hi-C data analysis and interpretation are still in the early stages. One of the main challenges is how to efficiently visualize chromatin interaction data, so that the scientific community to visualize and use it for their own research. In addition, due to the complex experimental procedure and high sequencing cost, Hi-C has only been performed in a limited number of cell/tissue types.

We will predict Hi-C interaction frequencies using other available genomic and epigenomic data in the same cell type, such as ChIP-Seq data for histone modifications and transcription factors. We will build our prediction model and then systematically impute Hi-C interaction matrices for all 127 cell types whose epigenomes are available thanks to recent effort by the ENCODE and Roadmap Epigenome projects.

"Modeling stress-induced, de novo epiallele architecture in the model Arabidopsis as a tractable entrypoint PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Epigenetic memory is a phenomenon of trans-generational, altered trait inheritance without changes to DNA sequence. Our present ability to predict or direct epigenomic behavior is extremely limited, even though epigenetic factors participate in nearly all aspects of multicellular development, environmental stress response, and disease development. There are critical gaps in our current knowledge of DNA methylation patterning, stable epiallele formation, and the relationship of genome-wide epigenomic behavior to gene expression and phenotype in both plant and animal systems. We have developed a system that will directly address these questions. Our long-term goals are to decode the heritable epigenome, and its relationship to organismal phenotype, particularly in response to stress. What distinguishes our proposed research is the availability of robust biologicals in the model plant Arabidopsis to impose artificial stress, recurrent heritable epigenetic memory, and methylome repatterning. These resources emanate from discovery of the MSH1 gene, disruption of which leads to epigenomic reprogramming. Recent data from this system lead to the overarching hypothesis that stress-induced gene expression recruits methylation machinery to gene networks in a non-stochastic manner. To address this hypothesis, we have developed novel genome-wide methylome analysis procedures for high-resolution identification of gene-associated methylation repatterning. These analyses reveal gene networks that are strikingly consistent with phenotype changes, and display repatterning that is intragenic and often subtle, yet reproducible. We have also identified epigenetic components of the DNA methylation and RdDM pathways that are essential to reprogramming based on msh1 double mutant analysis. Building upon strong preliminary data, we propose to pursue three specific aims to characterize trans-generational epigenomic behavior: (1) To delineate stable, de novo epialleles in the Arabidopsis msh1 model system, exploiting a five-generation memory lineage, (2) to develop a mechanistic understanding of stable epiallele formation in response to stress, implementing machine learning and mutant screening, and (3) to test locus-specific mechanics of epiallele establishment, capitalizing on gene relocation to delimit germane local chromatin features. The proposed research will broadly impact the field by providing the first example of inducible epigenomic reprogramming in a non-stochastic pattern that permits machine learning-based predictive modeling and identification of cis-acting sequence features. The results will be pertinent to mammalian systems and, possibly, to diagnostic strategies for diseases with a strong GxE component. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research has relevance to public health priorities as we see life style diseases, stress and environmental impacts on health, in utero and throughout development, pose greater challenges to conventional medicine. Environmental stress is a multifaceted influence on health, and epigenomic response is an important, under-investigated factor in cancer, neurodevelopmental, metabolic and toxin-related disorders with high GxE effects. Upon conclusion of the study, we will have defined the architectural features of stable, de novo epiallelic variation, assessed its influence on heritable phenotype, and refined a methodology for high resolution analysis of epigenomic data that is necessary to inform the development of early diagnostics and countermeasures.","Modeling stress-induced, de novo epiallele architecture in the model Arabidopsis as a tractable entrypoint",9801992,R01GM134056,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Animals', 'Arabidopsis', 'Architecture', 'Behavior', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Models', 'Chromatin', 'Chromatin Modeling', 'Cis-Acting Sequence', 'Complement', 'Cytosine', 'DNA', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Environmental Impact', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Targeting', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heritability', 'Homeostasis', 'Information Systems', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Life Style', 'Link', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mechanics', 'Medicine', 'Memory', 'Metabolic', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'Modeling', 'Nucleosomes', 'Organism', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Phenotype', 'Plant Model', 'Plants', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'RNA Splicing', 'Recurrence', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Reproduction', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Small RNA', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Stress', 'System', 'Testing', 'Thermodynamics', 'Tissue-Specific Gene Expression', 'Toxin', 'Transgenes', 'Variant', 'base', 'behavior influence', 'biological adaptation to stress', 'biophysical properties', 'bisulfite', 'density', 'epigenetic memory', 'epigenome', 'epigenomics', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'genome-wide', 'histone modification', 'in utero', 'innovation', 'insight', 'methylation pattern', 'methylome', 'mutant', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'public health priorities', 'recruit', 'response', 'screening', 'trait', 'transgenerational epigenetic inheritance']",NIGMS,PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIVERSITY-UNIV PARK,R01,2019,319720,0.037794481840887455
"Quantitative regulatory genomics: networks, cis-regulatory codes, and phenotypic variation How do changes in DNA sequence impact organismal properties? This is a central question of modern  biology, and insights into it can help us understand, among other things, why patients respond  differently to the same treatment, or why some species exhibit behavioral properties not seen in  other species. A major hurdle in solving this ‘genotype-to-phenotype’ problem is our poor knowledge  of gene regulatory mechanisms underlying phenotypes and cellular processes, and how those  mechanisms are encoded in DNA. It also leads to severe difficulties in prioritizing  phenotype-linked non-coding variants (polymorphisms) for further investigation. Driven by these  challenges, my lab seeks to develop quantitative frameworks for describing and  discovering transcriptional regulatory mechanisms. We have made significant progress towards this  goal in two main directions: (1) We have developed detailed biophysical models of the  cis-regulatory encoding of gene expression. Using these models we have shown how the regulatory  function of transcription factor (TF) binding sites depends on their sequence and DNA shape, as  well as their ‘trans-context’, e.g., cellular concentrations of regulators, and  ‘cis-context’, e.g., proximity to other TF binding sites and chromatin states. (2) We have  devised statistical models to discover TF-gene interactions from transcriptomic data, as well as  other types of ‘omics’ data if available. Working closely with biologists, we have applied these  models to understand phenotypes such as cytotoxic drug response in cell lines, behavioral response  to social encounters, and embryonic development. Building on the strong foundations of our  past work, I propose to establish a research program that studies transcriptional regulation  holistically at the cis- and trans- levels. Our new pursuits will include: (1) use of our  computational, sequence-level models to describe two data-rich mammalian regulatory programs, an  experimental collaboration to dissect the cis-regulatory logic of a key inflammation gene using  massively parallel reporter assays, and major advances in our modeling techniques; (2) new  machine learning methods for reconstructing networks of TF-gene interactions that explain  phenotypic differences, integration of cis- and trans-regulatory evidence from multi-omics  data, and collaborations to apply these methods in cancer pharmacogenomics and behavioral  neurogenomics; (3) a new probabilistic framework to combine traditional statistical scores of a  non-coding variant with quantitative predictions of its regulatory impact based on the  above-mentioned techniques. Explorations of new forms of synergy among these related goals of  network reconstruction, cis-regulatory sequence modeling and variant interpretation will be woven  throughout our research program. The proposed work will answer fundamental questions about molecular mechanisms underlying  phenotypic differences between individuals, such as why different patients respond differently to  the same drug. We will develop new computational methods for discovery of such mechanisms from a  variety of genomics data sets. We will work closely with experimental biologists and use our tools  to study important biological topics including cancer drug response, inflammation, and effect of  estrogen on breast cancer.","Quantitative regulatory genomics: networks, cis-regulatory codes, and phenotypic variation",9699641,R35GM131819,"['Antineoplastic Agents', 'Behavioral', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Cell Line', 'Cell physiology', 'Chromatin', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Cytotoxic agent', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Embryonic Development', 'Estrogens', 'Exhibits', 'Foundations', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Logic', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Molecular', 'Multiomic Data', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacogenomics', 'Phenotype', 'Property', 'Regulator Genes', 'Reporter', 'Research', 'Shapes', 'Statistical Models', 'Techniques', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'behavioral response', 'biophysical model', 'gene interaction', 'genomic data', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'neurogenomics', 'programs', 'reconstruction', 'response', 'social', 'synergism', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptomics']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT URBANA-CHAMPAIGN,R35,2019,356979,0.034800119821031796
"HIGH-THROUGHPUT FUNCTIONAL INTERROGATION OF MAMMALIAN ACTIVATION DOMAINS Project Summary Abstract Transcription factors (TFs) control gene expression by binding to DNA and either activating or repressing target gene expression. While our understanding of how TFs bind DNA has grown rapidly, our understanding of how TFs activate transcription once they are bound has not kept pace. As a result, when we identify a mutation in a patient in a TF, if this mutation is in the DNA binding domain, we can sometimes predict if it will disrupt function; if the mutation is in the activation domain, we have no ability to predict its effects. To address this gap, I propose to study the amino acid composition of acidic activation domains using high-throughput assays and modern computational analyses. I have recently developed a high-throughput assay for measuring thousands of designed activation domain mutants in yeast. Here, I propose to develop a similar method in mammalian cell culture. In Aim 1, I propose an in-depth study of a few activation domains as a model for how genetic variation impacts TF function. In Aim 2, I propose a broad survey of human transcription factors to search for new activation domains. In the independent phase of this grant (R00), I propose 2 more aims to investigate the mechanisms how TFs activate target genes. In Aim 3, I will functional classify different type of activation domains and search for common features of each time. In Aim 4, I will link activation domains to cofactors and look for the features that predict activation.] This proposal will create a new layer of annotation for the human genome: all regions that are sufficient to serve as activation domains, create a new genome-scale method and deliver computational models for predicting activation domains from amino acid sequence. This award will support training in mammalian experimental systems and advanced machine learning analysis. Together these aims will support the long term goal of reading the regulatory genome by predicting gene expression from DNA sequence. Project Narrative Transcription factors are proteins that bind DNA and turn target genes ON or OFF. When we sequence a genome, we can identify which proteins are likely to be transcription factors, however we cannot predict whether these candidates will turn their targets ON or OFF.

"An Integrative Computational Framework for DNA Hydroxymethylation Data Mining and Interpretation PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Recent advances in next generation–sequencing (NGS)-based molecular methods have illuminated the hierarchical organization of the genome and have shown that changes in the epigenome can promote or prevent the access of transcription factors (TFs) to specific DNA sequences, move genes between nuclear compartments, and build or remove the insulation between neighboring genomic regions. As changes in the epigenome and chromatin organization can derail precise transcriptional regulatory programs to change cell differentiation status or induce a pathological state, research in Dr. Li’s laboratory seeks to improve our ability to define and understand the impact of such changes across multiple layers of transcriptional regulation in the cell. The laboratory has effectively addressed the regulatory roles of DNA methylation in its previous and ongoing work and now extends its focus to hydroxymethylation. 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC), is a key epigenetic modification linked to transcriptional activation; however, 5hmC data and its genome properties have thus far been evaluated with limited integration of different genomic data types. Moreover, there is no integrative computational framework designed to interpret the functional role of 5hmC in the context of 5-methycytosine (5mC), enhancer activities, chromatin interactions, gene expression data, and DNA sequence information. This proposal will fill the growing need for user-friendly, interpretable, and extendable tools for mining 5hmC data toward laying a foundation for basic mechanistic studies of the epigenome and facilitate discovery of potential therapeutic targets in disease. Building on the investigator’s progress in revealing the dynamics of 5hmC and its impact on gene regulation, the proposal will now develop innovative computational tools for 5hmC data mining and data integration with other NGS datasets, with a focus on applying these tools to B cell differentiation, cancer, and embryonic stem cell (ESC) differentiation. Key goals over the next five years include developing a computational framework to mine short- and long-read sequencing data to answer the following questions: (1) How does 5hmC contribute to epigenetic heterogeneity? (2) How does 5hmC epigenetic heterogeneity contribute to transcriptome heterogeneity? (3) How do 5hmC levels and epigenetic heterogeneity communicate with histone modifications, enhancer activities, chromatin interactions, and chromatin organization? We will combine machine learning and network mining algorithms to enable knowledge discovery and data integration from diverse genomic data types. We will then harness the 5hmC data-mining framework to identify 5hmC patterns that correlate with ESC differentiation, B cell differentiation, and that contribute to the fitness advantage of cancer cells. This work is significant because it will be the first dissection of 5hmC’s contribution to local and long-range epigenetic heterogeneity and the first computational framework to uncover the cross-talk between DNA modifications and other transcriptional regulators via chromatin interaction data. Collectively, this work will yield a fuller picture of the molecular events that underlie fundamental changes in cell state and behavior. PROJECT NARRATIVE / RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH Modifications of the genome that do not change the sequence of the DNA, called epigenetic modifications, can impact how genes are expressed and lead healthy cells into a disease state. Here we propose to develop computational tools to define how one type of epigenetic modification, called hydroxymethylation, impacts gene expression and ultimately cell behavior. These tools will be versatile and adaptable to any cell type of choice, enabling research into the molecular features of the genome that underlie both normal and pathological cell behaviors.",An Integrative Computational Framework for DNA Hydroxymethylation Data Mining and Interpretation,9798459,R35GM133562,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'B cell differentiation', 'Behavior', 'Cell Differentiation process', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'DNA', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA Modification Process', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Dissection', 'Enhancers', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Event', 'Foundations', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomic Segment', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Knowledge Discovery', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Nuclear', 'Pathologic', 'Pattern', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Work', 'base', 'cancer cell', 'cell behavior', 'cell type', 'computer framework', 'computerized tools', 'data integration', 'data mining', 'design', 'differentiated B cell', 'embryonic stem cell', 'epigenome', 'fitness', 'genomic data', 'histone modification', 'improved', 'innovation', 'learning network', 'next generation sequencing', 'prevent', 'programs', 'stem cell differentiation', 'therapeutic target', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome', 'user-friendly']",NIGMS,JACKSON LABORATORY,R35,2019,472500,0.06599882230370063
"Defining interaction quantitative trait loci (iQTLs) in the human genome Abstract My research aims to understand the role of three-dimensional (3D) chromatin structure in gene regulation. This involves studying associations among genotype, histone modifications, transcription factor binding, non-coding RNAs, chromatin interactions and gene expression. In order to transform this genome-wide information into new biological discoveries, my laboratory develops scalable and interpretable computational methods based on statistics, graph theory and machine learning. Our recent focus is to address an important gap in the current knowledge of the role of 3D chromatin structure in gene regulation. That is, we aim to define how genotypic variation affects 3D organization of gene promoters, and in turn, their expression. To achieve this at a genome- wide scale is an ambitious goal, because it requires having at a minimum, genotype, gene expression and chromatin interaction profiles in pure populations of specific cell types from a large number of donors. However, my laboratory is uniquely positioned to perform this research because: i) we are involved in a study at the La Jolla Institute (LJI-R24AI108564) that has already genotyped ~100 donors and expression-profiled more than 15 different pure populations of human immune cell types, and we have access to the same samples for chromatin interaction mapping, ii) in collaboration with other groups at LJI, we have already discovered a prototypical example of an interaction quantitative trait locus (iQTL) that alters and rewires interactions from the promoter of a specific gene that is associated with asthma susceptibility, iii) we have the necessary expertise and proven track record in experimental design and computational analyses of various chromatin conformation capture assays. Leveraging the resources available at LJI and our expertise in the field, we will build a unique research program around the novel concept of iQTLs. The emerging set of three main questions we propose to address within the next five years are: Q1) How do we define cell-type-specific iQTLs for common genetic variants? Q2) What is the extent of overlap between iQTLs and GWAS SNPs? Q3) Can we build predictive models for the cell-type specificity of chromatin interactions and iQTLs? Although we propose to define iQTLs only in two abundant, easily accessible, and highly disease-relevant immune cell types, the concept of iQTLs is equally important in other cell types implicated in diseases with a genetic component. Hence, the proof-of-concept developed by this work, without a doubt, will open up a new field in studying a previously uncharacterized role for disease-susceptibility variants, specifically non-coding SNPs, from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) in gene regulation. Narrative Recent discoveries that allow us to look beyond the one-dimensional sequence of DNA and understand the large-scale organization principals of its three-dimensional folding have been limited when it comes to characterizing the role of fine-scale genetic variations of the DNA code in controlling important cellular processes such as gene expression. This work will employ state-of-the-art molecular biology techniques and develop novel computational methods to define the role of such genetic variants in changing three-dimensional connections made by the promoters of genes in the human genome. This systematic and unbiased genome- wide study will have important implications in changing the way we study the disease relevance of genetic variation by revealing genotype dependence of long-range chromatin interactions between genes and their distal control switches at a scale that has not been achieved to date.",Defining interaction quantitative trait loci (iQTLs) in the human genome,9751340,R35GM128938,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Asthma', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Cell physiology', 'Chromatin', 'Chromatin Structure', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computing Methodologies', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence', 'Dependence', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease susceptibility', 'Distal', 'Experimental Designs', 'Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Structure', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Immune', 'Institutes', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Molecular Biology Techniques', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predisposition', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Specificity', 'Susceptibility Gene', 'Uncertainty', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'cell type', 'chromosome conformation capture', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'genome-wide analysis', 'graph theory', 'histone modification', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'promoter', 'statistics', 'transcription factor']",NIGMS,LA JOLLA INSTITUTE FOR IMMUNOLOGY,R35,2019,449829,0.046486736111895965
"Methods for analysis of regulatory variation in cellular differentiation One of the key challenges in human genomics currently is to dissect the impact of sequence variation on gene regulation. Characterizing the functional consequences of regulatory variation would lead to a greater understanding of evolutionary constraint on gene expression, improved interpretation of whole genome sequencing, and a more complete picture of the genetic architecture of complex disease. However, interpreting non-coding genetic variation remains difficult, particularly due to the complexity of gene regulation, which is highly specific to cell-type and environmental context. Understanding how disease-associated genetic variation impacts human tissues requires that we identify mechanisms behind cell-type-specific regulatory variation. In order to address these important goals, we propose to create a resource in which we can directly assay a range of regulatory phenotypes in multiple cell-types. We propose to establish a panel of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from 70 individuals and collect genomic data from iPSCs and differentiated cells. This empirical effort will be complemented by formulating a novel statistical methodology to integrate data across different assays, cell-types, time points, and individuals; to robustly identify regulatory networks and genetic variants that affect gene regulation in each context. Together, these contributions will provide a basis for ongoing study of gene regulation and sequence variation in multiple disease-relevant cell types using a renewable model system and novel methods for robust analysis of these data. In Aim 1, we propose to develop the resource of 70 iPSC lines, where we will collect extensive molecular regulatory phenotypes at multiple time points throughout differentiation to three cell types (cardiomyocytes, neurons and hepatocytes). Measuring gene expression, chromatin accessibility, and methylation in each sample throughout differentiation, we will provide a detailed picture of the cascade of regulatory influences active in each cell type and during development. In Aim 2, we propose to develop a novel statistical framework for inferring universal and cell- type-specific regulatory factors from multi-dimensional data spanning cell-types, individuals, phenotypes, and time points. We specify a machine learning method based on Bayesian hierarchical transfer learning that provides dramatically increased power to detect shared effects while explicitly identifying context-specific regulatory changes. This approach will be adopted to infer regulatory networks, identify key regulatory sequence elements, and map QTLs in each phenotype and cell type. In Aim 3, we will utilize the empirical data and novel methods to infer regulatory relationships and mechanisms underlying genetic variants associated with gene expression in primary tissue and with disease. We will do this by performing a careful integration of external association studies. All samples, cell lines, data, computational tools, and analytical results will be made freely available to the community. We expect our project will greatly advance the understanding of gene regulation, the consequences of genetic variation in diverse cell-types, and the genetic basis of disease. Project narrative: Understanding the impact of individual genetic variation on diverse tissues and cell types in the human body is essential to dissecting the genetics of complex human diseases. Here, we gather data from multiple cell types derived from induced pluripotent stem cells, and develop a novel statistical framework for integrative analysis of data across individuals, cell types, and time points. Our approach provides a transformative approach for understanding gene regulation and the effects of genetic variation on individual health.  ",Methods for analysis of regulatory variation in cellular differentiation,9774175,R01GM120167,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Affect', 'Behavior', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Models', 'Cardiac Myocytes', 'Cell Differentiation process', 'Cell Line', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Ectoderm', 'Elements', 'Endoderm', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genomics', 'Germ Layers', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hepatocyte', 'Hour', 'Human Genetics', 'Human body', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mesoderm', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Neurons', 'Outcome', 'Phenotype', 'Process', 'Psychological Transfer', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Regulatory Element', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Specificity', 'Statistical Methods', 'Supporting Cell', 'System', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'base', 'cell type', 'computerized tools', 'data resource', 'genetic architecture', 'genetic variant', 'genome sequencing', 'genomic data', 'histone modification', 'human disease', 'human genomics', 'human tissue', 'improved', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'learning network', 'learning strategy', 'multidimensional data', 'multimodality', 'novel', 'phenotypic data', 'pluripotency', 'programs', 'statistics', 'stem cell differentiation', 'trait', 'transcriptomics', 'whole genome']",NIGMS,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,520253,0.0335953929040637
"ImmGen: Gene Expression and Regulation in Immune Cells The Immunological Genome Project (ImmGen) is a collaborative group of 15 Immunology and Computational Biology laboratories who perform, under standardized conditions, a thorough dissection of gene expression and its regulation in the mouse immune system. We also investigated how these respond to cytokines and immunologic challenges, how immune gene expression relates to chromatin configuration, and used cutting-edge computational algorithms to deduce regulatory connections. ImmGen data are publicly available on dedicated web and smartphone supports, using interactive graphic displays that make the results intuitive to users. These are now frequently used by the Immunology research community. The proposed continuation will harness the collective expertise of the ImmGen group to further develop this important public resource. (1) Expand and deepen the compendium, applying single-cell RNAseq to define very broadly the cast of cell-types at play in the immune system, their trajectories of differentiation, and their adaptation to specific organismal locations This effort will be complemented by deeper bulk profiling of cell-types thus identified. We will expand the analysis of cytokine signatures, continue to chart non-coding RNA (circRNAs), and persue the “OpenSource” program of coordinated sample contributions from the community. (2) Mechanistic Dissection of Immunogenomic Regulatory Networks focusing on a Core Set of 14 cell-types that represent all the major immunological lineages. We will generate high-resolution maps of transcription factor footprints by ultra-deep ATACseq; map 3D architectures by HiC chromosome conformation capture; apply ChIPseq to define enhancers and super-enhancers, chromatin modification domains and structural anchors; use machine learning approaches to integrate these complementary data into a comprehensive regulatory plan which spans from fine TF footprints to topologically associated domaiins; validate these inferences by collaborating with the KOMP project to analyze Core Set transcriptomes and chromatin configuration in mice with mutations in transcription factors that determine functionally relevant facets of immunocyte activity. (3): Public Display. ImmGen data have become a widely used resource in Immunology research, which will be maintained and curated. For scalability, cost-effectiveness, and to enable facile computation, we will develop and deploy cloud-based data storage and access solutions, compliant with NIH Commons guidelines. We will add to the existing databrowsers to allow users to query different facets of the expanding data (differential expression, regulatory network, chromatin states and architecture, cytokine signatures), increasing connectivity to other data sources. We will continue developing the popular mobile app, and explore the particular uses of that medium.

"Inferring gene regulatory circuitry from functional genomics data PROJECT SUMMARY It has long been known that methylation of genomic DNA correlates with gene expression. However, the structural mechanisms that underlie these observations remain obscure. In this project, we will pursue several innovative strategies for studying how methylation affects transcription factor (TF) binding. First, we will use Methyl-SELEX-seq – a novel experimental method developed in the previous cycle of this grant that uses barcoded mixtures of methylated and unmethylated DNA ligands – to create detailed maps of the effect of methylation on binding affinity for a broad panel of human transcription factors from various structural families. Second, we will perform detailed computational analyses and follow-up experiments to test the hypothesis that methylation causes local changes in DNA shape, which in turn modify TF binding affinity. We have shown that adding a methyl group in the major groove changes the geometry of the minor groove and enhances the electrostatic interaction between negative charges in the DNA minor groove and positively charged amino- acids in the TF. We will extend these analyses to other DNA modifications, as well as a wider range of DNA shape parameters and associated flexibility parameters. By building interpretable TF-DNA recognition models that integrate base, shape, and flexibility features using a powerful new machine learning framework developed in the previous funding cycle, we will make specific predictions regarding sequence and methylation readout mechanisms, and validate these using SELEX experiments with mutated TFs. To assess to what extent our quantitative models for binding to naked DNA built from SELEX data are predictive of binding to genomic DNA in the context of the living cell, we will perform detailed parallel analyses of SELEX and ChIP- seq data for Hox proteins and other TFs. Finally, to study the relationship between DNA binding and gene expression control in human cell lines, we will exploit Survey of Regulatory Elements (SuRE-seq), a novel massively parallel reporter assay that provides unique information about the autonomous transcriptional activity for each of >108 overlapping genomic fragments. PROJECT NARRATIVE Epigenetic modifications of the human genome are known to play a key role in development and disease, but the underlying molecular mechanisms are largely unknown. The main goal of this proposal is to develop and apply new experimental and computational tools for analyzing how the binding of regulatory proteins to DNA is influenced by cytosine methylation.

"Quantitative Modeling of Transcription Factor-DNA Binding Title: Quantitative Modeling of Transcription Factor–DNA Binding PI: Rohs, Remo PROJECT SUMMARY Genes are regulated through transcription factor (TF) binding to specific DNA target sites in the genome. These target sites are recognized through several layers of specificity determinants. The most extensively studied layer of binding specificity are hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic contacts between protein amino acids and functional groups of the base pairs mainly in the major groove. Base readout recognizes nucleotide sequence within a short core-binding site of only a few base pairs. However, these distinct sequence combinations in a TF binding motif occur many times in the genome and only a very small fraction of putative binding sites are functional. It is still unknown how a TF locates and identifies its in vivo binding sites in the plethora of possible genomic target sites. Recognition of three-dimensional DNA structure is an additional layer that refines base readout. While the latter is restricted to direct contacts with the core motif, shape readout is a mechanism through which flanking regions of the core motif or spacer regions between half-sites of dimeric TFs contribute to binding specificity. Other layers of in vivo TF binding determinants are chromatin structure, DNA accessibility, histone modifications, DNA methylation, cofactors and cooperative binding, and cell type. Given this multi-layer nature of TF recognition, we will develop quantitative models to predict TF binding with high accuracy. More important, however, is that our models will reveal recognition mechanisms in the absence of experiment-based structural information. We will build models where each distinct layer of TF binding specificity determinants is added to a base-line model combining DNA sequence and shape. Since it is expected that the importance of each of these TF binding specificity determinants will vary dramatically across protein families, we will use feature selection to identify relative contributions of each feature group as a function of TF or TF family. We will also develop a deep learning framework where individual feature modules can be added or removed from the input layer of convolutional neural networks. This approach will leverage the advantages of deep learning while circumventing the “black box” nature of standard deep learning methods. We will also generate experimental data for specific TFs using the SELEX-seq technology. This approach is currently able to probe the effect of cofactors, cooperative binding, and protein mutations on the binding specificity of a TF. We will add nucleosomes to the SELEX-seq binding assay and, thereby, probe chromatin effects on TF binding using an in vitro experiment in the absence of other cellular contributions. This project will result in a better mechanistic understanding of TF-DNA binding and reveal the impact of various specificity determinants across multiple scales. The new insights will describe different combinations of readout mechanisms on a protein-family specific basis. Our new methods will yield progress in biomedical innovation that is based on transcription and gene regulation. The generated knowledge will better integrate genomics and biophysics, and the project will contribute to the training and mentoring of a new generation of scientists. Title: Quantitative Modeling of Transcription Factor–DNA Binding PI: Rohs, Remo PROJECT NARRATIVE Gene regulatory mechanisms require the binding of transcription factors to highly selective target sites in the genome. By itself, the DNA sequence of the core motif is often insufficient to explain transcription factor binding to a very small fraction of the many more available putative sites.

"Mechanisms of Transcriptional Control Revealed by Nascent Transcript Sequencing Large consortium efforts have collected hundreds of genome-wide datasets that have delineated myriad regulatory regions, transcription factor binding sites and large numbers of coding and non-coding transcripts. Even with this massive amount of data, it remains a significant challenge to determine how the mapped elements function together in regulatory networks. This is due in large part to our inability to accurately and quantitatively detect all forms of nascent transcription, the instantaneous output of transcriptional regulation. Moreover, our understanding of global gene regulation is restricted by a lack of computational tools that seamlessly integrate genome-wide datasets. The overall goal of this proposal is to maximize the impact of nascent transcriptome studies and enable facile integration with other functional genomic data. My group developed native elongating transcript sequencing (NET-seq), that enables the strand-specific nucleotide-resolution mapping of RNA polymerase density, highlighting all transcriptional activity regardless of transcript half-lives and revealing precise positions of Pol II pausing where regulatory control is applied. Here, we will develop a new version of NET-seq – NET-seq 2.0 – that enables the routine, scalable and flexible application to diverse human cell types (or any eukaryotic system). Moreover, we will increase the potential of NET-seq analysis by developing two innovative bioinformatics strategies to seamlessly integrate NET-seq data with other genome-wide datasets that will have applications beyond NET-seq studies. To demonstrate the broad utility of our integrated approach, we will study regulatory networks and cell differentiation for which instantaneous nascent transcriptional analysis will be highly impactful. In Aim 1, our goal is to make NET-seq easier, cheaper, and more flexible. Our improvements will reduce background and increase usable reads, dramatically reduce cell input requirements (100-1000-fold), enable dense, region-specific RNA transcription analyses, and enable quantitative comparisons between samples and conditions. In Aim 2, we will determine transcription kinetics through integrating NET-seq with metabolic RNA labeling (TT-seq) data which report local synthesis rates. This integrative approach yields a rich transcriptional phenotype that we will use to develop gene regulatory network models. In Aim 3, we will create new computational algorithms that circumvent the need to determine each molecular event separately, and instead infer the status of unmapped events using information-rich datasets, such as NET-seq. We will use integrative deep neural networks (`deep-learning') that use available genome-wide datasets to predict unavailable datasets from data already on hand. We will apply this approach to study erythropoiesis using a well- defined primary human hematopoietic differentiation system by a time series NET-seq and DNase-seq analysis. These data will inform deep neural network models to predict ChIP-seq data for myriad transcription factors and chromatin marks to investigate key regulatory events without additional expense. The proposed research is relevant to public health, because discovery of regulatory mechanisms in transcription at high resolution is ultimately expected to significantly impact our understanding of most human disease.

"From epigenome to genome and back: disentangling the relationship between epigenetic modifications and chromatin organization PROJECT SUMMARY Understanding how the genome functions is one of the greatest challenges of the 21st century.

It is becoming increasingly clear that the epigenome— covalent modifications to the DNA and histone proteins—plays a crucial role. Genome-wide profiling of epigenetic modifications has clarified cell type specificity and the presence of a diverse set of combinatorial patterns that are strongly correlated with gene expression levels. Inferring causal relationships from these data has proved challenging, however. A working knowledge of the mechanisms that inform the establishment and regulation of the epigenome, and its impact on gene expression and cellular phenotype, therefore, remain elusive. In this project, we propose several novel modeling approaches which will address the key gaps in our understanding of the interrelationship between the epigenome and genome. First, we will parameterize a coarse- grained chromatin model from the bottom-up using a novel deep learning algorithm to generate an accurate and comprehensive characterization of chromatin secondary structure, and its sensitivity to DNA sequence, nucleosome repeat length, ionic concentrations, post-translational modifications, and phase-separated liquid- droplets formed by intrinsically disordered proteins. High resolution chromatin structures from this effort will elucidate how different epigenetic modifications impact gene expression by regulating nucleosome packaging and DNA accessibility. Second, we will investigate the role of epigenetic modifications in mediating long-range interactions between regulatory elements by developing a predictive model which will enable de novo reconstruction of three-dimensional genome organization. This project will result in a global view of the role of the epigenome in cell differentiation and cell fate determination. An improved understanding of the interrelationship between the epigenome and the genome from this research program can guide the development of engineering approaches to modify the epigenome for both long lasting and reversible changes as a novel strategy for combating diseases such as cancer. PROJECT NARRATIVE The epigenome works hand-in-hand with the genome to encode cell phenotypic diversity for multicellular organisms. We will apply interdisciplinary approaches to disentangle the interrelationship between the two, thus elucidating the role of the genome in establishing and maintaining a robust epigenome, and providing mechanistic insight into epigenetic regulations of the genome’s function. Insights from our study will pave the way for rational epigenome engineering which holds great potential for transforming medicine and biotechnology.",From epigenome to genome and back: disentangling the relationship between epigenetic modifications and chromatin organization,9798562,R35GM133580,"['Address', 'Back', 'Biotechnology', 'Cell Differentiation process', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'Chromatin Modeling', 'Chromatin Structure', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Engineering', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Gene Expression', 'Genome', 'Grain', 'Histones', 'Knowledge', 'Length', 'Liquid substance', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mediating', 'Medicine', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Nucleosomes', 'Organism', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Post-Translational Protein Processing', 'Proteins', 'Regulation', 'Regulatory Element', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Work', 'cell type', 'combat', 'combinatorial', 'deep learning algorithm', 'epigenetic profiling', 'epigenetic regulation', 'epigenome', 'genome-wide', 'improved', 'insight', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'reconstruction']",NIGMS,MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R35,2019,377555,0.05281583828249805
"Statistical modeling of long-range chromatin interactions on gene regulation and underlying molecular Disease-associated genetic variants have been found to be enriched in regulatory genomic regions of gene expression. In order to gain detailed understanding of disease mechanisms, one central question is to systematically delineate how tissue-specific gene expression programs are regulated. Enhancers are a major family of regulatory elements with complex signatures and they are abundant in the human genome. Enhancer regulation of gene expression is highly tissue-specific, associated with combinatorial transcription factor binding, and involved with long-range three-dimensional chromatin interactions. It is therefore challenging to characterize the large-scale enhancer regulatory networks. The primary goal of this project is to develop a suite of probabilistic models and efficient machine learning algorithms to predict genome-wide enhancer regulatory networks in diverse panels of cellular contexts and the associated molecular mechanisms to establish long-range interactions, which will be leveraged to interpret disease-associated genetic variants. In Aim 1, novel integrative graphical models will be developed to predict long-range chromatin interactions linking tissue-specific enhancers to their distal target genes, along with combinatorial transcription factor binding patterns. In Aim 2, computational algorithms will be designed to interrogate how specific chromatin interactions are established, leading to mechanistic insights on chromatin formation. In Aim 3, statistical models will be developed to integrate enhancer-gene regulatory networks with genetics data to predict which non-coding variants may disrupt regulatory links and cause diseases, with improved statistical power and accuracy. This modeling framework will substantially expand the analytical ability on non-coding variants and human disease mechanisms. Computational predictions from the three aims will be experimentally tested in mouse models of breast cancer development. This project will lead to both innovative computational tools and systematic biological insights on long-range enhancer regulation and their functional roles in human diseases. The advanced statistical models and machine learning algorithms will provide efficient big-data integration tools for epigenetics, gene regulation and human genetics. Comprehensive predictions from this project represent valuable platforms to delineate genetic variants and disease mechanisms. Novel mechanistic insights of diseases at the regulatory and molecular level will facilitate improved diagnostic and therapeutic approaches for human diseases.",Statistical modeling of long-range chromatin interactions on gene regulation and underlying molecular,9774269,R01GM131398,"['Affect', 'Big Data', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Breast Cancer Model', 'Chromatin', 'Chromatin Structure', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Distal', 'Drug Targeting', 'Elements', 'Enhancers', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Family', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Structure', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomic Segment', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Human Genetics', 'Human Genome', 'Joints', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Mediating', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Network-based', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Regulation', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Statistical Models', 'Structural Genes', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissue-Specific Gene Expression', 'Tissues', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'base', 'cell type', 'combinatorial', 'computerized tools', 'data integration', 'design', 'experimental study', 'functional genomics', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic information', 'genetic variant', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'human disease', 'human tissue', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mouse model', 'novel', 'programs', 'protein protein interaction', 'tissue resource', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'transcription factor USF']",NIGMS,MICHIGAN STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,325001,0.038676218250379917
"Encoding genomic architecture in the encyclopedia: linking DNA elements, chromatin state, and gene expression in 3D Project Summary Most of the 1000s of sequencing experiments generated by ENCODE provide 1D readouts of the epigenetic landscape or transcriptional output of a 3D genome. New chromosome conformation capture (3C) technologies – in particular Hi-C and ChIA-PET – have begun to provide insight into the hierarchical 3D organization of the genome: the partition of chromosomes into open and closed compartments; the existence of structural subunits defined as topologically associated domains (TADs); and the presence of regulatory and structural DNA loops within TADs. New experimental evidence using CRISPR/Cas-mediated genome editing suggests that disruption of local 3D structure can alter regulation of neighboring genes, and there have been early efforts to use data on 3D DNA looping to predict the impact of non-coding SNPs from GWAS studies. The goal of this proposal is to develop new integrative computational methods to interpret large-scale ENCODE 1D epigenomic and transcriptomic resources in light of the underlying 3D architecture of the genome. Members of our team have pioneered powerful methods to infer local chromatin states from a 1D viewpoint through the Segway suite. We have also analyzed the 1D organization of chromatin accessible elements and their lineage dynamics to define the concept of regulatory complexity, and we presented a gene regulation model to predict gene expression changes in differentiation from the DNA content of active enhancers. Here we will build on these efforts to learn chromatin state and gene regulation models that incorporate information on hierarchical 3D genomic architecture, enabling us to predict how individual structural/regulatory elements contribute to 3D DNA looping and to gene expression. Mechanistic predictions will be experimentally validated in their native cell-type specific chromatin context using state-of-the-art genome editing, exploiting computational and experimental CRISPR/Cas tools developed by our team. Project Narrative This project develops advanced computational methods for integrating information on the 3D structure of the human genome with large-scale genomics data sets generated by the ENCODE project to gain insight into cell-type specific chromatin state and gene regulation. These studies have broad relevance for understanding the regulation of gene expression in human cells and the disruption of gene expression programs in disease.","Encoding genomic architecture in the encyclopedia: linking DNA elements, chromatin state, and gene expression in 3D",9629973,U01HG009395,"['3-Dimensional', 'ATAC-seq', 'Architecture', 'Atlases', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'Chromatin Interaction Analysis by Paired-End Tag Sequencing', 'Chromatin Loop', 'Chromosomes', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Computing Methodologies', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence', 'DNA Structure', 'DNase I hypersensitive sites sequencing', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Encyclopedias', 'Enhancers', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Guide RNA', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Hybrids', 'Individual', 'Learning', 'Light', 'Link', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Output', 'Peptide Signal Sequences', 'Ploidies', 'Published Comment', 'Regulation', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Specificity', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Structural Models', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'Training', 'Untranslated RNA', 'base', 'cell type', 'chromosome conformation capture', 'computerized tools', 'deep learning', 'density', 'epigenomics', 'experimental study', 'genome annotation', 'genome editing', 'genome wide association study', 'genomic data', 'histone modification', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'member', 'next generation', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'sequence learning', 'supervised learning', 'three dimensional structure', 'three-dimensional modeling', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptomics', 'unsupervised learning']",NHGRI,SLOAN-KETTERING INST CAN RESEARCH,U01,2019,742538,0.05317410241071332
"Computational approaches for comparative regulatory genomics to decipher long-range gene regulation Project Abstract/Summary The three-dimensional organization of the genome is a major player in long-range gene regulation, where regulatory elements such as enhancers affect the expression of a gene hundreds of kilobases away. Changes in three-dimensional organization are associated with tissue-specific gene expression and have been implicated in several human diseases including cancer, diabetes and obesity. Advances in chromosome conformation capture (3C) technologies have expanded our repertoire of long-range interactions between enhancers and promoters in model cell lines and have shown that such interactions are established through a complex interplay of chromatin state, transcription factor binding and three-dimensional proximity of genomic regions. However, our current understanding of the dynamics of long-range gene regulation is limited, both across different cell types as well as across different species. This is because of the absence of such datasets in most species and cell types, lack of systematic methods to predict and interpret these interactions, and due to limited approaches to compare both the regions and their interactions across different cell types and especially across species. The overarching goals of this proposal are to develop novel computational methods to jointly identify candidate regulatory elements in multiple species and predict their long- range interactions in new cell types and species where high-throughput 3C datasets are not available or difficult to obtain. In Aim 1, we will develop a phylogenetically aware method of jointly identifying regulatory elements such as enhancers in multiple species. Aim 2 will develop multi-task and transfer learning approaches to predict interactions in new species and cell types by integrating available high-throughput 3C datasets from multiple cell types and 3C platforms. In Aim 3, we will collect a novel multi-species chromatin mark dataset in species-specific endothelial cells to enable a systematic study of long-range gene regulation dynamics. We will apply our computational approaches developed in Aims 1 and 2 on this multi-species epigenomic dataset to identify different regulatory elements and predict long-range interactions in multiple species. We will develop rigorous computational measures to evaluate the quality of predictions from our novel methods and the improvements compared to existing methods based on published 3C datasets. We will further experimentally validate predicted interactions using Capture-HiC in multiple species and using CRISPR/Cas9 experiments. We will examine individual and groups of interactions to identify species-specific, and clade- specific interactions and interpret the corresponding genes in the context of known pathways and curated gene sets associated with cardiovascular diseases. Our methods will be widely applicable to dissect long-range gene regulation in complex phenotypes including diseases. Software tools, resources, original data and experimental protocols developed by this project will be made publicly available. Project Narrative Long-range gene regulatory interactions are emerging as important determinants of tissue-specific gene expression and are often disrupted in different diseases including cancer. Such interactions occur between distally located regulatory sequence elements and genes hundreds of kilobases away. Currently our understanding of long-range gene regulation is limited to a few cell types and model organisms. Computational methods to identify regulatory elements and systematically link them to target genes in diverse cell types and mammalian species can significantly improve our understanding of the impact of long-range gene regulation in human diseases, help interpret regulatory variation in non-coding parts of the genome and assist in the development of better biomarkers.",Computational approaches for comparative regulatory genomics to decipher long-range gene regulation,9786812,R01HG010045,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Animal Model', 'Awareness', 'Basic Science', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cell Line', 'Cell model', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'Comparative Study', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Distal', 'Elements', 'Endothelial Cells', 'Enhancers', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genomic Segment', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Human', 'Ice', 'Individual', 'Joints', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Obesity', 'Pathway interactions', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Phylogenetic Analysis', 'Play', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychological Transfer', 'Publishing', 'Regulation', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Software Tools', 'Statistical Models', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Tissue-Specific Gene Expression', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'base', 'cell type', 'chromosome conformation capture', 'comparative', 'cost', 'epigenome', 'epigenomics', 'experimental study', 'follow-up', 'histone modification', 'human disease', 'improved', 'markov model', 'multi-task learning', 'multitask', 'novel', 'promoter', 'tool', 'trait', 'transcription factor']",NHGRI,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R01,2019,352626,0.03949586043677248
"Identification of epigenetic subclones in lymphomas and leukemias Abstract Epigenetic modifications, such as DNA methylation, play a significant role in human disease. DNA methylation is altered in cancer, and DNA methylation-induced silencing of promoters of tumor-suppressors is thought to play a key role in tumorigenesis. Though there is an increasing number of methylation sequencing datasets generated from cancer, they are confounded by tumor heterogeneity. Understanding the subclonal architecture underlying heterogeneity is important because individual cancer subclones impact cancer growth, treatment resistance, and metastasis. Increased “epigenetic heterogeneity,” or variation in DNA methylation patterns, was determined to be correlated with worse prognosis in patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). However, these studies only profiled epigenetic heterogeneity at a global scale and did not analyze methylation of individual subclones. Many computational methods have been developed for this purpose in epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS), but these methods are not applicable for methylation sequencing data. As such, there is a need to develop new computational methods to study subclonal methylation profiles in cancer. I will develop a novel computational method (DXM) that deconvolves DNA methylation of heterogeneous clinical samples into their major subpopulations, their prevalence, and their respective DNA methylation profiles (Aim 1). DXM will be developed on simulations generated from data available from both the Roadmap Epigenomics Project and the Blueprint Epigenome Project and will be validated with methylation sequencing on DLBCL samples. I will then leverage DXM to study subclonal methylation profiles in AML (Aim 2). I hypothesize that methylation can confer fitness advantages in epigenetic subclones of AML, leading to clonal expansion following therapeutic intervention and subsequent relapse. Using DXM, I will first identify epigenetic subclones from whole genome bisulfite sequencing data from AML patients with well-characterized genetic subclonal architecture and compare the epigenetic subclonal architecture to that of the genetic subclones. In a second dataset containing methylation sequencing data from paired diagnosis-relapse samples, I will apply DXM, identify subclonal methylation profiles, and characterize all genes impacted by subclonal methylation to determine if they are expected to confer fitness advantages. Finally, I will test if mutations known to impact DNA methylation in AML (DNMT3A, IDH1/2) alter epigenetic subclonal expansion. Taken together, this proposal will result in a new computational approach to interpret epigenetic data from heterogeneous clinical samples as well as identification of DNA methylation changes in epigenetic subclones of AML that contribute to disease progression and correlate with prognosis. Project Narrative Studies that characterize which variations in cancer relate to worse outcome may do analysis on the entire tumor sample, which is composed of many different types of cells, each with distinct biology. The goal of this proposal is to develop a novel computational method to analyze variations in cancer at the level of cell-types. These results can be used to improve patient prognostics and care in multiple cancers.",Identification of epigenetic subclones in lymphomas and leukemias,9752227,F30CA224687,"['Acute Myelocytic Leukemia', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Antibodies', 'Architecture', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Cancer Biology', 'Cancer Patient', 'Caring', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Clonal Expansion', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'CpG dinucleotide', 'DNA Methylation', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease Progression', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Fluorescence-Activated Cell Sorting', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genome', 'Genomic Imprinting', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Heterogeneity', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'Modification', 'Mutation', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Play', 'Prevalence', 'Relapse', 'Retrotransposon', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Surface', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Training', 'Tumor Promoters', 'Tumor Suppressor Genes', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins', 'United States', 'Variant', 'X Inactivation', 'anticancer research', 'bisulfite', 'bisulfite sequencing', 'career', 'cell type', 'clinical care', 'design', 'epigenome', 'epigenome-wide association studies', 'epigenomics', 'fitness', 'genome sequencing', 'human disease', 'improved', 'large cell Diffuse non-Hodgkin&apos', 's lymphoma', 'leukemia/lymphoma', 'methylation pattern', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'patient stratification', 'prognostic', 'promoter', 'simulation', 'single cell sequencing', 'statistics', 'therapy resistant', 'tumor', 'tumor heterogeneity', 'tumorigenesis', 'whole genome']",NCI,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,F30,2019,30926,0.08468715793253405
"VISION: ValIdated Systematic IntegratiON of epigenomic data Project Summary VISION: ValIdated Systematic IntegratiON of hematopoietic epigenomes Technological advances enabling the production of large numbers of rich, genome-wide, sequence-based datasets have transformed biology. However, the volume of data is overwhelming for most investigators. Also, we do not know the mechanisms by which the vast majority of epigenetic features regulate normal differentiation or lead to aberrant function in disease. We have formed an interdisciplinary, collaborative team of investigators to address the problem of how to effectively utilize the enormous amount of epigenetic data both for basic research and precision medicine. At this point, acquisition of data is no longer the major barrier to understanding mechanisms of gene regulation during normal and pathological tissue development. The chief challenges are how to: (i) integrate epigenetic data in terms that are accessible and understandable to a broad community of researchers, (ii) build validated quantitative models explaining how the dynamics of gene expression relates to epigenetic features, and (iii) translate information effectively from mouse models to potential applications in human health. These needs are addressed by the proposed ValIdated Systematic IntegratiON (VISION) of epigenetic data to analyze mouse and human hematopoiesis, a tractable system with clear clinical significance and importance to NIDDK. By pursuing the following Specific Aims, the interdisciplinary collaboration will deliver comprehensive catalogs of cis regulatory modules (CRMs), extensive chromatin interaction maps and deduced regulatory domains, validated quantitative models for gene regulation, and a guide for investigators to translate insights from mouse models to human clinical studies. These deliverables will be provided to the community in readily accessible, web-based platforms including customized genome browsers, databases with facile query interfaces, and data-driven on-line tools. Specifically, the proposed work in Aim 1 will build comprehensive, integrative catalogs of hematopoietic CRMs and transcriptomes by compiling and determining informative epigenetic features and transcript levels in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells and in mature cells. CRMs will be predicted using the novel IDEAS (Integrative and Discriminative Epigenome Annotation System) method. Work proposed in Aim 2 will build and validate quantitative models for gene regulation informed by chromatin interaction maps and epigenetic data. Compiling and determining chromosome interaction frequencies will predict likely target genes for CRMs. Gene regulatory models will be built that predict the contributions of CRMs and specific proteins to regulated expression; these models will be validated by extensive testing using genome-editing in ten reference loci. Finally, work in Aim 3 will produce a guide for investigators to translate insights from mouse models to human clinical studies. This effort will include categorizing orthologous mouse and human genes by conservation versus divergence of expression patterns, assigning CRMs to informative categories of epigenomic evolution, and testing the interspecies functional maps experimentally by genome-editing. Project Narrative VISION: ValIdated Systematic IntegratiON of hematopoietic epigenomes Blood cell formation is vitally important to human health because we must continually replace old and damaged cells, and because many diseases result from mis-regulation of gene expression during blood formation. Global measurements of proteins bound to DNA and their modifications help us find the genetic differences most likely to account for the aberrant gene expression at the heart of some diseases.

"Statistical Methods for Network-Based Integrative Analysis of CVD Epigenetic Data ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project involves the development of new statistical methodologies and computational tools for network-based integrative analysis of epigenetic risk factors of cardiovascular diseases (CVD). While the advent of omics data from new technologies has facilitated the study of epigenetic factors, existing methodologies often do not account for complexities of biological data  such as correlations due to interactions of genes/proteins as part of biological pathways  and fail to eﬃciently integrate diverse omics data sets  for instance genetic variation, DNA methylation and gene expression. The methodologies proposed in this project, and the software tools that will be developed to implement them, address these shortcomings, and facilitate further research by the biomedical community to gain a better understanding of the underlying biology of CVD, and to develop new diagnostic biomarkers and potential targets for therapies. The proposed methodologies are motivated by the study of epigenetic data from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA), and include (i) a network-based pathway enrichment analysis method that incorporates available knowledge of interactions among genes and proteins while complementing and reﬁning such information (Aim 1A), as well as its extension for analysis of multiple types of omics data (Aim 1B), and (ii) an integrative analysis framework to identify associations among gene expression levels and DNA methylation (Aim 2A) and identify common epigenetic factors of multiple CVD phenotypes through integrated analysis of DNA methylation and mRNA expression data (Aim 2B). We will develop eﬃcient and user-friendly software tools for the proposed methods (Aim 3), which will be made freely available to the public after extensive tests using both simulated data, as well as real data from MESA.

"Learning the rules of enhancer activity to understand non-coding genetic variation in autoimmune disease Project Summary/Abstract Genome-wide association studies have given us many clues about the mutations that cause common genetic diseases, including autoimmune diseases like lupus and rheumatoid arthritis. However, many of the mutations implicated in disease lie outside of the genes themselves and instead lie in the regions controlling expression of the genes, and so probably contribute to disease by producing the wrong amount of the gene in the wrong tissue or at the wrong time. Mutations in regulatory regions are thought to cause disease by altering the binding of regulatory proteins to the DNA, changing the DNA sequence from one that the protein can bind to one that it cannot (or vice versa). However, the ways in which these regulatory proteins control gene expression remains incompletely understood and so it is presently difficult to understand which regulatory protein binds differently to a mutated regulatory region, or how that change in binding affects expression of the regulated genes. In fact, we still do not even know where the regulatory regions are in the tissues we think are dysfunctional in disease. This project aims to better understand how these mutations contribute to autoimmune disease by first increasing our understanding of how regulatory proteins and regulatory regions work to control when and where genes are expressed, and then applying this knowledge to understand genetic disease. First, regulatory regions will be identified in immune cells and their effects on gene expression measured so that mutations that are likely to contribute to disease (those in regulatory regions) can be identified. The relationship between regulatory proteins, regulatory sequence, and gene expression will be learned by creating millions of synthetic regulatory regions and measuring their effect on gene expression, providing many examples of binding sites for each regulatory protein from which to learn. Finally, our new understanding of gene regulation will be applied to determine which genetic mutations change regulatory protein binding and cause disease. This will help us better understand the underlying causes of disease so that new treatments can be developed that target the mutations within each person. The candidate's long term career goals are to better understand how gene regulation works in humans so that we can better understand how the sequence of the genome controls the expression of our genes. The candidate currently works at the Broad Institute, a leading institute in human genetics and genomics with the resources and personnel required of this project. In order to continue to develop as a scientist, the candidate will gain more experience teaching, publish and present his existing findings, gain the necessary skills to work with human cells, and secure a faculty position and funding so that he can continue to make a positive impact on our knowledge of the genome.

"Mechanisms of eukaryotic transcription activation Summary Transcription activation, a key step in gene control, is the readout of many signaling pathways controlling cell growth, development and stress response and defects in activation cause many human diseases and syndromes. Activation typically results from factors containing activation domains (ADs) binding to coactivator complexes containing activator binding domains (ABDs). Understanding the nature of ADs, the specificity of AD-coactivator interactions, and mechanisms of coactivator cooperativity are necessary for understanding the molecular basis of gene regulation. The long-term goal of this project is to determine mechanisms used by gene-specific activators and coactivators to regulate RNA polymerase (Pol) II transcription. The objectives of this proposal are to determine: i) mechanisms of Mediator recruitment and its interaction with ADs, ii) mechanisms of cooperativity between Mediator and the coactivator SAGA, and iii) what constitutes a functional AD and determines the AD specificity for different coactivators and promoter types. This work will utilize an interdisciplinary combination of biochemical, structural, molecular, and computational approaches to examine transcriptional activation in S. cerevisiae. To understand these mechanisms, we will build upon several breakthrough concepts and methods developed in the past grant period. We will use a combination of genomics and biochemistry to identify a new mechanism of Mediator recruitment that is likely used at many genes. We will use orthogonal approaches to determine how the coactivator SAGA stimulates genome-wide transcription, either by direct interaction with the Pol II preinitiation complex (PIC) and/or by direct interaction with Mediator. We will determine the structural basis for AD-Mediator Tail domain interaction using a combination of biochemical and structural analysis. Finally, we will use a combination of biochemistry, genomics, and computational analysis to predict AD function and specificity and identify new mechanisms of AD-coactivator interaction. The expected outcome of these studies will be a molecular understanding of transcription activator specificity and function, mechanisms used by the coactivators Mediator and SAGA to promote transcription, and an understanding of how these factors function at different classes of genes –a leap forward in understanding widely conserved mechanisms of eukaryotic gene regulation. Project Narrative Regulation of transcription by activation of gene expression is a key mechanism for control of cell growth, differentiation, and development. Defects in activation directly contribute to many human illnesses. Our proposed work will identify conserved and widely used mechanisms for transcriptional activation that will form the molecular basis for understanding regulation of transcriptional programs in normal cells, transcriptional defects leading to human disease, and reveal fundamental information on the mechanism of transcription factors that are the readout of many signaling pathways.",Mechanisms of eukaryotic transcription activation,9735333,R01GM075114,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Amino Acids', 'Architecture', 'Binding', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemistry', 'Complex', 'Computer Analysis', 'DNA Binding Domain', 'DNA Polymerase II', 'Defect', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Gene Activation', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Growth and Development function', 'Housekeeping Gene', 'Human', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Maps', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Computations', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Nature', 'Normal Cell', 'Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Study', 'Polymerase', 'Proteins', 'Publishing', 'RNA Polymerase II', 'Randomized', 'Reagent', 'Regulation', 'Regulator Genes', 'SAGA', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae', 'Sequence Analysis', 'Signal Pathway', 'Specificity', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Tail', 'Technology', 'Transcription Coactivator', 'Transcription Initiation', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Transcriptional Activation Domain', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Work', 'base', 'biological adaptation to stress', 'cell growth', 'chromatin modification', 'deep learning', 'flexibility', 'genetic analysis', 'genome-wide', 'high throughput screening', 'human disease', 'in vivo', 'novel strategies', 'programs', 'promoter', 'protein crosslink', 'protein protein interaction', 'recruit', 'transcription factor']",NIGMS,FRED HUTCHINSON CANCER RESEARCH CENTER,R01,2019,527403,0.018961513531033904
"Mapping RNA polymerase in tissue samples with ChRO-seq. PROJECT ABSTRACT Deciphering how complex programs of gene expression and regulation contribute to human disease is one of the major challenges facing the field of genomics. Over the past decade, a wealth of new high-throughput genomics tools have revolutionized how we identify active genomic regions and appear poised to make great strides in understanding the mechanisms of disease. Yet the application of most of these technologies has been limited to established cell lines. Currently, approaches being developed to comprehensively map functional elements across the genome involve combining data from several different genome-wide experimental assays, making them expensive and impractical to use in clinical isolates of limited quantity or even to analyze new cell lines. Compounding these technical difficulties, gene expression is a complex and highly tissue dependent biological process, and many important applications will require the direct interrogation of clinical isolates or other similarly limited sources of sample. Thus, efficient new tools that map the repertoire of functional elements across the genome are likely to transform the biomedical and clinical sciences.  We propose to develop Chromatin Run-On and Sequencing (ChRO-seq) and a suite of computational tools for mapping transcription directly in limited tissue samples. Our approach uses a single genome-wide molecular assay to efficiently identify the location of promoters and enhancers, transcription factor binding sites, gene and lincRNA boundaries, transcription levels, and impute certain histone modifications. Preliminary ChRO-seq data reveals patterns of transcription that are virtually identical to those using Precision Run on and Sequencing in cultured cells, but can easily be applied in solid tissue samples. We applied our preliminary ChRO-seq technology to several primary tumors, revealing new insights into how transcriptional regulation underlies cancer development and progression, and providing a key proof-of-concept motivating further technology development. We anticipate that ChRO-seq and the computational methods proposed will enable the efficient discovery of functional elements in virtually any cell sample. In addition, ChRO-seq has the unique advantage that it can be applied in limited tissue samples and clinical isolates even after the degradation of mRNA. PROJECT NARRATIVE We propose to develop a suite of molecular and computational technologies that allow researchers to directly measure transcriptional regulation of genes, enhancers, and lincRNAs in limited clinical isolates. These technologies are anticipated to have a major impact on the biomedical sciences, enabling the genome-wide interrogation of transcription during virtually any disease process for the first time.",Mapping RNA polymerase in tissue samples with ChRO-seq.,9637410,R01HG009309,"['Archives', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Process', 'Cell Line', 'Cells', 'ChIP-seq', 'Chromatin', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Consumption', 'Cultured Cells', 'DNA Sequence', 'DNA-Directed RNA Polymerase', 'Data', 'Deoxyribonuclease I', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Enhancers', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomic Segment', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Hypersensitivity', 'Location', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Computations', 'Nuclear', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Primary Neoplasm', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'RNA', 'RNA Polymerase I', 'Regulatory Element', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Solid', 'Source', 'Specimen', 'Speed', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Tissue Sample', 'Tissues', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Untranslated RNA', 'computational suite', 'computerized tools', 'deep learning', 'established cell line', 'experimental study', 'genome-wide', 'genomic tools', 'histone modification', 'human disease', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'mRNA Transcript Degradation', 'next generation', 'novel', 'predictive tools', 'programs', 'promoter', 'scale up', 'technology development', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'virtual']",NHGRI,CORNELL UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,387500,0.03311407305394094
"Enhancer-mediated mechanisms of pattern formation ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Gene regulatory networks establish the body plans of complex multicellular animals. The main components of these networks are transcription factors and cis-regulatory elements (CREs) that contain unique combinations of transcription factor binding sites. Transgenic experiments have shown that CREs control spatial and temporal patterns of gene expression, but how binding events at the CRE level are converted into these patterns is still poorly understood. In humans, mutations that disrupt transcription factor activit or CRE DNA sequences can cause birth defects and disease states, including cancer. Here we propose to study CRE- mediated embryo patterning in the early Drosophila embryo, with a specific focus on CREs that respond to the maternal transcription factor Bicoid (Bcd). In previous work, we identified 66 Bcd-dependent CREs, which were validated by reporter genes in transgenic embryos. All 66 are directly activated by Bcd, but each contains a unique set of transcription factor-binding sites, and drives an expression pattern that appears as a band(s) or stripe(s) at a specific position(s) along the anterior-posterior (AP) axis. Expression pattern boundaries represent positions where genes make on/off decisions, and foreshadow boundaries between cells of different fates later in development. The work proposed here will focus on two major goals. First, we want to perform a deep, quantitative analysis of transcriptional activation by a single ""model"" CRE (hunchback P2E) that is activated by BCD. Two specific questions will be addressed: 1. how do individual binding sites, groups of binding sites, and combinations of sites for different factors contribute to transcriptional activation? We will combine DNA-binding data of different types to better define functional motifs, extensively mutate the CRE, and assay three specific output parameters using live imaging in close collaboration with Thomas Gregor's lab. 2. How does this Bcd-dependent CRE ""choose"" its specific basal promoter? We will use a split reporter system and single molecule FISH to identify basal promoter sequences that allow or prevent activation by Bcd, and CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing to test the importance of promoter choice in vivo. The second major goal will be to gain a conceptually complete understanding of the regulatory network that creates Bcd-dependent gene expression patterns. We have identified three proteins that function in broad activation, and nine candidate repressors expressed in discrete domains that together cover the entire embryonic region where activation can occur. We will use reporter gene manipulations and single molecule FISH to test how repressor gradients shape boundaries of gene expression, and genetics and reporter genes to test the roles of several newly identified repressors that prevent activation in anterior regions. Our hypothesis is that the expression patterns driven by all Bcd-dependent CREs are ""computed"" by specific combinations of binding sites for these twelve factors. These experiments will make significant contributions to our general understanding of how CREs functions in activation and repression events, and how embryos establish body plans. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Animal body plans are established by hundreds of DNA-binding factors that bind thousands of cis-regulatory elements (CREs). Our goals are to carry out the deepest analysis of gene activation by a single CRE in higher eukaryotes, and to understand how multiple CREs integrates activation and repression to pattern the embryo.",Enhancer-mediated mechanisms of pattern formation,9667439,R01GM051946,"['Address', 'Affinity', 'Animals', 'Anterior', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Models', 'Body Patterning', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Collaborations', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Congenital Abnormality', 'DNA Binding', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Defect', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Dissection', 'Drosophila genus', 'Elements', 'Embryo', 'Enhancers', 'Eukaryota', 'Event', 'Funding', 'Gene Activation', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Gene Order', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Homeodomain Proteins', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Length', 'Link', 'Logic', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Output', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Formation', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Proteins', 'RNA', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Reporter', 'Reporter Genes', 'Repression', 'Role', 'Shapes', 'Site', 'System', 'Tertiary Protein Structure', 'Testing', 'Transact', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Transgenic Organisms', 'Work', 'Zinc Fingers', 'bZIP Protein', 'base', 'cofactor', 'experimental study', 'fly', 'in vitro Assay', 'in vivo', 'loss of function mutation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'morphogens', 'prevent', 'promoter', 'protein function', 'public health relevance', 'single molecule', 'transcription factor']",NIGMS,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,362238,0.03141999360864883
"Learning Regulatory Drivers of Chromatin and Expression Dynamics during Nuclear Reprogramming PROJECT SUMMARY The deluge of sequencing-based functional genomic data profiling the transcriptome, regulome and epigenome in hundreds of diverse cellular contexts has spurred the development of powerful computational methods to learn integrative models of gene regulation. However, models learned on data from static cellular contexts only reveal correlative regulatory relationships. There is a paucity of tractable model systems and experiments profiling dynamic cellular processes and a corresponding lack of computational methods that can learn putative causal mechanisms controlling the precise timing and temporal order of changes in genomic chromatin state and gene expression. Here, we propose novel machine learning methods to learn dynamic models of transcription regulation in the context of cellular reprogramming. In Aim 1, we propose deep learning frameworks with new interpretation engines that can integrate dynamic chromatin accessibility and gene expression data to reveal networks of cis regulatory elements, transcription factor binding complexes and cascades of trans-acting regulatory factors that control cell fate. In Aim2, we will apply our modeling framework to investigate early dynamics of nuclear reprogramming of human fibroblasts to pluripotency. We will leverage a powerful heterokaryon cell fusion model system to generate global chromatin and gene expression profiles over a two day timecourse. In Aim 3, we perform perturbation experiments using RNAi and CRISPR/Cas9 technologies to validate hypotheses generated by our models and test the effectiveness of predicted pluripotency factors and regulatory elements in inducing reprogramming. The validation experiments will be further used to iteratively refine the computational models. We will integrate the time-course data generated in our model system with data from large reference compendia of functional genomic data such as the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) and The Roadmap Epigenomics Project. Our analyses will reveal molecular mechanisms crucial to early and transient stages of nuclear reprogramming, providing novel contributions to our fundamental knowledge of regenerative medicine. Finally, the proposed end-to-end integrative framework is highly generalizable and will be of broad utility to learn dynamic models of transcriptional regulation from time-course datasets in other model systems. NARRATIVE Understanding how cells precisely control the timing and order of gene expression changes during dynamic cellular processes remains a challenge. Here, we propose the development of novel machine learning methods based on deep neural networks to decipher dynamic regulatory networks controlling cell fate decisions. We will generate genome-wide temporal profiles of chromatin state and gene expression during nuclear reprogramming, learn integrative models of dynamic gene regulation and perform experiments to validate biological hypotheses generated by the model.",Learning Regulatory Drivers of Chromatin and Expression Dynamics during Nuclear Reprogramming,9542357,R01HG009674,"['ATAC-seq', 'Back', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'Cell Differentiation process', 'Cell Fate Control', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cell fusion', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'ChIP-seq', 'Chromatin', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computing Methodologies', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Effectiveness', 'Encyclopedia of DNA Elements', 'Event', 'Expression Profiling', 'Fibroblasts', 'Frequencies', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Order', 'Gene Silencing', 'Gene Targeting', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genomics', 'Human', 'Knock-out', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Pattern', 'Pluripotent Stem Cells', 'RNA Interference', 'Regenerative Medicine', 'Regulatory Element', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Series', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Transcription Factor 3', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Validation', 'base', 'c-myc Genes', 'combinatorial', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'embryonic stem cell', 'epigenome', 'epigenomics', 'experimental study', 'feeding', 'functional genomics', 'genetic regulatory protein', 'genome editing', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'heterokaryon', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'loss of function', 'novel', 'nuclear reprogramming', 'pluripotency', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NHGRI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,702694,0.041524057158647994
"Signals of Epigenetic Modification in Sjogrens Syndrome ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The objective of the project is to characterize the potential role of DNA methylation patterns in Sjögren's Syndrome (SS) disease etiology and mechanism. A growing body of evidence indicates that epigenetic changes, in particular, altered patterns of DNA methylation, contribute to the development of autoimmune disease and can mediate genetic risk factors. To date, aberrant DNA methylation has been associated with several human autoimmune diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus. My proposal focuses on the identification of unique epigenetic profiles in SS, focusing primarily on T cells, B cells, and salivary gland tissue, a primary site of the inflammatory disease. An understanding of these profiles in the context of genetic background, publicly available genomic data (RNA, ChIP-seq, WGBS) and annotation data (TF binding motifs, genomic QTLs), and cell types have the potential to significantly transform our understanding of SS etiology, particularly given the well-established heterogeneity in clinical manifestations. Further, these DNA methylation profiles could become useful clinical biomarkers for determining risk and prognosis in SS, especially if their biological relevance can be validated in future functional studies. The overall hypothesis of this project is that DNA methylation changes in key genomic regions are associated with SS status and phenotype. The project will use genome-wide SNP data, epigenome-wide methylation array data, and clinical characteristics abstracted from 100 SS cases and 20 controls to address 3 related hypotheses: First, that epigenome-wide DNA methylation patterns in T cells, B cells (both derived from peripheral blood), and salivary gland biopsy tissue are associated with primary SS status after correcting for cell-type heterogeneity. Case-control differences will be tested using supervised machine learning algorithms, new region-discovery methods, and cell-mixture inference techniques. Publicly available data (listed above) will be used to infer biological relevance. Second, that epigenome-wide DNA methylation patterns in these samples are representative of SS sub-phenotypes. Cases (and initially controls) will be clustered using principal component analysis (PCA) applied to all relevant DNA methylation probes and subsets of probes measuring CpGs implicated in specific pathways relevant to SS. The reduced representations will be tested for association with specific clinical and serological profiles. Third, that risk alleles identifie by genome-wide association studies (GWAS) are directly or indirectly associated with SS-specific DNA methylation patterns. Allelic dosage and random forest selection frequency (RFSF) analyses will be used to identify novel methylation quantitative trait loci within SS-associated genes in cases and controls (separately), and we will test whether cell-proportion or eQTLs can explain SS-specific methylation patterns. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Sjögren's Syndrome is a chronic, highly heterogenous, multisystem autoimmune disease predominantly affecting women. This disease is known to be associated with epigenetic changes, including DNA methylation, an axis of epigenetic variation that has been implicated as a mediator of disease risk in other autoimmune diseases. Full characterization of DNA methylation patterns across different cell types and affected tissues will provide new insights into disease etiology, phenotype classification, and targets for future therapeutic strategies.",Signals of Epigenetic Modification in Sjogrens Syndrome,9458167,F31DE025176,"['Aberrant DNA Methylation', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Autoimmunity', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biopsy', 'Carbon', 'Cells', 'ChIP-seq', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Country', 'CpG dinucleotide', 'Cytosine', 'DNA', 'DNA Methylation', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Enrollment', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Etiology', 'European', 'Exhibits', 'Fellowship', 'Female', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Code', 'Genomic Segment', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Individual National Research Service Award', 'Inflammatory', 'International', 'Labial Salivary Gland', 'Lasso', 'Link', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'Modification', 'Not Hispanic or Latino', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Population', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'RNA', 'Resources', 'Rheumatoid Arthritis', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Salivary Gland Tissue', 'Salivary Glands', 'Sampling', 'Serological', 'Severity of illness', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Sjogren&apos', 's Syndrome', 'Subgroup', 'Supervision', 'Systemic Lupus Erythematosus', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissues', 'Trans-Activators', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Woman', 'Work', 'base', 'bead chip', 'case control', 'cell type', 'chromatin remodeling', 'clinical biomarkers', 'disease heterogeneity', 'disease phenotype', 'disorder risk', 'dosage', 'epigenetic variation', 'epigenome', 'epigenome-wide association studies', 'forest', 'genetic risk factor', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'high throughput technology', 'histone modification', 'insight', 'methylation pattern', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'peripheral blood', 'pre-doctoral', 'public health relevance', 'recruit', 'risk variant', 'transcription factor', 'whole genome']",NIDCR,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,F31,2018,21727,0.10505264926538953
"FASEB SRC on Transcription, Chromatin, & Epigenetics Summary The goal of this meeting is to cover the regulation and role of epigenetic mechanisms at the nexus between aging and cancer. Epigenetic mechanisms encompass post-translational modifications of chromatin and RNA as well as transcriptional regulation. This FASEB meeting will be unique in integrating the latest discoveries in epigenetics and their importance in aging and cancer. Indeed, exciting recent studies have revealed how organismal aging can be regulated by epigenetic mechanisms. As age is one of the largest risk factors for cancer, epigenetic dysfunction could provide a long sought after link between aging and cancer. There is a vital need for such a meeting. The field of epigenetic is rapidly expanding, and the aging and cancer fields need to benefit from the latest and greatest discoveries in this area. Conversely, challenges and questions about the role of epigenetics in aging and cancer abound, and it is critical for researchers in the chromatin and transcription fields to better grasp the implications of their work for health and disease. This FASEB meeting will discuss the most cutting-edge questions in field of chromatin, transcription, and epigenetics. A key topic will be the underlying molecular basis of epigenetic mechanisms. The question of how these mechanisms get dysregulated during disease or normal aging will also be discussed. The meeting will also cover new frontiers, including the contribution of non-coding RNA to epigenetic mechanisms and the exciting emerging field of RNA epigenetic. The meeting will particularly focus on transformative epigenomic technologies and machine learning approaches and how they can be used to interrogate changes in epigenetic landscapes in cells from individuals at different ages or in different types of cancers. This meeting should foster new fundamental knowledge and information, new methodology and technical capabilities, and interdisciplinary collaborations. The meeting will also provide a uniquely interactive forum for trainees and new investigators, highlighting their research through short talks, poster teasers and sessions and promoting several networking and meet-the-expert events. ! !

"Inferring gene regulatory circuitry from functional genomics data PROJECT SUMMARY It has long been known that methylation of genomic DNA correlates with gene expression. However, the structural mechanisms that underlie these observations remain obscure. In this project, we will pursue several innovative strategies for studying how methylation affects transcription factor (TF) binding. First, we will use Methyl-SELEX-seq – a novel experimental method developed in the previous cycle of this grant that uses barcoded mixtures of methylated and unmethylated DNA ligands – to create detailed maps of the effect of methylation on binding affinity for a broad panel of human transcription factors from various structural families. Second, we will perform detailed computational analyses and follow-up experiments to test the hypothesis that methylation causes local changes in DNA shape, which in turn modify TF binding affinity. We have shown that adding a methyl group in the major groove changes the geometry of the minor groove and enhances the electrostatic interaction between negative charges in the DNA minor groove and positively charged amino- acids in the TF. We will extend these analyses to other DNA modifications, as well as a wider range of DNA shape parameters and associated flexibility parameters. By building interpretable TF-DNA recognition models that integrate base, shape, and flexibility features using a powerful new machine learning framework developed in the previous funding cycle, we will make specific predictions regarding sequence and methylation readout mechanisms, and validate these using SELEX experiments with mutated TFs. To assess to what extent our quantitative models for binding to naked DNA built from SELEX data are predictive of binding to genomic DNA in the context of the living cell, we will perform detailed parallel analyses of SELEX and ChIP- seq data for Hox proteins and other TFs. Finally, to study the relationship between DNA binding and gene expression control in human cell lines, we will exploit Survey of Regulatory Elements (SuRE-seq), a novel massively parallel reporter assay that provides unique information about the autonomous transcriptional activity for each of >108 overlapping genomic fragments. PROJECT NARRATIVE Epigenetic modifications of the human genome are known to play a key role in development and disease, but the underlying molecular mechanisms are largely unknown. The main goal of this proposal is to develop and apply new experimental and computational tools for analyzing how the binding of regulatory proteins to DNA is influenced by cytosine methylation.

"Statistical modeling of long-range chromatin interactions on gene regulation and underlying molecular Disease-associated genetic variants have been found to be enriched in regulatory genomic regions of gene expression. In order to gain detailed understanding of disease mechanisms, one central question is to systematically delineate how tissue-specific gene expression programs are regulated. Enhancers are a major family of regulatory elements with complex signatures and they are abundant in the human genome. Enhancer regulation of gene expression is highly tissue-specific, associated with combinatorial transcription factor binding, and involved with long-range three-dimensional chromatin interactions. It is therefore challenging to characterize the large-scale enhancer regulatory networks. The primary goal of this project is to develop a suite of probabilistic models and efficient machine learning algorithms to predict genome-wide enhancer regulatory networks in diverse panels of cellular contexts and the associated molecular mechanisms to establish long-range interactions, which will be leveraged to interpret disease-associated genetic variants. In Aim 1, novel integrative graphical models will be developed to predict long-range chromatin interactions linking tissue-specific enhancers to their distal target genes, along with combinatorial transcription factor binding patterns. In Aim 2, computational algorithms will be designed to interrogate how specific chromatin interactions are established, leading to mechanistic insights on chromatin formation. In Aim 3, statistical models will be developed to integrate enhancer-gene regulatory networks with genetics data to predict which non-coding variants may disrupt regulatory links and cause diseases, with improved statistical power and accuracy. This modeling framework will substantially expand the analytical ability on non-coding variants and human disease mechanisms. Computational predictions from the three aims will be experimentally tested in mouse models of breast cancer development. This project will lead to both innovative computational tools and systematic biological insights on long-range enhancer regulation and their functional roles in human diseases. The advanced statistical models and machine learning algorithms will provide efficient big-data integration tools for epigenetics, gene regulation and human genetics. Comprehensive predictions from this project represent valuable platforms to delineate genetic variants and disease mechanisms. Novel mechanistic insights of diseases at the regulatory and molecular level will facilitate improved diagnostic and therapeutic approaches for human diseases.",Statistical modeling of long-range chromatin interactions on gene regulation and underlying molecular,9672649,R01GM131398,"['Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Big Data', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Breast Cancer Model', 'Chromatin', 'Chromatin Structure', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Distal', 'Drug Targeting', 'Elements', 'Enhancers', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Family', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Structure', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomic Segment', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Human Genetics', 'Human Genome', 'Joints', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Network-based', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Regulation', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Statistical Models', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissue-Specific Gene Expression', 'Tissues', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'base', 'cell type', 'combinatorial', 'computerized tools', 'data integration', 'design', 'experimental study', 'functional genomics', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic information', 'genetic variant', 'genome-wide', 'human disease', 'human tissue', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'mouse model', 'novel', 'programs', 'protein protein interaction', 'tissue resource', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'transcription factor USF']",NIGMS,MICHIGAN STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,325001,0.038676218250379917
"Defining interaction quantitative trait loci (iQTLs) in the human genome Abstract My research aims to understand the role of three-dimensional (3D) chromatin structure in gene regulation. This involves studying associations among genotype, histone modifications, transcription factor binding, non-coding RNAs, chromatin interactions and gene expression. In order to transform this genome-wide information into new biological discoveries, my laboratory develops scalable and interpretable computational methods based on statistics, graph theory and machine learning. Our recent focus is to address an important gap in the current knowledge of the role of 3D chromatin structure in gene regulation. That is, we aim to define how genotypic variation affects 3D organization of gene promoters, and in turn, their expression. To achieve this at a genome- wide scale is an ambitious goal, because it requires having at a minimum, genotype, gene expression and chromatin interaction profiles in pure populations of specific cell types from a large number of donors. However, my laboratory is uniquely positioned to perform this research because: i) we are involved in a study at the La Jolla Institute (LJI-R24AI108564) that has already genotyped ~100 donors and expression-profiled more than 15 different pure populations of human immune cell types, and we have access to the same samples for chromatin interaction mapping, ii) in collaboration with other groups at LJI, we have already discovered a prototypical example of an interaction quantitative trait locus (iQTL) that alters and rewires interactions from the promoter of a specific gene that is associated with asthma susceptibility, iii) we have the necessary expertise and proven track record in experimental design and computational analyses of various chromatin conformation capture assays. Leveraging the resources available at LJI and our expertise in the field, we will build a unique research program around the novel concept of iQTLs. The emerging set of three main questions we propose to address within the next five years are: Q1) How do we define cell-type-specific iQTLs for common genetic variants? Q2) What is the extent of overlap between iQTLs and GWAS SNPs? Q3) Can we build predictive models for the cell-type specificity of chromatin interactions and iQTLs? Although we propose to define iQTLs only in two abundant, easily accessible, and highly disease-relevant immune cell types, the concept of iQTLs is equally important in other cell types implicated in diseases with a genetic component. Hence, the proof-of-concept developed by this work, without a doubt, will open up a new field in studying a previously uncharacterized role for disease-susceptibility variants, specifically non-coding SNPs, from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) in gene regulation. Narrative Recent discoveries that allow us to look beyond the one-dimensional sequence of DNA and understand the large-scale organization principals of its three-dimensional folding have been limited when it comes to characterizing the role of fine-scale genetic variations of the DNA code in controlling important cellular processes such as gene expression. This work will employ state-of-the-art molecular biology techniques and develop novel computational methods to define the role of such genetic variants in changing three-dimensional connections made by the promoters of genes in the human genome. This systematic and unbiased genome- wide study will have important implications in changing the way we study the disease relevance of genetic variation by revealing genotype dependence of long-range chromatin interactions between genes and their distal control switches at a scale that has not been achieved to date.",Defining interaction quantitative trait loci (iQTLs) in the human genome,9576241,R35GM128938,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Asthma', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Cell physiology', 'Chromatin', 'Chromatin Structure', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computing Methodologies', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence', 'Dependence', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease susceptibility', 'Distal', 'Experimental Designs', 'Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Structure', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Immune', 'Institutes', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Molecular Biology Techniques', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predisposition', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Specificity', 'Susceptibility Gene', 'Uncertainty', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'cell type', 'chromosome conformation capture', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'genome-wide analysis', 'graph theory', 'histone modification', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'promoter', 'statistics', 'transcription factor']",NIGMS,LA JOLLA INSTITUTE FOR IMMUNOLOGY,R35,2018,449829,0.046486736111895965
"Methods for analysis of regulatory variation in cellular differentiation One of the key challenges in human genomics currently is to dissect the impact of sequence variation on gene regulation. Characterizing the functional consequences of regulatory variation would lead to a greater understanding of evolutionary constraint on gene expression, improved interpretation of whole genome sequencing, and a more complete picture of the genetic architecture of complex disease. However, interpreting non-coding genetic variation remains difficult, particularly due to the complexity of gene regulation, which is highly specific to cell-type and environmental context. Understanding how disease-associated genetic variation impacts human tissues requires that we identify mechanisms behind cell-type-specific regulatory variation. In order to address these important goals, we propose to create a resource in which we can directly assay a range of regulatory phenotypes in multiple cell-types. We propose to establish a panel of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from 70 individuals and collect genomic data from iPSCs and differentiated cells. This empirical effort will be complemented by formulating a novel statistical methodology to integrate data across different assays, cell-types, time points, and individuals; to robustly identify regulatory networks and genetic variants that affect gene regulation in each context. Together, these contributions will provide a basis for ongoing study of gene regulation and sequence variation in multiple disease-relevant cell types using a renewable model system and novel methods for robust analysis of these data. In Aim 1, we propose to develop the resource of 70 iPSC lines, where we will collect extensive molecular regulatory phenotypes at multiple time points throughout differentiation to three cell types (cardiomyocytes, neurons and hepatocytes). Measuring gene expression, chromatin accessibility, and methylation in each sample throughout differentiation, we will provide a detailed picture of the cascade of regulatory influences active in each cell type and during development. In Aim 2, we propose to develop a novel statistical framework for inferring universal and cell- type-specific regulatory factors from multi-dimensional data spanning cell-types, individuals, phenotypes, and time points. We specify a machine learning method based on Bayesian hierarchical transfer learning that provides dramatically increased power to detect shared effects while explicitly identifying context-specific regulatory changes. This approach will be adopted to infer regulatory networks, identify key regulatory sequence elements, and map QTLs in each phenotype and cell type. In Aim 3, we will utilize the empirical data and novel methods to infer regulatory relationships and mechanisms underlying genetic variants associated with gene expression in primary tissue and with disease. We will do this by performing a careful integration of external association studies. All samples, cell lines, data, computational tools, and analytical results will be made freely available to the community. We expect our project will greatly advance the understanding of gene regulation, the consequences of genetic variation in diverse cell-types, and the genetic basis of disease. Project narrative: Understanding the impact of individual genetic variation on diverse tissues and cell types in the human body is essential to dissecting the genetics of complex human diseases. Here, we gather data from multiple cell types derived from induced pluripotent stem cells, and develop a novel statistical framework for integrative analysis of data across individuals, cell types, and time points. Our approach provides a transformative approach for understanding gene regulation and the effects of genetic variation on individual health.  ",Methods for analysis of regulatory variation in cellular differentiation,9552890,R01GM120167,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Affect', 'Behavior', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Models', 'Cardiac Myocytes', 'Cell Differentiation process', 'Cell Line', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Ectoderm', 'Elements', 'Endoderm', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genomics', 'Germ Layers', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hepatocyte', 'Hour', 'Human Genetics', 'Human body', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mesoderm', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Neurons', 'Outcome', 'Phenotype', 'Process', 'Psychological Transfer', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Regulatory Element', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Specificity', 'Statistical Methods', 'Supporting Cell', 'System', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'base', 'cell type', 'computerized tools', 'data resource', 'genetic architecture', 'genetic variant', 'genome sequencing', 'genomic data', 'histone modification', 'human disease', 'human genomics', 'human tissue', 'improved', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'learning network', 'learning strategy', 'novel', 'phenotypic data', 'pluripotency', 'programs', 'statistics', 'stem cell differentiation', 'trait', 'transcriptomics', 'whole genome']",NIGMS,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,543228,0.0335953929040637
"ImmGen: Gene Expression and Regulation in Immune Cells The Immunological Genome Project (ImmGen) is a collaborative group of 15 Immunology and Computational Biology laboratories who perform, under standardized conditions, a thorough dissection of gene expression and its regulation in the mouse immune system. We also investigated how these respond to cytokines and immunologic challenges, how immune gene expression relates to chromatin configuration, and used cutting-edge computational algorithms to deduce regulatory connections. ImmGen data are publicly available on dedicated web and smartphone supports, using interactive graphic displays that make the results intuitive to users. These are now frequently used by the Immunology research community. The proposed continuation will harness the collective expertise of the ImmGen group to further develop this important public resource. (1) Expand and deepen the compendium, applying single-cell RNAseq to define very broadly the cast of cell-types at play in the immune system, their trajectories of differentiation, and their adaptation to specific organismal locations This effort will be complemented by deeper bulk profiling of cell-types thus identified. We will expand the analysis of cytokine signatures, continue to chart non-coding RNA (circRNAs), and persue the “OpenSource” program of coordinated sample contributions from the community. (2) Mechanistic Dissection of Immunogenomic Regulatory Networks focusing on a Core Set of 14 cell-types that represent all the major immunological lineages. We will generate high-resolution maps of transcription factor footprints by ultra-deep ATACseq; map 3D architectures by HiC chromosome conformation capture; apply ChIPseq to define enhancers and super-enhancers, chromatin modification domains and structural anchors; use machine learning approaches to integrate these complementary data into a comprehensive regulatory plan which spans from fine TF footprints to topologically associated domaiins; validate these inferences by collaborating with the KOMP project to analyze Core Set transcriptomes and chromatin configuration in mice with mutations in transcription factors that determine functionally relevant facets of immunocyte activity. (3): Public Display. ImmGen data have become a widely used resource in Immunology research, which will be maintained and curated. For scalability, cost-effectiveness, and to enable facile computation, we will develop and deploy cloud-based data storage and access solutions, compliant with NIH Commons guidelines. We will add to the existing databrowsers to allow users to query different facets of the expanding data (differential expression, regulatory network, chromatin states and architecture, cytokine signatures), increasing connectivity to other data sources. We will continue developing the popular mobile app, and explore the particular uses of that medium.

"Deconvolution of Epigenomic Data to Characterize Cellular Subpopulations Abstract With the advent of new DNA sequencing technologies, genomic data has moved to the forefront in the quest for individualized medicine. However, the lack of new computational tools to interpret and exploit the deluge of genomic data has severely hampered its clinical benefit. A further complication is that clinical genomic data is often obtained from tissues containing a mixture of different cell types. For example, tumor samples are a mixture of tumor subclones and normal cell lineages. As a platform for understanding this heterogeneity in tumor cell populations, our studies will focus on DNA methylation changes in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), the most prevalent, aggressive form of Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (NHL). DNA methylation is cell type- specific, likely contributes to the phenotypic variation in tumor subclones, and plays key roles in gene regulation and lymphoma pathogenesis. Defining the methylation and transcriptional profiles of tumor subclones is necessary to identify potential drug targets, predict disease progression, and identify overall prognosis. Further, current computational approaches to understand epigenetic heterogeneity are not well- suited for tumor analysis and do not link epigenetic changes to expression. Here, we propose to develop a new computational approach that uses genomic methylation data from bulk samples to define DNA methylation- and expression-based subclonal populations and relate these populations to disease progression. Our approach exploits the fact that methylation levels are an accurate measure of the underlying distribution of allelic methylation states in the tumor (e.g. 30% methylation means 30% of the alleles are methylated). Our approach takes genome-wide methylation data as input, and outputs the number of subpopulations, their respective proportions, and each underlying subpopulation’s DNA methylation profile. After deconvolution, we will extend our previous work showing that DNA methylation profiles are predictive of expression levels, and apply tools from machine learning to estimate the relative expression profiles in each subpopulation. This approach will allow us to take advantage of the vast amount of data currently being collected in large-scale sequencing projects and obtain genome-wide methylation information from cellular subpopulations even when surface markers cannot be used to physically separate the different subpopulations. Lastly, we will assess the clinical relevance of these approaches by using them to understand the molecular changes found in tumor subpopulations from samples of relapsed DLBCL. We envision these methods can be applied as investigative tools first, and later as cost-effective clinical tools, to analyze the epigenetic and transcriptomic heterogeneity in different tumor types and diseased tissues. Public Narrative Tumors, including B-cell lymphomas, are comprised of heterogeneous populations of cells. Decoding the regulatory circuitry in these sub-populations is critical to understanding tumor metastasis, therapy resistance and relapse. We propose to develop a new computational approach to use genome-wide measurements of DNA methylation in primary tumors to understand the regulatory landscape of these subpopulations. All software will be made publically available to broadly advance cancer-research nationwide.

"A Technique for Measuring Transcription Factor Activity Summary  Almost every division of NIH has invested heavily in understanding transcription factors (TFs). TFs are the managers of the cell, controlling everything from cell type to cellular response to stress. With their great power, it is no wonder, many human disorders (cancer, familial platelet disorder, Waardenburg syndrome, etc.) result from mutations in transcription factors. Moreover, over 75% of disease causing variants within the human genome reside in regulatory regions, which are dense with TF binding sites. Currently we can measure the location of TF binding, but binding does not equate with regulatory activity. Furthermore, binding analysis is conducted one TF at a time. What is desperately needed is a technology that is able to measure the activity of all TFs in a cell simultaneously. We have developed a novel approach, called eRNA proﬁling, that leverages enhancer RNAs to infer the activity of all TFs in a cell simultaneously. In this grant we seek to optimize our technology, making eRNA proﬁling more accurate, fast and broadly applicable. Narrative  Transcription factors are important in many human diseases.

"Epigenetic Transgenerational Endocrine Disruptor Actions DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A number of environmental toxicants were shown in the previous grant period to promote the epigenetic transgenerational inheritance of adult onset disease including the fungicide vinclozolin, pesticides, plastics (BPA and phthalates), dioxin, hydrocarbons, and DDT. The ability of environmental compounds (e.g. endocrine disruptors) to promote transgenerational disease phenotypes is anticipated to be a critical aspect of adult onset disease etiology. The transgenerational inheritance phenotype requires the heritable epigenetic alterations of the germline. The current proposal is designed to further investigate the molecular and developmental aspects of the epigenetic transgenerational inheritance phenomenon and assess the potential use of epigenetic biomarkers for exposure and disease. The general hypothesis tested is that ""transient fetal exposure around the period of gonadal sex determination to environmental toxicants (i.e. vinclozolin) promotes the reprogramming of the epigenome (i.e. DNA methylation) of the male germline that then transmits an imprinted-like epigenome to subsequent generations to induce the epigenetic transgenerational inheritance of adult onset disease (e.g. male infertility)"". The previous grant period focused on the analysis of the epigenetic alteration in the F3 generation sperm using promoter associated differential DNA methylation regions (epimutations), as well as documented the epigenetic and transcriptome changes in the F3 generation vinclozolin lineage primordial germ cells. The molecular etiology of somatic cell changes associated with ovary and testis disease was established. The current proposal further investigates the molecular and developmental aspects of the germline mediated epigenetic transgenerational inheritance of disease. The experimental approach to test the above hypothesis consists of the following specific aims: Aim 1) Determine the developmental and generational aspects of the genome-wide germline epimutations. Aim 2) Determine the genomic features associated with the epimutations and potential genetic alterations involved in the epigenetic transgenerational inheritance phenomenon. Aim 3) Determine the optimal exposure parameters of the environmental induced transgenerational model and correlate epigenetic biomarkers with exposure and disease. Completion of the proposed research will determine the cascade of epigenetic events involved in germ cell development that generates the sperm epimutations that transmit the epigenetic transgenerational inheritance of disease phenotypes. The protection of the sperm epimutations from DNA methylation erasure is anticipated in early embryonic development. The proposed research will further elucidate the molecular and developmental aspects of environmentally induced epigenetic transgenerational inheritance of disease and the potential use of epigenetic biomarkers for ancestral exposure and disease.

"Surveying transcription factor pioneer interactions with nucleosomal DNA Numerous studies have focused on cataloging the genome `parts list', including transcripts, transcription factor (TF) binding sites, and chromatin states. Transcriptional regulatory networks have been inferred based on these data, leading to models of what TFs are master regulators at or near the top of the regulatory hierarchy versus lineage- or condition-specific TFs, which are downstream of those regulators. However, none of these approaches directly identifies which factors engage inaccessible chromatin to initiate the transcriptional regulatory cascades. Pioneer factors serve as keys to chromatin accessibility for binding by the majority of TFs in a cell, by binding stably to nucleosomal DNA (`pioneer binding') and thus increase the DNA enzymatic accessibility of the chromatin (`pioneer activity'), allowing the sequential recruitment of other TFs on inactive chromatin. By priming cis regulatory elements for subsequent transcriptional regulatory activity, pioneer factors serve as `gatekeepers' to cellular differentiation. Despite their importance, little is known about pioneer factors, and only a handful have been characterized. A major hurdle in characterization of pioneer factors is the lack of a robust, high- throughput functional assay. In this project, we will develop a new technology, termed Pioneer Interactions On Nucleosomal Engineered ARrays (PIONEAR), for high-throughput characterization of pioneer binding. We will use PIONEAR assays to survey the pioneer interactions of dozens of human TFs. TFs identified by PIONEAR assays to exhibit pioneer binding will be evaluated in vivo to examine chromatin decompaction on a broader scale. Identification of TFs that exhibit pioneer activity may lead to breakthroughs in directed cellular differentiation and reprogramming and the development of improved therapies to target cancer stem cells. Control of cell states, such as in maintenance of pluripotency by stem cells or differentiation into defined cell lineages, holds promise for regenerative medicine and cancer therapeutics. These cell fate programs are initiated by `pioneer factors' that recognize their genomic target sites and induce hierarchies of gene regulatory programs. We will identify human pioneer factors and characterize their regulatory interactions.",Surveying transcription factor pioneer interactions with nucleosomal DNA,9550852,R21HG009268,"['Affect', 'Area', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Binding Sites', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Assay', 'Cataloging', 'Catalogs', 'Cell Lineage', 'Cells', 'ChIP-seq', 'Chromatin', 'DNA', 'DNA Modification Process', 'DNase-I Footprinting', 'Data', 'Deoxyribonuclease I', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Developmental Process', 'Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay', 'Engineering', 'Exhibits', 'Future', 'Gatekeeping', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Human', 'Hypersensitivity', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Modeling', 'Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'Nucleosomes', 'Property', 'Regenerative Medicine', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Reporting', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Site', 'Stem cells', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Transcript', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'base', 'cancer stem cell', 'cell type', 'ds-DNA', 'genome-wide', 'high throughput technology', 'histone modification', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'new technology', 'novel', 'pluripotency', 'programs', 'recruit', 'technology development', 'transcription factor']",NHGRI,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R21,2018,266250,0.07987861208260373
"Visualization, modeling and validation of chromatin interaction data The three dimensional (3D) organization of mammalian genomes is tightly linked to gene regulation, as it can reveal the physical interactions between distal regulatory elements and their target genes. Several recent high- throughput technologies based on Chromatin Conformation Capture (3C) have emerged (such as 4C, 5C, Hi-C and ChIA-PET) and given us an unprecedented opportunity to study the higher-order genome organization. Among them, Hi-C technology is of particular interest due to its unbiased genome-wide coverage that can measure chromatin interaction intensities between any two given genomic loci. However, Hi-C data analysis and interpretation are still in the early stages. One of the main challenges is how to efficiently visualize chromatin interaction data, so that the scientific community to visualize and use it for their own research. In addition, due to the complex experimental procedure and high sequencing cost, Hi-C has only been performed in a limited number of cell/tissue types. Finally, the underlying mechanism of chromatin interactions remains largely unclear. Therefore, the PI will propose the following aims: Aim 1. Build an interactive and customizable 3D genome browser. We will build an interactive and customizable 3D browser, which allows users to navigate Hi-C data and other high-throughput chromatin organization data, including ChIA-PET and Capture Hi-C. We have built a prototype of the 3D genome browser (www.3dgenome.org). Our browser will allow users to conveniently browse chromatin interaction data with other data types (such as ChIP-Seq and RNA-Seq) from the genomic region in the same window simultaneously. Our system will also empower the users to create their own session and query their own Hi-C and other epigenomic data. Aim 2. Impute chromatin interaction using other genomic/epigenomic information. We will predict Hi-C interaction frequencies using other available genomic and epigenomic data in the same cell type, such as ChIP-Seq data for histone modifications and transcription factors. We will build our prediction model and then systematically impute Hi-C interaction matrices for all 127 cell types whose epigenomes are available thanks to recent effort by the ENCODE and Roadmap Epigenome projects. Aim 3. Perform validation experiments for computational method in aim 1 and 2. We will perform 20 3C experiments in hESC and GM cell lines, coupled with genome engineering by CRISPR/Cas9, to evaluate Hi-C prediction method in aim 2. The three dimensional (3D) organization of mammalian genomes is tightly linked to gene regulation, as it can reveal the physical interactions between distal regulatory elements and their target genes. Although several recent high-throughput technologies including Hi-C have emerged and given us an unprecedented opportunity to study 3D chromatin interaction in high resolution, its analysis and interpretation are still in the early stages. Here we propose to develop a suite of statistical modeling and computational methods to model and validate chromatin interaction using other genomic/epigenomics data, and build an interactive and customizable 3D genome browser.","Visualization, modeling and validation of chromatin interaction data",9425925,R01HG009906,"['Address', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'Cell Count', 'Cell Line', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'ChIP-seq', 'Chromatin', 'Chromatin Interaction Analysis by Paired-End Tag Sequencing', 'Chromatin Remodeling Factor', 'Chromosome Territory', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Country', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Dimensions', 'Distal', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Frequencies', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genome engineering', 'Genomic Segment', 'Genomics', 'Imagery', 'Intuition', 'Knock-out', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Procedures', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Tissues', 'Validation', 'Visit', 'base', 'cell type', 'chromosome conformation capture', 'cost', 'epigenome', 'epigenomics', 'experimental study', 'forest', 'genome annotation', 'genome browser', 'genome-wide', 'high throughput technology', 'histone modification', 'human embryonic stem cell', 'interest', 'mammalian genome', 'performance tests', 'predictive modeling', 'prototype', 'repository', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'web site']",NHGRI,PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIV HERSHEY MED CTR,R01,2018,383250,0.048790236961841045
"Enhancer-mediated mechanisms of pattern formation ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Gene regulatory networks establish the body plans of complex multicellular animals. The main components of these networks are transcription factors and cis-regulatory elements (CREs) that contain unique combinations of transcription factor binding sites. Transgenic experiments have shown that CREs control spatial and temporal patterns of gene expression, but how binding events at the CRE level are converted into these patterns is still poorly understood. In humans, mutations that disrupt transcription factor activit or CRE DNA sequences can cause birth defects and disease states, including cancer. Here we propose to study CRE- mediated embryo patterning in the early Drosophila embryo, with a specific focus on CREs that respond to the maternal transcription factor Bicoid (Bcd). In previous work, we identified 66 Bcd-dependent CREs, which were validated by reporter genes in transgenic embryos. All 66 are directly activated by Bcd, but each contains a unique set of transcription factor-binding sites, and drives an expression pattern that appears as a band(s) or stripe(s) at a specific position(s) along the anterior-posterior (AP) axis. Expression pattern boundaries represent positions where genes make on/off decisions, and foreshadow boundaries between cells of different fates later in development. The work proposed here will focus on two major goals. First, we want to perform a deep, quantitative analysis of transcriptional activation by a single ""model"" CRE (hunchback P2E) that is activated by BCD. Two specific questions will be addressed: 1. how do individual binding sites, groups of binding sites, and combinations of sites for different factors contribute to transcriptional activation? We will combine DNA-binding data of different types to better define functional motifs, extensively mutate the CRE, and assay three specific output parameters using live imaging in close collaboration with Thomas Gregor's lab. 2. How does this Bcd-dependent CRE ""choose"" its specific basal promoter? We will use a split reporter system and single molecule FISH to identify basal promoter sequences that allow or prevent activation by Bcd, and CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing to test the importance of promoter choice in vivo. The second major goal will be to gain a conceptually complete understanding of the regulatory network that creates Bcd-dependent gene expression patterns. We have identified three proteins that function in broad activation, and nine candidate repressors expressed in discrete domains that together cover the entire embryonic region where activation can occur. We will use reporter gene manipulations and single molecule FISH to test how repressor gradients shape boundaries of gene expression, and genetics and reporter genes to test the roles of several newly identified repressors that prevent activation in anterior regions. Our hypothesis is that the expression patterns driven by all Bcd-dependent CREs are ""computed"" by specific combinations of binding sites for these twelve factors. These experiments will make significant contributions to our general understanding of how CREs functions in activation and repression events, and how embryos establish body plans. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Animal body plans are established by hundreds of DNA-binding factors that bind thousands of cis-regulatory elements (CREs). Our goals are to carry out the deepest analysis of gene activation by a single CRE in higher eukaryotes, and to understand how multiple CREs integrates activation and repression to pattern the embryo.",Enhancer-mediated mechanisms of pattern formation,9450518,R01GM051946,"['Address', 'Affinity', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Anterior', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Models', 'Body Patterning', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Collaborations', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Congenital Abnormality', 'DNA Binding', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Defect', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Dissection', 'Drosophila genus', 'Elements', 'Embryo', 'Enhancers', 'Eukaryota', 'Event', 'Funding', 'Gene Activation', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Gene Order', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Homeodomain Proteins', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Length', 'Link', 'Logic', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Output', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Formation', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Proteins', 'RNA', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Reporter', 'Reporter Genes', 'Repression', 'Role', 'Shapes', 'Site', 'System', 'Tertiary Protein Structure', 'Testing', 'Transact', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Transgenic Organisms', 'Work', 'Zinc Fingers', 'bZIP Protein', 'base', 'cofactor', 'experimental study', 'fly', 'in vitro Assay', 'in vivo', 'loss of function mutation', 'morphogens', 'prevent', 'promoter', 'protein function', 'public health relevance', 'single molecule', 'transcription factor']",NIGMS,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,362333,0.03141999360864883
"Identification of epigenetic subclones in lymphomas and leukemias Abstract Epigenetic modifications, such as DNA methylation, play a significant role in human disease. DNA methylation is altered in cancer, and DNA methylation-induced silencing of promoters of tumor-suppressors is thought to play a key role in tumorigenesis. Though there is an increasing number of methylation sequencing datasets generated from cancer, they are confounded by tumor heterogeneity. Understanding the subclonal architecture underlying heterogeneity is important because individual cancer subclones impact cancer growth, treatment resistance, and metastasis. Increased “epigenetic heterogeneity,” or variation in DNA methylation patterns, was determined to be correlated with worse prognosis in patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). However, these studies only profiled epigenetic heterogeneity at a global scale and did not analyze methylation of individual subclones. Many computational methods have been developed for this purpose in epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS), but these methods are not applicable for methylation sequencing data. As such, there is a need to develop new computational methods to study subclonal methylation profiles in cancer. I will develop a novel computational method (DXM) that deconvolves DNA methylation of heterogeneous clinical samples into their major subpopulations, their prevalence, and their respective DNA methylation profiles (Aim 1). DXM will be developed on simulations generated from data available from both the Roadmap Epigenomics Project and the Blueprint Epigenome Project and will be validated with methylation sequencing on DLBCL samples. I will then leverage DXM to study subclonal methylation profiles in AML (Aim 2). I hypothesize that methylation can confer fitness advantages in epigenetic subclones of AML, leading to clonal expansion following therapeutic intervention and subsequent relapse. Using DXM, I will first identify epigenetic subclones from whole genome bisulfite sequencing data from AML patients with well-characterized genetic subclonal architecture and compare the epigenetic subclonal architecture to that of the genetic subclones. In a second dataset containing methylation sequencing data from paired diagnosis-relapse samples, I will apply DXM, identify subclonal methylation profiles, and characterize all genes impacted by subclonal methylation to determine if they are expected to confer fitness advantages. Finally, I will test if mutations known to impact DNA methylation in AML (DNMT3A, IDH1/2) alter epigenetic subclonal expansion. Taken together, this proposal will result in a new computational approach to interpret epigenetic data from heterogeneous clinical samples as well as identification of DNA methylation changes in epigenetic subclones of AML that contribute to disease progression and correlate with prognosis. Project Narrative Studies that characterize which variations in cancer relate to worse outcome may do analysis on the entire tumor sample, which is composed of many different types of cells, each with distinct biology. The goal of this proposal is to develop a novel computational method to analyze variations in cancer at the level of cell-types. These results can be used to improve patient prognostics and care in multiple cancers.",Identification of epigenetic subclones in lymphomas and leukemias,9611428,F30CA224687,"['Acute Myelocytic Leukemia', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Antibodies', 'Architecture', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Cancer Biology', 'Cancer Patient', 'Caring', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Clonal Expansion', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'CpG dinucleotide', 'DNA Methylation', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease Progression', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Fluorescence-Activated Cell Sorting', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genome', 'Genomic Imprinting', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Heterogeneity', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'Modification', 'Mutation', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Play', 'Prevalence', 'Relapse', 'Retrotransposon', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Surface', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Training', 'Tumor Promoters', 'Tumor Suppressor Genes', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins', 'United States', 'Variant', 'X Inactivation', 'anticancer research', 'bisulfite', 'bisulfite sequencing', 'career', 'cell type', 'clinical care', 'design', 'epigenome', 'epigenome-wide association studies', 'epigenomics', 'fitness', 'genome sequencing', 'human disease', 'improved', 'large cell Diffuse non-Hodgkin&apos', 's lymphoma', 'leukemia/lymphoma', 'methylation pattern', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'patient stratification', 'prognostic', 'promoter', 'simulation', 'single cell sequencing', 'statistics', 'therapy resistant', 'tumor', 'tumor heterogeneity', 'tumorigenesis', 'whole genome']",NCI,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,F30,2018,30434,0.08468715793253405
"Computational approaches for comparative regulatory genomics to decipher long-range gene regulation Project Abstract/Summary The three-dimensional organization of the genome is a major player in long-range gene regulation, where regulatory elements such as enhancers affect the expression of a gene hundreds of kilobases away. Changes in three-dimensional organization are associated with tissue-specific gene expression and have been implicated in several human diseases including cancer, diabetes and obesity. Advances in chromosome conformation capture (3C) technologies have expanded our repertoire of long-range interactions between enhancers and promoters in model cell lines and have shown that such interactions are established through a complex interplay of chromatin state, transcription factor binding and three-dimensional proximity of genomic regions. However, our current understanding of the dynamics of long-range gene regulation is limited, both across different cell types as well as across different species. This is because of the absence of such datasets in most species and cell types, lack of systematic methods to predict and interpret these interactions, and due to limited approaches to compare both the regions and their interactions across different cell types and especially across species. The overarching goals of this proposal are to develop novel computational methods to jointly identify candidate regulatory elements in multiple species and predict their long- range interactions in new cell types and species where high-throughput 3C datasets are not available or difficult to obtain. In Aim 1, we will develop a phylogenetically aware method of jointly identifying regulatory elements such as enhancers in multiple species. Aim 2 will develop multi-task and transfer learning approaches to predict interactions in new species and cell types by integrating available high-throughput 3C datasets from multiple cell types and 3C platforms. In Aim 3, we will collect a novel multi-species chromatin mark dataset in species-specific endothelial cells to enable a systematic study of long-range gene regulation dynamics. We will apply our computational approaches developed in Aims 1 and 2 on this multi-species epigenomic dataset to identify different regulatory elements and predict long-range interactions in multiple species. We will develop rigorous computational measures to evaluate the quality of predictions from our novel methods and the improvements compared to existing methods based on published 3C datasets. We will further experimentally validate predicted interactions using Capture-HiC in multiple species and using CRISPR/Cas9 experiments. We will examine individual and groups of interactions to identify species-specific, and clade- specific interactions and interpret the corresponding genes in the context of known pathways and curated gene sets associated with cardiovascular diseases. Our methods will be widely applicable to dissect long-range gene regulation in complex phenotypes including diseases. Software tools, resources, original data and experimental protocols developed by this project will be made publicly available. Project Narrative Long-range gene regulatory interactions are emerging as important determinants of tissue-specific gene expression and are often disrupted in different diseases including cancer. Such interactions occur between distally located regulatory sequence elements and genes hundreds of kilobases away. Currently our understanding of long-range gene regulation is limited to a few cell types and model organisms. Computational methods to identify regulatory elements and systematically link them to target genes in diverse cell types and mammalian species can significantly improve our understanding of the impact of long-range gene regulation in human diseases, help interpret regulatory variation in non-coding parts of the genome and assist in the development of better biomarkers.",Computational approaches for comparative regulatory genomics to decipher long-range gene regulation,9500095,R01HG010045,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Animal Model', 'Awareness', 'Basic Science', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cell Count', 'Cell Line', 'Cell model', 'Chromatin', 'Comparative Study', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Distal', 'Elements', 'Endothelial Cells', 'Enhancers', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genomic Segment', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Human', 'Ice', 'Individual', 'Joints', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Obesity', 'Pathway interactions', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Phylogenetic Analysis', 'Play', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychological Transfer', 'Publishing', 'Regulation', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Software Tools', 'Statistical Models', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Tissue-Specific Gene Expression', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'base', 'cell type', 'chromosome conformation capture', 'comparative', 'cost', 'epigenome', 'epigenomics', 'experimental study', 'follow-up', 'histone modification', 'human disease', 'improved', 'markov model', 'multitask', 'novel', 'promoter', 'tool', 'trait', 'transcription factor']",NHGRI,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R01,2018,411292,0.03949586043677248
"MODELING DNA METHYLATION'S ROLE IN GENE REGULATION DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Changes in patterns of DNA methylation, a modulator of gene expression, play a key role in development and disease. There has been a flurry of development of new experimental methods to accurately map 5- methylcytosine and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine genome-wide. However, development of computational techniques to interpret these data has lagged behind. Current analytical methods are mostly concerned with visualization of genome-level correlations between DNA methylation and other epigenetic marks or with the identification of differentially methylated regions between samples. These tools have performed poorly when trying to link methylation and expression changes at specific loci, and they find quite weak genome-wide correlations between them. We hypothesize that such discrepancies are due to limitations of the current analysis methods, which tend to oversimplify local DNA methylation signals. We propose to develop a new suite of tools using methods from computer vision to associate spatially-similar methylation changes with corresponding changes in transcription. This approach allows us to make minimal assumptions about what these signals should look like. First, we use Dynamic Time Warping (DTW), a curve similarity metric, to cluster genes together based on their methylation signals. We then find clusters of genes with similar methylation patterns that have coordinated differential expression. We export the patterns defined by these curves for use as a classifier, enabling us to enumerate genes with associated methylation and expression changes. Our model considers the entire shape and course of the signal around the gene promoter, rather than averaging the signal across windows or modeling signals with idealized statistical distributions. We recently published how our method discovered a variety of DNA methylation patterns associated with gene silencing, and produced longer and markedly higher quality gene lists than those generated by other methods. In this proposal we build on these results to address three aims concerning DNA methylation's role in gene silencing: (1) We will build a classifier to model the methylation patterns we discover and use it to examine the role of DNA hypomethylation, which occurs primarily at alternative and retrotransposon promoters that are poorly annotated, in transcriptome regulation in breast cancer. (2) We will expand our model to address the controversial role of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine in gene regulation and its interplay with 5-methylcytosine in differentiated cells in the central nervous system. (3) We will develop general rules governing the methylation signatures we have identified and experimentally validate their functionality. This proposal will yield a set of experimentally validated models for how DNA methylation contributes to gene silencing as well as a set of computational tools other researchers can use to analyze the role of methylation in human disease. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: DNA methylation is an important regulator of gene expression. Abnormal patterns of methylation are often found in cancer and other human diseases. We will develop a set of computational tools, inspired by methods from computer vision, to identify DNA methylation patterns associated with either gene silencing or activation from genomic data. We will elucidate and experimentally validate general rules governing these relationships. All software will be made publically available to broadly advance cancer-research nationwide.

"VISION: ValIdated Systematic IntegratiON of epigenomic data Project Summary VISION: ValIdated Systematic IntegratiON of hematopoietic epigenomes Technological advances enabling the production of large numbers of rich, genome-wide, sequence-based datasets have transformed biology. However, the volume of data is overwhelming for most investigators. Also, we do not know the mechanisms by which the vast majority of epigenetic features regulate normal differentiation or lead to aberrant function in disease. We have formed an interdisciplinary, collaborative team of investigators to address the problem of how to effectively utilize the enormous amount of epigenetic data both for basic research and precision medicine. At this point, acquisition of data is no longer the major barrier to understanding mechanisms of gene regulation during normal and pathological tissue development. The chief challenges are how to: (i) integrate epigenetic data in terms that are accessible and understandable to a broad community of researchers, (ii) build validated quantitative models explaining how the dynamics of gene expression relates to epigenetic features, and (iii) translate information effectively from mouse models to potential applications in human health. These needs are addressed by the proposed ValIdated Systematic IntegratiON (VISION) of epigenetic data to analyze mouse and human hematopoiesis, a tractable system with clear clinical significance and importance to NIDDK. By pursuing the following Specific Aims, the interdisciplinary collaboration will deliver comprehensive catalogs of cis regulatory modules (CRMs), extensive chromatin interaction maps and deduced regulatory domains, validated quantitative models for gene regulation, and a guide for investigators to translate insights from mouse models to human clinical studies. These deliverables will be provided to the community in readily accessible, web-based platforms including customized genome browsers, databases with facile query interfaces, and data-driven on-line tools. Specifically, the proposed work in Aim 1 will build comprehensive, integrative catalogs of hematopoietic CRMs and transcriptomes by compiling and determining informative epigenetic features and transcript levels in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells and in mature cells. CRMs will be predicted using the novel IDEAS (Integrative and Discriminative Epigenome Annotation System) method. Work proposed in Aim 2 will build and validate quantitative models for gene regulation informed by chromatin interaction maps and epigenetic data. Compiling and determining chromosome interaction frequencies will predict likely target genes for CRMs. Gene regulatory models will be built that predict the contributions of CRMs and specific proteins to regulated expression; these models will be validated by extensive testing using genome-editing in ten reference loci. Finally, work in Aim 3 will produce a guide for investigators to translate insights from mouse models to human clinical studies. This effort will include categorizing orthologous mouse and human genes by conservation versus divergence of expression patterns, assigning CRMs to informative categories of epigenomic evolution, and testing the interspecies functional maps experimentally by genome-editing. Project Narrative VISION: ValIdated Systematic IntegratiON of hematopoietic epigenomes Blood cell formation is vitally important to human health because we must continually replace old and damaged cells, and because many diseases result from mis-regulation of gene expression during blood formation. Global measurements of proteins bound to DNA and their modifications help us find the genetic differences most likely to account for the aberrant gene expression at the heart of some diseases.

"Statistical Methods for Network-Based Integrative Analysis of CVD Epigenetic Data ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project involves the development of new statistical methodologies and computational tools for network-based integrative analysis of epigenetic risk factors of cardiovascular diseases (CVD). While the advent of omics data from new technologies has facilitated the study of epigenetic factors, existing methodologies often do not account for complexities of biological data  such as correlations due to interactions of genes/proteins as part of biological pathways  and fail to eﬃciently integrate diverse omics data sets  for instance genetic variation, DNA methylation and gene expression. The methodologies proposed in this project, and the software tools that will be developed to implement them, address these shortcomings, and facilitate further research by the biomedical community to gain a better understanding of the underlying biology of CVD, and to develop new diagnostic biomarkers and potential targets for therapies. The proposed methodologies are motivated by the study of epigenetic data from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA), and include (i) a network-based pathway enrichment analysis method that incorporates available knowledge of interactions among genes and proteins while complementing and reﬁning such information (Aim 1A), as well as its extension for analysis of multiple types of omics data (Aim 1B), and (ii) an integrative analysis framework to identify associations among gene expression levels and DNA methylation (Aim 2A) and identify common epigenetic factors of multiple CVD phenotypes through integrated analysis of DNA methylation and mRNA expression data (Aim 2B).

"Mechanisms of Transcriptional Control Revealed by Nascent Transcript Sequencing Large consortium efforts have collected hundreds of genome-wide datasets that have delineated myriad regulatory regions, transcription factor binding sites and large numbers of coding and non-coding transcripts. Even with this massive amount of data, it remains a significant challenge to determine how the mapped elements function together in regulatory networks. This is due in large part to our inability to accurately and quantitatively detect all forms of nascent transcription, the instantaneous output of transcriptional regulation. Moreover, our understanding of global gene regulation is restricted by a lack of computational tools that seamlessly integrate genome-wide datasets. The overall goal of this proposal is to maximize the impact of nascent transcriptome studies and enable facile integration with other functional genomic data. My group developed native elongating transcript sequencing (NET-seq), that enables the strand-specific nucleotide-resolution mapping of RNA polymerase density, highlighting all transcriptional activity regardless of transcript half-lives and revealing precise positions of Pol II pausing where regulatory control is applied. Here, we will develop a new version of NET-seq – NET-seq 2.0 – that enables the routine, scalable and flexible application to diverse human cell types (or any eukaryotic system). Moreover, we will increase the potential of NET-seq analysis by developing two innovative bioinformatics strategies to seamlessly integrate NET-seq data with other genome-wide datasets that will have applications beyond NET-seq studies. To demonstrate the broad utility of our integrated approach, we will study regulatory networks and cell differentiation for which instantaneous nascent transcriptional analysis will be highly impactful. In Aim 1, our goal is to make NET-seq easier, cheaper, and more flexible. Our improvements will reduce background and increase usable reads, dramatically reduce cell input requirements (100-1000-fold), enable dense, region-specific RNA transcription analyses, and enable quantitative comparisons between samples and conditions. In Aim 2, we will determine transcription kinetics through integrating NET-seq with metabolic RNA labeling (TT-seq) data which report local synthesis rates. This integrative approach yields a rich transcriptional phenotype that we will use to develop gene regulatory network models. In Aim 3, we will create new computational algorithms that circumvent the need to determine each molecular event separately, and instead infer the status of unmapped events using information-rich datasets, such as NET-seq. We will use integrative deep neural networks (`deep-learning') that use available genome-wide datasets to predict unavailable datasets from data already on hand. We will apply this approach to study erythropoiesis using a well- defined primary human hematopoietic differentiation system by a time series NET-seq and DNase-seq analysis. These data will inform deep neural network models to predict ChIP-seq data for myriad transcription factors and chromatin marks to investigate key regulatory events without additional expense. The proposed research is relevant to public health, because discovery of regulatory mechanisms in transcription at high resolution is ultimately expected to significantly impact our understanding of most human disease. As such, the proposed research is relevant to the part of the NIH's mission that seeks to develop fundamental knowledge to inform our diagnosis and treatment of human disease.",Mechanisms of Transcriptional Control Revealed by Nascent Transcript Sequencing,9521770,R01HG007173,"['Binding Sites', 'Bioinformatics', 'Cell Differentiation process', 'Cells', 'ChIP-seq', 'Chromatin', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Computational algorithm', 'DNA-Directed RNA Polymerase', 'DNase I hypersensitive sites sequencing', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Elements', 'Embryonic Development', 'Enhancers', 'Erythropoiesis', 'Eukaryotic Cell', 'Event', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Hematopoietic', 'Human', 'Investigation', 'KDM1A gene', 'Kinetics', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Messenger RNA', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Molecular', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'Nucleotides', 'Output', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Polymerase', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'RNA', 'RNA Polymerase II', 'RNA purification', 'Regulator Genes', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Ribonucleases', 'Ribosomal RNA', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Series', 'Small Nuclear RNA', 'Small Nucleolar RNA', 'Speed', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Transcript', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Untranslated RNA', 'cell type', 'computerized tools', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'density', 'flexibility', 'functional genomics', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'human disease', 'improved', 'innovation', 'network models', 'novel', 'promoter', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome', 'virtual']",NHGRI,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,R01,2018,592501,0.03244194509262382
"Learning the rules of enhancer activity to understand non-coding genetic variation in autoimmune disease Project Summary/Abstract Genome-wide association studies have given us many clues about the mutations that cause common genetic diseases, including autoimmune diseases like lupus and rheumatoid arthritis. However, many of the mutations implicated in disease lie outside of the genes themselves and instead lie in the regions controlling expression of the genes, and so probably contribute to disease by producing the wrong amount of the gene in the wrong tissue or at the wrong time. Mutations in regulatory regions are thought to cause disease by altering the binding of regulatory proteins to the DNA, changing the DNA sequence from one that the protein can bind to one that it cannot (or vice versa). However, the ways in which these regulatory proteins control gene expression remains incompletely understood and so it is presently difficult to understand which regulatory protein binds differently to a mutated regulatory region, or how that change in binding affects expression of the regulated genes. In fact, we still do not even know where the regulatory regions are in the tissues we think are dysfunctional in disease. This project aims to better understand how these mutations contribute to autoimmune disease by first increasing our understanding of how regulatory proteins and regulatory regions work to control when and where genes are expressed, and then applying this knowledge to understand genetic disease. First, regulatory regions will be identified in immune cells and their effects on gene expression measured so that mutations that are likely to contribute to disease (those in regulatory regions) can be identified. The relationship between regulatory proteins, regulatory sequence, and gene expression will be learned by creating millions of synthetic regulatory regions and measuring their effect on gene expression, providing many examples of binding sites for each regulatory protein from which to learn. Finally, our new understanding of gene regulation will be applied to determine which genetic mutations change regulatory protein binding and cause disease. This will help us better understand the underlying causes of disease so that new treatments can be developed that target the mutations within each person. The candidate's long term career goals are to better understand how gene regulation works in humans so that we can better understand how the sequence of the genome controls the expression of our genes. The candidate currently works at the Broad Institute, a leading institute in human genetics and genomics with the resources and personnel required of this project. In order to continue to develop as a scientist, the candidate will gain more experience teaching, publish and present his existing findings, gain the necessary skills to work with human cells, and secure a faculty position and funding so that he can continue to make a positive impact on our knowledge of the genome. Project Narrative Certain genetic diseases are thought to be caused by mutations in the DNA that alter the expression of nearby genes. This project will help us to understand how DNA sequence regulates the expression of genes, and aims to apply this knowledge to predict how and why mutations change gene expression and contribute to disease. By better understanding the fundamental causes of disease, we can better design therapeutic interventions.",Learning the rules of enhancer activity to understand non-coding genetic variation in autoimmune disease,9431485,K99HG009920,"['ATAC-seq', 'Affect', 'Alleles', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Binding Sites', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemistry', 'Biological Assay', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Separation', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Enhancers', 'Faculty', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Haplotypes', 'Health', 'Human', 'Human Activities', 'Human Cell Line', 'Human Genetics', 'Human Genome', 'Human Resources', 'Immune', 'Institutes', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Logic', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Plasmids', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predisposition', 'Protein Region', 'Proteins', 'Publishing', 'Regulation', 'Reporter', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Rheumatoid Arthritis', 'Scientist', 'Secure', 'Specificity', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Work', 'Yeasts', 'biochemical model', 'career', 'cell type', 'design', 'disorder risk', 'experience', 'genetic predictors', 'genetic regulatory protein', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'human genomics', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'lupus-like', 'personalized medicine', 'promoter', 'rare variant', 'skills', 'transcription factor']",NHGRI,"BROAD INSTITUTE, INC.",K99,2018,120204,0.00825353559612053
"Mapping RNA polymerase in tissue samples with ChRO-seq. PROJECT ABSTRACT Deciphering how complex programs of gene expression and regulation contribute to human disease is one of the major challenges facing the field of genomics. Over the past decade, a wealth of new high-throughput genomics tools have revolutionized how we identify active genomic regions and appear poised to make great strides in understanding the mechanisms of disease. Yet the application of most of these technologies has been limited to established cell lines. Currently, approaches being developed to comprehensively map functional elements across the genome involve combining data from several different genome-wide experimental assays, making them expensive and impractical to use in clinical isolates of limited quantity or even to analyze new cell lines. Compounding these technical difficulties, gene expression is a complex and highly tissue dependent biological process, and many important applications will require the direct interrogation of clinical isolates or other similarly limited sources of sample. Thus, efficient new tools that map the repertoire of functional elements across the genome are likely to transform the biomedical and clinical sciences.  We propose to develop Chromatin Run-On and Sequencing (ChRO-seq) and a suite of computational tools for mapping transcription directly in limited tissue samples. Our approach uses a single genome-wide molecular assay to efficiently identify the location of promoters and enhancers, transcription factor binding sites, gene and lincRNA boundaries, transcription levels, and impute certain histone modifications. Preliminary ChRO-seq data reveals patterns of transcription that are virtually identical to those using Precision Run on and Sequencing in cultured cells, but can easily be applied in solid tissue samples. We applied our preliminary ChRO-seq technology to several primary tumors, revealing new insights into how transcriptional regulation underlies cancer development and progression, and providing a key proof-of-concept motivating further technology development. We anticipate that ChRO-seq and the computational methods proposed will enable the efficient discovery of functional elements in virtually any cell sample. In addition, ChRO-seq has the unique advantage that it can be applied in limited tissue samples and clinical isolates even after the degradation of mRNA. PROJECT NARRATIVE We propose to develop a suite of molecular and computational technologies that allow researchers to directly measure transcriptional regulation of genes, enhancers, and lincRNAs in limited clinical isolates. These technologies are anticipated to have a major impact on the biomedical sciences, enabling the genome-wide interrogation of transcription during virtually any disease process for the first time.",Mapping RNA polymerase in tissue samples with ChRO-seq.,9420630,R01HG009309,"['Archives', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Process', 'Cell Line', 'Cells', 'ChIP-seq', 'Chromatin', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Cultured Cells', 'DNA Sequence', 'DNA-Directed RNA Polymerase', 'Data', 'Deoxyribonuclease I', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Enhancers', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomic Segment', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Hypersensitivity', 'Location', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Computations', 'Nuclear', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Primary Neoplasm', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'RNA', 'RNA Polymerase I', 'Regulatory Element', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Solid', 'Source', 'Specimen', 'Speed', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Tissue Sample', 'Tissues', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Untranslated RNA', 'computerized tools', 'deep learning', 'established cell line', 'experimental study', 'genome-wide', 'genomic tools', 'histone modification', 'human disease', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'mRNA Transcript Degradation', 'next generation', 'novel', 'predictive tools', 'programs', 'promoter', 'scale up', 'technology development', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'virtual']",NHGRI,CORNELL UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,387500,0.03311407305394094
"Mechanisms of eukaryotic transcription activation Summary Transcription activation, a key step in gene control, is the readout of many signaling pathways controlling cell growth, development and stress response and defects in activation cause many human diseases and syndromes. Activation typically results from factors containing activation domains (ADs) binding to coactivator complexes containing activator binding domains (ABDs). Understanding the nature of ADs, the specificity of AD-coactivator interactions, and mechanisms of coactivator cooperativity are necessary for understanding the molecular basis of gene regulation. The long-term goal of this project is to determine mechanisms used by gene-specific activators and coactivators to regulate RNA polymerase (Pol) II transcription. The objectives of this proposal are to determine: i) mechanisms of Mediator recruitment and its interaction with ADs, ii) mechanisms of cooperativity between Mediator and the coactivator SAGA, and iii) what constitutes a functional AD and determines the AD specificity for different coactivators and promoter types. This work will utilize an interdisciplinary combination of biochemical, structural, molecular, and computational approaches to examine transcriptional activation in S. cerevisiae. To understand these mechanisms, we will build upon several breakthrough concepts and methods developed in the past grant period. We will use a combination of genomics and biochemistry to identify a new mechanism of Mediator recruitment that is likely used at many genes. We will use orthogonal approaches to determine how the coactivator SAGA stimulates genome-wide transcription, either by direct interaction with the Pol II preinitiation complex (PIC) and/or by direct interaction with Mediator. We will determine the structural basis for AD-Mediator Tail domain interaction using a combination of biochemical and structural analysis. Finally, we will use a combination of biochemistry, genomics, and computational analysis to predict AD function and specificity and identify new mechanisms of AD-coactivator interaction. The expected outcome of these studies will be a molecular understanding of transcription activator specificity and function, mechanisms used by the coactivators Mediator and SAGA to promote transcription, and an understanding of how these factors function at different classes of genes –a leap forward in understanding widely conserved mechanisms of eukaryotic gene regulation. Project Narrative Regulation of transcription by activation of gene expression is a key mechanism for control of cell growth, differentiation, and development. Defects in activation directly contribute to many human illnesses. Our proposed work will identify conserved and widely used mechanisms for transcriptional activation that will form the molecular basis for understanding regulation of transcriptional programs in normal cells, transcriptional defects leading to human disease, and reveal fundamental information on the mechanism of transcription factors that are the readout of many signaling pathways.",Mechanisms of eukaryotic transcription activation,9613971,R01GM075114,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Amino Acids', 'Architecture', 'Binding', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemistry', 'Complex', 'Computer Analysis', 'DNA Binding Domain', 'DNA Polymerase II', 'Defect', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Gene Activation', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Growth and Development function', 'Housekeeping Gene', 'Human', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Maps', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Computations', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Nature', 'Normal Cell', 'Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Study', 'Polymerase', 'Proteins', 'Publishing', 'RNA Polymerase II', 'Randomized', 'Reagent', 'Regulation', 'Regulator Genes', 'SAGA', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae', 'Sequence Analysis', 'Signal Pathway', 'Specificity', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Tail', 'Technology', 'Transcription Coactivator', 'Transcription Initiation', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Transcriptional Activation Domain', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Work', 'base', 'biological adaptation to stress', 'cell growth', 'chromatin modification', 'deep learning', 'flexibility', 'genetic analysis', 'genome-wide', 'high throughput screening', 'human disease', 'in vivo', 'novel strategies', 'programs', 'promoter', 'protein crosslink', 'protein protein interaction', 'recruit', 'transcription factor']",NIGMS,FRED HUTCHINSON CANCER RESEARCH CENTER,R01,2018,546403,0.018961513531033904
"Encoding genomic architecture in the encyclopedia: linking DNA elements, chromatin state, and gene expression in 3D Project Summary Most of the 1000s of sequencing experiments generated by ENCODE provide 1D readouts of the epigenetic landscape or transcriptional output of a 3D genome. New chromosome conformation capture (3C) technologies – in particular Hi-C and ChIA-PET – have begun to provide insight into the hierarchical 3D organization of the genome: the partition of chromosomes into open and closed compartments; the existence of structural subunits defined as topologically associated domains (TADs); and the presence of regulatory and structural DNA loops within TADs. New experimental evidence using CRISPR/Cas-mediated genome editing suggests that disruption of local 3D structure can alter regulation of neighboring genes, and there have been early efforts to use data on 3D DNA looping to predict the impact of non-coding SNPs from GWAS studies. The goal of this proposal is to develop new integrative computational methods to interpret large-scale ENCODE 1D epigenomic and transcriptomic resources in light of the underlying 3D architecture of the genome. Members of our team have pioneered powerful methods to infer local chromatin states from a 1D viewpoint through the Segway suite. We have also analyzed the 1D organization of chromatin accessible elements and their lineage dynamics to define the concept of regulatory complexity, and we presented a gene regulation model to predict gene expression changes in differentiation from the DNA content of active enhancers. Here we will build on these efforts to learn chromatin state and gene regulation models that incorporate information on hierarchical 3D genomic architecture, enabling us to predict how individual structural/regulatory elements contribute to 3D DNA looping and to gene expression. Mechanistic predictions will be experimentally validated in their native cell-type specific chromatin context using state-of-the-art genome editing, exploiting computational and experimental CRISPR/Cas tools developed by our team. Project Narrative This project develops advanced computational methods for integrating information on the 3D structure of the human genome with large-scale genomics data sets generated by the ENCODE project to gain insight into cell-type specific chromatin state and gene regulation. These studies have broad relevance for understanding the regulation of gene expression in human cells and the disruption of gene expression programs in disease.","Encoding genomic architecture in the encyclopedia: linking DNA elements, chromatin state, and gene expression in 3D",9420631,U01HG009395,"['ATAC-seq', 'Architecture', 'Atlases', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'Chromatin Interaction Analysis by Paired-End Tag Sequencing', 'Chromatin Loop', 'Chromosomes', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Computing Methodologies', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence', 'DNase I hypersensitive sites sequencing', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Encyclopedias', 'Enhancers', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Guide RNA', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Hybrids', 'Individual', 'Learning', 'Light', 'Link', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Output', 'Peptide Signal Sequences', 'Ploidies', 'Published Comment', 'Regulation', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Specificity', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'Technology', 'Training', 'Untranslated RNA', 'base', 'cell type', 'chromosome conformation capture', 'computerized tools', 'deep learning', 'density', 'epigenomics', 'experimental study', 'genome annotation', 'genome editing', 'genome wide association study', 'genomic data', 'histone modification', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'member', 'next generation', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'sequence learning', 'three dimensional structure', 'three-dimensional modeling', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptomics']",NHGRI,SLOAN-KETTERING INST CAN RESEARCH,U01,2018,717318,0.05317410241071332
"Learning Regulatory Drivers of Chromatin and Expression Dynamics during Nuclear Reprogramming PROJECT SUMMARY The deluge of sequencing-based functional genomic data profiling the transcriptome, regulome and epigenome in hundreds of diverse cellular contexts has spurred the development of powerful computational methods to learn integrative models of gene regulation. However, models learned on data from static cellular contexts only reveal correlative regulatory relationships. There is a paucity of tractable model systems and experiments profiling dynamic cellular processes and a corresponding lack of computational methods that can learn putative causal mechanisms controlling the precise timing and temporal order of changes in genomic chromatin state and gene expression. Here, we propose novel machine learning methods to learn dynamic models of transcription regulation in the context of cellular reprogramming. In Aim 1, we propose deep learning frameworks with new interpretation engines that can integrate dynamic chromatin accessibility and gene expression data to reveal networks of cis regulatory elements, transcription factor binding complexes and cascades of trans-acting regulatory factors that control cell fate. In Aim2, we will apply our modeling framework to investigate early dynamics of nuclear reprogramming of human fibroblasts to pluripotency. We will leverage a powerful heterokaryon cell fusion model system to generate global chromatin and gene expression profiles over a two day timecourse. In Aim 3, we perform perturbation experiments using RNAi and CRISPR/Cas9 technologies to validate hypotheses generated by our models and test the effectiveness of predicted pluripotency factors and regulatory elements in inducing reprogramming. The validation experiments will be further used to iteratively refine the computational models. We will integrate the time-course data generated in our model system with data from large reference compendia of functional genomic data such as the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) and The Roadmap Epigenomics Project. Our analyses will reveal molecular mechanisms crucial to early and transient stages of nuclear reprogramming, providing novel contributions to our fundamental knowledge of regenerative medicine. Finally, the proposed end-to-end integrative framework is highly generalizable and will be of broad utility to learn dynamic models of transcriptional regulation from time-course datasets in other model systems. NARRATIVE Understanding how cells precisely control the timing and order of gene expression changes during dynamic cellular processes remains a challenge. Here, we propose the development of novel machine learning methods based on deep neural networks to decipher dynamic regulatory networks controlling cell fate decisions.

"Signals of Epigenetic Modification in Sjogrens Syndrome ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The objective of the project is to characterize the potential role of DNA methylation patterns in Sjögren's Syndrome (SS) disease etiology and mechanism. A growing body of evidence indicates that epigenetic changes, in particular, altered patterns of DNA methylation, contribute to the development of autoimmune disease and can mediate genetic risk factors. To date, aberrant DNA methylation has been associated with several human autoimmune diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus. My proposal focuses on the identification of unique epigenetic profiles in SS, focusing primarily on T cells, B cells, and salivary gland tissue, a primary site of the inflammatory disease. An understanding of these profiles in the context of genetic background, publicly available genomic data (RNA, ChIP-seq, WGBS) and annotation data (TF binding motifs, genomic QTLs), and cell types have the potential to significantly transform our understanding of SS etiology, particularly given the well-established heterogeneity in clinical manifestations. Further, these DNA methylation profiles could become useful clinical biomarkers for determining risk and prognosis in SS, especially if their biological relevance can be validated in future functional studies. The overall hypothesis of this project is that DNA methylation changes in key genomic regions are associated with SS status and phenotype. The project will use genome-wide SNP data, epigenome-wide methylation array data, and clinical characteristics abstracted from 100 SS cases and 20 controls to address 3 related hypotheses: First, that epigenome-wide DNA methylation patterns in T cells, B cells (both derived from peripheral blood), and salivary gland biopsy tissue are associated with primary SS status after correcting for cell-type heterogeneity. Case-control differences will be tested using supervised machine learning algorithms, new region-discovery methods, and cell-mixture inference techniques. Publicly available data (listed above) will be used to infer biological relevance. Second, that epigenome-wide DNA methylation patterns in these samples are representative of SS sub-phenotypes. Cases (and initially controls) will be clustered using principal component analysis (PCA) applied to all relevant DNA methylation probes and subsets of probes measuring CpGs implicated in specific pathways relevant to SS. The reduced representations will be tested for association with specific clinical and serological profiles. Third, that risk alleles identifie by genome-wide association studies (GWAS) are directly or indirectly associated with SS-specific DNA methylation patterns. Allelic dosage and random forest selection frequency (RFSF) analyses will be used to identify novel methylation quantitative trait loci within SS-associated genes in cases and controls (separately), and we will test whether cell-proportion or eQTLs can explain SS-specific methylation patterns.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Sjögren's Syndrome is a chronic, highly heterogenous, multisystem autoimmune disease predominantly affecting women. This disease is known to be associated with epigenetic changes, including DNA methylation, an axis of epigenetic variation that has been implicated as a mediator of disease risk in other autoimmune diseases. Full characterization of DNA methylation patterns across different cell types and affected tissues will provide new insights into disease etiology, phenotype classification, and targets for future therapeutic strategies.                ",Signals of Epigenetic Modification in Sjogrens Syndrome,9240483,F31DE025176,"['Aberrant DNA Methylation', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Autoimmunity', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biopsy', 'Carbon', 'Cells', 'ChIP-seq', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Country', 'CpG dinucleotide', 'Cytosine', 'DNA', 'DNA Methylation', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Enrollment', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Etiology', 'European', 'Exhibits', 'Fellowship', 'Female', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Code', 'Genomic Segment', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Individual National Research Service Award', 'Inflammatory', 'International', 'Labial Salivary Gland', 'Lasso', 'Link', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'Modification', 'Not Hispanic or Latino', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Population', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'RNA', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Resources', 'Rheumatoid Arthritis', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Salivary Gland Tissue', 'Salivary Glands', 'Sampling', 'Serological', 'Severity of illness', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Sjogren&apos', 's Syndrome', 'Subgroup', 'Supervision', 'Systemic Lupus Erythematosus', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissues', 'Trans-Activators', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Woman', 'Work', 'base', 'bead chip', 'case control', 'cell type', 'chromatin remodeling', 'clinical biomarkers', 'disease heterogeneity', 'disease phenotype', 'disorder risk', 'dosage', 'epigenetic variation', 'epigenome', 'epigenome-wide association studies', 'forest', 'genetic risk factor', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'high throughput technology', 'histone modification', 'insight', 'methylation pattern', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'peripheral blood', 'pre-doctoral', 'public health relevance', 'risk variant', 'transcription factor', 'whole genome']",NIDCR,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,F31,2017,39597,0.10505264926538953
"Inferring gene regulatory circuitry from functional genomics data PROJECT SUMMARY It has long been known that methylation of genomic DNA correlates with gene expression. However, the structural mechanisms that underlie these observations remain obscure. In this project, we will pursue several innovative strategies for studying how methylation affects transcription factor (TF) binding. First, we will use Methyl-SELEX-seq – a novel experimental method developed in the previous cycle of this grant that uses barcoded mixtures of methylated and unmethylated DNA ligands – to create detailed maps of the effect of methylation on binding affinity for a broad panel of human transcription factors from various structural families. Second, we will perform detailed computational analyses and follow-up experiments to test the hypothesis that methylation causes local changes in DNA shape, which in turn modify TF binding affinity. We have shown that adding a methyl group in the major groove changes the geometry of the minor groove and enhances the electrostatic interaction between negative charges in the DNA minor groove and positively charged amino- acids in the TF. We will extend these analyses to other DNA modifications, as well as a wider range of DNA shape parameters and associated flexibility parameters. By building interpretable TF-DNA recognition models that integrate base, shape, and flexibility features using a powerful new machine learning framework developed in the previous funding cycle, we will make specific predictions regarding sequence and methylation readout mechanisms, and validate these using SELEX experiments with mutated TFs. To assess to what extent our quantitative models for binding to naked DNA built from SELEX data are predictive of binding to genomic DNA in the context of the living cell, we will perform detailed parallel analyses of SELEX and ChIP- seq data for Hox proteins and other TFs. Finally, to study the relationship between DNA binding and gene expression control in human cell lines, we will exploit Survey of Regulatory Elements (SuRE-seq), a novel massively parallel reporter assay that provides unique information about the autonomous transcriptional activity for each of >108 overlapping genomic fragments. PROJECT NARRATIVE Epigenetic modifications of the human genome are known to play a key role in development and disease, but the underlying molecular mechanisms are largely unknown. The main goal of this proposal is to develop and apply new experimental and computational tools for analyzing how the binding of regulatory proteins to DNA is influenced by cytosine methylation.

"Methods for analysis of regulatory variation in cellular differentiation One of the key challenges in human genomics currently is to dissect the impact of sequence variation on gene regulation. Characterizing the functional consequences of regulatory variation would lead to a greater understanding of evolutionary constraint on gene expression, improved interpretation of whole genome sequencing, and a more complete picture of the genetic architecture of complex disease. However, interpreting non-coding genetic variation remains difficult, particularly due to the complexity of gene regulation, which is highly specific to cell-type and environmental context. Understanding how disease-associated genetic variation impacts human tissues requires that we identify mechanisms behind cell-type-specific regulatory variation. In order to address these important goals, we propose to create a resource in which we can directly assay a range of regulatory phenotypes in multiple cell-types. We propose to establish a panel of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from 70 individuals and collect genomic data from iPSCs and differentiated cells. This empirical effort will be complemented by formulating a novel statistical methodology to integrate data across different assays, cell-types, time points, and individuals; to robustly identify regulatory networks and genetic variants that affect gene regulation in each context. Together, these contributions will provide a basis for ongoing study of gene regulation and sequence variation in multiple disease-relevant cell types using a renewable model system and novel methods for robust analysis of these data. In Aim 1, we propose to develop the resource of 70 iPSC lines, where we will collect extensive molecular regulatory phenotypes at multiple time points throughout differentiation to three cell types (cardiomyocytes, neurons and hepatocytes). Measuring gene expression, chromatin accessibility, and methylation in each sample throughout differentiation, we will provide a detailed picture of the cascade of regulatory influences active in each cell type and during development. In Aim 2, we propose to develop a novel statistical framework for inferring universal and cell- type-specific regulatory factors from multi-dimensional data spanning cell-types, individuals, phenotypes, and time points. We specify a machine learning method based on Bayesian hierarchical transfer learning that provides dramatically increased power to detect shared effects while explicitly identifying context-specific regulatory changes. This approach will be adopted to infer regulatory networks, identify key regulatory sequence elements, and map QTLs in each phenotype and cell type. In Aim 3, we will utilize the empirical data and novel methods to infer regulatory relationships and mechanisms underlying genetic variants associated with gene expression in primary tissue and with disease. We will do this by performing a careful integration of external association studies. All samples, cell lines, data, computational tools, and analytical results will be made freely available to the community. We expect our project will greatly advance the understanding of gene regulation, the consequences of genetic variation in diverse cell-types, and the genetic basis of disease. Project narrative: Understanding the impact of individual genetic variation on diverse tissues and cell types in the human body is essential to dissecting the genetics of complex human diseases. Here, we gather data from multiple cell types derived from induced pluripotent stem cells, and develop a novel statistical framework for integrative analysis of data across individuals, cell types, and time points. Our approach provides a transformative approach for understanding gene regulation and the effects of genetic variation on individual health.  ",Methods for analysis of regulatory variation in cellular differentiation,9356566,R01GM120167,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Affect', 'Architecture', 'Behavior', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Models', 'Cardiac Myocytes', 'Cell Differentiation process', 'Cell Line', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Ectoderm', 'Elements', 'Endoderm', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genomics', 'Germ Layers', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hepatocyte', 'Hour', 'Human Genetics', 'Human body', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mesoderm', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Neurons', 'Outcome', 'Phenotype', 'Process', 'Psychological Transfer', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Regulatory Element', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Specificity', 'Statistical Methods', 'Supporting Cell', 'System', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'base', 'cell type', 'computerized tools', 'data resource', 'genetic variant', 'genome sequencing', 'genomic data', 'histone modification', 'human disease', 'human genomics', 'human tissue', 'improved', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'learning network', 'learning strategy', 'novel', 'phenotypic data', 'pluripotency', 'programs', 'statistics', 'trait', 'transcriptomics', 'whole genome']",NIGMS,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R01,2017,463781,0.0335953929040637
"ImmGen: Gene Expression and Regulation in Immune Cells The Immunological Genome Project (ImmGen) is a collaborative group of 15 Immunology and Computational Biology laboratories who perform, under standardized conditions, a thorough dissection of gene expression and its regulation in the mouse immune system. We also investigated how these respond to cytokines and immunologic challenges, how immune gene expression relates to chromatin configuration, and used cutting-edge computational algorithms to deduce regulatory connections. ImmGen data are publicly available on dedicated web and smartphone supports, using interactive graphic displays that make the results intuitive to users. These are now frequently used by the Immunology research community. The proposed continuation will harness the collective expertise of the ImmGen group to further develop this important public resource. (1) Expand and deepen the compendium, applying single-cell RNAseq to define very broadly the cast of cell-types at play in the immune system, their trajectories of differentiation, and their adaptation to specific organismal locations This effort will be complemented by deeper bulk profiling of cell-types thus identified. We will expand the analysis of cytokine signatures, continue to chart non-coding RNA (circRNAs), and persue the “OpenSource” program of coordinated sample contributions from the community. (2) Mechanistic Dissection of Immunogenomic Regulatory Networks focusing on a Core Set of 14 cell-types that represent all the major immunological lineages. We will generate high-resolution maps of transcription factor footprints by ultra-deep ATACseq; map 3D architectures by HiC chromosome conformation capture; apply ChIPseq to define enhancers and super-enhancers, chromatin modification domains and structural anchors; use machine learning approaches to integrate these complementary data into a comprehensive regulatory plan which spans from fine TF footprints to topologically associated domaiins; validate these inferences by collaborating with the KOMP project to analyze Core Set transcriptomes and chromatin configuration in mice with mutations in transcription factors that determine functionally relevant facets of immunocyte activity. (3): Public Display. ImmGen data have become a widely used resource in Immunology research, which will be maintained and curated. For scalability, cost-effectiveness, and to enable facile computation, we will develop and deploy cloud-based data storage and access solutions, compliant with NIH Commons guidelines. We will add to the existing databrowsers to allow users to query different facets of the expanding data (differential expression, regulatory network, chromatin states and architecture, cytokine signatures), increasing connectivity to other data sources. We will continue developing the popular mobile app, and explore the particular uses of that medium. ImmGen has positively impacted immunological research in the current decade, providing detailed and rigorous genomic resolution of immune populations, informed by a strong understanding of their immunology. This is what we will continue and amplify. PROJECT NARRATIVE Through the high quality gene expression data it has generated, ImmGen has become an important resource in Immunology research. This next cycle of funding will expand the definition of gene expression across the immune system, analyze how its regulatory hierarchy relates to immune responses.

"Deconvolution of Epigenomic Data to Characterize Cellular Subpopulations Abstract With the advent of new DNA sequencing technologies, genomic data has moved to the forefront in the quest for individualized medicine. However, the lack of new computational tools to interpret and exploit the deluge of genomic data has severely hampered its clinical benefit. A further complication is that clinical genomic data is often obtained from tissues containing a mixture of different cell types. For example, tumor samples are a mixture of tumor subclones and normal cell lineages. As a platform for understanding this heterogeneity in tumor cell populations, our studies will focus on DNA methylation changes in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), the most prevalent, aggressive form of Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (NHL). DNA methylation is cell type- specific, likely contributes to the phenotypic variation in tumor subclones, and plays key roles in gene regulation and lymphoma pathogenesis. Defining the methylation and transcriptional profiles of tumor subclones is necessary to identify potential drug targets, predict disease progression, and identify overall prognosis. Further, current computational approaches to understand epigenetic heterogeneity are not well- suited for tumor analysis and do not link epigenetic changes to expression. Here, we propose to develop a new computational approach that uses genomic methylation data from bulk samples to define DNA methylation- and expression-based subclonal populations and relate these populations to disease progression. Our approach exploits the fact that methylation levels are an accurate measure of the underlying distribution of allelic methylation states in the tumor (e.g. 30% methylation means 30% of the alleles are methylated). Our approach takes genome-wide methylation data as input, and outputs the number of subpopulations, their respective proportions, and each underlying subpopulation’s DNA methylation profile. After deconvolution, we will extend our previous work showing that DNA methylation profiles are predictive of expression levels, and apply tools from machine learning to estimate the relative expression profiles in each subpopulation. This approach will allow us to take advantage of the vast amount of data currently being collected in large-scale sequencing projects and obtain genome-wide methylation information from cellular subpopulations even when surface markers cannot be used to physically separate the different subpopulations. Lastly, we will assess the clinical relevance of these approaches by using them to understand the molecular changes found in tumor subpopulations from samples of relapsed DLBCL. We envision these methods can be applied as investigative tools first, and later as cost-effective clinical tools, to analyze the epigenetic and transcriptomic heterogeneity in different tumor types and diseased tissues. Public Narrative Tumors, including B-cell lymphomas, are comprised of heterogeneous populations of cells. Decoding the regulatory circuitry in these sub-populations is critical to understanding tumor metastasis, therapy resistance and relapse. We propose to develop a new computational approach to use genome-wide measurements of DNA methylation in primary tumors to understand the regulatory landscape of these subpopulations. All software will be made publically available to broadly advance cancer-research nationwide. Results from this work will improve our understanding of molecular mechanisms of B cell lymphoma development and relapse.",Deconvolution of Epigenomic Data to Characterize Cellular Subpopulations,9317775,R21LM012395,"['Address', 'Advanced Malignant Neoplasm', 'Alleles', 'Antibodies', 'B-Cell Lymphomas', 'Biological', 'Cell Count', 'Cell Lineage', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Complication', 'Computer software', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'DNA sequencing', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Drug Targeting', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomic DNA', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Hematopoietic', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Large-Scale Sequencing', 'Lymphoma', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'Mixed Cellular Population', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Non-Hodgkin&apos', 's Lymphoma', 'Normal Cell', 'Output', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Primary Neoplasm', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Sampling', 'Structure of germinal center of lymph node', 'Surface', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Work', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'cancer cell', 'cell type', 'chemotherapy', 'clinical sequencing', 'clinically relevant', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'epigenome', 'epigenomics', 'genome wide methylation', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'large cell Diffuse non-Hodgkin&apos', 's lymphoma', 'lymph nodes', 'neoplastic cell', 'outcome forecast', 'prognostic', 'programs', 'tool', 'transcriptomics', 'tumor', 'tumor heterogeneity']",NLM,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R21,2017,220064,0.02664220210915591
"Genome analysis based on the integration of DNA sequence and shape DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Current techniques for genome analysis are mainly based on the one-dimensional DNA sequence, comprised of the letters A, C, G, and T. However, proteins recognize DNA as a three-dimensional (3D) object. Nuances in DNA shape at single nucleotide resolution play a crucial role in the binding specificity of transcription facors (TFs), including those involved in embryonic development and human cancer. This project involves the development of a battery of tools for genome analysis, through the integration of information derived from the DNA sequence and the 3D structure of DNA, or ""DNA shape"". The basis for these novel tools is a high- throughput (HT) method for the prediction of multiple features of local DNA shape at the genomic scale. Data will be made available to the community in the UCSC Genome Browser track format through a web server interface. These tools will enable users to analyze the shape of any number or length of DNA sequences, including whole genomes and the effect of DNA methylation. HT shape predictions will be validated based on X-ray crystallography, NMR spectroscopy, and hydroxyl radical cleavage data. Predictions will be combined with ORChID, an ENCODE project that infers DNA minor groove geometry from hydroxyl radical cleavage experiments. The HT method will be used to study how paralogous TFs select different target sites in vivo despite sharing core-binding motifs or having similar binding properties in vitro. To study this question, we will investigate the effect of flanking sequences on multiple structural features of TF binding sites (TFBSs). The initial focus of this study will be homeodomains and basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) TFs. Other protein families will later be included and used to construct a comprehensive TFBS database that provides shape features for binding motifs derived from JASPAR and other motif databases. Structural effects of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) will also be analyzed. Some SNPs are associated with deleterious functions, whereas others have no apparent effect. The HT shape prediction method will be used to predict the function of SNPs in non-coding regions based on DNA shape. We will correlate quantitative effects of SNPs on DNA structure with expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) and genome-wide association study (GWAS) signals, to develop a predictive tool for the functional effect of SNPs. The HT shape prediction approach will be used to design DNA sequences with different AT/GC contents but similar shapes. The relative contributions of sequence and shape to binding will be tested with analytic models including multiple linear regression (MLR) and support vector regression (SVR). For systems in which the integration of sequence and shape proves advantageous, novel motif finding tools will be developed based on an extended alphabet that combines sequence with informative structural features, selected by machine learning and feature selection approaches. Sequence+shape motifs will be tested by motif scanning, compared to sequence-only motifs, and integrated into the MEME Suite. The goal of this sequence-shape integration is to increase the accuracy of finding in vivo TFBSs in the genome. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Protein-DNA recognition is a critical yet poorly understood component of gene regulation. This proposal will connect the fields of DNA sequence and structure analysis, which so far have been developed in parallel but largely disconnected from each other. Integration of the one-dimensional DNA sequence at a genome-wide scale with the three-dimensional DNA structure at atomic resolution will lead to the development of novel genome analysis tools and will advance our understanding of genome function, leading to fundamentally new insights into the mechanisms of gene regulation and its impact on human disease.",Genome analysis based on the integration of DNA sequence and shape,9203633,R01GM106056,"['Affect', 'Affinity', 'Algorithms', 'BHLH Protein', 'Base Pairing', 'Base Sequence', 'Benchmarking', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological Process', 'ChIP-on-chip', 'ChIP-seq', 'Characteristics', 'Communities', 'Computational algorithm', 'DNA', 'DNA Databases', 'DNA Integration', 'DNA Structure', 'DNase-I Footprinting', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Databases', 'Deoxyribonuclease I', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Drosophila genus', 'Embryonic Development', 'Family', 'Gaussian model', 'Gene Components', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genome Scan', 'Genomics', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Guanine + Cytosine Composition', 'Helix-Turn-Helix Motifs', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Hydroxyl Radical', 'In Vitro', 'Internet', 'Length', 'Letters', 'Linear Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'Minor Groove', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Biology', 'Molecular Conformation', 'NMR Spectroscopy', 'Nucleotides', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protein Family', 'Proteins', 'Publishing', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Sequence Analysis', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Width', 'X-Ray Crystallography', 'Yeasts', 'base', 'design', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'genetic evolution', 'genome analysis', 'genome browser', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'homeodomain', 'human disease', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'member', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'predictive tools', 'public health relevance', 'three dimensional structure', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'vector', 'whole genome']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,R01,2017,309913,0.040791234943215744
"Epigenetic Transgenerational Endocrine Disruptor Actions DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A number of environmental toxicants were shown in the previous grant period to promote the epigenetic transgenerational inheritance of adult onset disease including the fungicide vinclozolin, pesticides, plastics (BPA and phthalates), dioxin, hydrocarbons, and DDT. The ability of environmental compounds (e.g. endocrine disruptors) to promote transgenerational disease phenotypes is anticipated to be a critical aspect of adult onset disease etiology. The transgenerational inheritance phenotype requires the heritable epigenetic alterations of the germline. The current proposal is designed to further investigate the molecular and developmental aspects of the epigenetic transgenerational inheritance phenomenon and assess the potential use of epigenetic biomarkers for exposure and disease. The general hypothesis tested is that ""transient fetal exposure around the period of gonadal sex determination to environmental toxicants (i.e. vinclozolin) promotes the reprogramming of the epigenome (i.e. DNA methylation) of the male germline that then transmits an imprinted-like epigenome to subsequent generations to induce the epigenetic transgenerational inheritance of adult onset disease (e.g. male infertility)"". The previous grant period focused on the analysis of the epigenetic alteration in the F3 generation sperm using promoter associated differential DNA methylation regions (epimutations), as well as documented the epigenetic and transcriptome changes in the F3 generation vinclozolin lineage primordial germ cells. The molecular etiology of somatic cell changes associated with ovary and testis disease was established. The current proposal further investigates the molecular and developmental aspects of the germline mediated epigenetic transgenerational inheritance of disease. The experimental approach to test the above hypothesis consists of the following specific aims: Aim 1) Determine the developmental and generational aspects of the genome-wide germline epimutations. Aim 2) Determine the genomic features associated with the epimutations and potential genetic alterations involved in the epigenetic transgenerational inheritance phenomenon. Aim 3) Determine the optimal exposure parameters of the environmental induced transgenerational model and correlate epigenetic biomarkers with exposure and disease. Completion of the proposed research will determine the cascade of epigenetic events involved in germ cell development that generates the sperm epimutations that transmit the epigenetic transgenerational inheritance of disease phenotypes. The protection of the sperm epimutations from DNA methylation erasure is anticipated in early embryonic development. The proposed research will further elucidate the molecular and developmental aspects of environmentally induced epigenetic transgenerational inheritance of disease and the potential use of epigenetic biomarkers for ancestral exposure and disease.

"Surveying transcription factor pioneer interactions with nucleosomal DNA Numerous studies have focused on cataloging the genome `parts list', including transcripts, transcription factor (TF) binding sites, and chromatin states. Transcriptional regulatory networks have been inferred based on these data, leading to models of what TFs are master regulators at or near the top of the regulatory hierarchy versus lineage- or condition-specific TFs, which are downstream of those regulators. However, none of these approaches directly identifies which factors engage inaccessible chromatin to initiate the transcriptional regulatory cascades.

"High-throughput methods for elucidating the control of chromatin accessibility ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We will develop the first validated predictive model of how transcription factors dynamically determine genome-wide chromatin accessibility that is generalizable across biological systems. We will accomplish this goal with three specific aims. We will develop novel Genome Syntax to Regulation (GSR) models that accurately learn a genomic regulatory vocabulary and predict how phrases in this vocabulary control chromatin accessibility (Aim 1). As part of this aim we will identify transcription factor binding motifs tha are in the discovered regulatory vocabulary. We will validate and refine the causality of these models by testing whether they accurately predict the chromatin accessibility of thousands of synthetic DNA ""phrases"" that have been engineered into specific genomic locations and measured in the context of transcription factor gain-of-function and loss-of-function studies. The phrases will be designed to elucidate both the factors and grammar that control chromatin opening in several distinct cellular states (Aim 2). We will use our predictive models to assign importance scores to individual genome bases and to predict how selected factors alter chromatin accessibility genome wide (Aim 3). We will test the ability of our importance scores to identify regulatory SNPs in the context of human genome-wide association study (GWAS) data, and we will validate model predictions of changes in whole genome chromatin accessibility in response to ectopic factor expression. Through computational modeling of the effect of such ectopic factor expression, we will develop a predictive understanding of how transcription factors alter chromatin state, laying the groundwork for a novel regenerative medicine paradigm of predictive cellular programming. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Access to the information in our genomes is regulated by a cell much like doors in a building can regulate access to rooms that contain instructions. The control over which doors are open in a cell regulates which instructions are accessible in a cell-type specific way. We will understand the code that controls the doors to our genome, and improve human health by understanding what genome changes interfere with door control and demonstrating that we can program cells to open and close their doors to create cells that might be able to serve as replacements for damaged cells in our bodies.",High-throughput methods for elucidating the control of chromatin accessibility,9267524,R01HG008363,"['Access to Information', 'Alpha Cell', 'Base Pairing', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Biological', 'Cell Differentiation process', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'Chromatin Modeling', 'Code', 'Computer Simulation', 'Controlled Vocabulary', 'DNA', 'DNA Library', 'DNA Sequence', 'DNase I hypersensitive sites sequencing', 'Data', 'Ectopic Expression', 'Engineering', 'Enhancers', 'Etiology', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Individual', 'Instruction', 'Knock-out', 'Learning', 'Libraries', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Oligonucleotides', 'Pancreas', 'Proteins', 'Regenerative Medicine', 'Regulation', 'Regulatory Element', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Vocabulary', 'Work', 'base', 'biological systems', 'cell injury', 'cell type', 'combinatorial', 'design', 'embryonic stem cell', 'gain of function', 'genetic regulatory protein', 'genome editing', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'loss of function', 'novel', 'overexpression', 'phrases', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'promoter', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'syntax', 'synthetic construct', 'transcription factor', 'whole genome']",NHGRI,MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2017,748525,0.057156332410677614
"Comparative analysis and regulatory architecture of epigenomics datasets ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The NIH Roadmap Epigenomics and ENCODE projects have generated a collection of 3000+ epigenomics datasets, including histone modification, DNA methylation, gene expression, and DNaseI hypersensitivity profiled across 190 cell and tissue types. In order to maximize its impact on gene regulation, cellular differentiation, and human health, novel computational analyses are needed. To address this challenge, we will develop new methods for epigenomic analysis, building on our extensive experience interpreting epigenomic information, and our preliminary studies building chromatin states, activity clusters, and regulatory motif maps for the Roadmap Epigenomics and ENCODE datasets. In Aim 1, we will characterize epigenomic differences and changes during lineage differentiation by developing new tools for systematic comparison of groups of epigenomes that directly exploit the complexity of epigenomic datasets; we will also develop methods for clustering epigenomes into developmental lineages based on automatically-learned diverse epigenomic features that distinguish them; and methods that learn the unidirectional epigenomic changes that pluripotent cells undergo during lineage commitment to gain more insights into differentiation and automatically learn to classify lineages and differentiation trajectories. In Am 2, we will seek to characterize higher-order chromatin architecture and chromatin conformation to enable systematic interpretation of cis-regulatory modules: we will develop a novel statistical approach for enhancer-enhancer and enhancer-gene linking to reveal interacting regions and their target genes based on their coordinated activity patterns across cell and tissue types; we will train a supervised learning method for predicting both constitutive and tissue-specific chromatin conformation information based on chromatin state information, individual chromatin marks, genomic distance, activity, regulatory motif information, and DNA sequence; and we will use these higher-order interaction maps to predict gene expression levels based on the combined action of multiple regulatory regions and to define the cis-regulatory architecture of each gene in the human genome. The resulting resources will be invaluable for studies of gene regulation, by revealing the set of regulatory elements that are linked to each gene, and for the interpretation of genetic studies, by revealing the set of regulatory elements which jointly act to regulate each target gene and the potential target genes of non-coding variants associated with human disease. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The NIH ENCODE and Roadmap Epigenomics projects have generated a collection of 4000+ epigenomics datasets across 200+ cell and tissue types, which can be invaluable to the scientific community, but novel computational analyses are needed to maximize its impact on gene regulation, cellular differentiation, and human health. To address this need, we propose to systematically study epigenomic differences between cell types, lineages, and stages of differentiation, and to learn models predicting the higher-order chromatin structures across cell/tissue types, within each cell/tissue, and the chromatin architectures that they define. By systematically interpreting epigenomic annotations in the context of their cellular differentiation and their higher-order chromatin structures, the resultin resource will greatly increase their impact on human health by enabling disease studies to understand the mechanistic relationship between non-coding variants and their target genes, and the specific differentiation stages in which they act.",Comparative analysis and regulatory architecture of epigenomics datasets,9253408,R01GM113708,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'Chromosomes', 'Classification', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Analysis', 'Correlation Studies', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Enhancers', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genetic study', 'Genomics', 'Graph', 'Health', 'Higher Order Chromatin Structure', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Hypersensitivity', 'Individual', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Mutation', 'Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'Nucleosomes', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Phylogenetic Analysis', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Regulatory Element', 'Resources', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Statistical Methods', 'Supervision', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'base', 'cell type', 'comparative', 'comparison group', 'differential expression', 'epigenome', 'epigenomics', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'follow-up', 'genetic association', 'genome wide association study', 'histone modification', 'human disease', 'innovation', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'predictive modeling', 'public health relevance', 'rare variant', 'tool', 'ward']",NIGMS,MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2017,284959,0.060228418493747014
"""Ribonomics"" of Gene Regulation to predict Innate Immune Responses DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The expression of genes involves a sequence of enzymatic events, such as transcription, mRNA processing, mRNA decay, and translation, that are subject to gene regulatory networks (GRNs) of protein-nucleic acid interactions. It is well appreciated that the control of transcription via regulatory networks that regulate enhancer and promoter activities are not the sole determinant of what gene products result, but that exon skipping is pervasive and post-transcriptional mechanisms such as mRNA splicing and decay determine the kinetics of mRNA induction and abundance. Indeed, in our preliminary studies of the macrophage response to pathogens, we find that a majority of induced gene expression events result in mRNAs that deviate substantially from those predicted by the genome-browser, and that mRNA decay is controlled by both protein- nucleic acid and miRNA regulatory networks. The proposed Center for the ""Ribonomics"" of Gene Regulation leverages and pioneers Next Gen Sequencing and computational modeling approaches to develop a predictive model for which mRNA isoforms are expressed and at what level given a given promoter activity and transcription initiation rate. We will develop generally applicable tools in conjunction with or in depth and quantitative experimental analysis of the macrophage response to pathogen-associated endotoxin, which results in the dramatic up regulation of more than 1000 genes. Strikingly, our preliminary data identified more than 900 exon skipping events in addition to numerous cases of alternative 5' or 3' splice site use, emphasizing the essential contribution of post-initiation events. Further, these splice patterns are dependent on the macrophage subtype-specific chromatin landscape and are altered by inducible splice factors in primed or tolerated states. Thus we will leverage the well-described macrophage biology and associated experimental model systems, to examine the role of gene structure and sequence (Aim 1), the role of chromatin modifications (Aim 2), and of trans-acting splicing factors (Aim 3) in determining the identity of mature mRNAs and their associated synthesis rates, before adding the stimulus-responsive regulatory networks that confer mRNA half-life control and thus determine the abundance of each mRNA isoform (Aim 4). PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The proposed Center for the Ribonomics of Gene Regulation leverages and pioneers Next Gen Sequencing and computational modeling approaches to develop gene regulatory network (GRN) models that predict which of many alternative mRNA isoforms are actually expressed and at what level.

"Enhancer-mediated mechanisms of pattern formation ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Gene regulatory networks establish the body plans of complex multicellular animals. The main components of these networks are transcription factors and cis-regulatory elements (CREs) that contain unique combinations of transcription factor binding sites. Transgenic experiments have shown that CREs control spatial and temporal patterns of gene expression, but how binding events at the CRE level are converted into these patterns is still poorly understood. In humans, mutations that disrupt transcription factor activit or CRE DNA sequences can cause birth defects and disease states, including cancer. Here we propose to study CRE- mediated embryo patterning in the early Drosophila embryo, with a specific focus on CREs that respond to the maternal transcription factor Bicoid (Bcd). In previous work, we identified 66 Bcd-dependent CREs, which were validated by reporter genes in transgenic embryos. All 66 are directly activated by Bcd, but each contains a unique set of transcription factor-binding sites, and drives an expression pattern that appears as a band(s) or stripe(s) at a specific position(s) along the anterior-posterior (AP) axis. Expression pattern boundaries represent positions where genes make on/off decisions, and foreshadow boundaries between cells of different fates later in development. The work proposed here will focus on two major goals. First, we want to perform a deep, quantitative analysis of transcriptional activation by a single ""model"" CRE (hunchback P2E) that is activated by BCD. Two specific questions will be addressed: 1. how do individual binding sites, groups of binding sites, and combinations of sites for different factors contribute to transcriptional activation? We will combine DNA-binding data of different types to better define functional motifs, extensively mutate the CRE, and assay three specific output parameters using live imaging in close collaboration with Thomas Gregor's lab. 2. How does this Bcd-dependent CRE ""choose"" its specific basal promoter? We will use a split reporter system and single molecule FISH to identify basal promoter sequences that allow or prevent activation by Bcd, and CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing to test the importance of promoter choice in vivo. The second major goal will be to gain a conceptually complete understanding of the regulatory network that creates Bcd-dependent gene expression patterns. We have identified three proteins that function in broad activation, and nine candidate repressors expressed in discrete domains that together cover the entire embryonic region where activation can occur. We will use reporter gene manipulations and single molecule FISH to test how repressor gradients shape boundaries of gene expression, and genetics and reporter genes to test the roles of several newly identified repressors that prevent activation in anterior regions. Our hypothesis is that the expression patterns driven by all Bcd-dependent CREs are ""computed"" by specific combinations of binding sites for these twelve factors. These experiments will make significant contributions to our general understanding of how CREs functions in activation and repression events, and how embryos establish body plans. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Animal body plans are established by hundreds of DNA-binding factors that bind thousands of cis-regulatory elements (CREs). Our goals are to carry out the deepest analysis of gene activation by a single CRE in higher eukaryotes, and to understand how multiple CREs integrates activation and repression to pattern the embryo.",Enhancer-mediated mechanisms of pattern formation,9276695,R01GM051946,"['Address', 'Affinity', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Anterior', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Models', 'Body Patterning', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Collaborations', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Congenital Abnormality', 'DNA Binding', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Defect', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Dissection', 'Drosophila genus', 'Elements', 'Embryo', 'Enhancers', 'Eukaryota', 'Event', 'Funding', 'Gene Activation', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Gene Order', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Homeodomain Proteins', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Length', 'Link', 'Logic', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Output', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Formation', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Proteins', 'RNA', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Reporter', 'Reporter Genes', 'Repression', 'Role', 'Shapes', 'Site', 'System', 'Tertiary Protein Structure', 'Testing', 'Transact', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Transgenic Organisms', 'Work', 'Zinc Fingers', 'bZIP Protein', 'base', 'cofactor', 'experimental study', 'fly', 'in vitro Assay', 'in vivo', 'loss of function mutation', 'morphogens', 'prevent', 'promoter', 'protein function', 'public health relevance', 'single molecule', 'transcription factor']",NIGMS,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY,R01,2017,356861,0.03141999360864883
"Statistical Methods for Network-Based Integrative Analysis of CVD Epigenetic Data ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project involves the development of new statistical methodologies and computational tools for network-based integrative analysis of epigenetic risk factors of cardiovascular diseases (CVD). While the advent of omics data from new technologies has facilitated the study of epigenetic factors, existing methodologies often do not account for complexities of biological data  such as correlations due to interactions of genes/proteins as part of biological pathways  and fail to eﬃciently integrate diverse omics data sets  for instance genetic variation, DNA methylation and gene expression. The methodologies proposed in this project, and the software tools that will be developed to implement them, address these shortcomings, and facilitate further research by the biomedical community to gain a better understanding of the underlying biology of CVD, and to develop new diagnostic biomarkers and potential targets for therapies. The proposed methodologies are motivated by the study of epigenetic data from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA), and include (i) a network-based pathway enrichment analysis method that incorporates available knowledge of interactions among genes and proteins while complementing and reﬁning such information (Aim 1A), as well as its extension for analysis of multiple types of omics data (Aim 1B), and (ii) an integrative analysis framework to identify associations among gene expression levels and DNA methylation (Aim 2A) and identify common epigenetic factors of multiple CVD phenotypes through integrated analysis of DNA methylation and mRNA expression data (Aim 2B). We will develop eﬃcient and user-friendly software tools for the proposed methods (Aim 3), which will be made freely available to the public after extensive tests using both simulated data, as well as real data from MESA. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research addresses the need for development of new statistical machine learning methods for analysis of diverse epigenetic data from multiple cardiovascular disease outcomes.

"MODELING DNA METHYLATION'S ROLE IN GENE REGULATION DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Changes in patterns of DNA methylation, a modulator of gene expression, play a key role in development and disease. There has been a flurry of development of new experimental methods to accurately map 5- methylcytosine and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine genome-wide. However, development of computational techniques to interpret these data has lagged behind. Current analytical methods are mostly concerned with visualization of genome-level correlations between DNA methylation and other epigenetic marks or with the identification of differentially methylated regions between samples. These tools have performed poorly when trying to link methylation and expression changes at specific loci, and they find quite weak genome-wide correlations between them. We hypothesize that such discrepancies are due to limitations of the current analysis methods, which tend to oversimplify local DNA methylation signals. We propose to develop a new suite of tools using methods from computer vision to associate spatially-similar methylation changes with corresponding changes in transcription. This approach allows us to make minimal assumptions about what these signals should look like. First, we use Dynamic Time Warping (DTW), a curve similarity metric, to cluster genes together based on their methylation signals. We then find clusters of genes with similar methylation patterns that have coordinated differential expression. We export the patterns defined by these curves for use as a classifier, enabling us to enumerate genes with associated methylation and expression changes. Our model considers the entire shape and course of the signal around the gene promoter, rather than averaging the signal across windows or modeling signals with idealized statistical distributions. We recently published how our method discovered a variety of DNA methylation patterns associated with gene silencing, and produced longer and markedly higher quality gene lists than those generated by other methods. In this proposal we build on these results to address three aims concerning DNA methylation's role in gene silencing: (1) We will build a classifier to model the methylation patterns we discover and use it to examine the role of DNA hypomethylation, which occurs primarily at alternative and retrotransposon promoters that are poorly annotated, in transcriptome regulation in breast cancer. (2) We will expand our model to address the controversial role of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine in gene regulation and its interplay with 5-methylcytosine in differentiated cells in the central nervous system. (3) We will develop general rules governing the methylation signatures we have identified and experimentally validate their functionality. This proposal will yield a set of experimentally validated models for how DNA methylation contributes to gene silencing as well as a set of computational tools other researchers can use to analyze the role of methylation in human disease. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: DNA methylation is an important regulator of gene expression. Abnormal patterns of methylation are often found in cancer and other human diseases. We will develop a set of computational tools, inspired by methods from computer vision, to identify DNA methylation patterns associated with either gene silencing or activation from genomic data. We will elucidate and experimentally validate general rules governing these relationships. All software will be made publically available to broadly advance cancer-research nationwide. Insights obtained through this work will improve our mechanistic understanding of DNA methylation and assist in the identification of patients who can benefit from DNA methylation targeted therapies.",MODELING DNA METHYLATION'S ROLE IN GENE REGULATION,9263991,R01GM108811,"['Address', 'Advanced Malignant Neoplasm', 'Affect', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Brain', 'Breast Cancer Model', 'Cell Differentiation process', 'Cells', 'Classification', 'Complication', 'Computational Technique', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'DNA', 'DNA Methylation', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Event', 'Gene Activation', 'Gene Cluster', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Silencing', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Hypermethylation', 'Imagery', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Neuraxis', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Play', 'Publishing', 'Regulation', 'Regulator Genes', 'Reporter', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Retroelements', 'Retrotransposon', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Statistical Distributions', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Transcription Initiation Site', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Validation', 'Visualization software', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'cancer type', 'cell type', 'common rule', 'computerized tools', 'differential expression', 'embryonic stem cell', 'genome browser', 'genome editing', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'human disease', 'improved', 'insight', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'methylation pattern', 'mouse model', 'promoter', 'public health relevance', 'targeted treatment', 'tool', 'transcriptome']",NIGMS,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2017,343125,0.09785955009301567
"VISION: ValIdated Systematic IntegratiON of epigenomic data Project Summary VISION: ValIdated Systematic IntegratiON of hematopoietic epigenomes Technological advances enabling the production of large numbers of rich, genome-wide, sequence-based datasets have transformed biology. However, the volume of data is overwhelming for most investigators. Also, we do not know the mechanisms by which the vast majority of epigenetic features regulate normal differentiation or lead to aberrant function in disease. We have formed an interdisciplinary, collaborative team of investigators to address the problem of how to effectively utilize the enormous amount of epigenetic data both for basic research and precision medicine. At this point, acquisition of data is no longer the major barrier to understanding mechanisms of gene regulation during normal and pathological tissue development. The chief challenges are how to: (i) integrate epigenetic data in terms that are accessible and understandable to a broad community of researchers, (ii) build validated quantitative models explaining how the dynamics of gene expression relates to epigenetic features, and (iii) translate information effectively from mouse models to potential applications in human health. These needs are addressed by the proposed ValIdated Systematic IntegratiON (VISION) of epigenetic data to analyze mouse and human hematopoiesis, a tractable system with clear clinical significance and importance to NIDDK. By pursuing the following Specific Aims, the interdisciplinary collaboration will deliver comprehensive catalogs of cis regulatory modules (CRMs), extensive chromatin interaction maps and deduced regulatory domains, validated quantitative models for gene regulation, and a guide for investigators to translate insights from mouse models to human clinical studies. These deliverables will be provided to the community in readily accessible, web-based platforms including customized genome browsers, databases with facile query interfaces, and data-driven on-line tools. Specifically, the proposed work in Aim 1 will build comprehensive, integrative catalogs of hematopoietic CRMs and transcriptomes by compiling and determining informative epigenetic features and transcript levels in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells and in mature cells. CRMs will be predicted using the novel IDEAS (Integrative and Discriminative Epigenome Annotation System) method. Work proposed in Aim 2 will build and validate quantitative models for gene regulation informed by chromatin interaction maps and epigenetic data. Compiling and determining chromosome interaction frequencies will predict likely target genes for CRMs. Gene regulatory models will be built that predict the contributions of CRMs and specific proteins to regulated expression; these models will be validated by extensive testing using genome-editing in ten reference loci. Finally, work in Aim 3 will produce a guide for investigators to translate insights from mouse models to human clinical studies. This effort will include categorizing orthologous mouse and human genes by conservation versus divergence of expression patterns, assigning CRMs to informative categories of epigenomic evolution, and testing the interspecies functional maps experimentally by genome-editing. Project Narrative VISION: ValIdated Systematic IntegratiON of hematopoietic epigenomes Blood cell formation is vitally important to human health because we must continually replace old and damaged cells, and because many diseases result from mis-regulation of gene expression during blood formation. Global measurements of proteins bound to DNA and their modifications help us find the genetic differences most likely to account for the aberrant gene expression at the heart of some diseases.

"Signals of Epigenetic Modification in Sjogrens Syndrome ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The objective of the project is to characterize the potential role of DNA methylation patterns in Sjögren's Syndrome (SS) disease etiology and mechanism. A growing body of evidence indicates that epigenetic changes, in particular, altered patterns of DNA methylation, contribute to the development of autoimmune disease and can mediate genetic risk factors. To date, aberrant DNA methylation has been associated with several human autoimmune diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus. My proposal focuses on the identification of unique epigenetic profiles in SS, focusing primarily on T cells, B cells, and salivary gland tissue, a primary site of the inflammatory disease. An understanding of these profiles in the context of genetic background, publicly available genomic data (RNA, ChIP-seq, WGBS) and annotation data (TF binding motifs, genomic QTLs), and cell types have the potential to significantly transform our understanding of SS etiology, particularly given the well-established heterogeneity in clinical manifestations. Further, these DNA methylation profiles could become useful clinical biomarkers for determining risk and prognosis in SS, especially if their biological relevance can be validated in future functional studies. The overall hypothesis of this project is that DNA methylation changes in key genomic regions are associated with SS status and phenotype. The project will use genome-wide SNP data, epigenome-wide methylation array data, and clinical characteristics abstracted from 100 SS cases and 20 controls to address 3 related hypotheses: First, that epigenome-wide DNA methylation patterns in T cells, B cells (both derived from peripheral blood), and salivary gland biopsy tissue are associated with primary SS status after correcting for cell-type heterogeneity. Case-control differences will be tested using supervised machine learning algorithms, new region-discovery methods, and cell-mixture inference techniques. Publicly available data (listed above) will be used to infer biological relevance. Second, that epigenome-wide DNA methylation patterns in these samples are representative of SS sub-phenotypes. Cases (and initially controls) will be clustered using principal component analysis (PCA) applied to all relevant DNA methylation probes and subsets of probes measuring CpGs implicated in specific pathways relevant to SS. The reduced representations will be tested for association with specific clinical and serological profiles. Third, that risk alleles identifie by genome-wide association studies (GWAS) are directly or indirectly associated with SS-specific DNA methylation patterns. Allelic dosage and random forest selection frequency (RFSF) analyses will be used to identify novel methylation quantitative trait loci within SS-associated genes in cases and controls (separately), and we will test whether cell-proportion or eQTLs can explain SS-specific methylation patterns.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Sjögren's Syndrome is a chronic, highly heterogenous, multisystem autoimmune disease predominantly affecting women. This disease is known to be associated with epigenetic changes, including DNA methylation, an axis of epigenetic variation that has been implicated as a mediator of disease risk in other autoimmune diseases. Full characterization of DNA methylation patterns across different cell types and affected tissues will provide new insights into disease etiology, phenotype classification, and targets for future therapeutic strategies.                ",Signals of Epigenetic Modification in Sjogrens Syndrome,9038173,F31DE025176,"['Aberrant DNA Methylation', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Autoimmunity', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biopsy', 'Carbon', 'Cell Separation', 'Cells', 'ChIP-seq', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Country', 'CpG dinucleotide', 'Cytosine', 'DNA', 'DNA Methylation', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Enrollment', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Etiology', 'European', 'Exhibits', 'Fellowship', 'Female', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Code', 'Genomic Segment', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Individual National Research Service Award', 'Inflammatory', 'International', 'Labial Salivary Gland', 'Lasso', 'Link', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'Modification', 'Not Hispanic or Latino', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Population', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'RNA', 'Resources', 'Rheumatoid Arthritis', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Salivary Gland Tissue', 'Salivary Glands', 'Sampling', 'Serological', 'Severity of illness', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Sjogren&apos', 's Syndrome', 'Staging', 'Subgroup', 'System', 'Systemic Lupus Erythematosus', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissues', 'Trans-Activators', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Woman', 'Work', 'abstracting', 'base', 'bead chip', 'case control', 'cell type', 'chromatin remodeling', 'clinical biomarkers', 'disease heterogeneity', 'disease phenotype', 'disorder risk', 'dosage', 'epigenetic variation', 'epigenome', 'epigenome-wide association studies', 'forest', 'genetic risk factor', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'high throughput technology', 'histone modification', 'insight', 'methylation pattern', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'peripheral blood', 'pre-doctoral', 'public health relevance', 'repository', 'risk variant', 'transcription factor', 'whole genome']",NIDCR,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,F31,2016,39129,0.10505264926538953
"Methods for analysis of regulatory variation in cellular differentiation One of the key challenges in human genomics currently is to dissect the impact of sequence variation on gene regulation. Characterizing the functional consequences of regulatory variation would lead to a greater understanding of evolutionary constraint on gene expression, improved interpretation of whole genome sequencing, and a more complete picture of the genetic architecture of complex disease. However, interpreting non-coding genetic variation remains difficult, particularly due to the complexity of gene regulation, which is highly specific to cell-type and environmental context. Understanding how disease-associated genetic variation impacts human tissues requires that we identify mechanisms behind cell-type-specific regulatory variation. In order to address these important goals, we propose to create a resource in which we can directly assay a range of regulatory phenotypes in multiple cell-types. We propose to establish a panel of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from 70 individuals and collect genomic data from iPSCs and differentiated cells. This empirical effort will be complemented by formulating a novel statistical methodology to integrate data across different assays, cell-types, time points, and individuals; to robustly identify regulatory networks and genetic variants that affect gene regulation in each context. Together, these contributions will provide a basis for ongoing study of gene regulation and sequence variation in multiple disease-relevant cell types using a renewable model system and novel methods for robust analysis of these data. In Aim 1, we propose to develop the resource of 70 iPSC lines, where we will collect extensive molecular regulatory phenotypes at multiple time points throughout differentiation to three cell types (cardiomyocytes, neurons and hepatocytes). Measuring gene expression, chromatin accessibility, and methylation in each sample throughout differentiation, we will provide a detailed picture of the cascade of regulatory influences active in each cell type and during development. In Aim 2, we propose to develop a novel statistical framework for inferring universal and cell- type-specific regulatory factors from multi-dimensional data spanning cell-types, individuals, phenotypes, and time points. We specify a machine learning method based on Bayesian hierarchical transfer learning that provides dramatically increased power to detect shared effects while explicitly identifying context-specific regulatory changes. This approach will be adopted to infer regulatory networks, identify key regulatory sequence elements, and map QTLs in each phenotype and cell type. In Aim 3, we will utilize the empirical data and novel methods to infer regulatory relationships and mechanisms underlying genetic variants associated with gene expression in primary tissue and with disease. We will do this by performing a careful integration of external association studies. All samples, cell lines, data, computational tools, and analytical results will be made freely available to the community. We expect our project will greatly advance the understanding of gene regulation, the consequences of genetic variation in diverse cell-types, and the genetic basis of disease. Project narrative: Understanding the impact of individual genetic variation on diverse tissues and cell types in the human body is essential to dissecting the genetics of complex human diseases. Here, we gather data from multiple cell types derived from induced pluripotent stem cells, and develop a novel statistical framework for integrative analysis of data across individuals, cell types, and time points. Our approach provides a transformative approach for understanding gene regulation and the effects of genetic variation on individual health.  ",Methods for analysis of regulatory variation in cellular differentiation,9157021,R01GM120167,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Affect', 'Architecture', 'Behavior', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Models', 'Cardiac Myocytes', 'Cell Line', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Ectoderm', 'Elements', 'Endoderm', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genomics', 'Germ Layers', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hepatocyte', 'Hour', 'Human Genetics', 'Human body', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mesoderm', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Neurons', 'Outcome', 'Phenotype', 'Process', 'Psychological Transfer', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Regulatory Element', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Specificity', 'Staging', 'Statistical Methods', 'Supporting Cell', 'System', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'base', 'cell type', 'computerized tools', 'genetic variant', 'genome sequencing', 'genomic data', 'histone modification', 'human disease', 'human genomics', 'human tissue', 'improved', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'learning strategy', 'novel', 'pluripotency', 'programs', 'statistics', 'trait', 'transcriptomics', 'whole genome']",NIGMS,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R01,2016,404036,0.0335953929040637
"Super-enhancer structure defines a signature of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this proposal is to decipher the genetic basis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) by integrating genome-wide association studies (GWAS) with the chromatin modification information in human immune system. Accumulating evidence suggests that IBD results from an inappropriate inflammatory response to intestinal microbes in a genetically susceptible host. Among complex diseases, GWAS methods have been successful in IBD, identifying hundreds of non-overlapping genetic risk loci. However, the majority of these disease-associated DNA variants fall into the gene-desert part of the genome, complicating their functional evaluation. There is now overwhelming evidence that the noncoding disease-associated DNA variants disrupt the action of key regulatory elements in relevant cell types. Since genomic coordinates of active regulatory elements can be charted using unique chromatin features, genome-wide profiling of chromatin modifications in relevant cell types can be used to pinpoint to DNA variants disrupting active regulatory elements.  Two recent studies discovered a novel kind of enhancers that occurs within exceptionally large genomic domains. These regions were initially dubbed as 'super-enhancers'. Super-enhancer domains occur at key identity genes in a variety of cell types. Strikingly, these enhancer domains are more sensitive to perturbation such as loss of transcription factors than typical shorter enhancers.  Because of the fragility of super-enhancers to perturbation, I postulate that super-enhancer domains of relevant immune cells harbor IBD-associated DNA variants. To test this hypothesis, in Aim 1 of this proposal, I will characterize super-enhancer structures of the human immune system. I will first develop an unsupervised machine learning technique to chart super-enhancer structures from histone acetylation (H3K27Ac) data in diverse immune cells. Using this technique, I will next delineate cell type- specific enhancer domains in the immune cells and investigate the relationship among cells types with respect to their super-enhancer structures. In Aim 2 of this proposal, I will investigate the enrichment of IBD-associated DNA variants within the super-enhancers of the most relevant immune cells. I then link these variants to genes and pathways that they regulate and are affected in disease utilizing gene expression and long-range chromatin interaction datasets. Completion of these aims, along with training opportunities associated with this proposal will establish the necessary foundation for my career as an independent investigator. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, the two common forms of (IBD), affect over 2.5 million people in North America and Europe. GWAS methods have identified hundreds of non-overlapping genetic risk loci in IBD. Yet, the functional effects of mos IBD-implicated variants remain largely unexplained. The finding that nearly 90% of these sites occur outside of protein-coding sequences suggests that many associated variants may instead have a role in gene regulation. Cell context is a key determinant of gene regulation but where IBD genetic variants are functional is largely unknown. This proposal seeks to utilize the chromatin structure of human immune cells to discover the cell context for IBD-associated variants. The identification of the pathogenic cell types as well as the molecular pathways that contribute to the disease will contribute greatly to our ability to treat patients.",Super-enhancer structure defines a signature of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD),9068802,K22AI112570,"['Address', 'Affect', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Binding Sites', 'Blood Cells', 'CD14 gene', 'CD19 gene', 'CD3 Antigens', 'CD4 Positive T Lymphocytes', 'CD8B1 gene', 'Cataloging', 'Catalogs', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'Chromatin Structure', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Crohn&apos', 's disease', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Disease susceptibility', 'Enhancers', 'Epithelial', 'Europe', 'Evaluation', 'Foundations', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Enhancer Element', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Histone Acetylation', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune system', 'Individual', 'Inflammatory', 'Inflammatory Bowel Diseases', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Intestines', 'Junk DNA', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Microbe', 'Molecular', 'NCAM1 gene', 'National Human Genome Research Institute', 'Natural Immunity', 'North America', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Play', 'Proteins', 'Regulatory Element', 'Research Personnel', 'Rheumatoid Arthritis', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Site', 'Structure', 'Susceptibility Gene', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Ulcerative Colitis', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'Work', 'adaptive immunity', 'base', 'career', 'cell type', 'chromatin modification', 'cohort', 'commensal microbes', 'epigenomics', 'falls', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'human disease', 'interest', 'markov model', 'monocyte', 'novel', 'risk variant', 'training opportunity', 'transcription factor']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,K22,2016,105224,-0.009994844550532839
"Genetic and epigenetic contributions to Sjogren's syndrome DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): High throughput whole genome platforms to quantitatively and efficiently assay human DNA methylation provide an extraordinary opportunity to accelerate progress in the identification of epigenetic mechanisms for complex human autoimmune diseases such as Sjogren's Syndrome (SS). Epigenetic modifications, such as methylation of the 5' carbon of cytosine which occurs in the context of CpG dinucleotides, do not affect the genetic sequence; however, they do play a critical role in transcriptional regulation of a gene and subsequent gene expression. We have applied this technology, in conjunction with whole genome SNP genotyping to a clinically well-characterized collection of SS cases and controls developed specifically for genetic and epigenetic studies. Samples from the Sjogren's International Collaborative Clinical Alliance (SICCA) repository (total n=3,500 individuals) will b utilized, given the careful phenotype characterization and standardized collection of biospecimens that has been performed for each participant. For this proposal, we have initially obtained DNA from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and sorted cell populations with high purity, including CD14+ monocytes, CD19+ B cells, CD4+ T cells, as well as labial salivary gland biopsy tissue from 120 SICCA participants (100 SS cases and 20 controls). Data collected for ~450,000 highly informative CpG sites spanning 22,000 genes across the genome will provide a comprehensive assessment of DNA methylation for each individual for our proposed study Aims. As part of Aim 1, DNA methylation profiles will be examined using three main approaches: 1) Global DNA methylation profiles will be analyzed for association with SS risk in all sample types; 2) Multidimensional scaling analysis (MDS) and principal components analysis (PCA) will be performed to determine whether SS case samples can be distinguished from control samples; and 3) Local analyses will also be performed and will focus specifically on DNA methylation changes within candidate SS genes and genes demonstrating at least 1.5 fold methylation differences between cases and controls. Our proposal will take advantage of available whole genome data for each study participant and results from the largest genome wide association study (GWAS) in SS. In Aim 2, we will utilize DNA methylation profiles and methods from Aim 1 to determine whether important SS case phenotypes can be distinguished from one another. We will identify top ranked CpG sites that are either hypo or hyper methylated in specific SS case groups or that distinguish cases from controls using supervised machine learning algorithms. We will attempt replication for all top findings in an independent dataset, followed by random effects meta-analysis to incorporate other SS risk factors. Finally, we will determine whether DNA methylation profiles of interest from Aims 1 and 2 can be detected in DNA from whole blood for potential use as a biomarker. The identification of unique epigenetic profiles in SS, and an understanding of these profiles in the context of different cell and tissue types and genetic background have the potential to significantly transform our understanding of SS etiology. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE New molecular genetic assays offer an extraordinary opportunity to accelerate progress in the identification of epigenetic mechanisms for complex human autoimmune diseases such as Sjogren's Syndrome (SS). We propose to perform a comprehensive screen of more than 450,000 highly informative CpG sites spanning 22,000 genes across the genome using DNA derived from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), sorted cell populations, and labial salivary gland biopsy tissue from SS cases and control individuals to identify epigenetic profiles that are predictive of disease risk and specifi clinical phenotypes. The identification of unique epigenetic profiles in SS, and an understanding of these profiles in the context of several different cell and tissue types and whole genome SNP data have the potential to significantly transform our understanding of SS etiology, and may lead to more effective approaches to prevention, diagnosis and treatment.",Genetic and epigenetic contributions to Sjogren's syndrome,8991063,R03DE024316,"['Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Autoantibodies', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Autoimmunity', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biopsy', 'Blood', 'Blood specimen', 'Budgets', 'CD14 gene', 'CD19 gene', 'CD4 Positive T Lymphocytes', 'Carbon', 'Cell Separation', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Country', 'CpG dinucleotide', 'Cytosine', 'DNA', 'DNA Methylation', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Enrollment', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Etiology', 'European', 'Exhibits', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genome', 'Genomic Segment', 'Genotype', 'Health', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Human', 'Individual', 'International', 'Labial Salivary Gland', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Molecular Genetics', 'National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research', 'Not Hispanic or Latino', 'Oral', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Population', 'Prevention approach', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Production', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'SNP genotyping', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'San Francisco', 'Site', 'Sjogren&apos', 's Syndrome', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Study Subject', 'Subgroup', 'Syndrome', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets', 'Technology', 'Tissues', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Whole Blood', 'Work', 'base', 'case control', 'cell type', 'clinical phenotype', 'disorder risk', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'high throughput technology', 'human DNA', 'interest', 'member', 'monocyte', 'repository', 'systemic autoimmune disease', 'whole genome']",NIDCR,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R03,2016,237102,0.08054501135122126
"Genome analysis based on the integration of DNA sequence and shape DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Current techniques for genome analysis are mainly based on the one-dimensional DNA sequence, comprised of the letters A, C, G, and T. However, proteins recognize DNA as a three-dimensional (3D) object. Nuances in DNA shape at single nucleotide resolution play a crucial role in the binding specificity of transcription facors (TFs), including those involved in embryonic development and human cancer. This project involves the development of a battery of tools for genome analysis, through the integration of information derived from the DNA sequence and the 3D structure of DNA, or ""DNA shape"". The basis for these novel tools is a high- throughput (HT) method for the prediction of multiple features of local DNA shape at the genomic scale. Data will be made available to the community in the UCSC Genome Browser track format through a web server interface. These tools will enable users to analyze the shape of any number or length of DNA sequences, including whole genomes and the effect of DNA methylation. HT shape predictions will be validated based on X-ray crystallography, NMR spectroscopy, and hydroxyl radical cleavage data. Predictions will be combined with ORChID, an ENCODE project that infers DNA minor groove geometry from hydroxyl radical cleavage experiments. The HT method will be used to study how paralogous TFs select different target sites in vivo despite sharing core-binding motifs or having similar binding properties in vitro. To study this question, we will investigate the effect of flanking sequences on multiple structural features of TF binding sites (TFBSs). The initial focus of this study will be homeodomains and basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) TFs. Other protein families will later be included and used to construct a comprehensive TFBS database that provides shape features for binding motifs derived from JASPAR and other motif databases. Structural effects of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) will also be analyzed. Some SNPs are associated with deleterious functions, whereas others have no apparent effect. The HT shape prediction method will be used to predict the function of SNPs in non-coding regions based on DNA shape. We will correlate quantitative effects of SNPs on DNA structure with expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) and genome-wide association study (GWAS) signals, to develop a predictive tool for the functional effect of SNPs. The HT shape prediction approach will be used to design DNA sequences with different AT/GC contents but similar shapes. The relative contributions of sequence and shape to binding will be tested with analytic models including multiple linear regression (MLR) and support vector regression (SVR). For systems in which the integration of sequence and shape proves advantageous, novel motif finding tools will be developed based on an extended alphabet that combines sequence with informative structural features, selected by machine learning and feature selection approaches. Sequence+shape motifs will be tested by motif scanning, compared to sequence-only motifs, and integrated into the MEME Suite. The goal of this sequence-shape integration is to increase the accuracy of finding in vivo TFBSs in the genome. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Protein-DNA recognition is a critical yet poorly understood component of gene regulation. This proposal will connect the fields of DNA sequence and structure analysis, which so far have been developed in parallel but largely disconnected from each other. Integration of the one-dimensional DNA sequence at a genome-wide scale with the three-dimensional DNA structure at atomic resolution will lead to the development of novel genome analysis tools and will advance our understanding of genome function, leading to fundamentally new insights into the mechanisms of gene regulation and its impact on human disease.",Genome analysis based on the integration of DNA sequence and shape,8998963,R01GM106056,"['Affect', 'Affinity', 'Algorithms', 'BHLH Protein', 'Base Pairing', 'Base Sequence', 'Benchmarking', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological Process', 'ChIP-on-chip', 'ChIP-seq', 'Characteristics', 'Communities', 'Computational algorithm', 'DNA', 'DNA Binding', 'DNA Databases', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA Sequence', 'DNA Structure', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'DNase-I Footprinting', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Databases', 'Deoxyribonuclease I', 'Development', 'Drosophila genus', 'Embryonic Development', 'Family', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genome Scan', 'Genomics', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Guanine + Cytosine Composition', 'Health', 'Helix-Turn-Helix Motifs', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Hydroxyl Radical', 'In Vitro', 'Internet', 'Lead', 'Length', 'Letters', 'Linear Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'Mining', 'Minor Groove', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Biology', 'NMR Spectroscopy', 'Nucleotides', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protein Family', 'Proteins', 'Publishing', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Sequence Analysis', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Width', 'X-Ray Crystallography', 'Yeasts', 'base', 'design', 'flexibility', 'genetic evolution', 'genome analysis', 'genome browser', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'homeodomain', 'human disease', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'member', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'predictive tools', 'research study', 'three dimensional structure', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'vector', 'whole genome']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,R01,2016,306949,0.040791234943215744
"Computational methods for modeling lineage-specific gene regulation DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Complex sensory and signaling pathways ultimately converge on the DNA in the form of complexes of interacting regulatory RNAs and proteins that bind specific gene-proximal and distal regulatory elements to active and repress genes resulting in the establishment and maintenance of cell-type specific transcriptional responses. These regulatory elements have static and dynamic components - the former encoded in the genomic sequence itself as combinations of transcription factor binding site sequence motifs and the latter a consequence of locus and cell-type specific chromatin accessibility and epigenomic modifications as well as the dynamic linking of distal regulatory elements to target genes. In addition, transcriptional and post-transcriptional feedback and control of the levels of regulatory proteins and RNAs also play a key role in dynamic cell-type specific gene regulation. One of the central challenges in modern genomics is to learn these rules by which the genome and epigenome encode regulatory information. How does a single genome sequence encode the information for exquisitely precise, and yet highly distinctive programs of gene regulation for different cell types, and at different time points? What are the key sequence determinants, and grammatical rules that determine the function of any given DNA sequence under any particular set of conditions? In this project we seek to use public data from The Roadmap Epigenomics project and The ENCODE project to make progress on these questions. We propose to build methods for interpreting shared and distinctive regulatory features, including especially transcription factor binding, across related cell types. In parallel, we will implement novel methods for identifying high-resolution, context-specific dynamic regulatory elements, decipher their underlying regulatory sequence grammars and learn predictive, integrative models of transcriptional regulation to decipher the effects of heterogeneous regulatory components on lineage-specific gene expression dynamics and provide regulatory annotations for large collections of curated and disease-associated gene sets. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The purpose of this project is to develop powerful statistical methods to study cell-type specific gene regulation, and apply these to publicly available data from The Roadmap Epigenomics Project, The ENCODE Project and several publicly available gene expression compendia. We propose new methods for joint inference of regulatory elements across diverse cell types, deciphering lineage-specific regulatory sequence grammars encoded in these elements and learning integrative transcriptional regulation programs.

"Epigenetic Transgenerational Endocrine Disruptor Actions DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A number of environmental toxicants were shown in the previous grant period to promote the epigenetic transgenerational inheritance of adult onset disease including the fungicide vinclozolin, pesticides, plastics (BPA and phthalates), dioxin, hydrocarbons, and DDT. The ability of environmental compounds (e.g. endocrine disruptors) to promote transgenerational disease phenotypes is anticipated to be a critical aspect of adult onset disease etiology. The transgenerational inheritance phenotype requires the heritable epigenetic alterations of the germline. The current proposal is designed to further investigate the molecular and developmental aspects of the epigenetic transgenerational inheritance phenomenon and assess the potential use of epigenetic biomarkers for exposure and disease. The general hypothesis tested is that ""transient fetal exposure around the period of gonadal sex determination to environmental toxicants (i.e. vinclozolin) promotes the reprogramming of the epigenome (i.e. DNA methylation) of the male germline that then transmits an imprinted-like epigenome to subsequent generations to induce the epigenetic transgenerational inheritance of adult onset disease (e.g. male infertility)"". The previous grant period focused on the analysis of the epigenetic alteration in the F3 generation sperm using promoter associated differential DNA methylation regions (epimutations), as well as documented the epigenetic and transcriptome changes in the F3 generation vinclozolin lineage primordial germ cells. The molecular etiology of somatic cell changes associated with ovary and testis disease was established. The current proposal further investigates the molecular and developmental aspects of the germline mediated epigenetic transgenerational inheritance of disease. The experimental approach to test the above hypothesis consists of the following specific aims: Aim 1) Determine the developmental and generational aspects of the genome-wide germline epimutations. Aim 2) Determine the genomic features associated with the epimutations and potential genetic alterations involved in the epigenetic transgenerational inheritance phenomenon. Aim 3) Determine the optimal exposure parameters of the environmental induced transgenerational model and correlate epigenetic biomarkers with exposure and disease. Completion of the proposed research will determine the cascade of epigenetic events involved in germ cell development that generates the sperm epimutations that transmit the epigenetic transgenerational inheritance of disease phenotypes. The protection of the sperm epimutations from DNA methylation erasure is anticipated in early embryonic development. The proposed research will further elucidate the molecular and developmental aspects of environmentally induced epigenetic transgenerational inheritance of disease and the potential use of epigenetic biomarkers for ancestral exposure and disease.

"Surveying transcription factor pioneer interactions with nucleosomal DNA Numerous studies have focused on cataloging the genome `parts list', including transcripts, transcription factor (TF) binding sites, and chromatin states. Transcriptional regulatory networks have been inferred based on these data, leading to models of what TFs are master regulators at or near the top of the regulatory hierarchy versus lineage- or condition-specific TFs, which are downstream of those regulators. However, none of these approaches directly identifies which factors engage inaccessible chromatin to initiate the transcriptional regulatory cascades. Pioneer factors serve as keys to chromatin accessibility for binding by the majority of TFs in a cell, by binding stably to nucleosomal DNA (`pioneer binding') and thus increase the DNA enzymatic accessibility of the chromatin (`pioneer activity'), allowing the sequential recruitment of other TFs on inactive chromatin. By priming cis regulatory elements for subsequent transcriptional regulatory activity, pioneer factors serve as `gatekeepers' to cellular differentiation. Despite their importance, little is known about pioneer factors, and only a handful have been characterized. A major hurdle in characterization of pioneer factors is the lack of a robust, high- throughput functional assay. In this project, we will develop a new technology, termed Pioneer Interactions On Nucleosomal Engineered ARrays (PIONEAR), for high-throughput characterization of pioneer binding. We will use PIONEAR assays to survey the pioneer interactions of dozens of human TFs. TFs identified by PIONEAR assays to exhibit pioneer binding will be evaluated in vivo to examine chromatin decompaction on a broader scale. Identification of TFs that exhibit pioneer activity may lead to breakthroughs in directed cellular differentiation and reprogramming and the development of improved therapies to target cancer stem cells. Control of cell states, such as in maintenance of pluripotency by stem cells or differentiation into defined cell lineages, holds promise for regenerative medicine and cancer therapeutics. These cell fate programs are initiated by `pioneer factors' that recognize their genomic target sites and induce hierarchies of gene regulatory programs. We will identify human pioneer factors and characterize their regulatory interactions.",Surveying transcription factor pioneer interactions with nucleosomal DNA,9206289,R21HG009268,"['Affect', 'Area', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Binding Sites', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Assay', 'Cataloging', 'Catalogs', 'Cell Lineage', 'Cells', 'ChIP-seq', 'Chromatin', 'DNase-I Footprinting', 'Data', 'Deoxyribonuclease I', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Developmental Process', 'Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Exhibits', 'Future', 'Gatekeeping', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Human', 'Hypersensitivity', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Modeling', 'Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'Nucleosomes', 'Property', 'Regenerative Medicine', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Reporting', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Site', 'Stem cells', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Transcript', 'Variant', 'base', 'cancer stem cell', 'cell type', 'ds-DNA', 'genome-wide', 'high throughput technology', 'histone modification', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'new technology', 'novel', 'pluripotency', 'programs', 'technology development', 'transcription factor']",NHGRI,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R21,2016,221875,0.07987861208260373
"High-throughput methods for elucidating the control of chromatin accessibility ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We will develop the first validated predictive model of how transcription factors dynamically determine genome-wide chromatin accessibility that is generalizable across biological systems. We will accomplish this goal with three specific aims. We will develop novel Genome Syntax to Regulation (GSR) models that accurately learn a genomic regulatory vocabulary and predict how phrases in this vocabulary control chromatin accessibility (Aim 1). As part of this aim we will identify transcription factor binding motifs tha are in the discovered regulatory vocabulary. We will validate and refine the causality of these models by testing whether they accurately predict the chromatin accessibility of thousands of synthetic DNA ""phrases"" that have been engineered into specific genomic locations and measured in the context of transcription factor gain-of-function and loss-of-function studies. The phrases will be designed to elucidate both the factors and grammar that control chromatin opening in several distinct cellular states (Aim 2). We will use our predictive models to assign importance scores to individual genome bases and to predict how selected factors alter chromatin accessibility genome wide (Aim 3). We will test the ability of our importance scores to identify regulatory SNPs in the context of human genome-wide association study (GWAS) data, and we will validate model predictions of changes in whole genome chromatin accessibility in response to ectopic factor expression. Through computational modeling of the effect of such ectopic factor expression, we will develop a predictive understanding of how transcription factors alter chromatin state, laying the groundwork for a novel regenerative medicine paradigm of predictive cellular programming. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Access to the information in our genomes is regulated by a cell much like doors in a building can regulate access to rooms that contain instructions. The control over which doors are open in a cell regulates which instructions are accessible in a cell-type specific way. We will understand the code that controls the doors to our genome, and improve human health by understanding what genome changes interfere with door control and demonstrating that we can program cells to open and close their doors to create cells that might be able to serve as replacements for damaged cells in our bodies.",High-throughput methods for elucidating the control of chromatin accessibility,9066734,R01HG008363,"['Access to Information', 'Base Pairing', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'Chromatin Modeling', 'Code', 'Computer Simulation', 'Controlled Vocabulary', 'DNA', 'DNA Library', 'DNA Sequence', 'DNase I hypersensitive sites sequencing', 'Data', 'Ectopic Expression', 'Engineering', 'Enhancers', 'Etiology', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Individual', 'Instruction', 'Knock-out', 'Learning', 'Libraries', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Oligonucleotides', 'Pancreas', 'Proteins', 'Regenerative Medicine', 'Regulation', 'Regulatory Element', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Vocabulary', 'Work', 'base', 'biological systems', 'cell injury', 'cell type', 'combinatorial', 'design', 'embryonic stem cell', 'gain of function', 'genetic regulatory protein', 'genome editing', 'genome sequencing', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'improved', 'loss of function', 'novel', 'overexpression', 'phrases', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'promoter', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'stem cell differentiation', 'syntax', 'synthetic construct', 'transcription factor', 'whole genome']",NHGRI,MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2016,748525,0.057156332410677614
"Comparative analysis and regulatory architecture of epigenomics datasets ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The NIH Roadmap Epigenomics and ENCODE projects have generated a collection of 3000+ epigenomics datasets, including histone modification, DNA methylation, gene expression, and DNaseI hypersensitivity profiled across 190 cell and tissue types. In order to maximize its impact on gene regulation, cellular differentiation, and human health, novel computational analyses are needed. To address this challenge, we will develop new methods for epigenomic analysis, building on our extensive experience interpreting epigenomic information, and our preliminary studies building chromatin states, activity clusters, and regulatory motif maps for the Roadmap Epigenomics and ENCODE datasets. In Aim 1, we will characterize epigenomic differences and changes during lineage differentiation by developing new tools for systematic comparison of groups of epigenomes that directly exploit the complexity of epigenomic datasets; we will also develop methods for clustering epigenomes into developmental lineages based on automatically-learned diverse epigenomic features that distinguish them; and methods that learn the unidirectional epigenomic changes that pluripotent cells undergo during lineage commitment to gain more insights into differentiation and automatically learn to classify lineages and differentiation trajectories. In Am 2, we will seek to characterize higher-order chromatin architecture and chromatin conformation to enable systematic interpretation of cis-regulatory modules: we will develop a novel statistical approach for enhancer-enhancer and enhancer-gene linking to reveal interacting regions and their target genes based on their coordinated activity patterns across cell and tissue types; we will train a supervised learning method for predicting both constitutive and tissue-specific chromatin conformation information based on chromatin state information, individual chromatin marks, genomic distance, activity, regulatory motif information, and DNA sequence; and we will use these higher-order interaction maps to predict gene expression levels based on the combined action of multiple regulatory regions and to define the cis-regulatory architecture of each gene in the human genome. The resulting resources will be invaluable for studies of gene regulation, by revealing the set of regulatory elements that are linked to each gene, and for the interpretation of genetic studies, by revealing the set of regulatory elements which jointly act to regulate each target gene and the potential target genes of non-coding variants associated with human disease. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The NIH ENCODE and Roadmap Epigenomics projects have generated a collection of 4000+ epigenomics datasets across 200+ cell and tissue types, which can be invaluable to the scientific community, but novel computational analyses are needed to maximize its impact on gene regulation, cellular differentiation, and human health. To address this need, we propose to systematically study epigenomic differences between cell types, lineages, and stages of differentiation, and to learn models predicting the higher-order chromatin structures across cell/tissue types, within each cell/tissue, and the chromatin architectures that they define. By systematically interpreting epigenomic annotations in the context of their cellular differentiation and their higher-order chromatin structures, the resultin resource will greatly increase their impact on human health by enabling disease studies to understand the mechanistic relationship between non-coding variants and their target genes, and the specific differentiation stages in which they act.",Comparative analysis and regulatory architecture of epigenomics datasets,9038385,R01GM113708,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'Chromosomes', 'Classification', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Analysis', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Enhancers', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genetic study', 'Genomics', 'Graph', 'Health', 'Higher Order Chromatin Structure', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Hypersensitivity', 'Individual', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'Nucleosomes', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Phylogenetic Analysis', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Resources', 'Shapes', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Staging', 'Statistical Methods', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'base', 'cell type', 'comparative', 'comparison group', 'differential expression', 'epigenome', 'epigenomics', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'genetic association', 'genome wide association study', 'histone modification', 'human disease', 'innovation', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'rare variant', 'research study', 'tool', 'ward']",NIGMS,MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2016,284106,0.060228418493747014
"""Ribonomics"" of Gene Regulation to predict Innate Immune Responses DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The expression of genes involves a sequence of enzymatic events, such as transcription, mRNA processing, mRNA decay, and translation, that are subject to gene regulatory networks (GRNs) of protein-nucleic acid interactions. It is well appreciated that the control of transcription via regulatory networks that regulate enhancer and promoter activities are not the sole determinant of what gene products result, but that exon skipping is pervasive and post-transcriptional mechanisms such as mRNA splicing and decay determine the kinetics of mRNA induction and abundance. Indeed, in our preliminary studies of the macrophage response to pathogens, we find that a majority of induced gene expression events result in mRNAs that deviate substantially from those predicted by the genome-browser, and that mRNA decay is controlled by both protein- nucleic acid and miRNA regulatory networks. The proposed Center for the ""Ribonomics"" of Gene Regulation leverages and pioneers Next Gen Sequencing and computational modeling approaches to develop a predictive model for which mRNA isoforms are expressed and at what level given a given promoter activity and transcription initiation rate. We will develop generally applicable tools in conjunction with or in depth and quantitative experimental analysis of the macrophage response to pathogen-associated endotoxin, which results in the dramatic up regulation of more than 1000 genes. Strikingly, our preliminary data identified more than 900 exon skipping events in addition to numerous cases of alternative 5' or 3' splice site use, emphasizing the essential contribution of post-initiation events. Further, these splice patterns are dependent on the macrophage subtype-specific chromatin landscape and are altered by inducible splice factors in primed or tolerated states. Thus we will leverage the well-described macrophage biology and associated experimental model systems, to examine the role of gene structure and sequence (Aim 1), the role of chromatin modifications (Aim 2), and of trans-acting splicing factors (Aim 3) in determining the identity of mature mRNAs and their associated synthesis rates, before adding the stimulus-responsive regulatory networks that confer mRNA half-life control and thus determine the abundance of each mRNA isoform (Aim 4).

"VISION: ValIdated Systematic IntegratiON of epigenomic data Project Summary VISION: ValIdated Systematic IntegratiON of hematopoietic epigenomes Technological advances enabling the production of large numbers of rich, genome-wide, sequence-based datasets have transformed biology. However, the volume of data is overwhelming for most investigators. Also, we do not know the mechanisms by which the vast majority of epigenetic features regulate normal differentiation or lead to aberrant function in disease. We have formed an interdisciplinary, collaborative team of investigators to address the problem of how to effectively utilize the enormous amount of epigenetic data both for basic research and precision medicine. At this point, acquisition of data is no longer the major barrier to understanding mechanisms of gene regulation during normal and pathological tissue development. The chief challenges are how to: (i) integrate epigenetic data in terms that are accessible and understandable to a broad community of researchers, (ii) build validated quantitative models explaining how the dynamics of gene expression relates to epigenetic features, and (iii) translate information effectively from mouse models to potential applications in human health. These needs are addressed by the proposed ValIdated Systematic IntegratiON (VISION) of epigenetic data to analyze mouse and human hematopoiesis, a tractable system with clear clinical significance and importance to NIDDK. By pursuing the following Specific Aims, the interdisciplinary collaboration will deliver comprehensive catalogs of cis regulatory modules (CRMs), extensive chromatin interaction maps and deduced regulatory domains, validated quantitative models for gene regulation, and a guide for investigators to translate insights from mouse models to human clinical studies. These deliverables will be provided to the community in readily accessible, web-based platforms including customized genome browsers, databases with facile query interfaces, and data-driven on-line tools. Specifically, the proposed work in Aim 1 will build comprehensive, integrative catalogs of hematopoietic CRMs and transcriptomes by compiling and determining informative epigenetic features and transcript levels in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells and in mature cells. CRMs will be predicted using the novel IDEAS (Integrative and Discriminative Epigenome Annotation System) method. Work proposed in Aim 2 will build and validate quantitative models for gene regulation informed by chromatin interaction maps and epigenetic data. Compiling and determining chromosome interaction frequencies will predict likely target genes for CRMs. Gene regulatory models will be built that predict the contributions of CRMs and specific proteins to regulated expression; these models will be validated by extensive testing using genome-editing in ten reference loci. Finally, work in Aim 3 will produce a guide for investigators to translate insights from mouse models to human clinical studies. This effort will include categorizing orthologous mouse and human genes by conservation versus divergence of expression patterns, assigning CRMs to informative categories of epigenomic evolution, and testing the interspecies functional maps experimentally by genome-editing. Project Narrative VISION: ValIdated Systematic IntegratiON of hematopoietic epigenomes Blood cell formation is vitally important to human health because we must continually replace old and damaged cells, and because many diseases result from mis-regulation of gene expression during blood formation. Global measurements of proteins bound to DNA and their modifications help us find the genetic differences most likely to account for the aberrant gene expression at the heart of some diseases.

"Enhancer-mediated mechanisms of pattern formation ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Gene regulatory networks establish the body plans of complex multicellular animals. The main components of these networks are transcription factors and cis-regulatory elements (CREs) that contain unique combinations of transcription factor binding sites. Transgenic experiments have shown that CREs control spatial and temporal patterns of gene expression, but how binding events at the CRE level are converted into these patterns is still poorly understood. In humans, mutations that disrupt transcription factor activit or CRE DNA sequences can cause birth defects and disease states, including cancer. Here we propose to study CRE- mediated embryo patterning in the early Drosophila embryo, with a specific focus on CREs that respond to the maternal transcription factor Bicoid (Bcd). In previous work, we identified 66 Bcd-dependent CREs, which were validated by reporter genes in transgenic embryos. All 66 are directly activated by Bcd, but each contains a unique set of transcription factor-binding sites, and drives an expression pattern that appears as a band(s) or stripe(s) at a specific position(s) along the anterior-posterior (AP) axis. Expression pattern boundaries represent positions where genes make on/off decisions, and foreshadow boundaries between cells of different fates later in development. The work proposed here will focus on two major goals. First, we want to perform a deep, quantitative analysis of transcriptional activation by a single ""model"" CRE (hunchback P2E) that is activated by BCD. Two specific questions will be addressed: 1. how do individual binding sites, groups of binding sites, and combinations of sites for different factors contribute to transcriptional activation? We will combine DNA-binding data of different types to better define functional motifs, extensively mutate the CRE, and assay three specific output parameters using live imaging in close collaboration with Thomas Gregor's lab. 2. How does this Bcd-dependent CRE ""choose"" its specific basal promoter? We will use a split reporter system and single molecule FISH to identify basal promoter sequences that allow or prevent activation by Bcd, and CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing to test the importance of promoter choice in vivo. The second major goal will be to gain a conceptually complete understanding of the regulatory network that creates Bcd-dependent gene expression patterns. We have identified three proteins that function in broad activation, and nine candidate repressors expressed in discrete domains that together cover the entire embryonic region where activation can occur. We will use reporter gene manipulations and single molecule FISH to test how repressor gradients shape boundaries of gene expression, and genetics and reporter genes to test the roles of several newly identified repressors that prevent activation in anterior regions. Our hypothesis is that the expression patterns driven by all Bcd-dependent CREs are ""computed"" by specific combinations of binding sites for these twelve factors. These experiments will make significant contributions to our general understanding of how CREs functions in activation and repression events, and how embryos establish body plans.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Animal body plans are established by hundreds of DNA-binding factors that bind thousands of cis-regulatory elements (CREs). Our goals are to carry out the deepest analysis of gene activation by a single CRE in higher eukaryotes, and to understand how multiple CREs integrates activation and repression to pattern the embryo.            ",Enhancer-mediated mechanisms of pattern formation,9106490,R01GM051946,"['Address', 'Affinity', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Anterior', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Models', 'Body Patterning', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Collaborations', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Congenital Abnormality', 'DNA Binding', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Defect', 'Development', 'Developmental Gene', 'Disease', 'Dissection', 'Drosophila genus', 'Elements', 'Embryo', 'Enhancers', 'Eukaryota', 'Event', 'Funding', 'Gene Activation', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Gene Order', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Homeodomain Proteins', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Length', 'Life', 'Link', 'Logic', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Output', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Formation', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Proteins', 'RNA', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Reporter', 'Reporter Genes', 'Repression', 'Role', 'Shapes', 'Site', 'System', 'Tertiary Protein Structure', 'Testing', 'Transact', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Transgenic Organisms', 'Work', 'Zinc Fingers', 'base', 'cofactor', 'fly', 'in vitro Assay', 'in vivo', 'loss of function mutation', 'morphogens', 'prevent', 'promoter', 'protein function', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'single molecule', 'transcription factor']",NIGMS,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY,R01,2016,360706,0.03141999360864883
"Statistical Methods for Network-Based Integrative Analysis of CVD Epigenetic Data ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project involves the development of new statistical methodologies and computational tools for network-based integrative analysis of epigenetic risk factors of cardiovascular diseases (CVD). While the advent of omics data from new technologies has facilitated the study of epigenetic factors, existing methodologies often do not account for complexities of biological data  such as correlations due to interactions of genes/proteins as part of biological pathways  and fail to eﬃciently integrate diverse omics data sets  for instance genetic variation, DNA methylation and gene expression. The methodologies proposed in this project, and the software tools that will be developed to implement them, address these shortcomings, and facilitate further research by the biomedical community to gain a better understanding of the underlying biology of CVD, and to develop new diagnostic biomarkers and potential targets for therapies. The proposed methodologies are motivated by the study of epigenetic data from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA), and include (i) a network-based pathway enrichment analysis method that incorporates available knowledge of interactions among genes and proteins while complementing and reﬁning such information (Aim 1A), as well as its extension for analysis of multiple types of omics data (Aim 1B), and (ii) an integrative analysis framework to identify associations among gene expression levels and DNA methylation (Aim 2A) and identify common epigenetic factors of multiple CVD phenotypes through integrated analysis of DNA methylation and mRNA expression data (Aim 2B). We will develop eﬃcient and user-friendly software tools for the proposed methods (Aim 3), which will be made freely available to the public after extensive tests using both simulated data, as well as real data from MESA.

"MODELING DNA METHYLATION'S ROLE IN GENE REGULATION DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Changes in patterns of DNA methylation, a modulator of gene expression, play a key role in development and disease. There has been a flurry of development of new experimental methods to accurately map 5- methylcytosine and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine genome-wide. However, development of computational techniques to interpret these data has lagged behind. Current analytical methods are mostly concerned with visualization of genome-level correlations between DNA methylation and other epigenetic marks or with the identification of differentially methylated regions between samples. These tools have performed poorly when trying to link methylation and expression changes at specific loci, and they find quite weak genome-wide correlations between them. We hypothesize that such discrepancies are due to limitations of the current analysis methods, which tend to oversimplify local DNA methylation signals. We propose to develop a new suite of tools using methods from computer vision to associate spatially-similar methylation changes with corresponding changes in transcription. This approach allows us to make minimal assumptions about what these signals should look like. First, we use Dynamic Time Warping (DTW), a curve similarity metric, to cluster genes together based on their methylation signals. We then find clusters of genes with similar methylation patterns that have coordinated differential expression. We export the patterns defined by these curves for use as a classifier, enabling us to enumerate genes with associated methylation and expression changes. Our model considers the entire shape and course of the signal around the gene promoter, rather than averaging the signal across windows or modeling signals with idealized statistical distributions. We recently published how our method discovered a variety of DNA methylation patterns associated with gene silencing, and produced longer and markedly higher quality gene lists than those generated by other methods. In this proposal we build on these results to address three aims concerning DNA methylation's role in gene silencing: (1) We will build a classifier to model the methylation patterns we discover and use it to examine the role of DNA hypomethylation, which occurs primarily at alternative and retrotransposon promoters that are poorly annotated, in transcriptome regulation in breast cancer. (2) We will expand our model to address the controversial role of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine in gene regulation and its interplay with 5-methylcytosine in differentiated cells in the central nervous system. (3) We will develop general rules governing the methylation signatures we have identified and experimentally validate their functionality. This proposal will yield a set of experimentally validated models for how DNA methylation contributes to gene silencing as well as a set of computational tools other researchers can use to analyze the role of methylation in human disease. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: DNA methylation is an important regulator of gene expression. Abnormal patterns of methylation are often found in cancer and other human diseases. We will develop a set of computational tools, inspired by methods from computer vision, to identify DNA methylation patterns associated with either gene silencing or activation from genomic data. We will elucidate and experimentally validate general rules governing these relationships. All software will be made publically available to broadly advance cancer-research nationwide.

"Signals of Epigenetic Modification in Sjogrens Syndrome ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The objective of the project is to characterize the potential role of DNA methylation patterns in Sjögren's Syndrome (SS) disease etiology and mechanism. A growing body of evidence indicates that epigenetic changes, in particular, altered patterns of DNA methylation, contribute to the development of autoimmune disease and can mediate genetic risk factors. To date, aberrant DNA methylation has been associated with several human autoimmune diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus. My proposal focuses on the identification of unique epigenetic profiles in SS, focusing primarily on T cells, B cells, and salivary gland tissue, a primary site of the inflammatory disease. An understanding of these profiles in the context of genetic background, publicly available genomic data (RNA, ChIP-seq, WGBS) and annotation data (TF binding motifs, genomic QTLs), and cell types have the potential to significantly transform our understanding of SS etiology, particularly given the well-established heterogeneity in clinical manifestations. Further, these DNA methylation profiles could become useful clinical biomarkers for determining risk and prognosis in SS, especially if their biological relevance can be validated in future functional studies. The overall hypothesis of this project is that DNA methylation changes in key genomic regions are associated with SS status and phenotype. The project will use genome-wide SNP data, epigenome-wide methylation array data, and clinical characteristics abstracted from 100 SS cases and 20 controls to address 3 related hypotheses: First, that epigenome-wide DNA methylation patterns in T cells, B cells (both derived from peripheral blood), and salivary gland biopsy tissue are associated with primary SS status after correcting for cell-type heterogeneity. Case-control differences will be tested using supervised machine learning algorithms, new region-discovery methods, and cell-mixture inference techniques. Publicly available data (listed above) will be used to infer biological relevance. Second, that epigenome-wide DNA methylation patterns in these samples are representative of SS sub-phenotypes. Cases (and initially controls) will be clustered using principal component analysis (PCA) applied to all relevant DNA methylation probes and subsets of probes measuring CpGs implicated in specific pathways relevant to SS. The reduced representations will be tested for association with specific clinical and serological profiles. Third, that risk alleles identifie by genome-wide association studies (GWAS) are directly or indirectly associated with SS-specific DNA methylation patterns. Allelic dosage and random forest selection frequency (RFSF) analyses will be used to identify novel methylation quantitative trait loci within SS-associated genes in cases and controls (separately), and we will test whether cell-proportion or eQTLs can explain SS-specific methylation patterns.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Sjögren's Syndrome is a chronic, highly heterogenous, multisystem autoimmune disease predominantly affecting women. This disease is known to be associated with epigenetic changes, including DNA methylation, an axis of epigenetic variation that has been implicated as a mediator of disease risk in other autoimmune diseases. Full characterization of DNA methylation patterns across different cell types and affected tissues will provide new insights into disease etiology, phenotype classification, and targets for future therapeutic strategies.                ",Signals of Epigenetic Modification in Sjogrens Syndrome,8910299,F31DE025176,"['Aberrant DNA Methylation', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Autoimmunity', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biopsy', 'Carbon', 'Cell Separation', 'Cells', 'ChIP-seq', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Country', 'CpG dinucleotide', 'Cytosine', 'DNA', 'DNA Methylation', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Enrollment', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Etiology', 'European', 'Exhibits', 'Fellowship', 'Female', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Code', 'Genome', 'Genomic Segment', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Inflammatory', 'International', 'Labial Salivary Gland', 'Lasso', 'Link', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'Modification', 'Not Hispanic or Latino', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Population', 'Predoctoral Individual National Research Service Award', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'RNA', 'Resources', 'Rheumatoid Arthritis', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Salivary Gland Tissue', 'Salivary Glands', 'Sampling', 'Serological', 'Severity of illness', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Sjogren&apos', 's Syndrome', 'Staging', 'Subgroup', 'System', 'Systemic Lupus Erythematosus', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissues', 'Trans-Activators', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Woman', 'Work', 'abstracting', 'base', 'bead chip', 'case control', 'cell type', 'chromatin remodeling', 'disease phenotype', 'disorder risk', 'dosage', 'epigenetic variation', 'epigenome', 'forest', 'genetic risk factor', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'high throughput technology', 'histone modification', 'insight', 'methylation pattern', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'peripheral blood', 'public health relevance', 'repository', 'risk variant', 'transcription factor']",NIDCR,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,F31,2015,38673,0.10505264926538953
"Super-enhancer structure defines a signature of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this proposal is to decipher the genetic basis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) by integrating genome-wide association studies (GWAS) with the chromatin modification information in human immune system. Accumulating evidence suggests that IBD results from an inappropriate inflammatory response to intestinal microbes in a genetically susceptible host. Among complex diseases, GWAS methods have been successful in IBD, identifying hundreds of non-overlapping genetic risk loci. However, the majority of these disease-associated DNA variants fall into the gene-desert part of the genome, complicating their functional evaluation. There is now overwhelming evidence that the noncoding disease-associated DNA variants disrupt the action of key regulatory elements in relevant cell types. Since genomic coordinates of active regulatory elements can be charted using unique chromatin features, genome-wide profiling of chromatin modifications in relevant cell types can be used to pinpoint to DNA variants disrupting active regulatory elements.  Two recent studies discovered a novel kind of enhancers that occurs within exceptionally large genomic domains. These regions were initially dubbed as 'super-enhancers'. Super-enhancer domains occur at key identity genes in a variety of cell types. Strikingly, these enhancer domains are more sensitive to perturbation such as loss of transcription factors than typical shorter enhancers.  Because of the fragility of super-enhancers to perturbation, I postulate that super-enhancer domains of relevant immune cells harbor IBD-associated DNA variants. To test this hypothesis, in Aim 1 of this proposal, I will characterize super-enhancer structures of the human immune system. I will first develop an unsupervised machine learning technique to chart super-enhancer structures from histone acetylation (H3K27Ac) data in diverse immune cells. Using this technique, I will next delineate cell type- specific enhancer domains in the immune cells and investigate the relationship among cells types with respect to their super-enhancer structures. In Aim 2 of this proposal, I will investigate the enrichment of IBD-associated DNA variants within the super-enhancers of the most relevant immune cells. I then link these variants to genes and pathways that they regulate and are affected in disease utilizing gene expression and long-range chromatin interaction datasets. Completion of these aims, along with training opportunities associated with this proposal will establish the necessary foundation for my career as an independent investigator.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, the two common forms of (IBD), affect over 2.5 million people in North America and Europe. GWAS methods have identified hundreds of non-overlapping genetic risk loci in IBD. Yet, the functional effects of mos IBD-implicated variants remain largely unexplained. The finding that nearly 90% of these sites occur outside of protein-coding sequences suggests that many associated variants may instead have a role in gene regulation. Cell context is a key determinant of gene regulation but where IBD genetic variants are functional is largely unknown. This proposal seeks to utilize the chromatin structure of human immune cells to discover the cell context for IBD-associated variants. The identification of the pathogenic cell types as well as the molecular pathways that contribute to the disease will contribute greatly to our ability to treat patients.              ",Super-enhancer structure defines a signature of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD),8749475,K22AI112570,"['Address', 'Affect', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Binding Sites', 'Blood Cells', 'CD14 gene', 'CD19 gene', 'CD3 Antigens', 'CD4 Positive T Lymphocytes', 'CD8B1 gene', 'Cataloging', 'Catalogs', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'Chromatin Structure', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Crohn&apos', 's disease', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Disease susceptibility', 'Enhancers', 'Epithelial', 'Europe', 'Evaluation', 'Foundations', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Enhancer Element', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Histone Acetylation', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune system', 'Individual', 'Inflammatory', 'Inflammatory Bowel Diseases', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Intestines', 'Junk DNA', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Microbe', 'Molecular', 'NCAM1 gene', 'National Human Genome Research Institute', 'Natural Immunity', 'North America', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Play', 'Proteins', 'Regulatory Element', 'Research Personnel', 'Rheumatoid Arthritis', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Site', 'Structure', 'Susceptibility Gene', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Ulcerative Colitis', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'Work', 'adaptive immunity', 'base', 'career', 'cell type', 'chromatin modification', 'cohort', 'commensal microbes', 'epigenomics', 'falls', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'human disease', 'interest', 'markov model', 'monocyte', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'risk variant', 'transcription factor']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,K22,2015,161200,-0.009994844550532839
"Genetic and epigenetic contributions to Sjogren's syndrome     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): High throughput whole genome platforms to quantitatively and efficiently assay human DNA methylation provide an extraordinary opportunity to accelerate progress in the identification of epigenetic mechanisms for complex human autoimmune diseases such as Sjogren's Syndrome (SS). Epigenetic modifications, such as methylation of the 5' carbon of cytosine which occurs in the context of CpG dinucleotides, do not affect the genetic sequence; however, they do play a critical role in transcriptional regulation of a gene and subsequent gene expression. We have applied this technology, in conjunction with whole genome SNP genotyping to a clinically well-characterized collection of SS cases and controls developed specifically for genetic and epigenetic studies. Samples from the Sjogren's International Collaborative Clinical Alliance (SICCA) repository (total n=3,500 individuals) will b utilized, given the careful phenotype characterization and standardized collection of biospecimens that has been performed for each participant. For this proposal, we have initially obtained DNA from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and sorted cell populations with high purity, including CD14+ monocytes, CD19+ B cells, CD4+ T cells, as well as labial salivary gland biopsy tissue from 120 SICCA participants (100 SS cases and 20 controls). Data collected for ~450,000 highly informative CpG sites spanning 22,000 genes across the genome will provide a comprehensive assessment of DNA methylation for each individual for our proposed study Aims. As part of Aim 1, DNA methylation profiles will be examined using three main approaches: 1) Global DNA methylation profiles will be analyzed for association with SS risk in all sample types; 2) Multidimensional scaling analysis (MDS) and principal components analysis (PCA) will be performed to determine whether SS case samples can be distinguished from control samples; and 3) Local analyses will also be performed and will focus specifically on DNA methylation changes within candidate SS genes and genes demonstrating at least 1.5 fold methylation differences between cases and controls. Our proposal will take advantage of available whole genome data for each study participant and results from the largest genome wide association study (GWAS) in SS. In Aim 2, we will utilize DNA methylation profiles and methods from Aim 1 to determine whether important SS case phenotypes can be distinguished from one another. We will identify top ranked CpG sites that are either hypo or hyper methylated in specific SS case groups or that distinguish cases from controls using supervised machine learning algorithms. We will attempt replication for all top findings in an independent dataset, followed by random effects meta-analysis to incorporate other SS risk factors. Finally, we will determine whether DNA methylation profiles of interest from Aims 1 and 2 can be detected in DNA from whole blood for potential use as a biomarker. The identification of unique epigenetic profiles in SS, and an understanding of these profiles in the context of different cell and tissue types and genetic background have the potential to significantly transform our understanding of SS etiology.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE New molecular genetic assays offer an extraordinary opportunity to accelerate progress in the identification of epigenetic mechanisms for complex human autoimmune diseases such as Sjogren's Syndrome (SS). We propose to perform a comprehensive screen of more than 450,000 highly informative CpG sites spanning 22,000 genes across the genome using DNA derived from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), sorted cell populations, and labial salivary gland biopsy tissue from SS cases and control individuals to identify epigenetic profiles that are predictive of disease risk and specifi clinical phenotypes. The identification of unique epigenetic profiles in SS, and an understanding of these profiles in the context of several different cell and tissue types and whole genome SNP data have the potential to significantly transform our understanding of SS etiology, and may lead to more effective approaches to prevention, diagnosis and treatment.                ",Genetic and epigenetic contributions to Sjogren's syndrome,8829521,R03DE024316,"['Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Autoantibodies', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Autoimmunity', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biopsy', 'Blood', 'Blood specimen', 'Budgets', 'CD14 gene', 'CD19 gene', 'CD4 Positive T Lymphocytes', 'Carbon', 'Cell Separation', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Country', 'CpG dinucleotide', 'Cytosine', 'DNA', 'DNA Methylation', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Enrollment', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Etiology', 'European', 'Exhibits', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genome', 'Genomic Segment', 'Genotype', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Human', 'Individual', 'International', 'Labial Salivary Gland', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Molecular Genetics', 'National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research', 'Not Hispanic or Latino', 'Oral', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Population', 'Prevention approach', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Production', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'SNP genotyping', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'San Francisco', 'Site', 'Sjogren&apos', 's Syndrome', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Study Subject', 'Subgroup', 'Syndrome', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets', 'Technology', 'Tissues', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Whole Blood', 'Work', 'base', 'case control', 'cell type', 'clinical phenotype', 'disorder risk', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'high throughput technology', 'human DNA', 'interest', 'member', 'monocyte', 'public health relevance', 'repository', 'systemic autoimmune disease']",NIDCR,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R03,2015,236912,0.08054501135122126
"Genome analysis based on the integration of DNA sequence and shape DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Current techniques for genome analysis are mainly based on the one-dimensional DNA sequence, comprised of the letters A, C, G, and T. However, proteins recognize DNA as a three-dimensional (3D) object. Nuances in DNA shape at single nucleotide resolution play a crucial role in the binding specificity of transcription facors (TFs), including those involved in embryonic development and human cancer. This project involves the development of a battery of tools for genome analysis, through the integration of information derived from the DNA sequence and the 3D structure of DNA, or ""DNA shape"". The basis for these novel tools is a high- throughput (HT) method for the prediction of multiple features of local DNA shape at the genomic scale. Data will be made available to the community in the UCSC Genome Browser track format through a web server interface. These tools will enable users to analyze the shape of any number or length of DNA sequences, including whole genomes and the effect of DNA methylation. HT shape predictions will be validated based on X-ray crystallography, NMR spectroscopy, and hydroxyl radical cleavage data. Predictions will be combined with ORChID, an ENCODE project that infers DNA minor groove geometry from hydroxyl radical cleavage experiments. The HT method will be used to study how paralogous TFs select different target sites in vivo despite sharing core-binding motifs or having similar binding properties in vitro. To study this question, we will investigate the effect of flanking sequences on multiple structural features of TF binding sites (TFBSs). The initial focus of this study will be homeodomains and basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) TFs. Other protein families will later be included and used to construct a comprehensive TFBS database that provides shape features for binding motifs derived from JASPAR and other motif databases. Structural effects of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) will also be analyzed. Some SNPs are associated with deleterious functions, whereas others have no apparent effect. The HT shape prediction method will be used to predict the function of SNPs in non-coding regions based on DNA shape. We will correlate quantitative effects of SNPs on DNA structure with expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) and genome-wide association study (GWAS) signals, to develop a predictive tool for the functional effect of SNPs. The HT shape prediction approach will be used to design DNA sequences with different AT/GC contents but similar shapes. The relative contributions of sequence and shape to binding will be tested with analytic models including multiple linear regression (MLR) and support vector regression (SVR). For systems in which the integration of sequence and shape proves advantageous, novel motif finding tools will be developed based on an extended alphabet that combines sequence with informative structural features, selected by machine learning and feature selection approaches. Sequence+shape motifs will be tested by motif scanning, compared to sequence-only motifs, and integrated into the MEME Suite. The goal of this sequence-shape integration is to increase the accuracy of finding in vivo TFBSs in the genome. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Protein-DNA recognition is a critical yet poorly understood component of gene regulation. This proposal will connect the fields of DNA sequence and structure analysis, which so far have been developed in parallel but largely disconnected from each other. Integration of the one-dimensional DNA sequence at a genome-wide scale with the three-dimensional DNA structure at atomic resolution will lead to the development of novel genome analysis tools and will advance our understanding of genome function, leading to fundamentally new insights into the mechanisms of gene regulation and its impact on human disease.",Genome analysis based on the integration of DNA sequence and shape,8795204,R01GM106056,"['Affect', 'Affinity', 'Algorithms', 'BHLH Protein', 'Base Pairing', 'Base Sequence', 'Benchmarking', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological Process', 'ChIP-on-chip', 'ChIP-seq', 'Characteristics', 'Communities', 'Computational algorithm', 'DNA', 'DNA Binding', 'DNA Databases', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA Sequence', 'DNA Structure', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'DNase-I Footprinting', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Databases', 'Deoxyribonuclease I', 'Development', 'Drosophila genus', 'Embryonic Development', 'Family', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genome Scan', 'Genomics', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Guanine + Cytosine Composition', 'Health', 'Helix-Turn-Helix Motifs', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Hydroxyl Radical', 'In Vitro', 'Internet', 'Lead', 'Length', 'Letters', 'Linear Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'Mining', 'Minor Groove', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Biology', 'NMR Spectroscopy', 'Nucleotides', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Family', 'Proteins', 'Publishing', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Relative (related person)', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Sequence Analysis', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Width', 'X-Ray Crystallography', 'Yeasts', 'base', 'design', 'flexibility', 'genetic evolution', 'genome analysis', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'homeodomain', 'human disease', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'member', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'research study', 'three dimensional structure', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'vector']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,R01,2015,304719,0.040791234943215744
"Computational methods for modeling lineage-specific gene regulation DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Complex sensory and signaling pathways ultimately converge on the DNA in the form of complexes of interacting regulatory RNAs and proteins that bind specific gene-proximal and distal regulatory elements to active and repress genes resulting in the establishment and maintenance of cell-type specific transcriptional responses. These regulatory elements have static and dynamic components - the former encoded in the genomic sequence itself as combinations of transcription factor binding site sequence motifs and the latter a consequence of locus and cell-type specific chromatin accessibility and epigenomic modifications as well as the dynamic linking of distal regulatory elements to target genes. In addition, transcriptional and post-transcriptional feedback and control of the levels of regulatory proteins and RNAs also play a key role in dynamic cell-type specific gene regulation. One of the central challenges in modern genomics is to learn these rules by which the genome and epigenome encode regulatory information. How does a single genome sequence encode the information for exquisitely precise, and yet highly distinctive programs of gene regulation for different cell types, and at different time points? What are the key sequence determinants, and grammatical rules that determine the function of any given DNA sequence under any particular set of conditions? In this project we seek to use public data from The Roadmap Epigenomics project and The ENCODE project to make progress on these questions. We propose to build methods for interpreting shared and distinctive regulatory features, including especially transcription factor binding, across related cell types. In parallel, we will implement novel methods for identifying high-resolution, context-specific dynamic regulatory elements, decipher their underlying regulatory sequence grammars and learn predictive, integrative models of transcriptional regulation to decipher the effects of heterogeneous regulatory components on lineage-specific gene expression dynamics and provide regulatory annotations for large collections of curated and disease-associated gene sets. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The purpose of this project is to develop powerful statistical methods to study cell-type specific gene regulation, and apply these to publicly available data from The Roadmap Epigenomics Project, The ENCODE Project and several publicly available gene expression compendia. We propose new methods for joint inference of regulatory elements across diverse cell types, deciphering lineage-specific regulatory sequence grammars encoded in these elements and learning integrative transcriptional regulation programs.

"Epigenomic control of RNA splicing DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The central objective of this project is to elucidate the roles of epigenetics and chromatin states in RNA splicing regulation. Eukaryotic cells generate astonishing regulatory diversity and as a consequence exceedingly complex phenotypes from a finite set of genes. Alternative pre-mRNA splicing plays an essential role in creating this regulatory diversity by generating multiple RNA isoforms from a single gene. Traditionally, splicing was considered as a ""post-transcriptional"" process, and studies of splicing regulation have largely focused on the roles of cis splicing regulatory elements and their interactions with canonical RNA-binding splicing factors. However, recent studies of eukaryotic epigenomes and transcriptomes have revealed a surprisingly complex picture of splicing regulation shaped by chromatin states and epigenetic marks. Exons are characterized by increased levels of nucleosome positioning, DNA methylation, and certain histone modifications. Many introns are spliced co-transcriptionally when the nascent RNAs are tethered to the chromatin, and changes in the transcription elongation rate or epigenetic marks can influence exon splicing patterns. Despite these exciting findings, many questions about epigenetic regulation of splicing remain unresolved. We propose to systematically investigate chromatin and epigenetic regulation of RNA splicing, by taking advantage of the broad and deep epigenome and transcriptome data generated by the Epigenome Roadmap project. By correlating transcriptome profiles to epigenome profiles across diverse cell types, we aim to address a series of important questions regarding epigenetic regulation of co-transcriptional and post-transcriptional RNA splicing. In three aims, we will investigate epigenome-splicing correlation in diverse tissues and cell types (Aim 1), identify combinatorial chromatin states and long-range interactions associated with splicing (Aim 2), and elucidate how epigenetic determinants affect chromatin-associated splicing (Aim 3). The proposed studies will significantly advance our understanding of splicing regulation, and how epigenetic signals influence alternative splicing in normal and diseased cells. In addition, through the proposed work we will develop novel computational methods for linking epigenome signatures to RNA splicing patterns. We anticipate that these tools will be of broad interest and utility to researchers studying epigenome and transcriptome regulation in diverse biological systems. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Many human diseases are caused by aberrant pre-mRNA splicing. This project will use extensive epigenome and transcriptome profiles from the Epigenome Roadmap project to elucidate chromatin and epigenetic regulation of RNA splicing.

"Epigenetic Transgenerational Endocrine Disruptor Actions DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A number of environmental toxicants were shown in the previous grant period to promote the epigenetic transgenerational inheritance of adult onset disease including the fungicide vinclozolin, pesticides, plastics (BPA and phthalates), dioxin, hydrocarbons, and DDT. The ability of environmental compounds (e.g. endocrine disruptors) to promote transgenerational disease phenotypes is anticipated to be a critical aspect of adult onset disease etiology. The transgenerational inheritance phenotype requires the heritable epigenetic alterations of the germline. The current proposal is designed to further investigate the molecular and developmental aspects of the epigenetic transgenerational inheritance phenomenon and assess the potential use of epigenetic biomarkers for exposure and disease. The general hypothesis tested is that ""transient fetal exposure around the period of gonadal sex determination to environmental toxicants (i.e. vinclozolin) promotes the reprogramming of the epigenome (i.e. DNA methylation) of the male germline that then transmits an imprinted-like epigenome to subsequent generations to induce the epigenetic transgenerational inheritance of adult onset disease (e.g. male infertility)"". The previous grant period focused on the analysis of the epigenetic alteration in the F3 generation sperm using promoter associated differential DNA methylation regions (epimutations), as well as documented the epigenetic and transcriptome changes in the F3 generation vinclozolin lineage primordial germ cells. The molecular etiology of somatic cell changes associated with ovary and testis disease was established. The current proposal further investigates the molecular and developmental aspects of the germline mediated epigenetic transgenerational inheritance of disease. The experimental approach to test the above hypothesis consists of the following specific aims: Aim 1) Determine the developmental and generational aspects of the genome-wide germline epimutations. Aim 2) Determine the genomic features associated with the epimutations and potential genetic alterations involved in the epigenetic transgenerational inheritance phenomenon. Aim 3) Determine the optimal exposure parameters of the environmental induced transgenerational model and correlate epigenetic biomarkers with exposure and disease. Completion of the proposed research will determine the cascade of epigenetic events involved in germ cell development that generates the sperm epimutations that transmit the epigenetic transgenerational inheritance of disease phenotypes. The protection of the sperm epimutations from DNA methylation erasure is anticipated in early embryonic development. The proposed research will further elucidate the molecular and developmental aspects of environmentally induced epigenetic transgenerational inheritance of disease and the potential use of epigenetic biomarkers for ancestral exposure and disease. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The current proposal further investigates the molecular and developmental aspects of germline mediated epigenetic transgenerational inheritance of disease. The cascade of epigenetic events involved in germ cell development that generates the sperm epimutations that transmit the epigenetic transgenerational inheritance of disease phenotypes will be determined.

The epimutations are anticipated to promote genetic alterations to contribute to the transgenerational disease phenotype.

"High-throughput methods for elucidating the control of chromatin accessibility ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We will develop the first validated predictive model of how transcription factors dynamically determine genome-wide chromatin accessibility that is generalizable across biological systems. We will accomplish this goal with three specific aims. We will develop novel Genome Syntax to Regulation (GSR) models that accurately learn a genomic regulatory vocabulary and predict how phrases in this vocabulary control chromatin accessibility (Aim 1). As part of this aim we will identify transcription factor binding motifs tha are in the discovered regulatory vocabulary. We will validate and refine the causality of these models by testing whether they accurately predict the chromatin accessibility of thousands of synthetic DNA ""phrases"" that have been engineered into specific genomic locations and measured in the context of transcription factor gain-of-function and loss-of-function studies. The phrases will be designed to elucidate both the factors and grammar that control chromatin opening in several distinct cellular states (Aim 2). We will use our predictive models to assign importance scores to individual genome bases and to predict how selected factors alter chromatin accessibility genome wide (Aim 3). We will test the ability of our importance scores to identify regulatory SNPs in the context of human genome-wide association study (GWAS) data, and we will validate model predictions of changes in whole genome chromatin accessibility in response to ectopic factor expression. Through computational modeling of the effect of such ectopic factor expression, we will develop a predictive understanding of how transcription factors alter chromatin state, laying the groundwork for a novel regenerative medicine paradigm of predictive cellular programming.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Access to the information in our genomes is regulated by a cell much like doors in a building can regulate access to rooms that contain instructions. The control over which doors are open in a cell regulates which instructions are accessible in a cell-type specific way. We will understand the code that controls the doors to our genome, and improve human health by understanding what genome changes interfere with door control and demonstrating that we can program cells to open and close their doors to create cells that might be able to serve as replacements for damaged cells in our bodies.            ",High-throughput methods for elucidating the control of chromatin accessibility,8861021,R01HG008363,"['Access to Information', 'Base Pairing', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'Chromatin Modeling', 'Code', 'Computer Simulation', 'Controlled Vocabulary', 'DNA', 'DNA Library', 'DNA Sequence', 'DNase I hypersensitive sites sequencing', 'Data', 'Ectopic Expression', 'Engineering', 'Enhancers', 'Etiology', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Individual', 'Instruction', 'Knock-out', 'Learning', 'Libraries', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Oligonucleotides', 'Pancreas', 'Proteins', 'Regenerative Medicine', 'Regulation', 'Regulatory Element', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Vocabulary', 'Work', 'base', 'biological systems', 'cell injury', 'cell type', 'combinatorial', 'design', 'embryonic stem cell', 'gain of function', 'genetic regulatory protein', 'genome editing', 'genome sequencing', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'improved', 'loss of function', 'novel', 'phrases', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'promoter', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'stem cell differentiation', 'syntax', 'synthetic construct', 'transcription factor']",NHGRI,MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2015,762851,0.057156332410677614
"Comparative analysis and regulatory architecture of epigenomics datasets ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The NIH Roadmap Epigenomics and ENCODE projects have generated a collection of 3000+ epigenomics datasets, including histone modification, DNA methylation, gene expression, and DNaseI hypersensitivity profiled across 190 cell and tissue types. In order to maximize its impact on gene regulation, cellular differentiation, and human health, novel computational analyses are needed. To address this challenge, we will develop new methods for epigenomic analysis, building on our extensive experience interpreting epigenomic information, and our preliminary studies building chromatin states, activity clusters, and regulatory motif maps for the Roadmap Epigenomics and ENCODE datasets. In Aim 1, we will characterize epigenomic differences and changes during lineage differentiation by developing new tools for systematic comparison of groups of epigenomes that directly exploit the complexity of epigenomic datasets; we will also develop methods for clustering epigenomes into developmental lineages based on automatically-learned diverse epigenomic features that distinguish them; and methods that learn the unidirectional epigenomic changes that pluripotent cells undergo during lineage commitment to gain more insights into differentiation and automatically learn to classify lineages and differentiation trajectories. In Am 2, we will seek to characterize higher-order chromatin architecture and chromatin conformation to enable systematic interpretation of cis-regulatory modules: we will develop a novel statistical approach for enhancer-enhancer and enhancer-gene linking to reveal interacting regions and their target genes based on their coordinated activity patterns across cell and tissue types; we will train a supervised learning method for predicting both constitutive and tissue-specific chromatin conformation information based on chromatin state information, individual chromatin marks, genomic distance, activity, regulatory motif information, and DNA sequence; and we will use these higher-order interaction maps to predict gene expression levels based on the combined action of multiple regulatory regions and to define the cis-regulatory architecture of each gene in the human genome. The resulting resources will be invaluable for studies of gene regulation, by revealing the set of regulatory elements that are linked to each gene, and for the interpretation of genetic studies, by revealing the set of regulatory elements which jointly act to regulate each target gene and the potential target genes of non-coding variants associated with human disease.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The NIH ENCODE and Roadmap Epigenomics projects have generated a collection of 4000+ epigenomics datasets across 200+ cell and tissue types, which can be invaluable to the scientific community, but novel computational analyses are needed to maximize its impact on gene regulation, cellular differentiation, and human health. To address this need, we propose to systematically study epigenomic differences between cell types, lineages, and stages of differentiation, and to learn models predicting the higher-order chromatin structures across cell/tissue types, within each cell/tissue, and the chromatin architectures that they define. By systematically interpreting epigenomic annotations in the context of their cellular differentiation and their higher-order chromatin structures, the resultin resource will greatly increase their impact on human health by enabling disease studies to understand the mechanistic relationship between non-coding variants and their target genes, and the specific differentiation stages in which they act.                ",Comparative analysis and regulatory architecture of epigenomics datasets,8847548,R01GM113708,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'Chromosomes', 'Classification', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Enhancers', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genetic study', 'Genomics', 'Graph', 'Health', 'Higher Order Chromatin Structure', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Hypersensitivity', 'Individual', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'Nucleosomes', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Phylogenetic Analysis', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Resources', 'Shapes', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Staging', 'Statistical Methods', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'base', 'cell type', 'comparative', 'comparison group', 'differential expression', 'epigenome', 'epigenomics', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'genetic association', 'genome wide association study', 'histone modification', 'human disease', 'innovation', 'insight', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'public health relevance', 'rare variant', 'research study', 'tool', 'ward']",NIGMS,MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2015,283300,0.060228418493747014
"""Ribonomics"" of Gene Regulation to predict Innate Immune Responses     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The expression of genes involves a sequence of enzymatic events, such as transcription, mRNA processing, mRNA decay, and translation, that are subject to gene regulatory networks (GRNs) of protein-nucleic acid interactions. It is well appreciated that the control of transcription via regulatory networks that regulate enhancer and promoter activities are not the sole determinant of what gene products result, but that exon skipping is pervasive and post-transcriptional mechanisms such as mRNA splicing and decay determine the kinetics of mRNA induction and abundance. Indeed, in our preliminary studies of the macrophage response to pathogens, we find that a majority of induced gene expression events result in mRNAs that deviate substantially from those predicted by the genome-browser, and that mRNA decay is controlled by both protein- nucleic acid and miRNA regulatory networks. The proposed Center for the ""Ribonomics"" of Gene Regulation leverages and pioneers Next Gen Sequencing and computational modeling approaches to develop a predictive model for which mRNA isoforms are expressed and at what level given a given promoter activity and transcription initiation rate. We will develop generally applicable tools in conjunction with or in depth and quantitative experimental analysis of the macrophage response to pathogen-associated endotoxin, which results in the dramatic up regulation of more than 1000 genes. Strikingly, our preliminary data identified more than 900 exon skipping events in addition to numerous cases of alternative 5' or 3' splice site use, emphasizing the essential contribution of post-initiation events. Further, these splice patterns are dependent on the macrophage subtype-specific chromatin landscape and are altered by inducible splice factors in primed or tolerated states. Thus we will leverage the well-described macrophage biology and associated experimental model systems, to examine the role of gene structure and sequence (Aim 1), the role of chromatin modifications (Aim 2), and of trans-acting splicing factors (Aim 3) in determining the identity of mature mRNAs and their associated synthesis rates, before adding the stimulus-responsive regulatory networks that confer mRNA half-life control and thus determine the abundance of each mRNA isoform (Aim 4).         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The proposed Center for the Ribonomics of Gene Regulation leverages and pioneers Next Gen Sequencing and computational modeling approaches to develop gene regulatory network (GRN) models that predict which of many alternative mRNA isoforms are actually expressed and at what level.

"MODELING DNA METHYLATION'S ROLE IN GENE REGULATION DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Changes in patterns of DNA methylation, a modulator of gene expression, play a key role in development and disease. There has been a flurry of development of new experimental methods to accurately map 5- methylcytosine and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine genome-wide. However, development of computational techniques to interpret these data has lagged behind. Current analytical methods are mostly concerned with visualization of genome-level correlations between DNA methylation and other epigenetic marks or with the identification of differentially methylated regions between samples. These tools have performed poorly when trying to link methylation and expression changes at specific loci, and they find quite weak genome-wide correlations between them. We hypothesize that such discrepancies are due to limitations of the current analysis methods, which tend to oversimplify local DNA methylation signals. We propose to develop a new suite of tools using methods from computer vision to associate spatially-similar methylation changes with corresponding changes in transcription. This approach allows us to make minimal assumptions about what these signals should look like. First, we use Dynamic Time Warping (DTW), a curve similarity metric, to cluster genes together based on their methylation signals. We then find clusters of genes with similar methylation patterns that have coordinated differential expression. We export the patterns defined by these curves for use as a classifier, enabling us to enumerate genes with associated methylation and expression changes. Our model considers the entire shape and course of the signal around the gene promoter, rather than averaging the signal across windows or modeling signals with idealized statistical distributions. We recently published how our method discovered a variety of DNA methylation patterns associated with gene silencing, and produced longer and markedly higher quality gene lists than those generated by other methods. In this proposal we build on these results to address three aims concerning DNA methylation's role in gene silencing: (1) We will build a classifier to model the methylation patterns we discover and use it to examine the role of DNA hypomethylation, which occurs primarily at alternative and retrotransposon promoters that are poorly annotated, in transcriptome regulation in breast cancer. (2) We will expand our model to address the controversial role of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine in gene regulation and its interplay with 5-methylcytosine in differentiated cells in the central nervous system. (3) We will develop general rules governing the methylation signatures we have identified and experimentally validate their functionality. This proposal will yield a set of experimentally validated models for how DNA methylation contributes to gene silencing as well as a set of computational tools other researchers can use to analyze the role of methylation in human disease. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: DNA methylation is an important regulator of gene expression. Abnormal patterns of methylation are often found in cancer and other human diseases. We will develop a set of computational tools, inspired by methods from computer vision, to identify DNA methylation patterns associated with either gene silencing or activation from genomic data. We will elucidate and experimentally validate general rules governing these relationships. All software will be made publically available to broadly advance cancer-research nationwide. Insights obtained through this work will improve our mechanistic understanding of DNA methylation and assist in the identification of patients who can benefit from DNA methylation targeted therapies.",MODELING DNA METHYLATION'S ROLE IN GENE REGULATION,8899611,R01GM108811,"['Address', 'Advanced Malignant Neoplasm', 'Affect', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Brain', 'Cells', 'Classification', 'Complication', 'Computational Technique', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'DNA', 'DNA Methylation', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Event', 'Gene Activation', 'Gene Cluster', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Silencing', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Hypermethylation', 'Imagery', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammary Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Neuraxis', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Play', 'Publishing', 'Regulation', 'Regulator Genes', 'Reporter', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Retroelements', 'Retrotransposon', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Statistical Distributions', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Transcription Initiation Site', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Validation', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'cancer type', 'cell type', 'common rule', 'computerized tools', 'differential expression', 'embryonic stem cell', 'genome editing', 'genome-wide', 'human disease', 'improved', 'insight', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'methylation pattern', 'mouse model', 'promoter', 'public health relevance', 'targeted treatment', 'tool']",NIGMS,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2015,343125,0.09785955009301567
"Epigenome Interactions in Complex Neurogenetic Disorders DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Modifications of DNA and chromatin impact the accessibility of the genetic code to the biological machinery of the cell. Relating epigenomic changes to neurodevelopmental disorders has been challenging. One obstacle is the need to study the relevant tissues at an appropriate stage of the disease process, while another is the difficulty of understanding the relationship of nucleotide and chromatin modifications to complex genetic disorders in which multiple loci interactions underlie expression of the disease. We propose to take advantage of a disorder, neural tube defects (NTDs), in which the existing mouse models closely parallel the human disease and in which several lines of evidence indicate a strong influence in both mouse and man of epigenetic modifications regulating disease expression. We will combine proof of principle studies in the mouse with investigations of human NTD cohorts to examine the relationship between DNA/chromatin methylation and the expressivity of NTDs in genetically susceptible individuals.  The study of epigenetic events contributing to NTDs has multiple distinct advantages over epigenomic investigation of other human diseases, as more than 200 genes are implicated in NTDs by human or animal studies. These provide critical clues to molecular pathways important for normal neurulation. Supporting the existing clinical data, we discovered several NTD-prone mouse mutant lines in which NTD occurrence is sensitive to folic acid supplementation. Folate metabolism is the source of al S-adenosyl methoinine (SAM), which is the primary methyl donor for methylating nucleic acids, proteins and lipids. Providing methyl donors is thought to be a major route through which folate supplementation exerts its beneficial effects on neurulation. We will use cutting edge and emerging technologies applied to mouse and human patient material to interrogate genome wide methylation and chromatin remodeling interactions, correlated with individual genotype, to examine epigenetic effects on the transcriptome and on phenotypic outcome.  This proposal tests the hypothesis that epigenetic modifications in DNA and chromatin in the setting of prenatal supplementation that modulates DNA and chromatin methylation will impact a recognizable pattern of gene expression to either favor or impair neurulation in a manner that can be predicted based on individual genotype. Moreover, we hypothesize that certain patterns will be evident not only in the developing neural tube but also in the peripheral blood and so will be useful in evaluating risk and optimal NTD prevention in a clinical setting. We predict that some DNA and chromatin methylation signatures acquired in utero wil persist postnatally, regardless of whether supplementation continues after birth. Finally, we expect that DNA methylation patterns found in mouse will be present as well-at least at the level of pathways if not individual genes-in human patients affected by an NTD. There is a critical need to identify patterns of human genetic--modified by epigenetic--variation that will allow individual risks to be accurately assessed. This would enable NTD prevention strategies to be optimized for each family, rather than basing recommendations on whole populations.

"An Integrative Approach to Construct a Regulatory Network Effected by TDZs     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Obesity is a major risk factor for metabolic disorders. Obesit typically leads to accumulation of dysfunctional white adipose tissue (WAT), which further causes metabolic dysregulation with elevated circulation of fatty acids and increased secretion of proinflammatory adipokines. The discovery of fat burning brown adipose tissue (BAT) in humans has raised the exciting possibility of BAT may be targeted as a novel method to treat obesity and metablic diseases. Thiazolidinediones (TZDs) have a function to convert WAT into a ""brownlike"" state. Beside, TZDs have been used as a remedy for diabetes. But the clinical use of TZDs has been limited because of the safety concerns such as potential cardiovascular risks. Understanding the mechanism will identify efficacious but lower risk drug targets for the metabolic disorders. TZDs act by activatin PPAR? (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor ?). However, our understanding about the targets f PPAR? and other cofactors is limited. To understand the role of TZDs and further study the browning effect, we propose to develop a novel algorithm to predict long-range promoter-enhancer interaction and construct a transcriptional network. To predict the long-range interactions, we will employ a machine learning algorithm that uses the enhancer RNA (eRNA) levels and gene transcription levels obtained from global run-on sequencing (GROseq) data. GROseq is a useful dataset to predict long-range interactions, as the eRNA levels highly correlate with the gene transcription level. Applyingthe obtained interactions to the known binding sites of TFs including PPAR?, GR, C/EBP, SMRT, and RXR, we will construct a comprehensive TF-gene network. The predicted interaction provides a useful environment to study gene regulation of TZDs. We will study how the distance, relative position, an the combination of multiple TF binding sites affect gene expression. We will also investigate the browning effects by TZDs by including BAT-specific TF binding data in the network. The transcriptioal rule of the BAT-specific binding information, in combination with other TFs, will be analyzed from he TF-gene network. As a whole, these studies use an innovative and creative approach to integrate various types of data to study gene regulation of TZDs. By reprocessing complex genomic datasets ino a comprehensive regulatory network, the proposed algorithm provides a unique view in analyzing the regulatory rules of the browning effect, which will greatly enhance our understanding about the gen regulation of TZDs and identify potential therapeutic targets for diabetes.          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: A noble algorithm is developed to reprocess and integrate various types of data in a regulatory network to the study of the browning effect by thiazolidinedione (TZD). We will develop a novel algorithm to predict promoter-enhancer long-range interactions using the glbal run-on sequencing (GROseq) data and construct regulatory network using the known transcription factor binding sites.

"Computational methods for modeling lineage-specific gene regulation     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Complex sensory and signaling pathways ultimately converge on the DNA in the form of complexes of interacting regulatory RNAs and proteins that bind specific gene-proximal and distal regulatory elements to active and repress genes resulting in the establishment and maintenance of cell-type specific transcriptional responses. These regulatory elements have static and dynamic components - the former encoded in the genomic sequence itself as combinations of transcription factor binding site sequence motifs and the latter a consequence of locus and cell-type specific chromatin accessibility and epigenomic modifications as well as the dynamic linking of distal regulatory elements to target genes. In addition, transcriptional and post-transcriptional feedback and control of the levels of regulatory proteins and RNAs also play a key role in dynamic cell-type specific gene regulation. One of the central challenges in modern genomics is to learn these rules by which the genome and epigenome encode regulatory information. How does a single genome sequence encode the information for exquisitely precise, and yet highly distinctive programs of gene regulation for different cell types, and at different time points? What are the key sequence determinants, and grammatical rules that determine the function of any given DNA sequence under any particular set of conditions? In this project we seek to use public data from The Roadmap Epigenomics project and The ENCODE project to make progress on these questions. We propose to build methods for interpreting shared and distinctive regulatory features, including especially transcription factor binding, across related cell types. In parallel, we will implement novel methods for identifying high-resolution, context-specific dynamic regulatory elements, decipher their underlying regulatory sequence grammars and learn predictive, integrative models of transcriptional regulation to decipher the effects of heterogeneous regulatory components on lineage-specific gene expression dynamics and provide regulatory annotations for large collections of curated and disease-associated gene sets.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The purpose of this project is to develop powerful statistical methods to study cell-type specific gene regulation, and apply these to publicly available data from The Roadmap Epigenomics Project, The ENCODE Project and several publicly available gene expression compendia. We propose new methods for joint inference of regulatory elements across diverse cell types, deciphering lineage-specific regulatory sequence grammars encoded in these elements and learning integrative transcriptional regulation programs. Our models will serve as a resource to provide comprehensive context-specific regulatory annotations for disease-associated gene sets and co-expression modules.            ",Computational methods for modeling lineage-specific gene regulation,8815902,R01ES025009,"['Beryllium', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Cell Line', 'Chromatin', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Distal', 'Elements', 'Feedback', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Imagery', 'Indium', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Play', 'Process', 'RNA-Binding Proteins', 'Regulatory Element', 'Regulatory Pathway', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Sensory', 'Signal Pathway', 'Statistical Methods', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'cell type', 'combinatorial', 'epigenome', 'epigenomics', 'experience', 'functional genomics', 'genetic regulatory protein', 'genome sequencing', 'insight', 'novel', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'tool', 'transcription factor']",NIEHS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2014,318763,0.021261649814663948
"Genome analysis based on the integration of DNA sequence and shape  Title: Genome analysis based on the integration of DNA sequence and shape PI: Rohs, Remo (USC); Co-I: Noble, William Stafford (UW); Co-I: Tullius, Thomas D. (BU) PROJECT SUMMARY Current techniques for genome analysis are mainly based on the one-dimensional DNA sequence, comprised of the letters A, C, G, and T. However, proteins recognize DNA as a three-dimensional (3D) object. Nuances in DNA shape at single nucleotide resolution play a crucial role in the binding specificity of transcription factors (TFs), including those involved in embryonic development and human cancer. This project involves the development of a battery of tools for genome analysis, through the integration of information derived from the DNA sequence and the 3D structure of DNA, or ""DNA shape"". The basis for these novel tools is a high- throughput (HT) method for the prediction of multiple features of local DNA shape at the genomic scale. Data will be made available to the community in the UCSC Genome Browser track format through a web server interface. These tools will enable users to analyze the shape of any number or length of DNA sequences, including whole genomes and the effect of DNA methylation. HT shape predictions will be validated based on X-ray crystallography, NMR spectroscopy, and hydroxyl radical cleavage data. Predictions will be combined with ORChID, an ENCODE project that infers DNA minor groove geometry from hydroxyl radical cleavage experiments. The HT method will be used to study how paralogous TFs select different target sites in vivo despite sharing core-binding motifs or having similar binding properties in vitro. To study this question, we will investigate the effect of flanking sequences on multiple structural features of TF binding sites (TFBSs). The initial focus of this study will be homeodomains and basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) TFs. Other protein families will later be included and used to construct a comprehensive TFBS database that provides shape features for binding motifs derived from JASPAR and other motif databases. Structural effects of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) will also be analyzed. Some SNPs are associated with deleterious functions, whereas others have no apparent effect. The HT shape prediction method will be used to predict the function of SNPs in non-coding regions based on DNA shape. We will correlate quantitative effects of SNPs on DNA structure with expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) and genome-wide association study (GWAS) signals, to develop a predictive tool for the functional effect of SNPs. The HT shape prediction approach will be used to design DNA sequences with different AT/GC contents but similar shapes. The relative contributions of sequence and shape to binding will be tested with analytic models including multiple linear regression (MLR) and support vector regression (SVR). For systems in which the integration of sequence and shape proves advantageous, novel motif finding tools will be developed based on an extended alphabet that combines sequence with informative structural features, selected by machine learning and feature selection approaches. Sequence+shape motifs will be tested by motif scanning, compared to sequence-only motifs, and integrated into the MEME Suite. The goal of this sequence-shape integration is to increase the accuracy of finding in vivo TFBSs in the genome. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Protein-DNA recognition is a critical yet poorly understood component of gene regulation. This proposal will connect the fields of DNA sequence and structure analysis, which so far have been developed in parallel but largely disconnected from each other. Integration of the one-dimensional DNA sequence at a genome-wide scale with the three-dimensional DNA structure at atomic resolution will lead to the development of novel genome analysis tools and will advance our understanding of genome function, leading to fundamentally new insights into the mechanisms of gene regulation and its impact on human disease.            ",Genome analysis based on the integration of DNA sequence and shape,8632246,R01GM106056,"['Affect', 'Affinity', 'Algorithms', 'BHLH Protein', 'Base Pairing', 'Base Sequence', 'Benchmarking', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological Process', 'ChIP-on-chip', 'ChIP-seq', 'Characteristics', 'Communities', 'Computational algorithm', 'DNA', 'DNA Binding', 'DNA Databases', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA Sequence', 'DNA Structure', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'DNase-I Footprinting', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Databases', 'Deoxyribonuclease I', 'Development', 'Drosophila genus', 'Embryonic Development', 'Family', 'Functional RNA', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genome Scan', 'Genomics', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Guanine + Cytosine Composition', 'Helix-Turn-Helix Motifs', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Hydroxyl Radical', 'In Vitro', 'Internet', 'Lead', 'Length', 'Letters', 'Linear Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'Mining', 'Minor Groove', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Biology', 'NMR Spectroscopy', 'Nucleotides', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Family', 'Proteins', 'Publishing', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Relative (related person)', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Sequence Analysis', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Width', 'X-Ray Crystallography', 'Yeasts', 'base', 'design', 'flexibility', 'genetic evolution', 'genome analysis', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'homeodomain', 'human disease', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'member', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'three dimensional structure', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'vector']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,R01,2014,334303,0.0388143132724421
"Epigenomic control of RNA splicing     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The central objective of this project is to elucidate the roles of epigenetics and chromatin states in RNA splicing regulation. Eukaryotic cells generate astonishing regulatory diversity and as a consequence exceedingly complex phenotypes from a finite set of genes. Alternative pre-mRNA splicing plays an essential role in creating this regulatory diversity by generating multiple RNA isoforms from a single gene. Traditionally, splicing was considered as a ""post-transcriptional"" process, and studies of splicing regulation have largely focused on the roles of cis splicing regulatory elements and their interactions with canonical RNA-binding splicing factors. However, recent studies of eukaryotic epigenomes and transcriptomes have revealed a surprisingly complex picture of splicing regulation shaped by chromatin states and epigenetic marks. Exons are characterized by increased levels of nucleosome positioning, DNA methylation, and certain histone modifications. Many introns are spliced co-transcriptionally when the nascent RNAs are tethered to the chromatin, and changes in the transcription elongation rate or epigenetic marks can influence exon splicing patterns. Despite these exciting findings, many questions about epigenetic regulation of splicing remain unresolved. We propose to systematically investigate chromatin and epigenetic regulation of RNA splicing, by taking advantage of the broad and deep epigenome and transcriptome data generated by the Epigenome Roadmap project. By correlating transcriptome profiles to epigenome profiles across diverse cell types, we aim to address a series of important questions regarding epigenetic regulation of co-transcriptional and post-transcriptional RNA splicing. In three aims, we will investigate epigenome-splicing correlation in diverse tissues and cell types (Aim 1), identify combinatorial chromatin states and long-range interactions associated with splicing (Aim 2), and elucidate how epigenetic determinants affect chromatin-associated splicing (Aim 3). The proposed studies will significantly advance our understanding of splicing regulation, and how epigenetic signals influence alternative splicing in normal and diseased cells. In addition, through the proposed work we will develop novel computational methods for linking epigenome signatures to RNA splicing patterns. We anticipate that these tools will be of broad interest and utility to researchers studying epigenome and transcriptome regulation in diverse biological systems.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Many human diseases are caused by aberrant pre-mRNA splicing. This project will use extensive epigenome and transcriptome profiles from the Epigenome Roadmap project to elucidate chromatin and epigenetic regulation of RNA splicing.

"Epigenetic Transgenerational Endocrine Disruptor Actions     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A number of environmental toxicants were shown in the previous grant period to promote the epigenetic transgenerational inheritance of adult onset disease including the fungicide vinclozolin, pesticides, plastics (BPA and phthalates), dioxin, hydrocarbons, and DDT. The ability of environmental compounds (e.g. endocrine disruptors) to promote transgenerational disease phenotypes is anticipated to be a critical aspect of adult onset disease etiology. The transgenerational inheritance phenotype requires the heritable epigenetic alterations of the germline. The current proposal is designed to further investigate the molecular and developmental aspects of the epigenetic transgenerational inheritance phenomenon and assess the potential use of epigenetic biomarkers for exposure and disease. The general hypothesis tested is that ""transient fetal exposure around the period of gonadal sex determination to environmental toxicants (i.e. vinclozolin) promotes the reprogramming of the epigenome (i.e. DNA methylation) of the male germline that then transmits an imprinted-like epigenome to subsequent generations to induce the epigenetic transgenerational inheritance of adult onset disease (e.g. male infertility)"". The previous grant period focused on the analysis of the epigenetic alteration in the F3 generation sperm using promoter associated differential DNA methylation regions (epimutations), as well as documented the epigenetic and transcriptome changes in the F3 generation vinclozolin lineage primordial germ cells. The molecular etiology of somatic cell changes associated with ovary and testis disease was established. The current proposal further investigates the molecular and developmental aspects of the germline mediated epigenetic transgenerational inheritance of disease. The experimental approach to test the above hypothesis consists of the following specific aims: Aim 1) Determine the developmental and generational aspects of the genome-wide germline epimutations. Aim 2) Determine the genomic features associated with the epimutations and potential genetic alterations involved in the epigenetic transgenerational inheritance phenomenon. Aim 3) Determine the optimal exposure parameters of the environmental induced transgenerational model and correlate epigenetic biomarkers with exposure and disease. Completion of the proposed research will determine the cascade of epigenetic events involved in germ cell development that generates the sperm epimutations that transmit the epigenetic transgenerational inheritance of disease phenotypes. The protection of the sperm epimutations from DNA methylation erasure is anticipated in early embryonic development. The proposed research will further elucidate the molecular and developmental aspects of environmentally induced epigenetic transgenerational inheritance of disease and the potential use of epigenetic biomarkers for ancestral exposure and disease.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The current proposal further investigates the molecular and developmental aspects of germline mediated epigenetic transgenerational inheritance of disease.

"Integrative analysis tools to dissect cell-type specific transcriptional programs DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): How cell-type specific gene expression programs are established and maintained is a fundamental question in molecular biology. In mammalian cells, hundreds of sequence-specific transcription factors have been catalogued, and they bind the regulatory regions of their target genes in cell-type specific and combinatorial occupancy patterns. Moreover, the developmental programs that generate different cell lineages are accompanied by complex chromatin remodeling. Increasing evidence suggests that the regulatory regions of cell-type specific genes may often be established and sometimes ""poised"" by chromatin marks at earlier stages in development. However, the detailed characterization of gene regulatory regions-including their initial establishment in earlier progenitor cells, the dynamics of their chromatin state, and the combinatorial control of gene transcriptional output by multiple transcription factors-has only been studied for a handful of developmentally important genes.  The goal of this project is to develop new integrative computational methods that exploit massive next- generation sequencing data sets to fundamentally advance our understanding of cell-type specific transcriptional programs. We will develop integrative computational analysis methods for (1) learning the sequence and chromatin determinants of transcription factor binding from ChIP-seq and DNase-seq; (2) mapping the landscape of chromatin accessibility of all regulatory regions in the human and mouse genomes using DNase-seq across all available cell types, dissecting the poising of their chromatin state in earlier progenitor cells, and extracting the sequence code governing their gain and loss in differentiation; and (3) modeling cell-type specific gene expression programs as a function of chromatin state, transcription factor binding, and regulatory sequence analysis. We will couple our computational methods development with targeted experimental validation, including both locus-specific and genome-wide assays. Understanding gene regulation is fundamental to the study of normal cellular processes as well as disease.

"MODELING DNA METHYLATION'S ROLE IN GENE REGULATION     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Changes in patterns of DNA methylation, a modulator of gene expression, play a key role in development and disease. There has been a flurry of development of new experimental methods to accurately map 5- methylcytosine and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine genome-wide. However, development of computational techniques to interpret these data has lagged behind. Current analytical methods are mostly concerned with visualization of genome-level correlations between DNA methylation and other epigenetic marks or with the identification of differentially methylated regions between samples. These tools have performed poorly when trying to link methylation and expression changes at specific loci, and they find quite weak genome-wide correlations between them. We hypothesize that such discrepancies are due to limitations of the current analysis methods, which tend to oversimplify local DNA methylation signals. We propose to develop a new suite of tools using methods from computer vision to associate spatially-similar methylation changes with corresponding changes in transcription. This approach allows us to make minimal assumptions about what these signals should look like. First, we use Dynamic Time Warping (DTW), a curve similarity metric, to cluster genes together based on their methylation signals. We then find clusters of genes with similar methylation patterns that have coordinated differential expression. We export the patterns defined by these curves for use as a classifier, enabling us to enumerate genes with associated methylation and expression changes. Our model considers the entire shape and course of the signal around the gene promoter, rather than averaging the signal across windows or modeling signals with idealized statistical distributions. We recently published how our method discovered a variety of DNA methylation patterns associated with gene silencing, and produced longer and markedly higher quality gene lists than those generated by other methods. In this proposal we build on these results to address three aims concerning DNA methylation's role in gene silencing: (1) We will build a classifier to model the methylation patterns we discover and use it to examine the role of DNA hypomethylation, which occurs primarily at alternative and retrotransposon promoters that are poorly annotated, in transcriptome regulation in breast cancer. (2) We will expand our model to address the controversial role of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine in gene regulation and its interplay with 5-methylcytosine in differentiated cells in the central nervous system. (3) We will develop general rules governing the methylation signatures we have identified and experimentally validate their functionality. This proposal will yield a set of experimentally validated models for how DNA methylation contributes to gene silencing as well as a set of computational tools other researchers can use to analyze the role of methylation in human disease.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: DNA methylation is an important regulator of gene expression. Abnormal patterns of methylation are often found in cancer and other human diseases. We will develop a set of computational tools, inspired by methods from computer vision, to identify DNA methylation patterns associated with either gene silencing or activation from genomic data. We will elucidate and experimentally validate general rules governing these relationships. All software will be made publically available to broadly advance cancer-research nationwide. Insights obtained through this work will improve our mechanistic understanding of DNA methylation and assist in the identification of patients who can benefit from DNA methylation targeted therapies.            ",MODELING DNA METHYLATION'S ROLE IN GENE REGULATION,8759963,R01GM108811,"['Address', 'Advanced Malignant Neoplasm', 'Affect', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Brain', 'Cells', 'Classification', 'Complication', 'Computational Technique', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'DNA', 'DNA Methylation', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Event', 'Gene Activation', 'Gene Cluster', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Silencing', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Hypermethylation', 'Imagery', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammary Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'Metric', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Neuraxis', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Play', 'Publishing', 'Regulation', 'Regulator Genes', 'Reporter', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Retroelements', 'Retrotransposon', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Statistical Distributions', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Transcription Initiation Site', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Validation', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'cancer type', 'cell type', 'common rule', 'computerized tools', 'embryonic stem cell', 'genome-wide', 'human disease', 'improved', 'insight', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'mouse model', 'promoter', 'public health relevance', 'tool']",NIGMS,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2014,343125,0.09785955009301567
"Epigenome Interactions in Complex Neurogenetic Disorders    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Modifications of DNA and chromatin impact the accessibility of the genetic code to the biological machinery of the cell. Relating epigenomic changes to neurodevelopmental disorders has been challenging. One obstacle is the need to study the relevant tissues at an appropriate stage of the disease process, while another is the difficulty of understanding the relationship of nucleotide and chromatin modifications to complex genetic disorders in which multiple loci interactions underlie expression of the disease. We propose to take advantage of a disorder, neural tube defects (NTDs), in which the existing mouse models closely parallel the human disease and in which several lines of evidence indicate a strong influence in both mouse and man of epigenetic modifications regulating disease expression. We will combine proof of principle studies in the mouse with investigations of human NTD cohorts to examine the relationship between DNA/chromatin methylation and the expressivity of NTDs in genetically susceptible individuals.  The study of epigenetic events contributing to NTDs has multiple distinct advantages over epigenomic investigation of other human diseases, as more than 200 genes are implicated in NTDs by human or animal studies. These provide critical clues to molecular pathways important for normal neurulation. Supporting the existing clinical data, we discovered several NTD-prone mouse mutant lines in which NTD occurrence is sensitive to folic acid supplementation. Folate metabolism is the source of al S-adenosyl methoinine (SAM), which is the primary methyl donor for methylating nucleic acids, proteins and lipids. Providing methyl donors is thought to be a major route through which folate supplementation exerts its beneficial effects on neurulation. We will use cutting edge and emerging technologies applied to mouse and human patient material to interrogate genome wide methylation and chromatin remodeling interactions, correlated with individual genotype, to examine epigenetic effects on the transcriptome and on phenotypic outcome.  This proposal tests the hypothesis that epigenetic modifications in DNA and chromatin in the setting of prenatal supplementation that modulates DNA and chromatin methylation will impact a recognizable pattern of gene expression to either favor or impair neurulation in a manner that can be predicted based on individual genotype. Moreover, we hypothesize that certain patterns will be evident not only in the developing neural tube but also in the peripheral blood and so will be useful in evaluating risk and optimal NTD prevention in a clinical setting. We predict that some DNA and chromatin methylation signatures acquired in utero wil persist postnatally, regardless of whether supplementation continues after birth. Finally, we expect that DNA methylation patterns found in mouse will be present as well-at least at the level of pathways if not individual genes-in human patients affected by an NTD.         There is a critical need to identify patterns of human genetic--modified by epigenetic--variation that will allow individual risks to be accurately assessed. This would enable NTD prevention strategies to be optimized for each family, rather than basing recommendations on whole populations.

"A MACHINE LEARNING APPROACH FOR FINE-SCALE GENOME WIDE DNA METHYLATION ANALYSIS    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Epigenetic regulation of gene expression through variation in DNA methylation plays a critical role in a range of biological processes including cellular differentiation, human disease and cancer. New methods for determining the fine structure of methylation patterns genome-wide have led to an explosion of research in this field. Methylation near the gene promoter is correlated with gene silencing, while unmethylated promoters are potentially active. Current computational methods classify genes as either methylated and silenced or unmethylated and potentially active based on a coarse calculation of CpG methylation state across a window of a few hundred base pairs around the transcription start site. The detailed spatial pattern of methylation across the promoter may be an important determinant of gene expression, but current computational methods ignore this valuable information. Recent work has found regions proximal to CpG island promoters, dubbed ""CpG island shores"", whose methylation state correlates with transcription. CpG island shores are loosely defined, however, and this concept is difficult to apply in practice. While other methylation signatures are also likely to correlate with gene expression, a general framework to identify and study them has not been established. New computational tools for identification and correlation of detailed methylation patterns with gene expression are critical for advancing our understanding of the epigenetics of gene regulation. We propose to develop software tools to detect new methylation signatures at gene promoters that correlate with expression. This will be done within a formal framework so that these signatures can be used to determine differentially methylated genes in a variety of study designs. Taking advantage of the fact  that methylation over short ranges are highly correlated, we will interpolate methylation data at individual  CpG sites in a 10 kb window around the TSS to yield a methylation signature at each promoter that is  independent of primary sequence features. We will then use a metric from topology, the discrete Frechet distance, to calculate the similarity between methylation signatures, and apply this metric to cluster signatures of similar type. We will then determine clusters with methylation signatures that correlate with expression.  Clusters that contain both silenced and expressed genes will be examined to see if other local primary sequence features can be used to discriminate the genes based on expression. This approach will be used to detect methylation changes in case-control studies and in pairwise comparisons, such as needed for timecourse analysis or for the detection of different states of differentiation. The general framework developed here can be expanded in the future to examine methylation signatures at enhancers and gene bodies, as well as to histone marks or other genomic signals that carry detailed spatial information.          Narrative  DNA methylation, the addition of a methyl group to the cytosine in CpG dinucleotides, is an important  epigenetic regulator of gene expression in cells. DNA methylation has been implicated in a large number of  biological processes including cellular differentiation and cancer.

"An integrative approach to construct a regulatory network effected by TDZs     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Obesity is a major risk factor for metabolic disorders. Obesit typically leads to accumulation of dysfunctional white adipose tissue (WAT), which further causes metabolic dysregulation with elevated circulation of fatty acids and increased secretion of proinflammatory adipokines. The discovery of fat burning brown adipose tissue (BAT) in humans has raised the exciting possibility of BAT may be targeted as a novel method to treat obesity and metablic diseases. Thiazolidinediones (TZDs) have a function to convert WAT into a ""brownlike"" state. Beside, TZDs have been used as a remedy for diabetes. But the clinical use of TZDs has been limited because of the safety concerns such as potential cardiovascular risks. Understanding the mechanism will identify efficacious but lower risk drug targets for the metabolic disorders. TZDs act by activatin PPAR? (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor ?). However, our understanding about the targets f PPAR? and other cofactors is limited. To understand the role of TZDs and further study the browning effect, we propose to develop a novel algorithm to predict long-range promoter-enhancer interaction and construct a transcriptional network. To predict the long-range interactions, we will employ a machine learning algorithm that uses the enhancer RNA (eRNA) levels and gene transcription levels obtained from global run-on sequencing (GROseq) data. GROseq is a useful dataset to predict long-range interactions, as the eRNA levels highly correlate with the gene transcription level. Applyingthe obtained interactions to the known binding sites of TFs including PPAR?, GR, C/EBP, SMRT, and RXR, we will construct a comprehensive TF-gene network. The predicted interaction provides a useful environment to study gene regulation of TZDs. We will study how the distance, relative position, an the combination of multiple TF binding sites affect gene expression. We will also investigate the browning effects by TZDs by including BAT-specific TF binding data in the network. The transcriptioal rule of the BAT-specific binding information, in combination with other TFs, will be analyzed from he TF-gene network. As a whole, these studies use an innovative and creative approach to integrate various types of data to study gene regulation of TZDs. By reprocessing complex genomic datasets ino a comprehensive regulatory network, the proposed algorithm provides a unique view in analyzing the regulatory rules of the browning effect, which will greatly enhance our understanding about the gen regulation of TZDs and identify potential therapeutic targets for diabetes.          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: A noble algorithm is developed to reprocess and integrate various types of data in a regulatory network to the study of the browning effect by thiazolidinedione (TZD). We will develop a novel algorithm to predict promoter-enhancer long-range interactions using the glbal run-on sequencing (GROseq) data and construct regulatory network using the known transcription factor binding sites. The analysis using the TF-gene networks will elucidate the transcriptional regulations of TZDs, which will identify efficacious but lower risk drug targets for the metabolic disorders.            ",An integrative approach to construct a regulatory network effected by TDZs,8491522,R21DK098769,"['2,4-thiazolidinedione', 'Adipose tissue', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Antidiabetic Drugs', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological', 'Blood Circulation', 'Brown Fat', 'Burn injury', 'CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins', 'Calories', 'Chemicals', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Distal', 'Drug Targeting', 'Enhancers', 'Environment', 'Exposure to', 'Fatty Acids', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genomics', 'Heating', 'Housing', 'Human', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Diseases', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Nature', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'Obesity', 'Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptors', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevention approach', 'Property', 'RNA', 'RXR', 'Regulation', 'Relative (related person)', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Running', 'Safety', 'Therapeutic', 'Thiazolidinediones', 'Time', 'Transcription factor genes', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Variant', 'adipokines', 'base', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'cofactor', 'design', 'epigenome', 'gene interaction', 'genome-wide', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'insulin sensitivity', 'meetings', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'promoter', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'therapeutic target', 'time use', 'transcription factor']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R21,2013,240000,0.04070479302076935
"Defining Genomic Signatures for Aberrant DNA Methylation in Human Cancers DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Epigenetic silencing involving alterations in DNA methylation and chromatin structure at promoter region CpG islands is a common mechanism of tumor suppressor gene inactivation in human cancers. However, the mechanisms underlying this event remain poorly understood. An unresolved question is why are some genes targets of aberrant methylation in human cancers while others are never affected? In preliminary work, we have shown that even in the context of an increased cellular capacity for de novo methylation, CpG islands differ in their potential for aberrant methylation. By applying DNA pattern recognition and machine learning techniques, we have developed an algorithm based on several short sequence patterns that is capable of accurately discriminating methylation-prone and methylation-resistant CpG islands. These studies indicate that the epigenetic status of a CpG island can be predicted based on DNA sequence features, and lead us to propose that one factor contributing to the non-random patterns of CpG island methylation observed in human tumors is an underlying susceptibility conferred by local sequence context. The goal of this proposal is to define the genomic signature associated with aberrant methylation. The long term objectives are (i) to identify and to functionally characterize local sequence attributes that contribute to the propensity towards, or protection from, aberrant methylation, and (ii) to develop and to test novel tumor specific classifiers capable of predicting genomic loci at risk of aberrant methylation. Specifically, we will determine whether sequence features identified in silico act in cis to promote or to prevent de novo methylation in vivo using an episomal transgene approach. In preliminary work, we have identified a relationship between methylation-prone CpG islands and genomic regions bound by the polycomb repressor complex. As a second component of the project, we will determine the role of PRC2 in methylation susceptibility. As a third component of this project we will refine our computational models by 1) determining whether CpG islands predicted to be methylation-prone are in fact targets of aberrant methylation in human cancers, 2) using this information to re-train the prediction model, and 3) developing and testing a novel lung cancer specific classifier based on large-scale CpG island methylation data from primary lung tumors. We anticipate that the information gained from these studies will allow for a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying the epigenetic silencing of tumor suppressor genes that accompanies carcinogenesis. Moreover, the ability to predict the methylation status of CpG islands genome-wide will provide an important resource for the identification of novel gene targets for further study as potential cancer biomarkers. Project Narrative  The overarching goal of this research is to better understand the mechanisms by which  important growth regulatory genes are targeted for epigenetic silencing in human cancers.  Although the consequences of this event are the same as a mutation, there is no molecular  defect in the DNA sequence itself. Rather, there is a problem with methylation marks on the  DNA and the histone proteins it is wrapped around that render certain genes abnormally and  permanently silent. We plan to use a computational approach to identify DNA features that put  certain genes at risk of aberrant methylation. Because genes that are silenced by methylation  are otherwise structurally sound, the potential for reactivating these genes by blocking or  reversing the methylation process represents an exciting molecular target for chemotherapeutic  intervention. A better understanding of the factors that contribute to aberrant methylation,  including the identification of sequence features that attract or repel DNA methylation, will be an  important step in achieving this long-term goal. Moreover, the ability to identify those genes at  risk of epigenetic silencing will provide novel molecular targets for further study as potential  biomarkers for improved cancer diagnosis and treatment planning.",Defining Genomic Signatures for Aberrant DNA Methylation in Human Cancers,8459567,R01CA132065,"['Aberrant DNA Methylation', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Alu Elements', 'Binding', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Process', 'Cancer cell line', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'ChIP-on-chip', 'Chromatin Structure', 'Classification', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'CpG Islands', 'Cytosine', 'DNA', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA Methyltransferase', 'DNA Modification Methylases', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Defect', 'Deletion Mutation', 'Ectopic Expression', 'Employee Strikes', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Event', 'Frequencies', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Gene Silencing', 'Gene Targeting', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Histones', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Hypermethylation', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Lung Neoplasms', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Mediating', 'Methylation', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Target', 'Mutation', 'Non-Small-Cell Lung Carcinoma', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Play', 'Polycomb', 'Post-Translational Protein Processing', 'Predisposition', 'Primary Neoplasm', 'Process', 'Promoter Regions', 'Proteins', 'Publishing', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Regulator Genes', 'Repression', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Shapes', 'Site', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Transgenes', 'Tumor Suppressor Genes', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins', 'Tumor-Suppressor Gene Inactivation', 'Work', 'base', 'cancer cell', 'cancer diagnosis', 'cancer therapy', 'carcinogenesis', 'genome-wide', 'histone modification', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'novel', 'overexpression', 'prevent', 'promoter', 'sound', 'treatment planning', 'tumor']",NCI,EMORY UNIVERSITY,R01,2013,287765,0.09699307159294432
"Integrative analysis tools to dissect cell-type specific transcriptional programs DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): How cell-type specific gene expression programs are established and maintained is a fundamental question in molecular biology. In mammalian cells, hundreds of sequence-specific transcription factors have been catalogued, and they bind the regulatory regions of their target genes in cell-type specific and combinatorial occupancy patterns. Moreover, the developmental programs that generate different cell lineages are accompanied by complex chromatin remodeling. Increasing evidence suggests that the regulatory regions of cell-type specific genes may often be established and sometimes ""poised"" by chromatin marks at earlier stages in development. However, the detailed characterization of gene regulatory regions-including their initial establishment in earlier progenitor cells, the dynamics of their chromatin state, and the combinatorial control of gene transcriptional output by multiple transcription factors-has only been studied for a handful of developmentally important genes.  The goal of this project is to develop new integrative computational methods that exploit massive next- generation sequencing data sets to fundamentally advance our understanding of cell-type specific transcriptional programs. We will develop integrative computational analysis methods for (1) learning the sequence and chromatin determinants of transcription factor binding from ChIP-seq and DNase-seq; (2) mapping the landscape of chromatin accessibility of all regulatory regions in the human and mouse genomes using DNase-seq across all available cell types, dissecting the poising of their chromatin state in earlier progenitor cells, and extracting the sequence code governing their gain and loss in differentiation; and (3) modeling cell-type specific gene expression programs as a function of chromatin state, transcription factor binding, and regulatory sequence analysis. We will couple our computational methods development with targeted experimental validation, including both locus-specific and genome-wide assays. Understanding gene regulation is fundamental to the study of normal cellular processes as well as disease. In this project, we develop computational methods to exploit multiple sources of large-scale genomics data enabled by next-generation sequencing technology in order to provide new tools for studying gene regulation in mammalian cells.",Integrative analysis tools to dissect cell-type specific transcriptional programs,8463019,R01HG006798,"['Algorithms', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological Assay', 'Case Study', 'Cataloging', 'Catalogs', 'Cell Extracts', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Lineage', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'ChIP-seq', 'Chromatin', 'Chromatin Remodeling Factor', 'Code', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computing Methodologies', 'DNA', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Deoxyribonucleases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Hematopoietic', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Histones', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Lasso', 'Learning', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Mammalian Cell', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'MicroRNAs', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Biology', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Mus', 'Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'Output', 'Pattern', 'Reading', 'Relative (related person)', 'Role', 'Sequence Analysis', 'Site', 'Source', 'Staging', 'Stem cells', 'Technology', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'bisulfite', 'cell type', 'combinatorial', 'computerized tools', 'data modeling', 'epigenomics', 'genome-wide', 'histone modification', 'improved', 'method development', 'mouse genome', 'multitask', 'next generation sequencing', 'preference', 'programs', 'promoter', 'repository', 'role model', 'sequence learning', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics']",NHGRI,SLOAN-KETTERING INST CAN RESEARCH,R01,2013,493524,0.07900332102776399
"Global Predictions and Tests of Erythroid Regulation    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Proper regulation of gene expression is essential to the normal development and health of organisms, whereas aberrant gene regulation is known to cause many genetic diseases, including some inherited anemias, and it is thought to be a major contributor to complex phenotypes such as susceptibility to common diseases. Understanding the molecular mechanisms of gene regulation may provide novel candidates for therapeutic interventions. Our studies aim for a deeper molecular understanding of global aspects of gene regulation in an important biological process, the maturation of erythroid precursor cells to become red blood cells. Building on our progress using patterns in sequence alignments to predict cis-regulatory modules for erythroid genes and deciphering functional correlations of their evolutionary history, we propose to acquire genome-wide information on biochemical features associated with regulation to reach a more complete understanding of gene regulation in erythroid cells. Specifically, we propose to use high throughput biochemical assays such as chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by hybridization to microarrays and deep re-sequencing to acquire data on genomic DNA sequences (Aim 1) occupied in vivo by critical tissue-specific transcription factors, (Aim 2) bound by histones with modifications associated with gene activation or repression, (Aim 3) in chromatin with an altered structure, and (Aim 4) transcribed in a mouse erythroid cell model that undergoes maturation upon restoration of the critical transcription factor GATA-1. Then we will (Aim 5) apply existing software and develop new data-processing algorithms to determine peaks of signals that are likely to represent the locations of the features targeted in aims 1-4. Aim 6 will mine the peak-calling results, along with raw data, multiple sequence alignments and other information to investigate their covariation structure and integrate them to predict cis-regulatory modules, classify the modules by function, identify motifs associated with specific protein occupancy, and deduce the phylogenetic depth of preservation of critical motifs in the regulatory modules. Aim 7 will experimentally test biological hypotheses that arise from the analyses in Aims 6 and 7, determining the extent to which we can validate the locations of protein occupancy and transcripts, the predictions of both positive and negative cis-regulatory modules by gain-of-function cell transfection assays, and the role of motifs implicated in occupancy by directed mutagenesis and in vivo binding assays. We will test whether the motif- constraint hypothesis for protein-occupied DNA segments involved in enhancement applies to transcription factors in addition to GATA-1, and we will conduct additional experiments probing deeper biological issues. This research will provide not only global insights into mechanisms and effects of gene regulation during erythroid maturation, but the techniques and analytical tools developed here can be applied to better understand the development and differentiation of any tissue.

"Epigenome Interactions in Complex Neurogenetic Disorders    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Modifications of DNA and chromatin impact the accessibility of the genetic code to the biological machinery of the cell. Relating epigenomic changes to neurodevelopmental disorders has been challenging. One obstacle is the need to study the relevant tissues at an appropriate stage of the disease process, while another is the difficulty of understanding the relationship of nucleotide and chromatin modifications to complex genetic disorders in which multiple loci interactions underlie expression of the disease. We propose to take advantage of a disorder, neural tube defects (NTDs), in which the existing mouse models closely parallel the human disease and in which several lines of evidence indicate a strong influence in both mouse and man of epigenetic modifications regulating disease expression. We will combine proof of principle studies in the mouse with investigations of human NTD cohorts to examine the relationship between DNA/chromatin methylation and the expressivity of NTDs in genetically susceptible individuals.  The study of epigenetic events contributing to NTDs has multiple distinct advantages over epigenomic investigation of other human diseases, as more than 200 genes are implicated in NTDs by human or animal studies. These provide critical clues to molecular pathways important for normal neurulation. Supporting the existing clinical data, we discovered several NTD-prone mouse mutant lines in which NTD occurrence is sensitive to folic acid supplementation. Folate metabolism is the source of al S-adenosyl methoinine (SAM), which is the primary methyl donor for methylating nucleic acids, proteins and lipids. Providing methyl donors is thought to be a major route through which folate supplementation exerts its beneficial effects on neurulation. We will use cutting edge and emerging technologies applied to mouse and human patient material to interrogate genome wide methylation and chromatin remodeling interactions, correlated with individual genotype, to examine epigenetic effects on the transcriptome and on phenotypic outcome.  This proposal tests the hypothesis that epigenetic modifications in DNA and chromatin in the setting of prenatal supplementation that modulates DNA and chromatin methylation will impact a recognizable pattern of gene expression to either favor or impair neurulation in a manner that can be predicted based on individual genotype. Moreover, we hypothesize that certain patterns will be evident not only in the developing neural tube but also in the peripheral blood and so will be useful in evaluating risk and optimal NTD prevention in a clinical setting. We predict that some DNA and chromatin methylation signatures acquired in utero wil persist postnatally, regardless of whether supplementation continues after birth. Finally, we expect that DNA methylation patterns found in mouse will be present as well-at least at the level of pathways if not individual genes-in human patients affected by an NTD.         There is a critical need to identify patterns of human genetic--modified by epigenetic--variation that will allow individual risks to be accurately assessed. This would enable NTD prevention strategies to be optimized for each family, rather than basing recommendations on whole populations. With our food supply now fortified, folic acid has become the most widely administered medicinal agent in the US today. Therefore, this study will also have broad relevance to human disorders in which folate intake has an implicated role, including major depression, autism, Alzheimer's disease, among others.

The general framework developed here can be expanded in the future to examine methylation signatures at enhancers and gene bodies, as well as to histone marks or other genomic signals that carry detailed spatial information.          Narrative  DNA methylation, the addition of a methyl group to the cytosine in CpG dinucleotides, is an important  epigenetic regulator of gene expression in cells. DNA methylation has been implicated in a large number of  biological processes including cellular differentiation and cancer. We will develop software tools to analyze  data from new techniques for mapping DNA methylation genome-wide to discover new methylation signatures  that are associated with silenced and active genes. These will include tools to use these signatures to  determine what genes are differentially regulated in different cell types and in human disease.",A MACHINE LEARNING APPROACH FOR FINE-SCALE GENOME WIDE DNA METHYLATION ANALYSIS,8229567,R21LM011199,"['Algorithms', 'Base Pairing', 'Biological Process', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cells', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'CpG Islands', 'CpG dinucleotide', 'Cytosine', 'DNA Methylation', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Enhancers', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Explosion', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Silencing', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Histones', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'Metric', 'Nature', 'Pattern', 'Play', 'Process', 'Regulator Genes', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Software Tools', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Transcription Initiation Site', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'cell type', 'computerized tools', 'genome-wide', 'human disease', 'methyl group', 'promoter', 'research study', 'software development', 'spatial neglect', 'tool']",NLM,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R21,2012,152000,0.0699852006517533
"Defining Genomic Signatures for Aberrant DNA Methylation in Human Cancers DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Epigenetic silencing involving alterations in DNA methylation and chromatin structure at promoter region CpG islands is a common mechanism of tumor suppressor gene inactivation in human cancers. However, the mechanisms underlying this event remain poorly understood. An unresolved question is why are some genes targets of aberrant methylation in human cancers while others are never affected? In preliminary work, we have shown that even in the context of an increased cellular capacity for de novo methylation, CpG islands differ in their potential for aberrant methylation. By applying DNA pattern recognition and machine learning techniques, we have developed an algorithm based on several short sequence patterns that is capable of accurately discriminating methylation-prone and methylation-resistant CpG islands. These studies indicate that the epigenetic status of a CpG island can be predicted based on DNA sequence features, and lead us to propose that one factor contributing to the non-random patterns of CpG island methylation observed in human tumors is an underlying susceptibility conferred by local sequence context. The goal of this proposal is to define the genomic signature associated with aberrant methylation. The long term objectives are (i) to identify and to functionally characterize local sequence attributes that contribute to the propensity towards, or protection from, aberrant methylation, and (ii) to develop and to test novel tumor specific classifiers capable of predicting genomic loci at risk of aberrant methylation. Specifically, we will determine whether sequence features identified in silico act in cis to promote or to prevent de novo methylation in vivo using an episomal transgene approach. In preliminary work, we have identified a relationship between methylation-prone CpG islands and genomic regions bound by the polycomb repressor complex. As a second component of the project, we will determine the role of PRC2 in methylation susceptibility. As a third component of this project we will refine our computational models by 1) determining whether CpG islands predicted to be methylation-prone are in fact targets of aberrant methylation in human cancers, 2) using this information to re-train the prediction model, and 3) developing and testing a novel lung cancer specific classifier based on large-scale CpG island methylation data from primary lung tumors. We anticipate that the information gained from these studies will allow for a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying the epigenetic silencing of tumor suppressor genes that accompanies carcinogenesis. Moreover, the ability to predict the methylation status of CpG islands genome-wide will provide an important resource for the identification of novel gene targets for further study as potential cancer biomarkers. Project Narrative  The overarching goal of this research is to better understand the mechanisms by which  important growth regulatory genes are targeted for epigenetic silencing in human cancers.  Although the consequences of this event are the same as a mutation, there is no molecular  defect in the DNA sequence itself. Rather, there is a problem with methylation marks on the  DNA and the histone proteins it is wrapped around that render certain genes abnormally and  permanently silent. We plan to use a computational approach to identify DNA features that put  certain genes at risk of aberrant methylation. Because genes that are silenced by methylation  are otherwise structurally sound, the potential for reactivating these genes by blocking or  reversing the methylation process represents an exciting molecular target for chemotherapeutic  intervention. A better understanding of the factors that contribute to aberrant methylation,  including the identification of sequence features that attract or repel DNA methylation, will be an  important step in achieving this long-term goal. Moreover, the ability to identify those genes at  risk of epigenetic silencing will provide novel molecular targets for further study as potential  biomarkers for improved cancer diagnosis and treatment planning.",Defining Genomic Signatures for Aberrant DNA Methylation in Human Cancers,8246510,R01CA132065,"['Aberrant DNA Methylation', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Alu Elements', 'Binding', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Process', 'Cancer cell line', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'ChIP-on-chip', 'Chromatin Structure', 'Classification', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'CpG Islands', 'Cytosine', 'DNA', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA Methyltransferase', 'DNA Modification Methylases', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Defect', 'Deletion Mutation', 'Ectopic Expression', 'Employee Strikes', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Event', 'Frequencies', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Gene Silencing', 'Gene Targeting', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Histones', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Hypermethylation', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Lung Neoplasms', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Mediating', 'Methylation', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Target', 'Mutation', 'Non-Small-Cell Lung Carcinoma', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Play', 'Polycomb', 'Post-Translational Protein Processing', 'Predisposition', 'Primary Neoplasm', 'Process', 'Promoter Regions', 'Proteins', 'Publishing', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Regulator Genes', 'Repression', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Shapes', 'Site', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Transgenes', 'Tumor Suppressor Genes', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins', 'Tumor-Suppressor Gene Inactivation', 'Work', 'base', 'cancer cell', 'cancer diagnosis', 'cancer therapy', 'carcinogenesis', 'genome-wide', 'histone modification', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'novel', 'overexpression', 'prevent', 'promoter', 'sound', 'treatment planning', 'tumor']",NCI,EMORY UNIVERSITY,R01,2012,306133,0.09699307159294432
"Integrative analysis tools to dissect cell-type specific transcriptional programs DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): How cell-type specific gene expression programs are established and maintained is a fundamental question in molecular biology. In mammalian cells, hundreds of sequence-specific transcription factors have been catalogued, and they bind the regulatory regions of their target genes in cell-type specific and combinatorial occupancy patterns. Moreover, the developmental programs that generate different cell lineages are accompanied by complex chromatin remodeling. Increasing evidence suggests that the regulatory regions of cell-type specific genes may often be established and sometimes ""poised"" by chromatin marks at earlier stages in development. However, the detailed characterization of gene regulatory regions-including their initial establishment in earlier progenitor cells, the dynamics of their chromatin state, and the combinatorial control of gene transcriptional output by multiple transcription factors-has only been studied for a handful of developmentally important genes.  The goal of this project is to develop new integrative computational methods that exploit massive next- generation sequencing data sets to fundamentally advance our understanding of cell-type specific transcriptional programs. We will develop integrative computational analysis methods for (1) learning the sequence and chromatin determinants of transcription factor binding from ChIP-seq and DNase-seq; (2) mapping the landscape of chromatin accessibility of all regulatory regions in the human and mouse genomes using DNase-seq across all available cell types, dissecting the poising of their chromatin state in earlier progenitor cells, and extracting the sequence code governing their gain and loss in differentiation; and (3) modeling cell-type specific gene expression programs as a function of chromatin state, transcription factor binding, and regulatory sequence analysis. We will couple our computational methods development with targeted experimental validation, including both locus-specific and genome-wide assays. Understanding gene regulation is fundamental to the study of normal cellular processes as well as disease. In this project, we develop computational methods to exploit multiple sources of large-scale genomics data enabled by next-generation sequencing technology in order to provide new tools for studying gene regulation in mammalian cells.",Integrative analysis tools to dissect cell-type specific transcriptional programs,8311335,R01HG006798,"['Algorithms', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological Assay', 'Case Study', 'Cataloging', 'Catalogs', 'Cell Extracts', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Lineage', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'ChIP-seq', 'Chromatin', 'Chromatin Remodeling Factor', 'Code', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computing Methodologies', 'DNA', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Deoxyribonucleases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Hematopoietic', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Histones', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Lasso', 'Learning', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Mammalian Cell', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'MicroRNAs', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Biology', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Mus', 'Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'Output', 'Pattern', 'RNA', 'Reading', 'Relative (related person)', 'Role', 'Sequence Analysis', 'Site', 'Source', 'Staging', 'Stem cells', 'Technology', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'bisulfite', 'cell type', 'combinatorial', 'computerized tools', 'data modeling', 'epigenomics', 'genome-wide', 'histone modification', 'improved', 'method development', 'mouse genome', 'multitask', 'next generation', 'preference', 'programs', 'promoter', 'repository', 'role model', 'sequence learning', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptomics']",NHGRI,SLOAN-KETTERING INST CAN RESEARCH,R01,2012,556291,0.07900332102776399
"Global Predictions and Tests of Erythroid Regulation    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Proper regulation of gene expression is essential to the normal development and health of organisms, whereas aberrant gene regulation is known to cause many genetic diseases, including some inherited anemias, and it is thought to be a major contributor to complex phenotypes such as susceptibility to common diseases. Understanding the molecular mechanisms of gene regulation may provide novel candidates for therapeutic interventions. Our studies aim for a deeper molecular understanding of global aspects of gene regulation in an important biological process, the maturation of erythroid precursor cells to become red blood cells. Building on our progress using patterns in sequence alignments to predict cis-regulatory modules for erythroid genes and deciphering functional correlations of their evolutionary history, we propose to acquire genome-wide information on biochemical features associated with regulation to reach a more complete understanding of gene regulation in erythroid cells. Specifically, we propose to use high throughput biochemical assays such as chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by hybridization to microarrays and deep re-sequencing to acquire data on genomic DNA sequences (Aim 1) occupied in vivo by critical tissue-specific transcription factors, (Aim 2) bound by histones with modifications associated with gene activation or repression, (Aim 3) in chromatin with an altered structure, and (Aim 4) transcribed in a mouse erythroid cell model that undergoes maturation upon restoration of the critical transcription factor GATA-1. Then we will (Aim 5) apply existing software and develop new data-processing algorithms to determine peaks of signals that are likely to represent the locations of the features targeted in aims 1-4. Aim 6 will mine the peak-calling results, along with raw data, multiple sequence alignments and other information to investigate their covariation structure and integrate them to predict cis-regulatory modules, classify the modules by function, identify motifs associated with specific protein occupancy, and deduce the phylogenetic depth of preservation of critical motifs in the regulatory modules. Aim 7 will experimentally test biological hypotheses that arise from the analyses in Aims 6 and 7, determining the extent to which we can validate the locations of protein occupancy and transcripts, the predictions of both positive and negative cis-regulatory modules by gain-of-function cell transfection assays, and the role of motifs implicated in occupancy by directed mutagenesis and in vivo binding assays. We will test whether the motif- constraint hypothesis for protein-occupied DNA segments involved in enhancement applies to transcription factors in addition to GATA-1, and we will conduct additional experiments probing deeper biological issues. This research will provide not only global insights into mechanisms and effects of gene regulation during erythroid maturation, but the techniques and analytical tools developed here can be applied to better understand the development and differentiation of any tissue.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Proper regulation of gene expression is essential to the normal development and health of organisms, whereas aberrant gene regulation can cause genetic diseases, and it appears to be a major contributor to susceptibility to common diseases.

"Epigenome Interactions in Complex Neurogenetic Disorders    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Modifications of DNA and chromatin impact the accessibility of the genetic code to the biological machinery of the cell. Relating epigenomic changes to neurodevelopmental disorders has been challenging. One obstacle is the need to study the relevant tissues at an appropriate stage of the disease process, while another is the difficulty of understanding the relationship of nucleotide and chromatin modifications to complex genetic disorders in which multiple loci interactions underlie expression of the disease. We propose to take advantage of a disorder, neural tube defects (NTDs), in which the existing mouse models closely parallel the human disease and in which several lines of evidence indicate a strong influence in both mouse and man of epigenetic modifications regulating disease expression. We will combine proof of principle studies in the mouse with investigations of human NTD cohorts to examine the relationship between DNA/chromatin methylation and the expressivity of NTDs in genetically susceptible individuals.  The study of epigenetic events contributing to NTDs has multiple distinct advantages over epigenomic investigation of other human diseases, as more than 200 genes are implicated in NTDs by human or animal studies. These provide critical clues to molecular pathways important for normal neurulation. Supporting the existing clinical data, we discovered several NTD-prone mouse mutant lines in which NTD occurrence is sensitive to folic acid supplementation. Folate metabolism is the source of al S-adenosyl methoinine (SAM), which is the primary methyl donor for methylating nucleic acids, proteins and lipids. Providing methyl donors is thought to be a major route through which folate supplementation exerts its beneficial effects on neurulation. We will use cutting edge and emerging technologies applied to mouse and human patient material to interrogate genome wide methylation and chromatin remodeling interactions, correlated with individual genotype, to examine epigenetic effects on the transcriptome and on phenotypic outcome.  This proposal tests the hypothesis that epigenetic modifications in DNA and chromatin in the setting of prenatal supplementation that modulates DNA and chromatin methylation will impact a recognizable pattern of gene expression to either favor or impair neurulation in a manner that can be predicted based on individual genotype. Moreover, we hypothesize that certain patterns will be evident not only in the developing neural tube but also in the peripheral blood and so will be useful in evaluating risk and optimal NTD prevention in a clinical setting. We predict that some DNA and chromatin methylation signatures acquired in utero wil persist postnatally, regardless of whether supplementation continues after birth. Finally, we expect that DNA methylation patterns found in mouse will be present as well-at least at the level of pathways if not individual genes-in human patients affected by an NTD.         There is a critical need to identify patterns of human genetic--modified by epigenetic--variation that will allow individual risks to be accurately assessed. This would enable NTD prevention strategies to be optimized for each family, rather than basing recommendations on whole populations. With our food supply now fortified, folic acid has become the most widely administered medicinal agent in the US today. Therefore, this study will also have broad relevance to human disorders in which folate intake has an implicated role, including major depression, autism, Alzheimer's disease, among others.

"Predict transcriptional enhancers using epigenetic signatures    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Activation of eukaryotic gene transcription involves the coordination of a multitude of transcription factors and cofactors on regulatory DNA sequences such as promoters and enhancers and on the chromatin structure containing these elements. Therefore, identification of these regulatory DNA elements is of utmost importance for understanding gene regulation in both healthy and diseased cells. Previous studies have demonstrated many characteristic epigenetic modifications occur at regulatory DNA elements, e.g., high levels of histone acetylation at gene promoters and at many enhancers. In addition, it is known that many regulatory elements carry these epigenetic modifications only in specific cell/tissue types or according to environmental conditions. In recent years, a vast amount of genome-wide histone modification data has been generated using chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with microarray chip (ChIP-chip) or with next-generation sequencing technologies (ChIP-Seq). Currently, there is a pressing need for computational methods to analyze genome-wide histone modification data in order to identify functional DNA elements.  The goal of the proposed research is to develop a novel computational method to identify transcriptional regulatory elements on the basis of their epigenetic characteristics. In the field of machine learning, it is well established that meaningful statistical features extracted from raw data can elude more relevant information and increase the prediction accuracy of a classifier. We hypothesize that by introducing efficient data transformation and feature extraction procedures before classification, we can increase the overall prediction accuracy of our method for identifying transcriptional regulatory elements. We propose to test the aforementioned hypothesis by pursuing the following three aims: (1) We will adopt well-established measures from signal processing to design and test a set of statistical features that could give us a better representation of signals in histone modification data. (2) We will evaluate the performance of several commonly used statistical classifiers in predicting enhancers. We will then develop a software tool combining the most informative features from Aim 1 with the optimal classifier. (3) We will apply our computational method to predict novel enhancers in mouse embryonic stem cell and human T cell using genome-wide histone modification maps in these two cell types. We will use both computational and experimental approaches to evaluate the accuracy of our predictions. Although in this project we focus on enhancers, the approach we develop can be readily extended to discover other types of functional DNA elements using histone modification data in different organisms and cell types. )      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Transcriptional enhancers play an essential role in establishing tissue and developmental stage specific gene expression patterns that are essential for understanding development, cellular responses to environmental and genetic perturbations as well as the molecular basis of many diseases. The proposed research will lead to the development of a novel computational tool to discover enhancer elements using genome-wide chromatin signatures. Successful completion of the project will also uncover novel enhancers in two biomedically important cell types, embryonic stem cell and T lymphocyte, which could generate new insights into the regulatory networks controlling stem cell phenotype and T cell development and activation.              Narrative: Transcriptional enhancers play an essential role in establishing tissue and developmental stage specific gene expression patterns that are essential for understanding development, cellular responses to environmental and genetic perturbations as well as the molecular basis of many diseases.

"Defining Genomic Signatures for Aberrant DNA Methylation in Human Cancers    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Epigenetic silencing involving alterations in DNA methylation and chromatin structure at promoter region CpG islands is a common mechanism of tumor suppressor gene inactivation in human cancers. However, the mechanisms underlying this event remain poorly understood. An unresolved question is why are some genes targets of aberrant methylation in human cancers while others are never affected? In preliminary work, we have shown that even in the context of an increased cellular capacity for de novo methylation, CpG islands differ in their potential for aberrant methylation. By applying DNA pattern recognition and machine learning techniques, we have developed an algorithm based on several short sequence patterns that is capable of accurately discriminating methylation-prone and methylation-resistant CpG islands. These studies indicate that the epigenetic status of a CpG island can be predicted based on DNA sequence features, and lead us to propose that one factor contributing to the non-random patterns of CpG island methylation observed in human tumors is an underlying susceptibility conferred by local sequence context. The goal of this proposal is to define the genomic signature associated with aberrant methylation. The long term objectives are (i) to identify and to functionally characterize local sequence attributes that contribute to the propensity towards, or protection from, aberrant methylation, and (ii) to develop and to test novel tumor specific classifiers capable of predicting genomic loci at risk of aberrant methylation. Specifically, we will determine whether sequence features identified in silico act in cis to promote or to prevent de novo methylation in vivo using an episomal transgene approach. In preliminary work, we have identified a relationship between methylation-prone CpG islands and genomic regions bound by the polycomb repressor complex. As a second component of the project, we will determine the role of PRC2 in methylation susceptibility. As a third component of this project we will refine our computational models by 1) determining whether CpG islands predicted to be methylation-prone are in fact targets of aberrant methylation in human cancers, 2) using this information to re-train the prediction model, and 3) developing and testing a novel lung cancer specific classifier based on large-scale CpG island methylation data from primary lung tumors. We anticipate that the information gained from these studies will allow for a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying the epigenetic silencing of tumor suppressor genes that accompanies carcinogenesis. Moreover, the ability to predict the methylation status of CpG islands genome-wide will provide an important resource for the identification of novel gene targets for further study as potential cancer biomarkers. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The overarching goal of this research is to better understand the mechanisms by which important growth regulatory genes are targeted for epigenetic silencing in human cancers. Although the consequences of this event are the same as a mutation, there is no molecular defect in the DNA sequence itself. Rather, there is a problem with methylation marks on the DNA and the histone proteins it is wrapped around that render certain genes abnormally and permanently silent. We plan to use a computational approach to identify DNA features that put certain genes at risk of aberrant methylation. Because genes that are silenced by methylation are otherwise structurally sound, the potential for reactivating these genes by blocking or reversing the methylation process represents an exciting molecular target for chemotherapeutic intervention. A better understanding of the factors that contribute to aberrant methylation, including the identification of sequence features that attract or repel DNA methylation, will be an important step in achieving this long-term goal. Moreover, the ability to identify those genes at risk of epigenetic silencing will provide novel molecular targets for further study as potential biomarkers for improved cancer diagnosis and treatment planning.           Project Narrative The overarching goal of this research is to better understand the mechanisms by which important growth regulatory genes are targeted for epigenetic silencing in human cancers.

"Integrative analysis of genomic and epigenomic datasets in multiple cell types    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application addresses broad Challenge Area (08) Genomics, and specific Challenge Topic, 08-OD-101, Computational approaches for epigenomic analysis. While the primary DNA sequence of the human genome is ultimately responsible for the encoding and functioning of each cell, a plethora of chromatin and DNA modifications have been described in recent years that can modulate the interpretation of this primary sequence. These epigenetic modifications lead to the diversity of function across different human cell types, and play key roles in the establishment and maintenance of cellular identity during development, and also in health and disease. The human ENCODE project, the NIH Epigenome Roadmap, and several other large-scale experimental efforts are currently underway to map dozens of histone and DNA modifications across multiple human cell types and disease states, generating a diversity of rich epigenomic datasets. This creates a pressing need for the development of rigorous computational methods for the systematic integrative analysis of epigenomic datasets, and for understanding their relationship to other genomic datasets, including gene expression, disease association, and phenotypic profiling. In this proposal, we will develop and apply graphical probabilistic models for describing chromatin modifications, based on multivariate hidden Markov models. We will use these models to discover the set of underlying chromatin state, based on recurrent combinations of epigenetic marks across the entire genome (Aim 1). We will validate and functionally characterize these states based on their enrichments and positional biases with respect to existing functional elements, as well as large-scale gene expression and disease association datasets (Aim 2). Lastly, we will extend these methods to study dynamics of chromatin state across both healthy and disease cell types, and study how these correlate with functional differences between the observed cell types (Aim 3). We will work closely with the scientists involved in data production and facilitate communication and data integration across them, and also with data analysis and coordination centers already established to facilitate sharing of methods and results across the ENCODE and Epigenome Roadmap consortia, and with the larger community. Overall, the proposed integrative analysis of large-scale genomic and epigenomic datasets will provide a unified view of current and planned epigenomic datasets, towards a systematic understanding of gene and genome regulation in health and disease. While the primary DNA sequence of the human genome is ultimately responsible for the encoding and functioning of each cell, a plethora of chromatin and DNA modifications have been described in recent years that can modulate the interpretation of this primary sequence, leading to the diversity of function across different human cell types.

"Global Predictions and Tests of Erythroid Regulation    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Proper regulation of gene expression is essential to the normal development and health of organisms, whereas aberrant gene regulation is known to cause many genetic diseases, including some inherited anemias, and it is thought to be a major contributor to complex phenotypes such as susceptibility to common diseases. Understanding the molecular mechanisms of gene regulation may provide novel candidates for therapeutic interventions. Our studies aim for a deeper molecular understanding of global aspects of gene regulation in an important biological process, the maturation of erythroid precursor cells to become red blood cells. Building on our progress using patterns in sequence alignments to predict cis-regulatory modules for erythroid genes and deciphering functional correlations of their evolutionary history, we propose to acquire genome-wide information on biochemical features associated with regulation to reach a more complete understanding of gene regulation in erythroid cells. Specifically, we propose to use high throughput biochemical assays such as chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by hybridization to microarrays and deep re-sequencing to acquire data on genomic DNA sequences (Aim 1) occupied in vivo by critical tissue-specific transcription factors, (Aim 2) bound by histones with modifications associated with gene activation or repression, (Aim 3) in chromatin with an altered structure, and (Aim 4) transcribed in a mouse erythroid cell model that undergoes maturation upon restoration of the critical transcription factor GATA-1. Then we will (Aim 5) apply existing software and develop new data-processing algorithms to determine peaks of signals that are likely to represent the locations of the features targeted in aims 1-4. Aim 6 will mine the peak-calling results, along with raw data, multiple sequence alignments and other information to investigate their covariation structure and integrate them to predict cis-regulatory modules, classify the modules by function, identify motifs associated with specific protein occupancy, and deduce the phylogenetic depth of preservation of critical motifs in the regulatory modules. Aim 7 will experimentally test biological hypotheses that arise from the analyses in Aims 6 and 7, determining the extent to which we can validate the locations of protein occupancy and transcripts, the predictions of both positive and negative cis-regulatory modules by gain-of-function cell transfection assays, and the role of motifs implicated in occupancy by directed mutagenesis and in vivo binding assays. We will test whether the motif- constraint hypothesis for protein-occupied DNA segments involved in enhancement applies to transcription factors in addition to GATA-1, and we will conduct additional experiments probing deeper biological issues. This research will provide not only global insights into mechanisms and effects of gene regulation during erythroid maturation, but the techniques and analytical tools developed here can be applied to better understand the development and differentiation of any tissue.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Proper regulation of gene expression is essential to the normal development and health of organisms, whereas aberrant gene regulation can cause genetic diseases, and it appears to be a major contributor to susceptibility to common diseases.

"Epigenome Interactions in Complex Neurogenetic Disorders    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Modifications of DNA and chromatin impact the accessibility of the genetic code to the biological machinery of the cell. Relating epigenomic changes to neurodevelopmental disorders has been challenging. One obstacle is the need to study the relevant tissues at an appropriate stage of the disease process, while another is the difficulty of understanding the relationship of nucleotide and chromatin modifications to complex genetic disorders in which multiple loci interactions underlie expression of the disease. We propose to take advantage of a disorder, neural tube defects (NTDs), in which the existing mouse models closely parallel the human disease and in which several lines of evidence indicate a strong influence in both mouse and man of epigenetic modifications regulating disease expression. We will combine proof of principle studies in the mouse with investigations of human NTD cohorts to examine the relationship between DNA/chromatin methylation and the expressivity of NTDs in genetically susceptible individuals.  The study of epigenetic events contributing to NTDs has multiple distinct advantages over epigenomic investigation of other human diseases, as more than 200 genes are implicated in NTDs by human or animal studies. These provide critical clues to molecular pathways important for normal neurulation. Supporting the existing clinical data, we discovered several NTD-prone mouse mutant lines in which NTD occurrence is sensitive to folic acid supplementation. Folate metabolism is the source of al S-adenosyl methoinine (SAM), which is the primary methyl donor for methylating nucleic acids, proteins and lipids. Providing methyl donors is thought to be a major route through which folate supplementation exerts its beneficial effects on neurulation. We will use cutting edge and emerging technologies applied to mouse and human patient material to interrogate genome wide methylation and chromatin remodeling interactions, correlated with individual genotype, to examine epigenetic effects on the transcriptome and on phenotypic outcome.  This proposal tests the hypothesis that epigenetic modifications in DNA and chromatin in the setting of prenatal supplementation that modulates DNA and chromatin methylation will impact a recognizable pattern of gene expression to either favor or impair neurulation in a manner that can be predicted based on individual genotype. Moreover, we hypothesize that certain patterns will be evident not only in the developing neural tube but also in the peripheral blood and so will be useful in evaluating risk and optimal NTD prevention in a clinical setting. We predict that some DNA and chromatin methylation signatures acquired in utero wil persist postnatally, regardless of whether supplementation continues after birth. Finally, we expect that DNA methylation patterns found in mouse will be present as well-at least at the level of pathways if not individual genes-in human patients affected by an NTD.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  There is a critical need to identify patterns of human genetic--modified by epigenetic--variation that will allow individual risks to be accurately assessed. This would enable NTD prevention strategies to be optimized for each family, rather than basing recommendations on whole populations. With our food supply now fortified, folic acid has become the most widely administered medicinal agent in the US today. Therefore, this study will also have broad relevance to human disorders in which folate intake has an implicated role, including major depression, autism, Alzheimer's disease, among others.            There is a critical need to identify patterns of human genetic--modified by epigenetic--variation that will allow individual risks to be accurately assessed.

"Gene Regulation E. coli Database Integrated Modeling    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The Center for Genomic Sciences of the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM) in Cuernavaca and a group of collaborators propose to further develop and enrich the RegulonDB database. RegulonDB contains the largest electronically-available regulatory network of any living organism, that of Escherichia coli K-12. In the project we will expand the design, implement computational and conceptual models, and generate annotations derived from original literature of the different components of the regulatory network. We will experimentally map promoters and transcription units under different conditions. This project expands a previous grant supporting RegulonDB. High quality manual curation is to be enriched beyond transcription initiation to include signal-transduction connecting sensing with regulation, as well as with natural language text processing tools. We propose to continue an exhaustive experimental mapping of all possible transcription initiation sites in the genome and to perform an exhaustive experimental identification of transcription units in different conditions. The core of RegulonDB (literature-based network and the graphic and browsing tools) will be linked and made accessible, as optional user selections, with high-throughput available experiments (microarrays and ChIP- chip) both as raw and pre-analyzed data, as well as with collections of computational predictions of all network elements (transcription factors, promoters, binding sites, operons, regulatory interactions). This will be based on track representations and compliant with international consortia normalized pathway exchange formats. The openness of RegulonDB data and internal structure will expand considerably, enhancing as well its availability to tools for analysis and representation. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  RegulonDB is a gold standard both in its conceptual and computational design, as well as in the amount and quality of data gathered on the largest and best characterized regulatory network of a single organism.

"Predict transcriptional enhancers using epigenetic signatures    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Activation of eukaryotic gene transcription involves the coordination of a multitude of transcription factors and cofactors on regulatory DNA sequences such as promoters and enhancers and on the chromatin structure containing these elements. Therefore, identification of these regulatory DNA elements is of utmost importance for understanding gene regulation in both healthy and diseased cells. Previous studies have demonstrated many characteristic epigenetic modifications occur at regulatory DNA elements, e.g., high levels of histone acetylation at gene promoters and at many enhancers. In addition, it is known that many regulatory elements carry these epigenetic modifications only in specific cell/tissue types or according to environmental conditions. In recent years, a vast amount of genome-wide histone modification data has been generated using chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with microarray chip (ChIP-chip) or with next-generation sequencing technologies (ChIP-Seq). Currently, there is a pressing need for computational methods to analyze genome-wide histone modification data in order to identify functional DNA elements.  The goal of the proposed research is to develop a novel computational method to identify transcriptional regulatory elements on the basis of their epigenetic characteristics. In the field of machine learning, it is well established that meaningful statistical features extracted from raw data can elude more relevant information and increase the prediction accuracy of a classifier. We hypothesize that by introducing efficient data transformation and feature extraction procedures before classification, we can increase the overall prediction accuracy of our method for identifying transcriptional regulatory elements. We propose to test the aforementioned hypothesis by pursuing the following three aims: (1) We will adopt well-established measures from signal processing to design and test a set of statistical features that could give us a better representation of signals in histone modification data. (2) We will evaluate the performance of several commonly used statistical classifiers in predicting enhancers. We will then develop a software tool combining the most informative features from Aim 1 with the optimal classifier. (3) We will apply our computational method to predict novel enhancers in mouse embryonic stem cell and human T cell using genome-wide histone modification maps in these two cell types. We will use both computational and experimental approaches to evaluate the accuracy of our predictions. Although in this project we focus on enhancers, the approach we develop can be readily extended to discover other types of functional DNA elements using histone modification data in different organisms and cell types. )      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Transcriptional enhancers play an essential role in establishing tissue and developmental stage specific gene expression patterns that are essential for understanding development, cellular responses to environmental and genetic perturbations as well as the molecular basis of many diseases. The proposed research will lead to the development of a novel computational tool to discover enhancer elements using genome-wide chromatin signatures. Successful completion of the project will also uncover novel enhancers in two biomedically important cell types, embryonic stem cell and T lymphocyte, which could generate new insights into the regulatory networks controlling stem cell phenotype and T cell development and activation.              Narrative: Transcriptional enhancers play an essential role in establishing tissue and developmental stage specific gene expression patterns that are essential for understanding development, cellular responses to environmental and genetic perturbations as well as the molecular basis of many diseases.

"Defining Genomic Signatures for Aberrant DNA Methylation in Human Cancers    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Epigenetic silencing involving alterations in DNA methylation and chromatin structure at promoter region CpG islands is a common mechanism of tumor suppressor gene inactivation in human cancers. However, the mechanisms underlying this event remain poorly understood. An unresolved question is why are some genes targets of aberrant methylation in human cancers while others are never affected? In preliminary work, we have shown that even in the context of an increased cellular capacity for de novo methylation, CpG islands differ in their potential for aberrant methylation. By applying DNA pattern recognition and machine learning techniques, we have developed an algorithm based on several short sequence patterns that is capable of accurately discriminating methylation-prone and methylation-resistant CpG islands. These studies indicate that the epigenetic status of a CpG island can be predicted based on DNA sequence features, and lead us to propose that one factor contributing to the non-random patterns of CpG island methylation observed in human tumors is an underlying susceptibility conferred by local sequence context. The goal of this proposal is to define the genomic signature associated with aberrant methylation. The long term objectives are (i) to identify and to functionally characterize local sequence attributes that contribute to the propensity towards, or protection from, aberrant methylation, and (ii) to develop and to test novel tumor specific classifiers capable of predicting genomic loci at risk of aberrant methylation. Specifically, we will determine whether sequence features identified in silico act in cis to promote or to prevent de novo methylation in vivo using an episomal transgene approach. In preliminary work, we have identified a relationship between methylation-prone CpG islands and genomic regions bound by the polycomb repressor complex. As a second component of the project, we will determine the role of PRC2 in methylation susceptibility. As a third component of this project we will refine our computational models by 1) determining whether CpG islands predicted to be methylation-prone are in fact targets of aberrant methylation in human cancers, 2) using this information to re-train the prediction model, and 3) developing and testing a novel lung cancer specific classifier based on large-scale CpG island methylation data from primary lung tumors. We anticipate that the information gained from these studies will allow for a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying the epigenetic silencing of tumor suppressor genes that accompanies carcinogenesis. Moreover, the ability to predict the methylation status of CpG islands genome-wide will provide an important resource for the identification of novel gene targets for further study as potential cancer biomarkers. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The overarching goal of this research is to better understand the mechanisms by which important growth regulatory genes are targeted for epigenetic silencing in human cancers. Although the consequences of this event are the same as a mutation, there is no molecular defect in the DNA sequence itself. Rather, there is a problem with methylation marks on the DNA and the histone proteins it is wrapped around that render certain genes abnormally and permanently silent. We plan to use a computational approach to identify DNA features that put certain genes at risk of aberrant methylation. Because genes that are silenced by methylation are otherwise structurally sound, the potential for reactivating these genes by blocking or reversing the methylation process represents an exciting molecular target for chemotherapeutic intervention. A better understanding of the factors that contribute to aberrant methylation, including the identification of sequence features that attract or repel DNA methylation, will be an important step in achieving this long-term goal. Moreover, the ability to identify those genes at risk of epigenetic silencing will provide novel molecular targets for further study as potential biomarkers for improved cancer diagnosis and treatment planning.           Project Narrative The overarching goal of this research is to better understand the mechanisms by which important growth regulatory genes are targeted for epigenetic silencing in human cancers.

"Integrative analysis of genomic and epigenomic datasets in multiple cell types    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application addresses broad Challenge Area (08) Genomics, and specific Challenge Topic, 08-OD-101, Computational approaches for epigenomic analysis. While the primary DNA sequence of the human genome is ultimately responsible for the encoding and functioning of each cell, a plethora of chromatin and DNA modifications have been described in recent years that can modulate the interpretation of this primary sequence. These epigenetic modifications lead to the diversity of function across different human cell types, and play key roles in the establishment and maintenance of cellular identity during development, and also in health and disease. The human ENCODE project, the NIH Epigenome Roadmap, and several other large-scale experimental efforts are currently underway to map dozens of histone and DNA modifications across multiple human cell types and disease states, generating a diversity of rich epigenomic datasets. This creates a pressing need for the development of rigorous computational methods for the systematic integrative analysis of epigenomic datasets, and for understanding their relationship to other genomic datasets, including gene expression, disease association, and phenotypic profiling. In this proposal, we will develop and apply graphical probabilistic models for describing chromatin modifications, based on multivariate hidden Markov models. We will use these models to discover the set of underlying chromatin state, based on recurrent combinations of epigenetic marks across the entire genome (Aim 1). We will validate and functionally characterize these states based on their enrichments and positional biases with respect to existing functional elements, as well as large-scale gene expression and disease association datasets (Aim 2). Lastly, we will extend these methods to study dynamics of chromatin state across both healthy and disease cell types, and study how these correlate with functional differences between the observed cell types (Aim 3). We will work closely with the scientists involved in data production and facilitate communication and data integration across them, and also with data analysis and coordination centers already established to facilitate sharing of methods and results across the ENCODE and Epigenome Roadmap consortia, and with the larger community. Overall, the proposed integrative analysis of large-scale genomic and epigenomic datasets will provide a unified view of current and planned epigenomic datasets, towards a systematic understanding of gene and genome regulation in health and disease.

"Global Predictions and Tests of Erythroid Regulation    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Proper regulation of gene expression is essential to the normal development and health of organisms, whereas aberrant gene regulation is known to cause many genetic diseases, including some inherited anemias, and it is thought to be a major contributor to complex phenotypes such as susceptibility to common diseases. Understanding the molecular mechanisms of gene regulation may provide novel candidates for therapeutic interventions. Our studies aim for a deeper molecular understanding of global aspects of gene regulation in an important biological process, the maturation of erythroid precursor cells to become red blood cells. Building on our progress using patterns in sequence alignments to predict cis-regulatory modules for erythroid genes and deciphering functional correlations of their evolutionary history, we propose to acquire genome-wide information on biochemical features associated with regulation to reach a more complete understanding of gene regulation in erythroid cells. Specifically, we propose to use high throughput biochemical assays such as chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by hybridization to microarrays and deep re-sequencing to acquire data on genomic DNA sequences (Aim 1) occupied in vivo by critical tissue-specific transcription factors, (Aim 2) bound by histones with modifications associated with gene activation or repression, (Aim 3) in chromatin with an altered structure, and (Aim 4) transcribed in a mouse erythroid cell model that undergoes maturation upon restoration of the critical transcription factor GATA-1. Then we will (Aim 5) apply existing software and develop new data-processing algorithms to determine peaks of signals that are likely to represent the locations of the features targeted in aims 1-4. Aim 6 will mine the peak-calling results, along with raw data, multiple sequence alignments and other information to investigate their covariation structure and integrate them to predict cis-regulatory modules, classify the modules by function, identify motifs associated with specific protein occupancy, and deduce the phylogenetic depth of preservation of critical motifs in the regulatory modules. Aim 7 will experimentally test biological hypotheses that arise from the analyses in Aims 6 and 7, determining the extent to which we can validate the locations of protein occupancy and transcripts, the predictions of both positive and negative cis-regulatory modules by gain-of-function cell transfection assays, and the role of motifs implicated in occupancy by directed mutagenesis and in vivo binding assays. We will test whether the motif- constraint hypothesis for protein-occupied DNA segments involved in enhancement applies to transcription factors in addition to GATA-1, and we will conduct additional experiments probing deeper biological issues. This research will provide not only global insights into mechanisms and effects of gene regulation during erythroid maturation, but the techniques and analytical tools developed here can be applied to better understand the development and differentiation of any tissue.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Proper regulation of gene expression is essential to the normal development and health of organisms, whereas aberrant gene regulation can cause genetic diseases, and it appears to be a major contributor to susceptibility to common diseases.

"Gene Regulation E. coli Database Integrated Modeling    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The Center for Genomic Sciences of the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM) in Cuernavaca and a group of collaborators propose to further develop and enrich the RegulonDB database. RegulonDB contains the largest electronically-available regulatory network of any living organism, that of Escherichia coli K-12. In the project we will expand the design, implement computational and conceptual models, and generate annotations derived from original literature of the different components of the regulatory network. We will experimentally map promoters and transcription units under different conditions. This project expands a previous grant supporting RegulonDB. High quality manual curation is to be enriched beyond transcription initiation to include signal-transduction connecting sensing with regulation, as well as with natural language text processing tools. We propose to continue an exhaustive experimental mapping of all possible transcription initiation sites in the genome and to perform an exhaustive experimental identification of transcription units in different conditions. The core of RegulonDB (literature-based network and the graphic and browsing tools) will be linked and made accessible, as optional user selections, with high-throughput available experiments (microarrays and ChIP- chip) both as raw and pre-analyzed data, as well as with collections of computational predictions of all network elements (transcription factors, promoters, binding sites, operons, regulatory interactions). This will be based on track representations and compliant with international consortia normalized pathway exchange formats. The openness of RegulonDB data and internal structure will expand considerably, enhancing as well its availability to tools for analysis and representation.

By applying DNA pattern recognition and machine learning techniques, we have developed an algorithm based on several short sequence patterns that is capable of accurately discriminating methylation-prone and methylation-resistant CpG islands. These studies indicate that the epigenetic status of a CpG island can be predicted based on DNA sequence features, and lead us to propose that one factor contributing to the non-random patterns of CpG island methylation observed in human tumors is an underlying susceptibility conferred by local sequence context. The goal of this proposal is to define the genomic signature associated with aberrant methylation. The long term objectives are (i) to identify and to functionally characterize local sequence attributes that contribute to the propensity towards, or protection from, aberrant methylation, and (ii) to develop and to test novel tumor specific classifiers capable of predicting genomic loci at risk of aberrant methylation. Specifically, we will determine whether sequence features identified in silico act in cis to promote or to prevent de novo methylation in vivo using an episomal transgene approach. In preliminary work, we have identified a relationship between methylation-prone CpG islands and genomic regions bound by the polycomb repressor complex. As a second component of the project, we will determine the role of PRC2 in methylation susceptibility. As a third component of this project we will refine our computational models by 1) determining whether CpG islands predicted to be methylation-prone are in fact targets of aberrant methylation in human cancers, 2) using this information to re-train the prediction model, and 3) developing and testing a novel lung cancer specific classifier based on large-scale CpG island methylation data from primary lung tumors. We anticipate that the information gained from these studies will allow for a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying the epigenetic silencing of tumor suppressor genes that accompanies carcinogenesis. Moreover, the ability to predict the methylation status of CpG islands genome-wide will provide an important resource for the identification of novel gene targets for further study as potential cancer biomarkers. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The overarching goal of this research is to better understand the mechanisms by which important growth regulatory genes are targeted for epigenetic silencing in human cancers. Although the consequences of this event are the same as a mutation, there is no molecular defect in the DNA sequence itself. Rather, there is a problem with methylation marks on the DNA and the histone proteins it is wrapped around that render certain genes abnormally and permanently silent. We plan to use a computational approach to identify DNA features that put certain genes at risk of aberrant methylation. Because genes that are silenced by methylation are otherwise structurally sound, the potential for reactivating these genes by blocking or reversing the methylation process represents an exciting molecular target for chemotherapeutic intervention. A better understanding of the factors that contribute to aberrant methylation, including the identification of sequence features that attract or repel DNA methylation, will be an important step in achieving this long-term goal. Moreover, the ability to identify those genes at risk of epigenetic silencing will provide novel molecular targets for further study as potential biomarkers for improved cancer diagnosis and treatment planning.           Project Narrative The overarching goal of this research is to better understand the mechanisms by which important growth regulatory genes are targeted for epigenetic silencing in human cancers.

"Integrative analysis of genomic and epigenomic datasets in multiple cell types    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application addresses broad Challenge Area (08) Genomics, and specific Challenge Topic, 08-OD-101, Computational approaches for epigenomic analysis. While the primary DNA sequence of the human genome is ultimately responsible for the encoding and functioning of each cell, a plethora of chromatin and DNA modifications have been described in recent years that can modulate the interpretation of this primary sequence. These epigenetic modifications lead to the diversity of function across different human cell types, and play key roles in the establishment and maintenance of cellular identity during development, and also in health and disease. The human ENCODE project, the NIH Epigenome Roadmap, and several other large-scale experimental efforts are currently underway to map dozens of histone and DNA modifications across multiple human cell types and disease states, generating a diversity of rich epigenomic datasets. This creates a pressing need for the development of rigorous computational methods for the systematic integrative analysis of epigenomic datasets, and for understanding their relationship to other genomic datasets, including gene expression, disease association, and phenotypic profiling. In this proposal, we will develop and apply graphical probabilistic models for describing chromatin modifications, based on multivariate hidden Markov models. We will use these models to discover the set of underlying chromatin state, based on recurrent combinations of epigenetic marks across the entire genome (Aim 1). We will validate and functionally characterize these states based on their enrichments and positional biases with respect to existing functional elements, as well as large-scale gene expression and disease association datasets (Aim 2). Lastly, we will extend these methods to study dynamics of chromatin state across both healthy and disease cell types, and study how these correlate with functional differences between the observed cell types (Aim 3). We will work closely with the scientists involved in data production and facilitate communication and data integration across them, and also with data analysis and coordination centers already established to facilitate sharing of methods and results across the ENCODE and Epigenome Roadmap consortia, and with the larger community. Overall, the proposed integrative analysis of large-scale genomic and epigenomic datasets will provide a unified view of current and planned epigenomic datasets, towards a systematic understanding of gene and genome regulation in health and disease. While the primary DNA sequence of the human genome is ultimately responsible for the encoding and functioning of each cell, a plethora of chromatin and DNA modifications have been described in recent years that can modulate the interpretation of this primary sequence, leading to the diversity of function across different human cell types. This project will create a computational framework and resource to integrate large-scale genomic and epigenomic datasets, to understand their functional role in health and disease, and to understand their dynamics across different cell lines and disease states. The knowledge gained can play key roles in understanding the establishment and maintenance of cellular identity during healthy development, and how dysregulation of these processes can lead to the onset of disease.               Narrative: While the primary DNA sequence of the human genome is ultimately responsible for the encoding and functioning of each cell, a plethora of chromatin and DNA modifications have been described in recent years that can modulate the interpretation of this primary sequence, leading to the diversity of function across different human cell types.

"Global Predictions and Tests of Erythroid Regulation    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Proper regulation of gene expression is essential to the normal development and health of organisms, whereas aberrant gene regulation is known to cause many genetic diseases, including some inherited anemias, and it is thought to be a major contributor to complex phenotypes such as susceptibility to common diseases. Understanding the molecular mechanisms of gene regulation may provide novel candidates for therapeutic interventions. Our studies aim for a deeper molecular understanding of global aspects of gene regulation in an important biological process, the maturation of erythroid precursor cells to become red blood cells. Building on our progress using patterns in sequence alignments to predict cis-regulatory modules for erythroid genes and deciphering functional correlations of their evolutionary history, we propose to acquire genome-wide information on biochemical features associated with regulation to reach a more complete understanding of gene regulation in erythroid cells. Specifically, we propose to use high throughput biochemical assays such as chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by hybridization to microarrays and deep re-sequencing to acquire data on genomic DNA sequences (Aim 1) occupied in vivo by critical tissue-specific transcription factors, (Aim 2) bound by histones with modifications associated with gene activation or repression, (Aim 3) in chromatin with an altered structure, and (Aim 4) transcribed in a mouse erythroid cell model that undergoes maturation upon restoration of the critical transcription factor GATA-1. Then we will (Aim 5) apply existing software and develop new data-processing algorithms to determine peaks of signals that are likely to represent the locations of the features targeted in aims 1-4. Aim 6 will mine the peak-calling results, along with raw data, multiple sequence alignments and other information to investigate their covariation structure and integrate them to predict cis-regulatory modules, classify the modules by function, identify motifs associated with specific protein occupancy, and deduce the phylogenetic depth of preservation of critical motifs in the regulatory modules. Aim 7 will experimentally test biological hypotheses that arise from the analyses in Aims 6 and 7, determining the extent to which we can validate the locations of protein occupancy and transcripts, the predictions of both positive and negative cis-regulatory modules by gain-of-function cell transfection assays, and the role of motifs implicated in occupancy by directed mutagenesis and in vivo binding assays. We will test whether the motif- constraint hypothesis for protein-occupied DNA segments involved in enhancement applies to transcription factors in addition to GATA-1, and we will conduct additional experiments probing deeper biological issues. This research will provide not only global insights into mechanisms and effects of gene regulation during erythroid maturation, but the techniques and analytical tools developed here can be applied to better understand the development and differentiation of any tissue.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Proper regulation of gene expression is essential to the normal development and health of organisms, whereas aberrant gene regulation can cause genetic diseases, and it appears to be a major contributor to susceptibility to common diseases.

"Gene Regulation E. coli Database Integrated Modeling    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The Center for Genomic Sciences of the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM) in Cuernavaca and a group of collaborators propose to further develop and enrich the RegulonDB database. RegulonDB contains the largest electronically-available regulatory network of any living organism, that of Escherichia coli K-12. In the project we will expand the design, implement computational and conceptual models, and generate annotations derived from original literature of the different components of the regulatory network. We will experimentally map promoters and transcription units under different conditions. This project expands a previous grant supporting RegulonDB. High quality manual curation is to be enriched beyond transcription initiation to include signal-transduction connecting sensing with regulation, as well as with natural language text processing tools. We propose to continue an exhaustive experimental mapping of all possible transcription initiation sites in the genome and to perform an exhaustive experimental identification of transcription units in different conditions. The core of RegulonDB (literature-based network and the graphic and browsing tools) will be linked and made accessible, as optional user selections, with high-throughput available experiments (microarrays and ChIP- chip) both as raw and pre-analyzed data, as well as with collections of computational predictions of all network elements (transcription factors, promoters, binding sites, operons, regulatory interactions). This will be based on track representations and compliant with international consortia normalized pathway exchange formats.

"Identification of Transcriptional Factor Binding Sites in Human Promoters    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   Transcriptional regulation is a highly coordinated process in the human genome. A significant component of transcriptional regulation is the interaction between transcriptional factor proteins (TFs) and cis-regulatory DNA elements. The goal of this project is to computationally predict and experimentally validate DNA sequence motifs that explain promoter function. The results of this project will be direct functional measurements of sequence motifs at base-pair resolution. This will yield extremely valuable information to assess the sensitivity and specificity of algorithms that can be immediately applied to the whole genome. These results will also help to identify the proportion of functionally relevant transcription factor binding events. The three aims of our project are: Aim 1: We will use two machine learning algorithms (support vector machines and random forest) to determine a subset of known transcription factor binding motifs that are the most predictive of promoter activities. Aim 2: We will then use Bayesian networks to select the most predictive motif features. These features are the strengths of the motif using PSSM and the positions of individual sites relative to each other and the transcription start site. Aim 3: We will then perform mutagenesis of the informative positions within the 900 sites identified in Aim 2, and measure their promoter activities by using transient transfection assays. We also plan to test 100 lower ranking sites to determine the sensitivity and specificity of our algorithms. We will also develop an oligo competition assay as a new approach to increase the throughput of experimental motif analysis for the rest of the genome. The data generated in this project will be the first systematic functional analysis of TF binding sites at base-pair resolution.              n/a",Identification of Transcriptional Factor Binding Sites in Human Promoters,7502766,U01HG004561,"['Accounting', 'Algorithms', 'Amino Acid Motifs', 'Antibodies', 'Base Pairing', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological Assay', 'Cell Line', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'Classification', 'Collection', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Elements', 'Event', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Life', 'Localized', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Mutagenesis', 'Mutation', 'Oligonucleotides', 'Policies', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Promoter Regions', 'Protein Binding', 'Proteins', 'Range', 'Relative (related person)', 'Reporter', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Rest', 'Score', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Site', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Transcription Initiation Site', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Transfection', 'base', 'chromatin immunoprecipitation', 'computer based statistical methods', 'cost', 'forest', 'member', 'novel strategies', 'promoter', 'research study', 'transcription factor']",NHGRI,UNIV OF MASSACHUSETTS MED SCH WORCESTER,U01,2008,418301,0.03982909583728729
"Locating Regulatory Elements in Genomes    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Understanding regulatory networks controlling gene expression is one of the fundamental problems of modern biology. The proposed research focuses on the methods of locating regulatory elements in DNA. We have developed a new maximum likelihood method based on the physical DNA dependent binding probability of a transcription factor (TF) that correctly incorporates the protein concentration dependent saturation effect. The advantage of keeping the saturation effect is that the method automatically provides a score threshold for classifying candidate sites into binders and non-binders. Most conventional methods, based on the information score, merely provide a relative ordering of candidate sequences. The principled choice of a threshold is extremely useful for dealing with the highly variable sites typical of global regulatory factors. The simplest of our algorithms reduces to a one-class support vector machine. This classifier will be applied to detect large regulons in E. coli, as well as in phages, with special attention to targets of sigma factors. We also develop classifiers for regulatory targets that go beyond pure sequence analysis and combine it with information from additional sources, like microarray expression data or sequence similarity between phylogenetically closely related species. The proposed computational effort will be complemented by experiments verifying the predictions as well as providing in vitro and in vivo data needed to make predictions. Experimental efforts will involve a high throughput low stringency SELEX method applied to global transcriptional regulators from E. coli. It will also involve chromatin immunoprecipitation and beta- galactosidase assays performed in S. Cerevisiae that test the ability of bioinformatic algorithms to predict functionality of TF binding sites. A special feature of this proposal is the analysis of the effect of the rest of the promoter on the regulatory potential of a site. We apply the lessons learnt in simple organisms to the elucidation of distinctive specificity of different NFkB proteins involved in immunity, inflammation and cancer. Mutation, over-expression and amplification of genes encoding transcription factors play an important role in many diseases from diabetes to cancer. Understanding how a factor targets genes is crucial for discovering the pathways whose malfunction leads to the symptoms.

"A Comprehensive Structural and Dynamic Map of DNA Duplex Ends    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The structure and dynamics of DNA duplex ends can influence numerous enzyme-dependent processes such as transposition of phage Mu, and integration of HIV dsDNA copies into target chromosomal DNA. Despite their critical importance in biology, DNA duplex ends are significantly under-represented in NMR and crystal structure studies, and their dynamic properties have not been measured directly. The long-term goal of this project is to establish a comprehensive dynamic and structural map of DNA duplex ends. This map will be at near angstrom precision and will include all possible combinations of base pairs for the last six positions of the DNA helix (i.e. 46 = 4096 unique sequences). The approach we will use to generate the map couples NMR spectroscopy with an instrument developed in our laboratory for single molecule measurements. This instrument is based on a nanoscale pore formed by the bacterial toxin, ?-hemolysin. When individual DNA hairpins are captured in this pore by an applied electric field, the duplex stem is suspended in the pore vestibule. Preliminary results suggest that low frequency (kHz) current noise during DNA capture is caused by structural changes of the helix terminus. The aim of this R-21 proposal is to determine if the nanopore detector gives unbiased reads of DNA duplex end structure and dynamics in the Hz to MHz range. Specific questions we will address include: 1) To what extent does the pore vestibule and the applied electric field influence DNA dynamics? 2) Are the duplex end kinetics independent of hairpin loop identity and duplex stem length? 3) There is broad consensus that some sequences are unusually rigid (e.g. A tracts) while others are highly flexible (e.g. TATA). Do these sequences cause nanopore current signatures that cluster together as predicted? 4) Can pattern recognition algorithms be used to automate data analysis? We consider this research to be suited for R-21 funding because there is substantial risk that the outcome will be negative, i.e. we may find that the observed current dynamics are only relevant to the limited case of DNA hairpins captured in a nanoscale protein cavity. However, if the research is successful, it will yield a new way to observe DNA dynamics that reports precise kinetic data, and that is amenable to high throughput experiments. These nanopore experiments will be used to direct subsequent NMR experiments and vice versa.         n/a",A Comprehensive Structural and Dynamic Map of DNA Duplex Ends,7447802,R21GM073617,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Automated Pattern Recognition', 'Bacterial Toxins', 'Bacteriophage mu', 'Base Pairing', 'Bathing', 'Behavior', 'Biology', 'Caliber', 'Canada', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 5', 'Computer software', 'Consensus', 'Couples', 'DNA', 'DNA mapping', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Devices', 'Digestion', 'Enzymes', 'Exonuclease', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'HIV', 'Helix (Snails)', 'Hemolysin', 'Individual', 'Kinetics', 'Laboratories', 'Length', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'NMR Spectroscopy', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Phase', 'Pore Proteins', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'Range', 'Reading', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Residual state', 'Risk', 'Robotics', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Shapes', 'Structure', 'System', 'Teflon', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tube', 'Universities', 'Vestibule', 'base', 'detector', 'ear helix', 'electric field', 'improved', 'instrument', 'interest', 'nanopore', 'nanoscale', 'polymerization', 'professor', 'research study', 'single molecule', 'stem', 'two-dimensional']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SANTA CRUZ,R21,2008,100329,0.023170624085855233

"Identification of Transcriptional Factor Binding Sites in Human Promoters    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   Transcriptional regulation is a highly coordinated process in the human genome. A significant component of transcriptional regulation is the interaction between transcriptional factor proteins (TFs) and cis-regulatory DNA elements. The goal of this project is to computationally predict and experimentally validate DNA sequence motifs that explain promoter function. The results of this project will be direct functional measurements of sequence motifs at base-pair resolution. This will yield extremely valuable information to assess the sensitivity and specificity of algorithms that can be immediately applied to the whole genome. These results will also help to identify the proportion of functionally relevant transcription factor binding events. The three aims of our project are: Aim 1: We will use two machine learning algorithms (support vector machines and random forest) to determine a subset of known transcription factor binding motifs that are the most predictive of promoter activities. Aim 2: We will then use Bayesian networks to select the most predictive motif features. These features are the strengths of the motif using PSSM and the positions of individual sites relative to each other and the transcription start site. Aim 3: We will then perform mutagenesis of the informative positions within the 900 sites identified in Aim 2, and measure their promoter activities by using transient transfection assays. We also plan to test 100 lower ranking sites to determine the sensitivity and specificity of our algorithms. We will also develop an oligo competition assay as a new approach to increase the throughput of experimental motif analysis for the rest of the genome.

"Locating Regulatory Elements in Genomes    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Understanding regulatory networks controlling gene expression is one of the fundamental problems of modern biology. The proposed research focuses on the methods of locating regulatory elements in DNA. We have developed a new maximum likelihood method based on the physical DNA dependent binding probability of a transcription factor (TF) that correctly incorporates the protein concentration dependent saturation effect. The advantage of keeping the saturation effect is that the method automatically provides a score threshold for classifying candidate sites into binders and non-binders. Most conventional methods, based on the information score, merely provide a relative ordering of candidate sequences. The principled choice of a threshold is extremely useful for dealing with the highly variable sites typical of global regulatory factors. The simplest of our algorithms reduces to a one-class support vector machine. This classifier will be applied to detect large regulons in E. coli, as well as in phages, with special attention to targets of sigma factors. We also develop classifiers for regulatory targets that go beyond pure sequence analysis and combine it with information from additional sources, like microarray expression data or sequence similarity between phylogenetically closely related species. The proposed computational effort will be complemented by experiments verifying the predictions as well as providing in vitro and in vivo data needed to make predictions. Experimental efforts will involve a high throughput low stringency SELEX method applied to global transcriptional regulators from E. coli. It will also involve chromatin immunoprecipitation and beta- galactosidase assays performed in S. Cerevisiae that test the ability of bioinformatic algorithms to predict functionality of TF binding sites. A special feature of this proposal is the analysis of the effect of the rest of the promoter on the regulatory potential of a site. We apply the lessons learnt in simple organisms to the elucidation of distinctive specificity of different NFkB proteins involved in immunity, inflammation and cancer. Mutation, over-expression and amplification of genes encoding transcription factors play an important role in many diseases from diabetes to cancer. Understanding how a factor targets genes is crucial for discovering the pathways whose malfunction leads to the symptoms. This is an achievable goal, given the right way to analyze the plethora of genome-wide data available to us.           n/a",Locating Regulatory Elements in Genomes,7221303,R01HG003470,"['Affinity', 'Algorithms', 'Attention', 'Bacteriophages', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Biogenesis', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Class', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer Analysis', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Early identification', 'Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay', 'Escherichia coli', 'Evolution', 'Gene Amplification', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Immunity', 'In Vitro', 'Inflammation', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mating Types', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Organism', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phylogenetic Analysis', 'Play', 'Probability', 'Protein Overexpression', 'Proteins', 'Regulatory Element', 'Regulon', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Ribosomes', 'Role', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae', 'Score', 'Sequence Analysis', 'Shock', 'Sigma Factor', 'Site', 'Source', 'Specificity', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Work', 'base', 'beta-Galactosidase', 'chromatin immunoprecipitation', 'combinatorial', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'programs', 'promoter', 'research study', 'response', 'transcription factor']",NHGRI,RUTGERS THE ST UNIV OF NJ NEW BRUNSWICK,R01,2007,299796,0.03646013126716232
"A Comprehensive Structural and Dynamic Map of DNA Duplex Ends    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The structure and dynamics of DNA duplex ends can influence numerous enzyme-dependent processes such as transposition of phage Mu, and integration of HIV dsDNA copies into target chromosomal DNA. Despite their critical importance in biology, DNA duplex ends are significantly under-represented in NMR and crystal structure studies, and their dynamic properties have not been measured directly. The long-term goal of this project is to establish a comprehensive dynamic and structural map of DNA duplex ends. This map will be at near angstrom precision and will include all possible combinations of base pairs for the last six positions of the DNA helix (i.e. 46 = 4096 unique sequences). The approach we will use to generate the map couples NMR spectroscopy with an instrument developed in our laboratory for single molecule measurements. This instrument is based on a nanoscale pore formed by the bacterial toxin, ?-hemolysin. When individual DNA hairpins are captured in this pore by an applied electric field, the duplex stem is suspended in the pore vestibule. Preliminary results suggest that low frequency (kHz) current noise during DNA capture is caused by structural changes of the helix terminus. The aim of this R-21 proposal is to determine if the nanopore detector gives unbiased reads of DNA duplex end structure and dynamics in the Hz to MHz range. Specific questions we will address include: 1) To what extent does the pore vestibule and the applied electric field influence DNA dynamics? 2) Are the duplex end kinetics independent of hairpin loop identity and duplex stem length? 3) There is broad consensus that some sequences are unusually rigid (e.g. A tracts) while others are highly flexible (e.g. TATA). Do these sequences cause nanopore current signatures that cluster together as predicted? 4) Can pattern recognition algorithms be used to automate data analysis? We consider this research to be suited for R-21 funding because there is substantial risk that the outcome will be negative, i.e. we may find that the observed current dynamics are only relevant to the limited case of DNA hairpins captured in a nanoscale protein cavity. However, if the research is successful, it will yield a new way to observe DNA dynamics that reports precise kinetic data, and that is amenable to high throughput experiments. These nanopore experiments will be used to direct subsequent NMR experiments and vice versa.         n/a",A Comprehensive Structural and Dynamic Map of DNA Duplex Ends,7229898,R21GM073617,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Automated Pattern Recognition', 'Bacterial Toxins', 'Bacteriophage mu', 'Base Pairing', 'Bathing', 'Behavior', 'Biology', 'Caliber', 'Canada', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 5', 'Computer software', 'Consensus', 'Couples', 'DNA', 'DNA mapping', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Devices', 'Digestion', 'Enzymes', 'Exonuclease', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'HIV', 'Helix (Snails)', 'Hemolysin', 'Individual', 'Kinetics', 'Laboratories', 'Length', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'NMR Spectroscopy', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Phase', 'Pore Proteins', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'Range', 'Reading', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Residual state', 'Risk', 'Robotics', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Shapes', 'Structure', 'System', 'Teflon', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tube', 'Universities', 'Vestibule', 'base', 'detector', 'ear helix', 'electric field', 'improved', 'instrument', 'interest', 'nanopore', 'nanoscale', 'polymerization', 'professor', 'research study', 'single molecule', 'stem', 'two-dimensional']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SANTA CRUZ,R21,2007,143598,0.023170624085855233

"Genomic Reconstruction of Yeast Transcription Networks DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Organisms devote a significant fraction of their genomes to encoding regulatory information which specifies when and where different genes should be turned on or off. Such information is essential for understanding development, tissue specificity, and cellular response to the environment and has great importance for understanding the molecular basis of disease.

"Statistical Models in Epigenomics The primary objective of this proposal is to develop statistical models for the analysis of DNA methylation data. Questions that are currently posed for gene expression profiles, such as how to classify samples based on cell-wide gene expression patterns or how to classify genes with unknown function, based on their expression patterns across samples, may be similarly posed for DNA methylation patterns.  Our focus is on the discovery of new subgroups based on patterns of DNA methylation.  We view DNA methylation patterns as an intermediate variable along a pathway from exposures to outcomes and take a flexible hierarchical modeling approach that can incorporate measured and unmeasured covariates.  Our aims are motivated by ongoing and planned future studies in the Department of Preventive Medicine and Norris Cancer Center at the University of Southern California.

"Knowledge-based Analysis of Transcription Factor Binding I propose new knowledge-based approaches for determining both the short sequences of DNA to which transcription factors bind and the ways in which the context of these sequences specify regulatory control. I will apply these approaches to recently produced binding data from chromatin-immunoprecipitation microarray efforts in S. cerevisiae. First, I will incorporate information from three-dimensional structures of protein-DNA complexes into motif discovery algorithms to identify over-represented sequences in the bound intergenic regions. Second, I will use machine learning techniques to apply multiple criteria based on biological knowledge of promoter organization to identify which of the binding sites predicted by these algorithms are genuine. As a first application of new motifs found using these approaches, I will perform hypothesis-directed sequence analysis to reconcile differences between in vivo binding and the organization of binding sites in promoters. Following experimental validation, the discovered binding motifs and organizational rules will provide the basis for a deeper understanding of the underlying logic of promoter organization, and will have direct impact on the study of transcriptional regulatory mechanisms in higher eukaryotes.            n/a",Knowledge-based Analysis of Transcription Factor Binding,6841605,F32GM068278,"['Saccharomyces cerevisiae', 'binding sites', 'bioinformatics', 'chromatin immunoprecipitation', 'computational biology', 'computer assisted sequence analysis', 'genetic promoter element', 'genetic regulation', 'microarray technology', 'nucleic acid sequence', 'nucleic acid structure', 'postdoctoral investigator', 'protein binding', 'protein structure function', 'transcription factor']",NIGMS,WHITEHEAD INSTITUTE FOR BIOMEDICAL RES,F32,2005,7362,0.042765233163431345

Our focus is on the discovery of new subgroups based on patterns of DNA methylation.  We view DNA methylation patterns as an intermediate variable along a pathway from exposures to outcomes and take a flexible hierarchical modeling approach that can incorporate measured and unmeasured covariates.  Our aims are motivated by ongoing and planned future studies in the Department of Preventive Medicine and Norris Cancer Center at the University of Southern California.  Specifically, we propose to: 1. Develop model-based class discovery methods (cluster analysis/unsupervised learning approaches) using quantitative measures of DNA methylation, adjusting for locus-specific and sample-specific covariate effects. a. Analysis of paired samples of tumor tissue and normal tissue taken from the margin of the tumor. b. Extend model to allow for multiple tumors per subject. c.

"DNA pattern identification and analysis    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    We will continue the development of computer methods for analyzing gene regulation. We will further enhance methods to identify regulatory sites from the promoter regions of co-regulated genes with special emphasis on taking advantage of orthologous promoter regions from additional species. Included in the improvements will be better ways to identify multiple transcription factors that act coordinately to regulate gene expression.      We will develop computational methods to help determine which transcription factors within a genome interact with which regulatory sites. The methods will be developed initially using bacterial genomes where a large number of genome sequences, from a wide range of phylogenetic distances, already exist. We will test the ability of different types of information, including genomic location, phylogenetic correlation and recognition code predictions, to aid in the identification of the associations between factors and sites.      We will continue the development and enhancement of methods to predict RNA motifs composed of both sequence and structure constraints. We will go beyond the capabilities of programs like FOLDALIGN to detect conserved structures that are complex, including pseudoknots. Two approaches will be tested, one general one that should work on any collection of common RNA motifs and the other designed specifically to take advantage of phylogenetically conserved motifs in orthologous regions of multiple species.      Each of these projects will be enhanced through collaborations with other groups, primarily experimentalists, who are interested in the application of our methods to their biological problems.         n/a",DNA pattern identification and analysis,6774554,R01HG000249,"['artificial intelligence', 'binding sites', 'computer assisted sequence analysis', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'functional /structural genomics', 'genetic regulation', 'method development', 'nucleic acid sequence', 'protein structure', 'transcription factor']",NHGRI,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2004,306000,0.02393954463125327
"Genomic Reconstruction of Yeast Transcription Networks DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Organisms devote a significant fraction of their genomes to encoding regulatory information which specifies when and where different genes should be turned on or off. Such information is essential for understanding development, tissue specificity, and cellular response to the environment and has great importance for understanding the molecular basis of disease. The one dimensional regulatory programs encoded in DNA are executed by transcription factors which respond to different conditions and regulate gene expression combinatorially, leading to complex regulatory networks. The goal of the proposed research is to develop theoretical models and computational algorithms to decipher the regulatory programs and to reconstruct the transcription networks in the model organism Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The following are the specific aims: 1) to systematically map the DNA recognition sites and target genes of transcription factors in the genome, 2) to identify environmental and genetic perturbations under which each transcription factor is activated or deactivated, 3) to systematically analyze combinatorial regulation by multiple transcription factors, 4) collaborate with two experimental labs to address specific problems of transcriptional regulation and combinatorial control, and 5) to build databases and online tools for the biological community to analyze gene expression data and transcriptional regulation. We will develop methods integrating information from the genome sequences for several yeast species and genome-wide functional data, and we will combine bioinformatics analysis with mechanistic models of gene regulation. n/a",Genomic Reconstruction of Yeast Transcription Networks,6754662,R01GM070808,"['Saccharomyces cerevisiae', 'artificial intelligence', 'binding sites', 'chemical binding', 'chromatin immunoprecipitation', 'combinatorial chemistry', 'fungal genetics', 'genetic mapping', 'genetic models', 'genetic regulation', 'genetic transcription', 'mathematical model', 'microarray technology', 'model design /development', 'molecular biology information system', 'transcription factor']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SAN FRANCISCO,R01,2004,268267,0.06170183463504489
"Knowledge-based Analysis of Transcription Factor Binding I propose new knowledge-based approaches for determining both the short sequences of DNA to which transcription factors bind and the ways in which the context of these sequences specify regulatory control. I will apply these approaches to recently produced binding data from chromatin-immunoprecipitation microarray efforts in S. cerevisiae. First, I will incorporate information from three-dimensional structures of protein-DNA complexes into motif discovery algorithms to identify over-represented sequences in the bound intergenic regions. Second, I will use machine learning techniques to apply multiple criteria based on biological knowledge of promoter organization to identify which of the binding sites predicted by these algorithms are genuine. As a first application of new motifs found using these approaches, I will perform hypothesis-directed sequence analysis to reconcile differences between in vivo binding and the organization of binding sites in promoters. Following experimental validation, the discovered binding motifs and organizational rules will provide the basis for a deeper understanding of the underlying logic of promoter organization, and will have direct impact on the study of transcriptional regulatory mechanisms in higher eukaryotes.            n/a",Knowledge-based Analysis of Transcription Factor Binding,6740580,F32GM068278,"['Saccharomyces cerevisiae', 'binding sites', 'bioinformatics', 'chromatin immunoprecipitation', 'computational biology', 'computer assisted sequence analysis', 'genetic promoter element', 'genetic regulation', 'microarray technology', 'nucleic acid sequence', 'nucleic acid structure', 'postdoctoral investigator', 'protein binding', 'protein structure function', 'transcription factor']",NIGMS,WHITEHEAD INSTITUTE FOR BIOMEDICAL RES,F32,2004,48928,0.042765233163431345

"DNA 3.0: Developing novel enzymes for DNA synthesis with deep learning and combinatorial genetics Project Summary/Abstract  DNA synthesis has played a key role in the biotechnology revolution. The ready availability of synthetic DNA oligonucleotides and of genes assembled from them, has been invaluable for elucidating and unlocking biological function and enabling the new field of synthetic biology which can create novel cells, enzymes, therapeutics, diagnostics and other reagents of commercial value. Despite this impact, DNA synthesis uses chemical strategies developed over 30 years ago which are costly and limited to molecules of 200 nucleotides or less in length.  Next-generation enzymatic DNA synthesis technologies are being explored that use template- independent DNA polymerases (TIDPs) for controlled addition of nucleotides to a growing DNA strand. Although advances have been reported recently, enzymatic DNA synthesis is still limited by the low efficiency of available TIDPs, and specifically by the relative inability of these polymerases to incorporate 3'-blocked nucleotides.  In this Phase I Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project, Primordial Genetics Inc, a synthetic biology company with differentiated combinatorial genetic technology, and Denovium Inc., an artificial intelligence company pioneering novel Al methods for genetic discovery, are joining forces to develop novel and highly efficient TIDPs for enzymatic DNA synthesis in vitro.  Denovium will use their computational capabilities based on machine learning algorithms to discover novel TIDPs with the desired activities from proprietary and public databases. Denovium will also perform proprietary artificial intelligence (AI) scans to determine the functional impact of all possible mutations on the selected TIDPs. Primordial Genetics will synthesize and express the resulting collection of sequences, and test them in vitro to identify the most active enzymes. The best 2 enzymes will be diversified using Primordial Genetics' proprietary Function Generator technology and other randomized diversification methods. Populations of genes encoding enzyme variants will be screened with ultra-high-throughput screens to identify the most active enzymes. The dataset resulting from this work will be used to train Denovium's sequence prediction algorithm to accelerate further enzyme improvements in Phase II.  The proposed work is a feasibility study for isolating and developing novel enzymes suitable for enzymatic DNA synthesis, and also for creating a pipeline of enzyme optimization tools. The enzymes discovered and in this work will be directly useful for enzymatic DNA synthesis applications, and can be licensed or sold to leading DNA and gene manufaturers. Project Narrative The principal aim of this project is to develop novel and improved DNA polymerases for the industrial synthesis of DNA, which is currently performed by synthetic chemical methods and represents one of the cornerstone technologies of the biotechnology industry. To overcome limitations of the current chemical technology in cost, efficiency and the length of DNA molecules that can be synthesized, there have been widespread attempts to develop specific DNA polymerases as efficient molecular machines for synthesizing DNA. This project will develop novel and more efficient polymerases than are currently available, which will impact the diagnosis, prevention and treatment of human diseases such as cancer, heart disease, HIV and genetic diseases such as cystic fibrosis.",DNA 3.0: Developing novel enzymes for DNA synthesis with deep learning and combinatorial genetics,10010243,R43HG010995,"['Artificial Intelligence', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Biotechnology', 'Capital', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Chemistry', 'Collection', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Cost efficiency', 'Cystic Fibrosis', 'DNA', 'DNA Nucleotidylexotransferase', 'DNA biosynthesis', 'DNA-Directed DNA Polymerase', 'Data Set', 'Data Storage and Retrieval', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Enzymes', 'Equipment', 'Evolution', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Diseases', 'HIV', 'Heart Diseases', 'In Vitro', 'Industrialization', 'Industry', 'Length', 'Libraries', 'Licensing', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methods', 'Microbe', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Biology', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Molecular Machines', 'Mutation', 'Nucleotides', 'Oligonucleotides', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Polymerase', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Randomized', 'Reagent', 'Reporting', 'Research Project Grants', 'Scanning', 'Single-Stranded DNA', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'TimeLine', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'combinatorial', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'genetic technology', 'high throughput screening', 'human disease', 'improved', 'in vitro testing', 'machine learning algorithm', 'model development', 'next generation', 'novel', 'phosphoramidite', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive test', 'research and development', 'synthetic biology', 'synthetic construct', 'tool']",NHGRI,"PRIMORDIAL GENETICS, INC",R43,2020,374524,0.03272454741958401
"Uncovering the epitranscriptome regulatory codes using machine learning Project Summary N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is the most abundant methylation widely found in mRNAs of mammalian cells whose function is largely unknown. Recent research has accumulated increasingly strong evidence of m6A's involvement in different diseases such as leukemia, breast cancer, lung cancer, and AIDs. While m6A's close involvement in many diseases is apparent, mechanistic evidence linking m6A alterations to disease phenotypes is mostly missing. Most of the recent research is fueled by the high throughput sequencing technologies such as MeRIP-seq for transcriptome-wide profiling of m6A methylation. However, due to the innate limitations of such technologies, sophisticated machine learning based algorithms are urgently needed to address the problem of detecting m6A sites with high sensitivity and precision, accurate quantification of m6A methylation levels and the prediction of m6A sites differentially affected under disease and normal conditions and the prediction of genes whose expression levels are regulated by m6A. Without bridging these knowledge gaps, it is impossible to made inroads to the problem of finding m6A's role in regulating diseases. To address these issues, our aims in this proposal are 1) Establish a deep learning algorithm for base-resolution m6A site prediction; 2) Establish base- resolution m6A differential site prediction using a hierarchical Bayesian approach; and 3) Determine m6A- mediated genes and functions by Bayesian Negative-Binomial regression. The proposed research will employ deep learning and adversarial learned inference methods and utilize both methylation quantification and sequence information for the first time. Also, it will employ Bayesian graphical model-based methods for combining sequence and methylation level information. It is expected that the developed algorithms will have broad applications in functional study, for which we plan to closely work with our collaborators in applying these algorithms in their research of Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV), which will lead to the fulfillment our long term goal in the eventual validation and practical medical application of m6A research in the future. Project Narrative  This project proposes to address the problem of detecting m6A sites with high sensitivity and precision, accurate quantification of m6A methylation levels, the prediction of m6A sites differentially affected under disease and normal conditions and the prediction of genes whose expression levels are regulated by m6A. The overall goal is to elucidate m6A's role in regulating diseases.",Uncovering the epitranscriptome regulatory codes using machine learning,9937431,SC3GM136594,"['3&apos', ' Untranslated Regions', '5&apos', ' Untranslated Regions', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Bayesian Method', 'Binding', 'Biological Process', 'Code', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Human Herpesvirus 8', 'Hypermethylation', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Mammalian Cell', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Messenger RNA', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Pathway interactions', 'Play', 'Problem Solving', 'Proteins', 'RNA-Binding Proteins', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Site', 'Statistical Distributions', 'Supervision', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Transcript', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'cell transformation', 'convolutional neural network', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'disease phenotype', 'effective therapy', 'epitranscriptome', 'gene function', 'improved', 'leukemia', 'mRNA Stability', 'machine learning algorithm', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'metaplastic cell transformation', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'tool', 'transcriptome', 'tumorigenesis']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS SAN ANTONIO,SC3,2020,97500,0.02093428782916786
"Genetic determinants of 4D genome folding in human cardiac development PROJECT SUMMARY A major unanswered question is how chromatin topology coordinates human development and cellular differentiation, and how genome folding is differentially regulated in human disease. It is thought that three- dimensional (3D) chromatin organization is driven by transcriptional regulators, but fundamental mechanisms of this regulation as it relates to disease-relevant human cells have not been well explored. We propose to elucidate the temporally dynamic 3D nucleome (4DN) that underlies human cardiac differentiation, its molecular underpinnings, and the impact of mutations that underly defective 4DN organization in human congenital heart disease (CHD). CHDs are the most common birth defect and arise from abnormal heart development. The genetic basis of CHD is largely mutations in genes encoding chromatin modifiers (e.g. WDR5, KMT2D) and transcription factors (TFs, e.g. TBX5, GATA4), many of which also cause adult-onset arrhythmias. The impact of CHD mutations on the 4DN has not been explored. We hypothesize that 3D genome folding is highly regulated during cardiac differentiation and is impacted by disease-causing mutations in transcriptional regulators and non-coding elements. We will use iPS cell models and machine learning to elucidate dynamic 3D chromatin organization in human cardiomyocytes and endothelial cells during normal and diseased cardiac differentiation. We propose 3 specific aims: Aim 1: Establish a kilobase-scale 4D map of genome folding in human cardiomyocytes (CM) and endothelial cell (EC) differentiation. We will use directed differentiation of human iPS cells towards the two major cell types of the developing heart: CMs and ECs, and using microC across a fine time course of differentiation we will define at kilobase scale the 3D organization of the genome, capturing the states of developmental intermediates and the final differentiated cells. This aim will generate an essential integrated 4DN template for discovery in cardiac differentiation. In Aim 2: we will Determine the regulatory and disease-related basis for cardiac 3D chromatin organization. We will perform microC in iPS cell lines with CHD-associated mutations in transcriptional regulators, differentiated into CMs and ECs. These findings will establish the degree to which CHD is caused by abnormal genome folding and chromatin states, with important relevance to other human cardiovascular diseases. Finally, Aim 3 will address High-throughput screening of millions of CHD and synthetic non- coding mutations with a deep-learning model of dynamic genome folding. We will build a deep-learning model predicting 3D chromatin contact frequencies across cardiac differentiation at kilobase-resolution. By introducing thousands of CHD patient deletions and other non-coding mutations in silico, we will prioritize variants likely to interact with transcriptional regulators to cause disease through disrupted genome folding. Several candidates will be validated in engineered iPS cells differentiated into CMs and ECs. These results will provide a novel platform for computational discovery of disease variant impact across diverse human diseases PROJECT NARRATIVE Congenital heart defects are present in 1-2 out of 100 births, and are caused by mutations in genes that may control the 3-dimensional organization of chromosomes. We will use human cellular models and Artificial Intelligence to understand how chromosome organization is controlled during heart development and altered by disease processes. This will reveal fundamental concepts of gene regulation and may lead to a better understanding congenital heart defects towards improving diagnosis and treatment.",Genetic determinants of 4D genome folding in human cardiac development,10118056,U01HL157989,"['3-Dimensional', 'ATAC-seq', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Architecture', 'Arrhythmia', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Birth', 'CCCTC-binding factor', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Myocytes', 'Cardiac development', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cell Differentiation process', 'Cell Line', 'Cell model', 'Cells', 'ChIP-seq', 'Child', 'Chromatin', 'Chromatin Remodeling Factor', 'Chromosome Structures', 'Code', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Congenital Abnormality', 'Congenital Heart Defects', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Endothelial Cells', 'Engineering', 'Enhancers', 'Family', 'Frequencies', 'GATA4 gene', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Determinism', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Heart', 'Heart Abnormalities', 'Heart Diseases', 'Histones', 'Human', 'Human Biology', 'Human Development', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Regulation', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Resolution', 'SMARCA2 gene', 'Structure', 'Time', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'Work', 'cardiogenesis', 'cell type', 'cohesin', 'computational platform', 'congenital heart disorder', 'deep learning', 'disease-causing mutation', 'high throughput screening', 'histone modification', 'human disease', 'human model', 'human pluripotent stem cell', 'improved', 'in silico', 'machine learning method', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'promoter', 'stem cell differentiation', 'stem cell model', 'transcription factor']",NHLBI,J.

"Computational modeling of DNA methylation-mediated gene regulation Abstract Large numbers of complete methylomes are being acquired through clinical sequencing projects, such as through The Cancer Genome Atlas, Blueprint Epigenome Project, and International Cancer Genome Consortium. Furthermore, third-generation nanopore sequencers, which detect DNA methylation and genetic variation in a single experiment, are nearly ready for routine clinical sequencing and will provide complete methylomes for all patients where whole-genome sequencing is indicated. Current analysis tools however only perform preliminary methylome processing and catalogue differentially methylated regions (DMRs). In order to transform methylome analysis into a clinically useful diagnostic/prognostic test, we need to develop predictive tools to interpret the functional and pathological consequences of identified methylation changes. Towards this goal, we have published a series of papers demonstrating that machine-learning based models utilizing high- resolution signatures of all methylation changes around a promoter vastly outperform conventional DMR methods. Our models accurately predict expression states at genes potentially regulated by methylation and reveal predictive methylation signatures that facilitate mechanistic interpretation. Nonetheless, several challenges remain before we can achieve our goals of translating genome-wide methylation data for routine clinical use: (1) To our knowledge, no current models integrate distal enhancers, whose activation is affected by DNA methylation. Such integrative analysis is necessary to understand consequences of methylation changes in cancers, whose genomes frequently undergo wide-spread methylation changes. In addition, such modelling will be essential to understand the role of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC), which may play both repressive and activating roles in neurons depending on whether it is found at promoters or enhancers. (2) Our current models (and conventional approaches) represent methylation data independent of DNA sequence despite mechanistic studies demonstrating that methylation changes can have different functional effects depending on which sequences change and depending on the context of the local regulatory grammar. In this proposal, we will meet these challenges by first developing a predictive model that incorporates 5-methylcytosine and 5hmC at promoters and enhancers to determine how these marks act in concert. In particular, we will examine the hypothesized dual role of 5hmC as a repressor at promoters and as an activator at enhancers in cortical neurons. We will then use new advances in natural language processing to model DNA sequence and methylation to predict expression states. Our results will reveal which regulatory elements and transcription factors binding sites are affected by DNA methylation and how changes at different sites collaborate to affect expression changes. We will experimentally validate our in silico predictions using a combination of reporter assays and CRISPR- based epigenome-editing tools. Thus, the software tools we develop will form an important toolkit for the analysis and mechanistic interpretation of whole-genome methylation studies, both in the laboratory and clinic. Public Narrative DNA normally undergoes a variety of chemical modifications including the addition of methyl- and hydroxymethyl- groups to cytosines (DNA methylation). Though we are unsure how to interpret them, abnormal patterns of DNA methylation are often found in human diseases and will likely soon be routinely measured in the clinic. In this proposal, we will develop advanced computational approaches to predict the functional and pathological consequences of DNA methylation changes in disease. In the future, the approaches we develop will lead to software that suggests individualized therapies for patients based on clinical methylation data.",Computational modeling of DNA methylation-mediated gene regulation,10018936,R01LM013096,"['Affect', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological Assay', 'Brain', 'Cataloging', 'Catalogs', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Chemicals', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Communities', 'Computer Models', 'Computer software', 'Cytosine', 'DNA', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA Sequence', 'DNA sequencing', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Distal', 'Elements', 'Enhancers', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Etiology', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Glioma', 'Goals', 'Individual', 'International', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Mus', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neurons', 'Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'Paper', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Play', 'Publishing', 'Recurrence', 'Regulation', 'Regulatory Element', 'Reporter', 'Resolution', 'Retrieval', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Software Tools', 'Testing', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Training', 'Translating', 'base', 'cancer genome', 'cancer type', 'clinical sequencing', 'cofactor', 'demethylation', 'embryonic stem cell', 'epigenetic therapy', 'epigenome', 'epigenome editing', 'epigenomics', 'experimental study', 'genome sequencing', 'genome wide methylation', 'genome-wide', 'histone modification', 'human disease', 'in silico', 'individualized medicine', 'long short term memory network', 'methylation pattern', 'methylome', 'mutant', 'nanopore', 'network architecture', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive tools', 'prognostic', 'prognostic assays', 'promoter', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'success', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'whole genome']",NLM,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,350896,0.10122686594160074
"Mathematical Models of Vulnerability and Cell-Type Specific Analysis of DNA Modifications in Aging Project Summary Understanding the biochemical processes underlying aging that give rise to age-related pathologies is the central concept of geroscience research. A focus in geroscience is to identify interventions that slow/prevent aging. These could both alter the trajectory of aging and have beneficial effects across a number of diseases, delaying onset or slowing progression. However, evaluating anti-aging interventions requires years-long studies in mammalian model organisms and is almost impossible in clinical trials that would require of multi-year studies to evaluate lifespan and healthspan extensions. The solution to this problem lies in developing endpoints that indicate biological age and the health-related changes that go with it with sufficient sensitivity. The recent development of epigenetic clocks, chronological age-predictive machine learning models that use DNA cytosine methylation data, are leading the field in age estimation accuracy and precision. The difference between a person’s chronological age and the estimated “methylation age” has been proposed as a measure of aging acceleration or deceleration – a ‘biological age’. Age acceleration predicted by methylation has shown robust correlations to all-cause mortality risk, but weak correlations in age-related diseases. Age-related biological outcomes such as cognitive decline have found little to no association with methylation age acceleration. Put simply, epigenetic clocks have been developed to predict chronological age but have so far demonstrated marginal utility to predict disease states. However, our preliminary results indicate that as many as 20% of genomic cytosines have age-related methylation changes which may be leveraged to understand biological aging and its outcomes simultaneously. Using the largest collection of methylation data with disease, age, tissue, and sex labels from our previous work in natural language processing, we will create the first model of epigenetic aging to identify “healthy” aging loci and disease-predictive loci. These loci will give us insight into the molecular pathways disturbed by age-related methylation changes, providing targets for therapeutic intervention and a predictor for patient disease risk. However, it is still unknown how epigenetic clocks ‘tick’, especially considering their performance across tissues. We will test how epigenetic changes with age are distributed throughout specific cell types in the central nervous system and cell types common across all tissues – such as vascular endothelium and immune cells. Using single-cell bisulfite sequencing and cell-type specific promoter-driven labelling, we can detect if the epigenetic clock changes are truly occurring in all cells or if they are restricted to some cell types common across tissues. This information is critical for predicting the downstream effects of changes identified by epigenetic clocks and interpreting the effects of ‘reversing’ epigenetic aging. These experiments will further our understanding of the role epigenetics play in the aging process and in neurological diseases of age such as Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s Disease. Project Narrative Epigenetic clocks, models of DNA methylation changes with age, have been shown as robust biomarkers for aging and all-cause mortality risk, but weakly predict disease risk and thus biological aging. This proposed research plan will generate a new epigenetic model by identifying loci predictive of both age and disease to create an Epigenetic Vulnerability Estimator (EVE), granting insights into disease-associated pathways affected by DNA methylation aging. We will also determine how epigenetic clocks ‘tick’ in the brain using cell-type specific single-cell bisulfite sequencing to understand what cellular populations are reflecting both age-related epigenetic dysregulation and potentially responding to anti-aging interventions.",Mathematical Models of Vulnerability and Cell-Type Specific Analysis of DNA Modifications in Aging,10067953,F31AG063493,"['Acceleration', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Age-associated memory impairment', 'Aging', 'Alleles', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Astrocytes', 'Biochemical Process', 'Biological', 'Biological Aging', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Brain', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Chronology', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collection', 'Computer software', 'Cre-LoxP', 'Cytosine', 'DNA', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA Modification Process', 'DNA analysis', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Deceleration', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Enhancers', 'Entropy', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Euchromatin', 'Genes', 'Genetic Models', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Geroscience', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Label', 'Link', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Metadata', 'Methylation', 'Microglia', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neuraxis', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurons', 'Nuclear', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Phagocytes', 'Play', 'Population', 'Process', 'Research', 'Research Training', 'Ribosomes', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Site', 'Source', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Ticks', 'Tissues', 'Vascular Endothelial Cell', 'Vascular Endothelium', 'Work', 'age effect', 'age related', 'aging brain', 'animal data', 'anti aging', 'base', 'bisulfite sequencing', 'cell type', 'disorder risk', 'experimental study', 'healthspan', 'healthy aging', 'insight', 'laboratory experiment', 'mathematical model', 'mortality risk', 'nerve stem cell', 'nervous system disorder', 'normal aging', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'promoter', 'sex', 'single cell sequencing', 'targeted treatment', 'therapy development']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF OKLAHOMA HLTH SCIENCES CTR,F31,2020,34001,0.050439646481289284
"Quantitative Modeling of Transcription Factor-DNA Binding Title: Quantitative Modeling of Transcription Factor–DNA Binding PI: Rohs, Remo PROJECT SUMMARY Genes are regulated through transcription factor (TF) binding to specific DNA target sites in the genome. These target sites are recognized through several layers of specificity determinants. The most extensively studied layer of binding specificity are hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic contacts between protein amino acids and functional groups of the base pairs mainly in the major groove. Base readout recognizes nucleotide sequence within a short core-binding site of only a few base pairs. However, these distinct sequence combinations in a TF binding motif occur many times in the genome and only a very small fraction of putative binding sites are functional. It is still unknown how a TF locates and identifies its in vivo binding sites in the plethora of possible genomic target sites. Recognition of three-dimensional DNA structure is an additional layer that refines base readout. While the latter is restricted to direct contacts with the core motif, shape readout is a mechanism through which flanking regions of the core motif or spacer regions between half-sites of dimeric TFs contribute to binding specificity. Other layers of in vivo TF binding determinants are chromatin structure, DNA accessibility, histone modifications, DNA methylation, cofactors and cooperative binding, and cell type. Given this multi-layer nature of TF recognition, we will develop quantitative models to predict TF binding with high accuracy. More important, however, is that our models will reveal recognition mechanisms in the absence of experiment-based structural information. We will build models where each distinct layer of TF binding specificity determinants is added to a base-line model combining DNA sequence and shape. Since it is expected that the importance of each of these TF binding specificity determinants will vary dramatically across protein families, we will use feature selection to identify relative contributions of each feature group as a function of TF or TF family. We will also develop a deep learning framework where individual feature modules can be added or removed from the input layer of convolutional neural networks. This approach will leverage the advantages of deep learning while circumventing the “black box” nature of standard deep learning methods. We will also generate experimental data for specific TFs using the SELEX-seq technology. This approach is currently able to probe the effect of cofactors, cooperative binding, and protein mutations on the binding specificity of a TF. We will add nucleosomes to the SELEX-seq binding assay and, thereby, probe chromatin effects on TF binding using an in vitro experiment in the absence of other cellular contributions. This project will result in a better mechanistic understanding of TF-DNA binding and reveal the impact of various specificity determinants across multiple scales. The new insights will describe different combinations of readout mechanisms on a protein-family specific basis. Our new methods will yield progress in biomedical innovation that is based on transcription and gene regulation. The generated knowledge will better integrate genomics and biophysics, and the project will contribute to the training and mentoring of a new generation of scientists. Title: Quantitative Modeling of Transcription Factor–DNA Binding PI: Rohs, Remo PROJECT NARRATIVE Gene regulatory mechanisms require the binding of transcription factors to highly selective target sites in the genome. By itself, the DNA sequence of the core motif is often insufficient to explain transcription factor binding to a very small fraction of the many more available putative sites. The development of new computational methods in combination with generation of experimental binding data will reveal the protein- family specific use of readout modes at atomic, molecular, and cellular scales.",Quantitative Modeling of Transcription Factor-DNA Binding,9975181,R35GM130376,"['3-Dimensional', 'Amino Acids', 'Base Pairing', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological Assay', 'Biophysics', 'Chromatin', 'Chromatin Structure', 'Computing Methodologies', 'DNA', 'DNA Binding', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA Sequence', 'DNA Structure', 'Data', 'Development', 'Epitopes', 'Family', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Hydrogen Bonding', 'Hydrophobicity', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Major Groove', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mutation', 'Nature', 'Nucleosomes', 'Protein Family', 'Proteins', 'Regulator Genes', 'Scientist', 'Shapes', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'base', 'cell type', 'cofactor', 'convolutional neural network', 'deep learning', 'dimer', 'experimental study', 'feature selection', 'functional group', 'histone modification', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'transcription factor']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,R35,2020,523665,0.05660934501747875
"Visualization, modeling and validation of chromatin interaction data The three dimensional (3D) organization of mammalian genomes is tightly linked to gene regulation, as it can reveal the physical interactions between distal regulatory elements and their target genes. Several recent high- throughput technologies based on Chromatin Conformation Capture (3C) have emerged (such as 4C, 5C, Hi-C and ChIA-PET) and given us an unprecedented opportunity to study the higher-order genome organization. Among them, Hi-C technology is of particular interest due to its unbiased genome-wide coverage that can measure chromatin interaction intensities between any two given genomic loci. However, Hi-C data analysis and interpretation are still in the early stages. One of the main challenges is how to efficiently visualize chromatin interaction data, so that the scientific community to visualize and use it for their own research. In addition, due to the complex experimental procedure and high sequencing cost, Hi-C has only been performed in a limited number of cell/tissue types. Finally, the underlying mechanism of chromatin interactions remains largely unclear. Therefore, the PI will propose the following aims: Aim 1. Build an interactive and customizable 3D genome browser. We will build an interactive and customizable 3D browser, which allows users to navigate Hi-C data and other high-throughput chromatin organization data, including ChIA-PET and Capture Hi-C. We have built a prototype of the 3D genome browser (www.3dgenome.org). Our browser will allow users to conveniently browse chromatin interaction data with other data types (such as ChIP-Seq and RNA-Seq) from the genomic region in the same window simultaneously. Our system will also empower the users to create their own session and query their own Hi-C and other epigenomic data. Aim 2. Impute chromatin interaction using other genomic/epigenomic information. We will predict Hi-C interaction frequencies using other available genomic and epigenomic data in the same cell type, such as ChIP-Seq data for histone modifications and transcription factors. We will build our prediction model and then systematically impute Hi-C interaction matrices for all 127 cell types whose epigenomes are available thanks to recent effort by the ENCODE and Roadmap Epigenome projects. Aim 3. Perform validation experiments for computational method in aim 1 and 2. We will perform 20 3C experiments in hESC and GM cell lines, coupled with genome engineering by CRISPR/Cas9, to evaluate Hi-C prediction method in aim 2. The three dimensional (3D) organization of mammalian genomes is tightly linked to gene regulation, as it can reveal the physical interactions between distal regulatory elements and their target genes. Although several recent high-throughput technologies including Hi-C have emerged and given us an unprecedented opportunity to study 3D chromatin interaction in high resolution, its analysis and interpretation are still in the early stages. Here we propose to develop a suite of statistical modeling and computational methods to model and validate chromatin interaction using other genomic/epigenomics data, and build an interactive and customizable 3D genome browser.","Visualization, modeling and validation of chromatin interaction data",9840492,R01HG009906,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'Cell Line', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'ChIP-seq', 'Chromatin', 'Chromatin Interaction Analysis by Paired-End Tag Sequencing', 'Chromatin Remodeling Factor', 'Chromosome Territory', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Country', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Distal', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Frequencies', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genome engineering', 'Genomic Segment', 'Genomics', 'Intuition', 'Knock-out', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Procedures', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Tissues', 'Validation', 'Visit', 'Visualization', 'base', 'cell type', 'chromosome conformation capture', 'convolutional neural network', 'cost', 'epigenome', 'epigenomics', 'experimental study', 'genome annotation', 'genome browser', 'genome-wide', 'genomic locus', 'high throughput technology', 'histone modification', 'human embryonic stem cell', 'interest', 'mammalian genome', 'performance tests', 'predictive modeling', 'prototype', 'random forest', 'repository', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'web site']",NHGRI,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R01,2020,395000,0.048790236961841045
"Computational modeling of spatial genome organization and gene regulation PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The three-dimensional (3D) organization of the genome plays an essential role in genome stability, gene regulation, and many diseases, including cancer. The recent development of high-throughput chromatin conformation capture (Hi-C) and its variants provide an unprecedented opportunity to investigate higher-order chromatin organization. Despite the rapidly accumulating resources for investigating 3D genome organization, our understanding of the regulatory mechanisms and functions of the genome organization remain largely incomplete. Hi-C analyses and 3D genome research are still in their early stage and face several challenges. First, high-resolution chromatin contact maps require extremely deep sequencing and hence have been achieved only for a few cell lines. Second, it is computationally challenging to complement 3D genome structure with one-dimensional (1D) genomic and epigenomic features. Third, recent studies have just begun to infer associations between chromatin interactions and genetic variants and to identify potential target genes of those variants at the genome-wide scale. Given these challenges and my unique multi-disciplinary training, my long-term research goal is to develop innovative computational and statistical methods to uncover the interplay between 3D genome structure and function. Speciﬁcally, in the next ﬁve years, I will i) develop computational approaches to enhance the resolution of existing Hi-C data and investigate ﬁne-scale 3D genome architecture as well as its spatiotemporal dynamics and ii) build scalable and interpretable machine learning models that leverage 1D epigenomic data to predict cell type-speciﬁc 3D chromatin interactions and gene expression and elucidate the function of 3D genome organization in gene regulation and human diseases. The completion of the proposed work will deepen our knowledge of 3D genome architecture as well as its functions in gene regulation and disease. PROJECT NARRATIVE The overarching mission of my research is to understand the interplay between genome architecture and gene regulation. Recent development of high-throughput chromatin conformation capture techniques has allowed us to look beyond the nucleotide sequence of DNA and investigate the principles of higher-order chromatin organization.

"Mechanisms of Transcriptional Control Revealed by Nascent Transcript Sequencing Large consortium efforts have collected hundreds of genome-wide datasets that have delineated myriad regulatory regions, transcription factor binding sites and large numbers of coding and non-coding transcripts. Even with this massive amount of data, it remains a significant challenge to determine how the mapped elements function together in regulatory networks. This is due in large part to our inability to accurately and quantitatively detect all forms of nascent transcription, the instantaneous output of transcriptional regulation. Moreover, our understanding of global gene regulation is restricted by a lack of computational tools that seamlessly integrate genome-wide datasets. The overall goal of this proposal is to maximize the impact of nascent transcriptome studies and enable facile integration with other functional genomic data. My group developed native elongating transcript sequencing (NET-seq), that enables the strand-specific nucleotide-resolution mapping of RNA polymerase density, highlighting all transcriptional activity regardless of transcript half-lives and revealing precise positions of Pol II pausing where regulatory control is applied. Here, we will develop a new version of NET-seq – NET-seq 2.0 – that enables the routine, scalable and flexible application to diverse human cell types (or any eukaryotic system). Moreover, we will increase the potential of NET-seq analysis by developing two innovative bioinformatics strategies to seamlessly integrate NET-seq data with other genome-wide datasets that will have applications beyond NET-seq studies. To demonstrate the broad utility of our integrated approach, we will study regulatory networks and cell differentiation for which instantaneous nascent transcriptional analysis will be highly impactful. In Aim 1, our goal is to make NET-seq easier, cheaper, and more flexible. Our improvements will reduce background and increase usable reads, dramatically reduce cell input requirements (100-1000-fold), enable dense, region-specific RNA transcription analyses, and enable quantitative comparisons between samples and conditions. In Aim 2, we will determine transcription kinetics through integrating NET-seq with metabolic RNA labeling (TT-seq) data which report local synthesis rates. This integrative approach yields a rich transcriptional phenotype that we will use to develop gene regulatory network models. In Aim 3, we will create new computational algorithms that circumvent the need to determine each molecular event separately, and instead infer the status of unmapped events using information-rich datasets, such as NET-seq. We will use integrative deep neural networks (`deep-learning') that use available genome-wide datasets to predict unavailable datasets from data already on hand. We will apply this approach to study erythropoiesis using a well- defined primary human hematopoietic differentiation system by a time series NET-seq and DNase-seq analysis. These data will inform deep neural network models to predict ChIP-seq data for myriad transcription factors and chromatin marks to investigate key regulatory events without additional expense. The proposed research is relevant to public health, because discovery of regulatory mechanisms in transcription at high resolution is ultimately expected to significantly impact our understanding of most human disease. As such, the proposed research is relevant to the part of the NIH's mission that seeks to develop fundamental knowledge to inform our diagnosis and treatment of human disease.",Mechanisms of Transcriptional Control Revealed by Nascent Transcript Sequencing,9932470,R01HG007173,"['Binding Sites', 'Bioinformatics', 'Cell Differentiation process', 'Cells', 'ChIP-seq', 'Chromatin', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Computational algorithm', 'Consumption', 'DNA-Directed RNA Polymerase', 'DNase I hypersensitive sites sequencing', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Elements', 'Embryonic Development', 'Enhancers', 'Erythropoiesis', 'Eukaryotic Cell', 'Event', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Human', 'Investigation', 'KDM1A gene', 'Kinetics', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Messenger RNA', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Molecular', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'Nucleotides', 'Output', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Polymerase', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'RNA', 'RNA Polymerase II', 'RNA purification', 'Regulator Genes', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Ribonucleases', 'Ribosomal RNA', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Series', 'Small Nuclear RNA', 'Small Nucleolar RNA', 'Speed', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Transcript', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Untranslated RNA', 'cell type', 'computerized tools', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'density', 'flexibility', 'functional genomics', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'hematopoietic differentiation', 'human disease', 'improved', 'innovation', 'network models', 'novel', 'promoter', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome', 'virtual']",NHGRI,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,R01,2020,517318,0.03244194509262382
"Modeling stress-induced, de novo epiallele architecture in the model Arabidopsis as a tractable entrypoint PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Epigenetic memory is a phenomenon of trans-generational, altered trait inheritance without changes to DNA sequence. Our present ability to predict or direct epigenomic behavior is extremely limited, even though epigenetic factors participate in nearly all aspects of multicellular development, environmental stress response, and disease development. There are critical gaps in our current knowledge of DNA methylation patterning, stable epiallele formation, and the relationship of genome-wide epigenomic behavior to gene expression and phenotype in both plant and animal systems. We have developed a system that will directly address these questions. Our long-term goals are to decode the heritable epigenome, and its relationship to organismal phenotype, particularly in response to stress. What distinguishes our proposed research is the availability of robust biologicals in the model plant Arabidopsis to impose artificial stress, recurrent heritable epigenetic memory, and methylome repatterning. These resources emanate from discovery of the MSH1 gene, disruption of which leads to epigenomic reprogramming. Recent data from this system lead to the overarching hypothesis that stress-induced gene expression recruits methylation machinery to gene networks in a non-stochastic manner. To address this hypothesis, we have developed novel genome-wide methylome analysis procedures for high-resolution identification of gene-associated methylation repatterning. These analyses reveal gene networks that are strikingly consistent with phenotype changes, and display repatterning that is intragenic and often subtle, yet reproducible. We have also identified epigenetic components of the DNA methylation and RdDM pathways that are essential to reprogramming based on msh1 double mutant analysis. Building upon strong preliminary data, we propose to pursue three specific aims to characterize trans-generational epigenomic behavior: (1) To delineate stable, de novo epialleles in the Arabidopsis msh1 model system, exploiting a five-generation memory lineage, (2) to develop a mechanistic understanding of stable epiallele formation in response to stress, implementing machine learning and mutant screening, and (3) to test locus-specific mechanics of epiallele establishment, capitalizing on gene relocation to delimit germane local chromatin features. The proposed research will broadly impact the field by providing the first example of inducible epigenomic reprogramming in a non-stochastic pattern that permits machine learning-based predictive modeling and identification of cis-acting sequence features. The results will be pertinent to mammalian systems and, possibly, to diagnostic strategies for diseases with a strong GxE component. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research has relevance to public health priorities as we see life style diseases, stress and environmental impacts on health, in utero and throughout development, pose greater challenges to conventional medicine. Environmental stress is a multifaceted influence on health, and epigenomic response is an important, under-investigated factor in cancer, neurodevelopmental, metabolic and toxin-related disorders with high GxE effects. Upon conclusion of the study, we will have defined the architectural features of stable, de novo epiallelic variation, assessed its influence on heritable phenotype, and refined a methodology for high resolution analysis of epigenomic data that is necessary to inform the development of early diagnostics and countermeasures.","Modeling stress-induced, de novo epiallele architecture in the model Arabidopsis as a tractable entrypoint",9983094,R01GM134056,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Animals', 'Arabidopsis', 'Architecture', 'Behavior', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Models', 'Chromatin', 'Chromatin Modeling', 'Cis-Acting Sequence', 'Complement', 'Cytosine', 'DNA', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Environmental Impact', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Targeting', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heritability', 'Homeostasis', 'Information Systems', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Life Style', 'Link', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mechanics', 'Medicine', 'Memory', 'Metabolic', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'Modeling', 'Nucleosomes', 'Organism', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Phenotype', 'Plant Model', 'Plants', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'RNA Splicing', 'Recurrence', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Reproduction', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Small RNA', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Stress', 'System', 'Testing', 'Thermodynamics', 'Tissue-Specific Gene Expression', 'Toxin', 'Transgenes', 'Variant', 'base', 'behavior influence', 'biological adaptation to stress', 'biophysical properties', 'bisulfite', 'density', 'epigenetic memory', 'epigenome', 'epigenomics', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'genome-wide', 'histone modification', 'in utero', 'innovation', 'insight', 'methylation pattern', 'methylome', 'mutant', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'public health priorities', 'recruit', 'response', 'screening', 'trait', 'transgenerational epigenetic inheritance']",NIGMS,PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIVERSITY-UNIV PARK,R01,2020,319720,0.037794481840887455
"Peripheral blood mononuclear cell epigenetic associations in and biomarkers for knee osteoarthritis development and progression. Project Summary / Abstract The objective of the proposed research is to better understand how peripheral blood epigenetic patterns are associated with knee osteoarthritis (OA). A great deal of work has already been demonstrated widespread epigenetic changes within articular tissues in both knee and hip OA. Others have described serum and urine protein biomarkers as predictors of future knee OA progression. Our first Aim is to evaluate peripheral blood cell DNA epigenetic patterns in baseline blood samples from patients who will go on to have rapid radiographc and/or pain progression in the subsequent 24 months. We will then use these data to develop develop and evaluate the performance of epigenetic algorithmic models to discriminate these groups. Patient samples will parallel the National Institutes of Health OA Biomarkers Consortium (OABC-FNIH) study. DNA methylation will be evaluated using a next-generation bisulfite sequencing approach (methylSeq), and algorithms developed using cutting-edge machine learning techniques. We will then translate our findings into a more high- throughput, inexpensive, and clinically relevant form by developing and validating a targeted capture sequencing system to interrogate these specific epigenetic locations. Our second Aim is to evaluate the peripheral blood DNA methylation patterns that precede the development of OA, using samples from 48-, 24-, 12-, and 0-months before incident OA. We will again develop algorithms to predict future OA development using similar techniques as Aim 1 and translate this to a targeted capture sequencing system. This unique longitudinal approach which will allow us not only to determine whether and when epigenetic patterns develop preceding OA development, but also track longitudinal epigenetic changes as OA develops. The proposed work is important, as there are no FDA approved biomarkers for OA diagnosis or prognosis. Our work is quite innovative both in its combination of ""big data"" epigenetic analysis and cutting-edge machine learning techniques applied to a specific clinical problem, as well as in its examination of PBMC epigenetics in OA, which has not yet been described. Moreover, we tackle the problem of translation of big-data research by aiming specifically to develop high-throughput methods to translate our findings into a clinically-relevant and accessible form. Success in our proposal will produce both algorithmic models with direct clinical impact to predict future OA development and progression, as well as broaden our understanding of epigenetic changes in peripheral blood cells from OA patients. Project Narrative The proposed research is relevant to public health because a better understanding of blood epigenetic patterns in osteoarthritis (OA) is likely not only to give insights into the causes of OA, but also to give rise to new biomarkers to assist physicians and researchers diagnose OA patients and predict how rapidly they will worsen over time. Thus, this proposal is relevant to the part of the NIH's mission that pertains to fostering fundamental creative discoveries, innovative research strategies, and their applications as a basis for ultimately improving health.",Peripheral blood mononuclear cell epigenetic associations in and biomarkers for knee osteoarthritis development and progression.,9861881,R01AR076440,"['Affect', 'Age-Years', 'Algorithms', 'Big Data', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood Cells', 'Blood specimen', 'Cartilage', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'DNA', 'DNA Methylation', 'Data', 'Degenerative polyarthritis', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Epigenetic Process', 'FDA approved', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genomic Segment', 'Genomics', 'Health', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Hip Osteoarthritis', 'Immunologics', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammation Mediators', 'Inflammatory', 'Joints', 'Knee Osteoarthritis', 'Libraries', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Musculoskeletal Diseases', 'Pain', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Pilot Projects', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Sampling', 'Serum', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'TimeLine', 'Tissues', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Urine', 'Validation', 'Work', 'algorithm development', 'base', 'biobank', 'biomarker development', 'bisulfite', 'bisulfite sequencing', 'clinical application', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'deep sequencing', 'disability', 'economic impact', 'epigenetic marker', 'epigenome', 'genome-wide analysis', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'joint function', 'methylation pattern', 'model development', 'mortality', 'next generation', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'peripheral blood', 'protein biomarkers', 'sodium bisulfite', 'subchondral bone', 'success', 'targeted sequencing']",NIAMS,UNIVERSITY OF OKLAHOMA HLTH SCIENCES CTR,R01,2020,21455,0.041548576602472055
"Joint analysis of 3D chromatin organization and 1D epigenome Abstract After the completion of the Human Genome Project, thousands of experiments from ENCODE and Roadmap Epigenomics projects have successfully proﬁled regulatory elements and epigenetic landscape along the genome. More recently, over 2,000 chromatin organization datasets have been generated from 4D Nucleome (4DN) Project, and they provide complementary information about how these genomic and epigenomic elements are spatially organized in a nucleus. Joint analysis of 3D chromatin organization with previously proﬁled 1D epigenome in different cell types will be a key step to understand the mechanisms underlying transcriptional regulation over long genomic distances. However, there are two challenges. First, there is a resolution mismatch between chromatin organization data (e.g. Hi-C contacts) which are usually measured at 10k base pair resolution, and epigenome-based chromatin state features (e.g. ChIP-seq peaks) whose signals are usually at tens to hundreds of base pairs. Second, existing computational approaches for analyzing epigenome, such as annotating genome and understanding regulatory elements, all treat the DNA sequence as one-dimensional data, leaving the important 3D structural information unutilized. We aim to develop the most cutting-edge deep learning approaches for understanding the relationship between chromatin state features and chromatin organization, performing 3D and 4D genome annotation, and identifying spatially collaborative transcription factors, respectively. After the completion of the proposed work, we expect to have: (1) an accurate and interpretable computational model to predict chromatin contact maps at nucleosome resolution for a wide range of cell lines, (2) 3D and 4D genome annotations over dynamic chromatin organization, regulatory elements and epigenomic features, and (3) a computational method for identifying spatially collaborative transcription factors which can help us understand the orchestration of noncoding genetic variants. These results will provide fundamental understanding of disease-relevant genetic variation in the light of the spatial organization of these genomic and epigenomic elements and their functional implications. Project Narrative The goal of this project is to develop novel computational methods to jointly analyze 3D chromatin organization data and 1D epigenomic features, and reveal the interplay among regulatory elements, epigenomic features, and dynamic chromatin organization. These new methods will help us understand the mechanisms of the genetic variants identiﬁed in genome-wide association studies, and understand the genetic basis of many human diseases.",Joint analysis of 3D chromatin organization and 1D epigenome,10046394,R35HG011279,"['3-Dimensional', 'Base Pairing', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Nucleus', 'ChIP-seq', 'Chromatin', 'Computer Models', 'Computing Methodologies', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Human Genome Project', 'Joints', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Nucleosomes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Resolution', 'Signal Transduction', 'Three-dimensional analysis', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Work', 'base', 'cell type', 'deep learning', 'epigenome', 'epigenomics', 'experimental study', 'genetic variant', 'genome annotation', 'genome wide association study', 'human disease', 'novel', 'three dimensional structure', 'transcription factor']",NHGRI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R35,2020,432839,0.026266560956330134
"From epigenome to genome and back: disentangling the relationship between epigenetic modifications and chromatin organization PROJECT SUMMARY Understanding how the genome functions is one of the greatest challenges of the 21st century. Encoded within its DNA sequences are the blueprints for several cell types. Nevertheless, it remains a mystery how the full variety of phenotypes arise, and how they are maintained. It is becoming increasingly clear that the epigenome— covalent modifications to the DNA and histone proteins—plays a crucial role. Genome-wide profiling of epigenetic modifications has clarified cell type specificity and the presence of a diverse set of combinatorial patterns that are strongly correlated with gene expression levels. Inferring causal relationships from these data has proved challenging, however. A working knowledge of the mechanisms that inform the establishment and regulation of the epigenome, and its impact on gene expression and cellular phenotype, therefore, remain elusive. In this project, we propose several novel modeling approaches which will address the key gaps in our understanding of the interrelationship between the epigenome and genome. First, we will parameterize a coarse- grained chromatin model from the bottom-up using a novel deep learning algorithm to generate an accurate and comprehensive characterization of chromatin secondary structure, and its sensitivity to DNA sequence, nucleosome repeat length, ionic concentrations, post-translational modifications, and phase-separated liquid- droplets formed by intrinsically disordered proteins. High resolution chromatin structures from this effort will elucidate how different epigenetic modifications impact gene expression by regulating nucleosome packaging and DNA accessibility. Second, we will investigate the role of epigenetic modifications in mediating long-range interactions between regulatory elements by developing a predictive model which will enable de novo reconstruction of three-dimensional genome organization. This project will result in a global view of the role of the epigenome in cell differentiation and cell fate determination. An improved understanding of the interrelationship between the epigenome and the genome from this research program can guide the development of engineering approaches to modify the epigenome for both long lasting and reversible changes as a novel strategy for combating diseases such as cancer. PROJECT NARRATIVE The epigenome works hand-in-hand with the genome to encode cell phenotypic diversity for multicellular organisms. We will apply interdisciplinary approaches to disentangle the interrelationship between the two, thus elucidating the role of the genome in establishing and maintaining a robust epigenome, and providing mechanistic insight into epigenetic regulations of the genome’s function. Insights from our study will pave the way for rational epigenome engineering which holds great potential for transforming medicine and biotechnology.",From epigenome to genome and back: disentangling the relationship between epigenetic modifications and chromatin organization,9986842,R35GM133580,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Back', 'Biotechnology', 'Cell Differentiation process', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'Chromatin Modeling', 'Chromatin Structure', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Engineering', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Gene Expression', 'Genome', 'Grain', 'Histones', 'Knowledge', 'Length', 'Liquid substance', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mediating', 'Medicine', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Nucleosomes', 'Organism', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Post-Translational Protein Processing', 'Proteins', 'Regulation', 'Regulatory Element', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Work', 'cell type', 'combat', 'combinatorial', 'deep learning algorithm', 'epigenetic profiling', 'epigenetic regulation', 'epigenome', 'genome-wide', 'improved', 'insight', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'reconstruction']",NIGMS,MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R35,2020,377555,0.05281583828249805
"Direct Determination of Multiple Specific Forms of DNA Chemical Modifications in Human Genome PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The information content of DNA is not limited to the primary sequence (A, C, G, T), but is also conveyed by chemical modifications of individual bases. For example, DNA methylation, specifically 5-methylcytosine (5mC), has been widely studied for its important regulatory roles in human development and diseases. In addition, the discovery of active demethylation of 5mC, mediated by TET enzymes, into 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC), 5-formylcytosine (5fC) and 5-carboxylcytosine (5caC) revealed great insights into the dynamic nature of the human methylome and its close relevance to multiple human diseases. Beyond these chemical modifications to cytosine, recent studies by us and others discovered that N6-methyladenine (6mA), another form of methylation previously thought exclusively existing in bacteria and protozoa, also exists in eukaryotic genomes including the human genome. In addition to these epigenetic marks, different forms of DNA damages represent another category of DNA chemical modifications that are of important biological relevance. Although a few methods for mapping individual chemical modifications have been developed and some are widely used, it is usually hard for broad researchers to master every protocol to map each form of modification. While third- generation sequencing technologies support the direct detection of DNA modifications, they face fundamental challenges distinguishing among different forms of modifications. The objective of this project is to develop a novel technology for the direct mapping of multiple forms of DNA methylation and DNA damage events simultaneously. The core idea is that each form of nucleic acid modification has a unique signature in terms of their physical interaction with DNA polymerase, or nanopores in third-generation sequencing; and these signatures can be modeled by deep learning methods. We will develop this technology using multiple innovative strategies to address a few fundamental challenges, and then comprehensively evaluate the technology to facilitate broad applications. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Chemical DNA modifications are crucial components of human genome that controls many important biological processes in human development and human diseases. In this project, we will develop a novel technology for direct mapping of multiple and specific forms of DNA modifications, which will enable us and a large number of researchers to more effectively study the functions of DNA modifications in human genome. !",Direct Determination of Multiple Specific Forms of DNA Chemical Modifications in Human Genome,10267380,R56HG011095,"['Address', 'Antibodies', 'Bacteria', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Categories', 'Characteristics', 'Chemicals', 'Chemistry', 'Classification', 'Complex', 'Cytosine', 'DNA', 'DNA Damage', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA Modification Process', 'DNA-Directed DNA Polymerase', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Ensure', 'Enzymes', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Event', 'Face', 'Future', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Human Characteristics', 'Human Development', 'Human Genome', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'Individual', 'Maps', 'Mediating', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Neurons', 'Nucleic Acids', 'Oligonucleotides', 'Ploidies', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Protocols documentation', 'Protozoa', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Technology', 'Third Generation Sequencing', 'Thymine', 'Time', 'Training', 'Variant', 'base', 'bisulfite sequencing', 'cancer risk', 'cell type', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'demethylation', 'human disease', 'innovation', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'methylome', 'nanopore', 'network models', 'new technology', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'public health relevance', 'sequencing platform', 'single molecule real time sequencing']",NHGRI,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R56,2020,233456,0.020438127070022093
"Statistical modeling of long-range chromatin interactions on gene regulation and underlying molecular Disease-associated genetic variants have been found to be enriched in regulatory genomic regions of gene expression. In order to gain detailed understanding of disease mechanisms, one central question is to systematically delineate how tissue-specific gene expression programs are regulated. Enhancers are a major family of regulatory elements with complex signatures and they are abundant in the human genome. Enhancer regulation of gene expression is highly tissue-specific, associated with combinatorial transcription factor binding, and involved with long-range three-dimensional chromatin interactions. It is therefore challenging to characterize the large-scale enhancer regulatory networks. The primary goal of this project is to develop a suite of probabilistic models and efficient machine learning algorithms to predict genome-wide enhancer regulatory networks in diverse panels of cellular contexts and the associated molecular mechanisms to establish long-range interactions, which will be leveraged to interpret disease-associated genetic variants. In Aim 1, novel integrative graphical models will be developed to predict long-range chromatin interactions linking tissue-specific enhancers to their distal target genes, along with combinatorial transcription factor binding patterns. In Aim 2, computational algorithms will be designed to interrogate how specific chromatin interactions are established, leading to mechanistic insights on chromatin formation. In Aim 3, statistical models will be developed to integrate enhancer-gene regulatory networks with genetics data to predict which non-coding variants may disrupt regulatory links and cause diseases, with improved statistical power and accuracy. This modeling framework will substantially expand the analytical ability on non-coding variants and human disease mechanisms. Computational predictions from the three aims will be experimentally tested in mouse models of breast cancer development. This project will lead to both innovative computational tools and systematic biological insights on long-range enhancer regulation and their functional roles in human diseases. The advanced statistical models and machine learning algorithms will provide efficient big-data integration tools for epigenetics, gene regulation and human genetics. Comprehensive predictions from this project represent valuable platforms to delineate genetic variants and disease mechanisms. Novel mechanistic insights of diseases at the regulatory and molecular level will facilitate improved diagnostic and therapeutic approaches for human diseases.",Statistical modeling of long-range chromatin interactions on gene regulation and underlying molecular,9932407,R01GM131398,"['3-Dimensional', 'Affect', 'Big Data', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Breast Cancer Model', 'Chromatin', 'Chromatin Structure', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Distal', 'Drug Targeting', 'Elements', 'Enhancers', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Family', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomic Segment', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Human Genetics', 'Human Genome', 'Joints', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Mediating', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Network-based', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Regulation', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissue-Specific Gene Expression', 'Tissues', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'base', 'cell type', 'combinatorial', 'computerized tools', 'data integration', 'design', 'experimental study', 'functional genomics', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic information', 'genetic variant', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'human disease', 'human tissue', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mouse model', 'novel', 'programs', 'protein protein interaction', 'tissue resource', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'transcription factor USF']",NIGMS,MICHIGAN STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,325001,0.038676218250379917
"Quantitative regulatory genomics: networks, cis-regulatory codes, and phenotypic variation How do changes in DNA sequence impact organismal properties? This is a central question of modern  biology, and insights into it can help us understand, among other things, why patients respond  differently to the same treatment, or why some species exhibit behavioral properties not seen in  other species. A major hurdle in solving this ‘genotype-to-phenotype’ problem is our poor knowledge  of gene regulatory mechanisms underlying phenotypes and cellular processes, and how those  mechanisms are encoded in DNA. It also leads to severe difficulties in prioritizing  phenotype-linked non-coding variants (polymorphisms) for further investigation. Driven by these  challenges, my lab seeks to develop quantitative frameworks for describing and  discovering transcriptional regulatory mechanisms. We have made significant progress towards this  goal in two main directions: (1) We have developed detailed biophysical models of the  cis-regulatory encoding of gene expression. Using these models we have shown how the regulatory  function of transcription factor (TF) binding sites depends on their sequence and DNA shape, as  well as their ‘trans-context’, e.g., cellular concentrations of regulators, and  ‘cis-context’, e.g., proximity to other TF binding sites and chromatin states. (2) We have  devised statistical models to discover TF-gene interactions from transcriptomic data, as well as  other types of ‘omics’ data if available. Working closely with biologists, we have applied these  models to understand phenotypes such as cytotoxic drug response in cell lines, behavioral response  to social encounters, and embryonic development. Building on the strong foundations of our  past work, I propose to establish a research program that studies transcriptional regulation  holistically at the cis- and trans- levels. Our new pursuits will include: (1) use of our  computational, sequence-level models to describe two data-rich mammalian regulatory programs, an  experimental collaboration to dissect the cis-regulatory logic of a key inflammation gene using  massively parallel reporter assays, and major advances in our modeling techniques; (2) new  machine learning methods for reconstructing networks of TF-gene interactions that explain  phenotypic differences, integration of cis- and trans-regulatory evidence from multi-omics  data, and collaborations to apply these methods in cancer pharmacogenomics and behavioral  neurogenomics; (3) a new probabilistic framework to combine traditional statistical scores of a  non-coding variant with quantitative predictions of its regulatory impact based on the  above-mentioned techniques. Explorations of new forms of synergy among these related goals of  network reconstruction, cis-regulatory sequence modeling and variant interpretation will be woven  throughout our research program. The proposed work will answer fundamental questions about molecular mechanisms underlying  phenotypic differences between individuals, such as why different patients respond differently to  the same drug. We will develop new computational methods for discovery of such mechanisms from a  variety of genomics data sets. We will work closely with experimental biologists and use our tools  to study important biological topics including cancer drug response, inflammation, and effect of  estrogen on breast cancer.","Quantitative regulatory genomics: networks, cis-regulatory codes, and phenotypic variation",10021007,R35GM131819,"['Antineoplastic Agents', 'Behavioral', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Cell Line', 'Cell physiology', 'Chromatin', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Cytotoxic agent', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Embryonic Development', 'Estrogens', 'Exhibits', 'Foundations', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Logic', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Molecular', 'Multiomic Data', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacogenomics', 'Phenotype', 'Property', 'Regulator Genes', 'Reporter', 'Research', 'Shapes', 'Statistical Models', 'Techniques', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'behavioral response', 'biophysical model', 'gene interaction', 'genomic data', 'insight', 'machine learning method', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'neurogenomics', 'programs', 'reconstruction', 'response', 'social', 'synergism', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptomics']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT URBANA-CHAMPAIGN,R35,2020,356979,0.034800119821031796
"HIGH-THROUGHPUT FUNCTIONAL INTERROGATION OF MAMMALIAN ACTIVATION DOMAINS Project Summary Abstract Transcription factors (TFs) control gene expression by binding to DNA and either activating or repressing target gene expression. While our understanding of how TFs bind DNA has grown rapidly, our understanding of how TFs activate transcription once they are bound has not kept pace. As a result, when we identify a mutation in a patient in a TF, if this mutation is in the DNA binding domain, we can sometimes predict if it will disrupt function; if the mutation is in the activation domain, we have no ability to predict its effects. To address this gap, I propose to study the amino acid composition of acidic activation domains using high-throughput assays and modern computational analyses. I have recently developed a high-throughput assay for measuring thousands of designed activation domain mutants in yeast. Here, I propose to develop a similar method in mammalian cell culture. In Aim 1, I propose an in-depth study of a few activation domains as a model for how genetic variation impacts TF function. In Aim 2, I propose a broad survey of human transcription factors to search for new activation domains. In the independent phase of this grant (R00), I propose 2 more aims to investigate the mechanisms how TFs activate target genes. In Aim 3, I will functional classify different type of activation domains and search for common features of each time. In Aim 4, I will link activation domains to cofactors and look for the features that predict activation.] This proposal will create a new layer of annotation for the human genome: all regions that are sufficient to serve as activation domains, create a new genome-scale method and deliver computational models for predicting activation domains from amino acid sequence. This award will support training in mammalian experimental systems and advanced machine learning analysis. Together these aims will support the long term goal of reading the regulatory genome by predicting gene expression from DNA sequence. Project Narrative Transcription factors are proteins that bind DNA and turn target genes ON or OFF. When we sequence a genome, we can identify which proteins are likely to be transcription factors, however we cannot predict whether these candidates will turn their targets ON or OFF. I propose to develop a tool to find all the transcription factors in the human genome that can turn ON target genes.",HIGH-THROUGHPUT FUNCTIONAL INTERROGATION OF MAMMALIAN ACTIVATION DOMAINS,9856466,K99GM131022,"['Address', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Amino Acids', 'Award', 'Binding', 'Biological Assay', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer Models', 'DNA', 'DNA Binding', 'DNA Binding Domain', 'DNA Sequence', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Distal', 'Enhancers', 'Essential Amino Acids', 'Foundations', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic Models', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Glutamine', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Image', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Mammalian Cell', 'Measures', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Methods', 'Modernization', 'Molecular', 'Mutation', 'Nuclear', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Phase Transition', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Reading', 'Reporter', 'Reporter Genes', 'Research', 'Series', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Tail', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Support', 'Transcription Initiation Site', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Yeasts', 'activating transcription factor', 'cell type', 'cofactor', 'design', 'genome-wide', 'high throughput analysis', 'high throughput screening', 'imaging platform', 'in vivo', 'learning classifier', 'model building', 'mutant', 'mutation screening', 'particle', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'promoter', 'rapid technique', 'recruit', 'tool', 'transcription factor']",NIGMS,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,K99,2020,99998,0.02902772610608584
"Resolving single-cell brain regulatory elements with bulk data supervised models Gene regulation is an important determinant of the complex specialization of cells in the human brain, and nucleotide changes within regulatory elements contribute to risk for psychiatric disorders. We therefore hypothesize that these debilitating diseases are driven in part by genetic variants that alter gene expression and disturb the balance and function of cell types in brain tissue. Single-cell open chromatin assays are a promising approach to testing this hypothesis by mapping variants to regulatory elements specific to and shared across cell populations. There are two major barriers to this strategy, for which our project proposes modeling solutions. First, despite being the best assay currently, single-cell ATAC-sequencing (scATAC-seq) suffers from low resolution, meaning that an open chromatin region may be supported by zero or few reads in a given cell. This makes it hard to identify coherent cell populations. We propose a network model for semi-supervised clustering of cells in scATAC-seq that leverages information from higher-coverage bulk tissue experiments and single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq), if available. The expected outcomes from applying this model to compendia of brain data from public repositories and our collaborators are (i) identification of open chromatin regions that differentiate cell types and states, and (ii) discovery of resolved cell populations whose open chromatin is enriched for psychiatric disorder associated genetic variants. These results alone may not be enough to develop a mechanistic understanding of how variants impact brain function. To address this second challenge, we will implement a computationally efficient, machine-learning framework for predicting the specific regulatory functions of single-cell open chromatin regions from our network model and other approaches. Gene regulatory enhancers are particularly amenable to this approach, because high-throughput mouse transgenics and massively parallel reporter assays have generated enough validated enhancers for supervised learning. Our framework will be easy to apply to other regulatory functions, such as insulating boundaries in chromatin capture data. By developing a compressed, yet flexible, featurization of massive bulk and single-cell data compendia, we will enable rapid iteration with computationally intensive prediction algorithms to be applied to single-cell open chromatin regions. Our approach will also incorporate transfer learning from data-rich (e.g., postmortem or mouse brains) to data-poor settings (e.g., human late-gestation brains). We expect predicted regulatory elements to be more enriched for psychiatric disorder genetic risk, to provide mechanistic insight regarding how variants cause disease, and to be useful molecular tools. Together our two proposed computational approaches will leverage the complementary strengths of bulk and single-cell data to resolve regulatory elements that drive the exquisite diversity of cells in developing and adult brains towards mapping the non-coding contribution of psychiatric disease. The human brain is a complex tissue comprised of diverse cell types with distinct gene regulation and function, making it difficult to mechanistically link genetic mutations to differences in brain health. This project will develop a network model and machine-learning framework that leverage single-cell and bulk genomics data to identify genome sequences that control gene expression in specific cell populations and states. We hypothesize that these cell type resolved regulatory elements will shed light on how sequence variants outside protein-coding genes increase risk for psychiatric disorders.",Resolving single-cell brain regulatory elements with bulk data supervised models,10007660,R01MH123178,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Atlases', 'Autopsy', 'Base Pairing', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Process', 'Brain', 'Cell Differentiation process', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Cellular Assay', 'Censuses', 'Chickens', 'Chromatin', 'Code', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'DNA Binding', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Diffusion', 'Disease', 'Drops', 'Elements', 'Enhancers', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Evaluation', 'Functional disorder', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype-Tissue Expression Project', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Light', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Mutation', 'Neuraxis', 'Nucleotides', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Pregnancy', 'Proteins', 'Psychological Transfer', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Reporter', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Source Code', 'Specificity', 'Supervision', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Theoretical model', 'Time', 'Tissue Sample', 'Tissues', 'Transgenic Mice', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Weight', 'XCL1 gene', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'brain cell', 'brain health', 'brain tissue', 'cell type', 'cohort', 'differential expression', 'disorder risk', 'egg', 'epigenomics', 'equilibration disorder', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'functional genomics', 'gene function', 'genetic variant', 'genome sequencing', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'human data', 'improved', 'in vitro Assay', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'multiple data types', 'network models', 'open source', 'prediction algorithm', 'promoter', 'psychiatric genomics', 'public repository', 'single cell analysis', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'structured data', 'supervised learning', 'tool', 'web server', 'whole genome']",NIMH,J.

"Defining interaction quantitative trait loci (iQTLs) in the human genome Abstract My research aims to understand the role of three-dimensional (3D) chromatin structure in gene regulation. This involves studying associations among genotype, histone modifications, transcription factor binding, non-coding RNAs, chromatin interactions and gene expression. In order to transform this genome-wide information into new biological discoveries, my laboratory develops scalable and interpretable computational methods based on statistics, graph theory and machine learning. Our recent focus is to address an important gap in the current knowledge of the role of 3D chromatin structure in gene regulation. That is, we aim to define how genotypic variation affects 3D organization of gene promoters, and in turn, their expression. To achieve this at a genome- wide scale is an ambitious goal, because it requires having at a minimum, genotype, gene expression and chromatin interaction profiles in pure populations of specific cell types from a large number of donors. However, my laboratory is uniquely positioned to perform this research because: i) we are involved in a study at the La Jolla Institute (LJI-R24AI108564) that has already genotyped ~100 donors and expression-profiled more than 15 different pure populations of human immune cell types, and we have access to the same samples for chromatin interaction mapping, ii) in collaboration with other groups at LJI, we have already discovered a prototypical example of an interaction quantitative trait locus (iQTL) that alters and rewires interactions from the promoter of a specific gene that is associated with asthma susceptibility, iii) we have the necessary expertise and proven track record in experimental design and computational analyses of various chromatin conformation capture assays. Leveraging the resources available at LJI and our expertise in the field, we will build a unique research program around the novel concept of iQTLs. The emerging set of three main questions we propose to address within the next five years are: Q1) How do we define cell-type-specific iQTLs for common genetic variants? Q2) What is the extent of overlap between iQTLs and GWAS SNPs? Q3) Can we build predictive models for the cell-type specificity of chromatin interactions and iQTLs? Although we propose to define iQTLs only in two abundant, easily accessible, and highly disease-relevant immune cell types, the concept of iQTLs is equally important in other cell types implicated in diseases with a genetic component. Hence, the proof-of-concept developed by this work, without a doubt, will open up a new field in studying a previously uncharacterized role for disease-susceptibility variants, specifically non-coding SNPs, from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) in gene regulation. Narrative Recent discoveries that allow us to look beyond the one-dimensional sequence of DNA and understand the large-scale organization principals of its three-dimensional folding have been limited when it comes to characterizing the role of fine-scale genetic variations of the DNA code in controlling important cellular processes such as gene expression. This work will employ state-of-the-art molecular biology techniques and develop novel computational methods to define the role of such genetic variants in changing three-dimensional connections made by the promoters of genes in the human genome. This systematic and unbiased genome- wide study will have important implications in changing the way we study the disease relevance of genetic variation by revealing genotype dependence of long-range chromatin interactions between genes and their distal control switches at a scale that has not been achieved to date.",Defining interaction quantitative trait loci (iQTLs) in the human genome,9980439,R35GM128938,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Asthma', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Cell physiology', 'Chromatin', 'Chromatin Structure', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computing Methodologies', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence', 'Dependence', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease susceptibility', 'Distal', 'Experimental Designs', 'Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Structure', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Immune', 'Institutes', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Molecular Biology Techniques', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predisposition', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Specificity', 'Susceptibility Gene', 'Uncertainty', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'cell type', 'chromosome conformation capture', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'genome-wide analysis', 'graph theory', 'histone modification', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'promoter', 'statistics', 'transcription factor']",NIGMS,LA JOLLA INSTITUTE FOR IMMUNOLOGY,R35,2020,449649,0.046486736111895965
"Inferring gene regulatory circuitry from functional genomics data PROJECT SUMMARY It has long been known that methylation of genomic DNA correlates with gene expression. However, the structural mechanisms that underlie these observations remain obscure. In this project, we will pursue several innovative strategies for studying how methylation affects transcription factor (TF) binding. First, we will use Methyl-SELEX-seq – a novel experimental method developed in the previous cycle of this grant that uses barcoded mixtures of methylated and unmethylated DNA ligands – to create detailed maps of the effect of methylation on binding affinity for a broad panel of human transcription factors from various structural families. Second, we will perform detailed computational analyses and follow-up experiments to test the hypothesis that methylation causes local changes in DNA shape, which in turn modify TF binding affinity. We have shown that adding a methyl group in the major groove changes the geometry of the minor groove and enhances the electrostatic interaction between negative charges in the DNA minor groove and positively charged amino- acids in the TF. We will extend these analyses to other DNA modifications, as well as a wider range of DNA shape parameters and associated flexibility parameters. By building interpretable TF-DNA recognition models that integrate base, shape, and flexibility features using a powerful new machine learning framework developed in the previous funding cycle, we will make specific predictions regarding sequence and methylation readout mechanisms, and validate these using SELEX experiments with mutated TFs. To assess to what extent our quantitative models for binding to naked DNA built from SELEX data are predictive of binding to genomic DNA in the context of the living cell, we will perform detailed parallel analyses of SELEX and ChIP- seq data for Hox proteins and other TFs. Finally, to study the relationship between DNA binding and gene expression control in human cell lines, we will exploit Survey of Regulatory Elements (SuRE-seq), a novel massively parallel reporter assay that provides unique information about the autonomous transcriptional activity for each of >108 overlapping genomic fragments. PROJECT NARRATIVE Epigenetic modifications of the human genome are known to play a key role in development and disease, but the underlying molecular mechanisms are largely unknown. The main goal of this proposal is to develop and apply new experimental and computational tools for analyzing how the binding of regulatory proteins to DNA is influenced by cytosine methylation.

"An Integrative Computational Framework for DNA Hydroxymethylation Data Mining and Interpretation PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Recent advances in next generation–sequencing (NGS)-based molecular methods have illuminated the hierarchical organization of the genome and have shown that changes in the epigenome can promote or prevent the access of transcription factors (TFs) to specific DNA sequences, move genes between nuclear compartments, and build or remove the insulation between neighboring genomic regions. As changes in the epigenome and chromatin organization can derail precise transcriptional regulatory programs to change cell differentiation status or induce a pathological state, research in Dr. Li’s laboratory seeks to improve our ability to define and understand the impact of such changes across multiple layers of transcriptional regulation in the cell. The laboratory has effectively addressed the regulatory roles of DNA methylation in its previous and ongoing work and now extends its focus to hydroxymethylation. 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC), is a key epigenetic modification linked to transcriptional activation; however, 5hmC data and its genome properties have thus far been evaluated with limited integration of different genomic data types. Moreover, there is no integrative computational framework designed to interpret the functional role of 5hmC in the context of 5-methycytosine (5mC), enhancer activities, chromatin interactions, gene expression data, and DNA sequence information. This proposal will fill the growing need for user-friendly, interpretable, and extendable tools for mining 5hmC data toward laying a foundation for basic mechanistic studies of the epigenome and facilitate discovery of potential therapeutic targets in disease. Building on the investigator’s progress in revealing the dynamics of 5hmC and its impact on gene regulation, the proposal will now develop innovative computational tools for 5hmC data mining and data integration with other NGS datasets, with a focus on applying these tools to B cell differentiation, cancer, and embryonic stem cell (ESC) differentiation. Key goals over the next five years include developing a computational framework to mine short- and long-read sequencing data to answer the following questions: (1) How does 5hmC contribute to epigenetic heterogeneity? (2) How does 5hmC epigenetic heterogeneity contribute to transcriptome heterogeneity? (3) How do 5hmC levels and epigenetic heterogeneity communicate with histone modifications, enhancer activities, chromatin interactions, and chromatin organization? We will combine machine learning and network mining algorithms to enable knowledge discovery and data integration from diverse genomic data types. We will then harness the 5hmC data-mining framework to identify 5hmC patterns that correlate with ESC differentiation, B cell differentiation, and that contribute to the fitness advantage of cancer cells. This work is significant because it will be the first dissection of 5hmC’s contribution to local and long-range epigenetic heterogeneity and the first computational framework to uncover the cross-talk between DNA modifications and other transcriptional regulators via chromatin interaction data. Collectively, this work will yield a fuller picture of the molecular events that underlie fundamental changes in cell state and behavior. PROJECT NARRATIVE / RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH Modifications of the genome that do not change the sequence of the DNA, called epigenetic modifications, can impact how genes are expressed and lead healthy cells into a disease state. Here we propose to develop computational tools to define how one type of epigenetic modification, called hydroxymethylation, impacts gene expression and ultimately cell behavior. These tools will be versatile and adaptable to any cell type of choice, enabling research into the molecular features of the genome that underlie both normal and pathological cell behaviors.",An Integrative Computational Framework for DNA Hydroxymethylation Data Mining and Interpretation,9986833,R35GM133562,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'B cell differentiation', 'Behavior', 'Cell Differentiation process', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'DNA', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA Modification Process', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Dissection', 'Enhancers', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Event', 'Foundations', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomic Segment', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Knowledge Discovery', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Nuclear', 'Pathologic', 'Pattern', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Work', 'base', 'cancer cell', 'cell behavior', 'cell type', 'computer framework', 'computerized tools', 'data integration', 'data mining', 'design', 'embryonic stem cell', 'epigenome', 'fitness', 'genomic data', 'histone modification', 'improved', 'innovation', 'learning network', 'next generation sequencing', 'prevent', 'programs', 'stem cell differentiation', 'therapeutic target', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome', 'user-friendly']",NIGMS,JACKSON LABORATORY,R35,2020,472500,0.06599882230370063
"ImmGen: Gene Expression and Regulation in Immune Cells The Immunological Genome Project (ImmGen) is a collaborative group of 15 Immunology and Computational Biology laboratories who perform, under standardized conditions, a thorough dissection of gene expression and its regulation in the mouse immune system. We also investigated how these respond to cytokines and immunologic challenges, how immune gene expression relates to chromatin configuration, and used cutting-edge computational algorithms to deduce regulatory connections. ImmGen data are publicly available on dedicated web and smartphone supports, using interactive graphic displays that make the results intuitive to users. These are now frequently used by the Immunology research community. The proposed continuation will harness the collective expertise of the ImmGen group to further develop this important public resource.

We will expand the analysis of cytokine signatures, continue to chart non-coding RNA (circRNAs), and persue the “OpenSource” program of coordinated sample contributions from the community. (2) Mechanistic Dissection of Immunogenomic Regulatory Networks focusing on a Core Set of 14 cell-types that represent all the major immunological lineages. We will generate high-resolution maps of transcription factor footprints by ultra-deep ATACseq; map 3D architectures by HiC chromosome conformation capture; apply ChIPseq to define enhancers and super-enhancers, chromatin modification domains and structural anchors; use machine learning approaches to integrate these complementary data into a comprehensive regulatory plan which spans from fine TF footprints to topologically associated domaiins; validate these inferences by collaborating with the KOMP project to analyze Core Set transcriptomes and chromatin configuration in mice with mutations in transcription factors that determine functionally relevant facets of immunocyte activity. (3): Public Display. ImmGen data have become a widely used resource in Immunology research, which will be maintained and curated. For scalability, cost-effectiveness, and to enable facile computation, we will develop and deploy cloud-based data storage and access solutions, compliant with NIH Commons guidelines. We will add to the existing databrowsers to allow users to query different facets of the expanding data (differential expression, regulatory network, chromatin states and architecture, cytokine signatures), increasing connectivity to other data sources. We will continue developing the popular mobile app, and explore the particular uses of that medium. ImmGen has positively impacted immunological research in the current decade, providing detailed and rigorous genomic resolution of immune populations, informed by a strong understanding of their immunology. This is what we will continue and amplify. PROJECT NARRATIVE Through the high quality gene expression data it has generated, ImmGen has become an important resource in Immunology research. This next cycle of funding will expand the definition of gene expression across the immune system, analyze how its regulatory hierarchy relates to immune responses. It will thus provide an essential foundation for the immunogenic understanding of immune responses in health and disease.",ImmGen: Gene Expression and Regulation in Immune Cells,9994813,R24AI072073,"['3-Dimensional', 'ATAC-seq', 'Architecture', 'Biology', 'Boston', 'Cell Differentiation process', 'Cell Lineage', 'Cells', 'Cellular Phone', 'Chromatin', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Computational Biology', 'Computational algorithm', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Data Storage and Retrieval', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Dissection', 'Enhancers', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic Structures', 'Genome', 'Genomic approach', 'Genomics', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immune system', 'Immunogenomics', 'Immunologics', 'Immunology', 'Internet', 'Intuition', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Location', 'Lymphocyte', 'Lymphoid Cell', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Mutation', 'Myeloid Cells', 'Play', 'Population', 'Property', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Visit', 'Wages', 'Washington', 'cell type', 'chromatin modification', 'chromosome conformation capture', 'cloud based', 'cohesin', 'cost effectiveness', 'cytokine', 'data access', 'differential expression', 'immune activation', 'immunogenic', 'mobile application', 'programs', 'response', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'stem cells', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome', 'web site']",NIAID,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,R24,2020,1673172,0.03226257138969373
"Encoding genomic architecture in the encyclopedia: linking DNA elements, chromatin state, and gene expression in 3D Project Summary Most of the 1000s of sequencing experiments generated by ENCODE provide 1D readouts of the epigenetic landscape or transcriptional output of a 3D genome. New chromosome conformation capture (3C) technologies – in particular Hi-C and ChIA-PET – have begun to provide insight into the hierarchical 3D organization of the genome: the partition of chromosomes into open and closed compartments; the existence of structural subunits defined as topologically associated domains (TADs); and the presence of regulatory and structural DNA loops within TADs. New experimental evidence using CRISPR/Cas-mediated genome editing suggests that disruption of local 3D structure can alter regulation of neighboring genes, and there have been early efforts to use data on 3D DNA looping to predict the impact of non-coding SNPs from GWAS studies. The goal of this proposal is to develop new integrative computational methods to interpret large-scale ENCODE 1D epigenomic and transcriptomic resources in light of the underlying 3D architecture of the genome. Members of our team have pioneered powerful methods to infer local chromatin states from a 1D viewpoint through the Segway suite. We have also analyzed the 1D organization of chromatin accessible elements and their lineage dynamics to define the concept of regulatory complexity, and we presented a gene regulation model to predict gene expression changes in differentiation from the DNA content of active enhancers. Here we will build on these efforts to learn chromatin state and gene regulation models that incorporate information on hierarchical 3D genomic architecture, enabling us to predict how individual structural/regulatory elements contribute to 3D DNA looping and to gene expression. Mechanistic predictions will be experimentally validated in their native cell-type specific chromatin context using state-of-the-art genome editing, exploiting computational and experimental CRISPR/Cas tools developed by our team. Project Narrative This project develops advanced computational methods for integrating information on the 3D structure of the human genome with large-scale genomics data sets generated by the ENCODE project to gain insight into cell-type specific chromatin state and gene regulation. These studies have broad relevance for understanding the regulation of gene expression in human cells and the disruption of gene expression programs in disease.","Encoding genomic architecture in the encyclopedia: linking DNA elements, chromatin state, and gene expression in 3D",9855022,U01HG009395,"['3-Dimensional', 'ATAC-seq', 'Architecture', 'Atlases', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'Chromatin Interaction Analysis by Paired-End Tag Sequencing', 'Chromatin Loop', 'Chromosomes', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Computing Methodologies', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence', 'DNA Structure', 'DNase I hypersensitive sites sequencing', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Encyclopedias', 'Enhancers', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Guide RNA', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Hybrids', 'Individual', 'Learning', 'Light', 'Link', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Output', 'Peptide Signal Sequences', 'Ploidies', 'Published Comment', 'Regulation', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Specificity', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Structural Models', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'Training', 'Untranslated RNA', 'base', 'cell type', 'chromosome conformation capture', 'computerized tools', 'deep learning', 'density', 'epigenomics', 'experimental study', 'genome annotation', 'genome editing', 'genome wide association study', 'genomic data', 'histone modification', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'member', 'next generation', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'sequence learning', 'supervised learning', 'three dimensional structure', 'three-dimensional modeling', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptomics', 'unsupervised learning']",NHGRI,SLOAN-KETTERING INST CAN RESEARCH,U01,2020,742538,0.05317410241071332
"Hit-and-Run transcription: The impact of transient interactions in dynamic gene regulatory networks that mediate rapid nutrient signaling Project Summary: This grant exploits TIME - the 4th and largely unexplored dimension of transcription - to capture transient interactions in gene regulatory networks (GRNs) that are important, but missed, in vivo. This is because genome- scale methods to capture transcription factor (TF) target interactions favor stable binding, and reporter gene studies which detect transient TF-target interactions in seconds, miss global responses needed for GRN models. We aim to fill the time-gap in our collective knowledge of dynamic GRNs by experimentally capturing transient TF-target interactions globally using a cell-based temporal TF perturbation assay (Aims 1 & 2), and evaluate their importance in forecasting gene expression at future time-points (Aim 3), a main goal of systems biology. We model temporal GRNs controlling nitrogen (N)-signaling in plants, but our approaches are broadly applicable. We exploit a cell-based assay for temporal TF perturbation, TARGET, which captures transient TF-target interactions genome-wide; i) by TF-mediated gene regulation even in the absence of detectable TF-binding, ii) within minutes of controlled TF nuclear entry, and iii) identifies highly transient TF-binding leading to sustained transcription by affinity-capture of de novo mRNAs. We discovered that i) a single TF can stably or transiently bind to, and induce or repress, distinct sets of targets depending on their cis-context, ii) that transient TF-targets captured only in cells control early N-responses in planta, for two master TFs in our GRNs (bZIP1 & NLP7). This genome-wide data supports a Hit-and-Run transcription model, where a TF Hit can initiate a stable transcriptional complex, including recruitment of TF partners, enabling transcription to continue after the initiating TF is no longer bound, the Run. This could allow a small number of TF molecules to rapidly affect a large number of target genes by acting catalytically. Our studies have been cited and influenced thinking of transient transcription mechanisms across yeast, stems cells, and were invoked to explain the new discovery of transient binding of Zelda/Bicoid to a reporter gene in Drosophila. Herein, we deploy experimental and computational innovations to test the pervasiveness and in vivo significance of a conceptual innovation - transient Hit-and- Run interactions in GRNs. Our experimental innovations include; i) Assays for Hit-and-Run activity across all 70 TF families in Arabidopsis, using a higher throughput version of the cell-based TARGET assay we recently published, ii) new methods to capture TF-target interactions using time-series biotin-ChIP and DamID, which leaves DNA methylation marks on transient TF-target interactions, supported by preliminary data (Aims 1 & 2). Our computational innovations include: i) ConnectTF, a platform to integrate TF-DNA binding and RNA-seq data and identify candidate Hit-and-Run TFs, and approaches to assess the in planta relevance of transient TF- target interactions in GRNs, such as ii) our newly published Network Walking method, and iii) OutPredict, a new time-based method to forecast gene expression at future time-points (Aim 3). Our experimental & computational approaches are broadly applicable and our results are relevant to environmental N-use affecting human health. PROJECT NARRATIVE This work illustrates a combined experimental and computational approach to discover gene regulatory networks in a pathway, process, or trait - applied across a range of problems in biology, agriculture and medicine.

"Statistical Methods for Network-Based Integrative Analysis of CVD Epigenetic Data ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project involves the development of new statistical methodologies and computational tools for network-based integrative analysis of epigenetic risk factors of cardiovascular diseases (CVD). While the advent of omics data from new technologies has facilitated the study of epigenetic factors, existing methodologies often do not account for complexities of biological data  such as correlations due to interactions of genes/proteins as part of biological pathways  and fail to eﬃciently integrate diverse omics data sets  for instance genetic variation, DNA methylation and gene expression. The methodologies proposed in this project, and the software tools that will be developed to implement them, address these shortcomings, and facilitate further research by the biomedical community to gain a better understanding of the underlying biology of CVD, and to develop new diagnostic biomarkers and potential targets for therapies. The proposed methodologies are motivated by the study of epigenetic data from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA), and include (i) a network-based pathway enrichment analysis method that incorporates available knowledge of interactions among genes and proteins while complementing and reﬁning such information (Aim 1A), as well as its extension for analysis of multiple types of omics data (Aim 1B), and (ii) an integrative analysis framework to identify associations among gene expression levels and DNA methylation (Aim 2A) and identify common epigenetic factors of multiple CVD phenotypes through integrated analysis of DNA methylation and mRNA expression data (Aim 2B). We will develop eﬃcient and user-friendly software tools for the proposed methods (Aim 3), which will be made freely available to the public after extensive tests using both simulated data, as well as real data from MESA. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research addresses the need for development of new statistical machine learning methods for analysis of diverse epigenetic data from multiple cardiovascular disease outcomes.

"Understanding Ethnic Differences in Cancer: The Multiethnic Cohort Study - DNA Methylation Supplement PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Native Hawaiian women (NatHW) experience substantial health disparities compared to women of other races/ethnicities, evidenced by their short healthy life expectancy and high all-cause and cancer mortality rates. Reasons for NatHW’s health disparities likely involve a combination of causes, including genetic susceptibility, individual and contextual socioeconomic status (SES), obesity and related lifestyle factors, smoking, healthcare access and quality, and the environment. The multifactorial basis of disparities requires an array of information and integrative approaches in research. Herein, we propose to use epigenetic biomarkers, known to reflect and mediate the combined effects of some of the genetic and environmental stressors, to enhance our mechanistic understanding of NatHW’s disparities in key carcinogenic metabolic traits. We will base the study in the Multiethnic Cohort Study (MEC), which is following the largest number of otherwise understudied Native Hawaiians (~7,850 women, ~6,120 men), as well as >201,000 older adults of mainly four other ethnicities (African American, Japanese American, Latino, white) since 1993-1996 with comprehensive characterization. Research to date indicates that there are significant sex and racial/ethnic differences in the human DNA methylome and in DNA methylation age (DNAm-age) acceleration. Thus, to enable an initial study in the MEC of leukocyte DNA methylation as a likely mediator of NatHW’s health disparities, we request a supplement to the MEC grant (U01 CA164973) in response to NOT-OD-20-048. We will analyze the archived leukocyte DNA samples in the Adiposity Phenotype Study (APS), which is a cross-sectional subset of the MEC, using the Illumina HumanMethylation EPIC bead chips. This will allow us to compare genome-wide methylation patterns and DNAm-age parameters in 140 NatHW and 140 white women, aged 60-77 years at the time of blood collection. We plan to (Aim 1) compare the DNA methylation patterns by constructing a DNA methylation score (DNAm- score) for NatHW vs. white women using penalized logistic regression of ethnicity on methylation at CpGs, adjusted for % Native Hawaiian genetic ancestry. Based on the selected differentially methylated genes, we will infer the biological functions in pathway analysis. We hypothesize that we will discover a DNA methylation signature and accelerated DNAm-age for NatHW vs. white women. We will then (Aim 2) quantify the proportion of the excess metabolic risk in NatHW compared to white women, namely higher insulin, triglycerides, visceral fat, and liver fat, respectively, mediated through the DNA methylome, based on the DNAm-score and DNAm- age. Finally, we will (Aim 3) identify behavioral and environmental determinants of the DNAm-score or DNAm- age among the wealth of data in the MEC-APS (adulthood weight gain, total body fat, lifetime smoking, diet quality, alcohol and meat intake, physical in/activity, sleep hours, and individual and neighborhood SES). This study addresses the goal of the U3 supplement and the MEC U01 grant and may yield important insight into the mechanisms of the disparities in NatHW. PROJECT NARRATIVE / RELEVANCE Native Hawaiian women (NatHW) experience substantial health disparities compared to women of other races/ethnicities. We propose to compare blood epigenetics, the external changes to DNA induced by both genetic and environmental influences, in NatHW and white women. This analysis nested in a large, long-term follow-up study will allow us to understand better which lifestyle and environmental risk factors, to what extent and for which physiologic functions increase the disease-causing metabolic risk in NatHW through epigenetics.",Understanding Ethnic Differences in Cancer: The Multiethnic Cohort Study - DNA Methylation Supplement,10091327,U01CA164973,"['16S ribosomal RNA sequencing', '21 year old', 'Aborigine', 'Acceleration', 'Address', 'Adult', 'African American', 'Age', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohols', 'Archives', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Process', 'Blood', 'Body fat', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Chinese American', 'Chronic Disease', 'Cohort Studies', 'Collection', 'Communicable Diseases', 'DNA', 'DNA Methylation', 'Data', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diet', 'Disease', 'Elderly', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Fatty Liver', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Frequencies', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genetic Risk', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Grant', 'Hawaii', 'Health', 'Hepatocarcinogenesis', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Hypermethylation', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Insulin', 'Intake', 'Japanese American', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Latino', 'Leukocytes', 'Life Expectancy', 'Life Style', 'Liver', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Longterm Follow-up', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of liver', 'Mammary Gland Parenchyma', 'Meat', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'Methylation', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Native Hawaiian', 'Neighborhoods', 'Obesity', 'Pacific Island Americans', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Pilot Projects', 'Polynesian', 'Processed Meats', 'Race', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Sleep', 'Smoking', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Strategic Planning', 'Time', 'Triglycerides', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Visceral', 'Visceral fat', 'Weight Gain', 'Woman', 'Women&apos', 's Health', 'aged', 'base', 'bead chip', 'carcinogenicity', 'chronic liver disease', 'disadvantaged population', 'environmental stressor', 'epigenetic marker', 'epigenome', 'ethnic difference', 'ethnic minority population', 'experience', 'fecal microbiome', 'genome wide association study', 'genome wide methylation', 'genome-wide', 'health care availability', 'health care quality', 'health disparity', 'high risk', 'human DNA', 'insight', 'lifestyle factors', 'liver function', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'men', 'methylation pattern', 'methylome', 'mortality', 'promoter', 'racial and ethnic', 'random forest', 'response', 'sex', 'trait']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF HAWAII AT MANOA,U01,2020,232505,0.04328664994903777
"A Technique for Measuring Transcription Factor Activity Summary  Almost every division of NIH has invested heavily in understanding transcription factors (TFs). TFs are the managers of the cell, controlling everything from cell type to cellular response to stress. With their great power, it is no wonder, many human disorders (cancer, familial platelet disorder, Waardenburg syndrome, etc.) result from mutations in transcription factors. Moreover, over 75% of disease causing variants within the human genome reside in regulatory regions, which are dense with TF binding sites. Currently we can measure the location of TF binding, but binding does not equate with regulatory activity. Furthermore, binding analysis is conducted one TF at a time. What is desperately needed is a technology that is able to measure the activity of all TFs in a cell simultaneously. We have developed a novel approach, called eRNA proﬁling, that leverages enhancer RNAs to infer the activity of all TFs in a cell simultaneously. In this grant we seek to optimize our technology, making eRNA proﬁling more accurate, fast and broadly applicable. Narrative  Transcription factors are important in many human diseases. When transcription factors function they produce eRNAs. We have developed a prototype technique that leverages eRNAs to infer the activity of all TF in a cell simultaneously.",A Technique for Measuring Transcription Factor Activity,9963292,R01GM125871,"['Algorithms', 'Antibodies', 'Behavior', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological Assay', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'DNA', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Drug Screening', 'ESR1 gene', 'Engineering', 'Enhancers', 'Estradiol', 'Familial Platelet Disorder', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Location', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'Pattern', 'Polymerase', 'Post-Translational Protein Processing', 'Protein Isoforms', 'Proteins', 'Publishing', 'RNA', 'Regulation', 'Reporter', 'Research', 'Site', 'Stimulus', 'Stress', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'Waardenburg syndrome', 'Work', 'cell type', 'chromatin immunoprecipitation', 'cooking', 'disease-causing mutation', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'genome-wide', 'human disease', 'improved', 'machine learning algorithm', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'prototype', 'response', 'transcription factor']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO,R01,2020,359286,0.021783094906753807
"REGULATORS OF EPIDERMAL GENE EXPRESSION REGULATORS OF EPIDERAL GENE EXPRESSION  PROJECT SUMMARY  DNA motifs bind transcription factors (TFs) that control gene expression in normal and diseased skin. AR45192 recently mapped the enhancers and promoters that are sequentially activated during epidermal differentiation, and found them enriched for 15 conserved DNA motif combinations, or DNA motif “grammars”. This suggested that these grammars, acting through recruitment of motif-binding TFs, may encode the DNA sequence logic that coordinates the temporal and spatial induction of early and late epidermal differentiation genes. AR45192 also found that these grammars were recurrently altered by single nucleotide polymorphisms (eSNPs, for “expression SNPs”) linked by genome-wide association studies (GWAS) to skin diseases characterized by disrupted epidermal differentiation, including cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). This suggests that newly identified DNA motif grammars may control differentiation and that their disruption may contribute to disease pathogenesis.  Aim I will test the hypothesis that specific DNA motif grammars control the physiologic activation of differentiation genes necessary for normal epidermal function. First, it will define the temporal activity of hundreds of examples of each grammar in early and late differentiation within intact epidermis. Second, it will quantitate epidermal differentiation gene expression and barrier function in isogenic epidermal tissues in which a subset of grammars have been altered by gene-editing. Aim I is designed to characterize the actions of newly identified DNA motif grammars in epidermal differentiation.  Aim II will test the hypothesis that SCC risk eSNPs residing within epidermal differentiation motif grammars alter gene expression in a way that enhances cancer progression. First, it will define SCC eSNP impacts on gene expression in normal epidermis with a goal to understanding the altered target genes, and their biologic functions, that predispose to SCC risk. Second, it will quantitatively assess the impact of these SCC risk eSNPs, singly and in combination, on neoplastic progression of epidermal neoplasia in vivo. Aim II is designed to define the impact of regulatory DNA variants on epidermal gene expression and disease progression.  This AR45192 competing renewal will characterize the role of newly identified regulatory DNA grammars in epidermal homeostasis and neoplastic progression. RELEVANCE  Abnormal differentiation is a hallmark of common skin diseases, such as epidermal cancers, psoriasis, atopic dermatitis, and certain ichthyoses. Transcription factors (TFs) bind DNA motifs in enhancers to control differentiation gene expression in skin and other tissues. Characterizing the patterns of normal and disease-linked DNA sequence motifs that control epidermal differentiation may be of broad utility in the future treatment and prevention of skin disorders. REGULATORS OF EPIDERAL GENE EXPRESSION  Project Narrative The control of gene expression determines the health or disease of human tissues, including skin.

"Mechanisms of eukaryotic transcription activation Summary Transcription activation, a key step in gene control, is the readout of many signaling pathways controlling cell growth, development and stress response and defects in activation cause many human diseases and syndromes. Activation typically results from factors containing activation domains (ADs) binding to coactivator complexes containing activator binding domains (ABDs). Understanding the nature of ADs, the specificity of AD-coactivator interactions, and mechanisms of coactivator cooperativity are necessary for understanding the molecular basis of gene regulation. The long-term goal of this project is to determine mechanisms used by gene-specific activators and coactivators to regulate RNA polymerase (Pol) II transcription. The objectives of this proposal are to determine: i) mechanisms of Mediator recruitment and its interaction with ADs, ii) mechanisms of cooperativity between Mediator and the coactivator SAGA, and iii) what constitutes a functional AD and determines the AD specificity for different coactivators and promoter types. This work will utilize an interdisciplinary combination of biochemical, structural, molecular, and computational approaches to examine transcriptional activation in S. cerevisiae. To understand these mechanisms, we will build upon several breakthrough concepts and methods developed in the past grant period. We will use a combination of genomics and biochemistry to identify a new mechanism of Mediator recruitment that is likely used at many genes. We will use orthogonal approaches to determine how the coactivator SAGA stimulates genome-wide transcription, either by direct interaction with the Pol II preinitiation complex (PIC) and/or by direct interaction with Mediator. We will determine the structural basis for AD-Mediator Tail domain interaction using a combination of biochemical and structural analysis. Finally, we will use a combination of biochemistry, genomics, and computational analysis to predict AD function and specificity and identify new mechanisms of AD-coactivator interaction. The expected outcome of these studies will be a molecular understanding of transcription activator specificity and function, mechanisms used by the coactivators Mediator and SAGA to promote transcription, and an understanding of how these factors function at different classes of genes –a leap forward in understanding widely conserved mechanisms of eukaryotic gene regulation. Project Narrative Regulation of transcription by activation of gene expression is a key mechanism for control of cell growth, differentiation, and development. Defects in activation directly contribute to many human illnesses. Our proposed work will identify conserved and widely used mechanisms for transcriptional activation that will form the molecular basis for understanding regulation of transcriptional programs in normal cells, transcriptional defects leading to human disease, and reveal fundamental information on the mechanism of transcription factors that are the readout of many signaling pathways.",Mechanisms of eukaryotic transcription activation,9968281,R01GM075114,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Amino Acids', 'Architecture', 'Binding', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemistry', 'Complex', 'Computer Analysis', 'DNA Binding Domain', 'DNA Polymerase II', 'Defect', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Gene Activation', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Growth and Development function', 'Housekeeping Gene', 'Human', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Maps', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Computations', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Nature', 'Normal Cell', 'Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Study', 'Polymerase', 'Proteins', 'Publishing', 'RNA Polymerase II', 'Randomized', 'Reagent', 'Regulation', 'Regulator Genes', 'SAGA', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae', 'Sequence Analysis', 'Signal Pathway', 'Specificity', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Tail', 'Technology', 'Transcription Coactivator', 'Transcription Initiation', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Transcriptional Activation Domain', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Work', 'base', 'biological adaptation to stress', 'cell growth', 'chromatin modification', 'deep learning', 'flexibility', 'genetic analysis', 'genome-wide', 'high throughput screening', 'human disease', 'in vivo', 'novel strategies', 'programs', 'promoter', 'protein crosslink', 'protein protein interaction', 'recruit', 'transcription factor']",NIGMS,FRED HUTCHINSON CANCER RESEARCH CENTER,R01,2020,527403,0.018961513531033904

Over the past decade, a wealth of new high-throughput genomics tools have revolutionized how we identify active genomic regions and appear poised to make great strides in understanding the mechanisms of disease. Yet the application of most of these technologies has been limited to established cell lines. Currently, approaches being developed to comprehensively map functional elements across the genome involve combining data from several different genome-wide experimental assays, making them expensive and impractical to use in clinical isolates of limited quantity or even to analyze new cell lines. Compounding these technical difficulties, gene expression is a complex and highly tissue dependent biological process, and many important applications will require the direct interrogation of clinical isolates or other similarly limited sources of sample. Thus, efficient new tools that map the repertoire of functional elements across the genome are likely to transform the biomedical and clinical sciences.  We propose to develop Chromatin Run-On and Sequencing (ChRO-seq) and a suite of computational tools for mapping transcription directly in limited tissue samples. Our approach uses a single genome-wide molecular assay to efficiently identify the location of promoters and enhancers, transcription factor binding sites, gene and lincRNA boundaries, transcription levels, and impute certain histone modifications. Preliminary ChRO-seq data reveals patterns of transcription that are virtually identical to those using Precision Run on and Sequencing in cultured cells, but can easily be applied in solid tissue samples. We applied our preliminary ChRO-seq technology to several primary tumors, revealing new insights into how transcriptional regulation underlies cancer development and progression, and providing a key proof-of-concept motivating further technology development. We anticipate that ChRO-seq and the computational methods proposed will enable the efficient discovery of functional elements in virtually any cell sample. In addition, ChRO-seq has the unique advantage that it can be applied in limited tissue samples and clinical isolates even after the degradation of mRNA. PROJECT NARRATIVE We propose to develop a suite of molecular and computational technologies that allow researchers to directly measure transcriptional regulation of genes, enhancers, and lincRNAs in limited clinical isolates. These technologies are anticipated to have a major impact on the biomedical sciences, enabling the genome-wide interrogation of transcription during virtually any disease process for the first time.",Mapping RNA polymerase in tissue samples with ChRO-seq.,9850271,R01HG009309,"['Archives', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Process', 'Cell Line', 'Cells', 'ChIP-seq', 'Chromatin', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Consumption', 'Cultured Cells', 'DNA Sequence', 'DNA-Directed RNA Polymerase', 'Data', 'Deoxyribonuclease I', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Enhancers', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomic Segment', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Hypersensitivity', 'Location', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Computations', 'Nuclear', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Primary Neoplasm', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'RNA', 'RNA Polymerase I', 'Regulatory Element', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Solid', 'Source', 'Specimen', 'Speed', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Tissue Sample', 'Tissues', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Untranslated RNA', 'computational suite', 'computerized tools', 'deep learning', 'established cell line', 'experimental study', 'genome-wide', 'genomic tools', 'histone modification', 'human disease', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'mRNA Transcript Degradation', 'next generation', 'novel', 'predictive tools', 'programs', 'promoter', 'scale up', 'technology development', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'virtual']",NHGRI,CORNELL UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,387500,0.03311407305394094
"Unbiased identification and characterization of mouse metastable epialleles PROJECT SUMMARY (Abstract) In addition to genetics and environment, interindividual variation in epigenetic regulation may determine risk of obesity. Exceptional genomic loci called metastable epialleles offer unprecedented opportunities to test this. Metastable epialleles – essentially epigenetic polymorphisms – exhibit interindividual variation in DNA methylation that is neither tissue-specific nor genetically mediated. Metastable epialleles were first discovered in mice when dramatic phenotypic variation was observed amongst inbred mice. Over the last 10 years we pioneered the discovery and characterization of human metastable epialleles. We have shown that DNA methylation profiling of multiple tissues in multiple individuals is an effective approach to identifying regions that exhibit systemic interindividual variation in DNA methylation, a hallmark of metastable epialleles. Now that we know epigenetic metastability is common to mice and humans, it is essential to identify and explore the full range of MEs in the mouse. We therefore propose to pursue the following Specific Aims: Aim 1 - Perform an unbiased screen for mouse metastable epialleles. Aim 2 - Test for effects of maternal dietary methyl donor supplementation on offspring DNA methylation at metastable epialleles. Aim 3: Use comparative genomics to identify sequence determinants of epigenetic metastability. Successful completion of these Aims will provide the foundation for development of mouse (and potentially other mammalian) models which will enable controlled experiments to help understand how interindividual variation in DNA methylation affects risk of disease in humans. PROJECT NARRATIVE (Relevance Statement) Just as individual genetic variation can affect risk of disease, so too can individual epigenetic variation. In particular, special genomic regions called metastable epialleles, which were first discovered in mice, offer the best opportunities to advance our understanding of epigenetic etiology of disease because their systemic nature means that – like genetic polymorphisms – they can be assessed in any easily obtainable tissue sample, such as peripheral blood. Now that we know that metastable epialleles also exist in humans, we urgently need to develop a more complete catalog of these genomic regions in the mouse, to enable well- controlled experiments to advance our understanding of the causes and consequences of interindividual epigenetic variation at these loci.",Unbiased identification and characterization of mouse metastable epialleles,10032890,R01DK125562,"['Affect', 'Area', 'Assisted Reproductive Technology', 'Base Sequence', 'Beds', 'Catalogs', 'Cells', 'Cleft Palate', 'DNA', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Developmental Biology', 'Diet', 'Dietary Supplementation', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Embryo', 'Environment', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Etiology', 'Exhibits', 'Foundations', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Fingerprintings', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genomic Segment', 'Genomic approach', 'Genomics', 'Germ Layers', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Inbred Mouse', 'Individual', 'Individuality', 'Intracisternal A-Particle Elements', 'Label', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Mediating', 'Metabolic', 'Methylation', 'Micronutrients', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Nature', 'Nutritional', 'Nutritional Study', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Pancreas', 'Paper', 'Phenotype', 'Reporting', 'Research Personnel', 'Retrotransposon', 'Seminal', 'Supplementation', 'Tail', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissue Sample', 'Tissues', 'Toxicology', 'Variant', 'base', 'bisulfite sequencing', 'catalyst', 'cell type', 'comparative genomics', 'critical period', 'disorder risk', 'early pregnancy', 'embryo culture', 'epigenetic regulation', 'epigenetic variation', 'experimental study', 'genomic locus', 'improved', 'inter-individual variation', 'metabolic phenotype', 'mother nutrition', 'mouse development', 'mouse genome', 'mouse model', 'nonhuman primate', 'nutrition', 'obesity risk', 'offspring', 'peripheral blood', 'transgenerational epigenetic inheritance']",NIDDK,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R01,2020,500075,0.054275358834860926
"Computational approaches for comparative regulatory genomics to decipher long-range gene regulation Project Abstract/Summary The three-dimensional organization of the genome is a major player in long-range gene regulation, where regulatory elements such as enhancers affect the expression of a gene hundreds of kilobases away. Changes in three-dimensional organization are associated with tissue-specific gene expression and have been implicated in several human diseases including cancer, diabetes and obesity. Advances in chromosome conformation capture (3C) technologies have expanded our repertoire of long-range interactions between enhancers and promoters in model cell lines and have shown that such interactions are established through a complex interplay of chromatin state, transcription factor binding and three-dimensional proximity of genomic regions. However, our current understanding of the dynamics of long-range gene regulation is limited, both across different cell types as well as across different species. This is because of the absence of such datasets in most species and cell types, lack of systematic methods to predict and interpret these interactions, and due to limited approaches to compare both the regions and their interactions across different cell types and especially across species. The overarching goals of this proposal are to develop novel computational methods to jointly identify candidate regulatory elements in multiple species and predict their long- range interactions in new cell types and species where high-throughput 3C datasets are not available or difficult to obtain. In Aim 1, we will develop a phylogenetically aware method of jointly identifying regulatory elements such as enhancers in multiple species. Aim 2 will develop multi-task and transfer learning approaches to predict interactions in new species and cell types by integrating available high-throughput 3C datasets from multiple cell types and 3C platforms. In Aim 3, we will collect a novel multi-species chromatin mark dataset in species-specific endothelial cells to enable a systematic study of long-range gene regulation dynamics. We will apply our computational approaches developed in Aims 1 and 2 on this multi-species epigenomic dataset to identify different regulatory elements and predict long-range interactions in multiple species. We will develop rigorous computational measures to evaluate the quality of predictions from our novel methods and the improvements compared to existing methods based on published 3C datasets. We will further experimentally validate predicted interactions using Capture-HiC in multiple species and using CRISPR/Cas9 experiments. We will examine individual and groups of interactions to identify species-specific, and clade- specific interactions and interpret the corresponding genes in the context of known pathways and curated gene sets associated with cardiovascular diseases. Our methods will be widely applicable to dissect long-range gene regulation in complex phenotypes including diseases. Software tools, resources, original data and experimental protocols developed by this project will be made publicly available. Project Narrative Long-range gene regulatory interactions are emerging as important determinants of tissue-specific gene expression and are often disrupted in different diseases including cancer. Such interactions occur between distally located regulatory sequence elements and genes hundreds of kilobases away. Currently our understanding of long-range gene regulation is limited to a few cell types and model organisms. Computational methods to identify regulatory elements and systematically link them to target genes in diverse cell types and mammalian species can significantly improve our understanding of the impact of long-range gene regulation in human diseases, help interpret regulatory variation in non-coding parts of the genome and assist in the development of better biomarkers.",Computational approaches for comparative regulatory genomics to decipher long-range gene regulation,9996761,R01HG010045,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Animal Model', 'Awareness', 'Basic Science', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cell Line', 'Cell model', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'Comparative Study', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Distal', 'Elements', 'Endothelial Cells', 'Enhancers', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genomic Segment', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Human', 'Ice', 'Individual', 'Joints', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Obesity', 'Pathway interactions', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Phylogenetic Analysis', 'Play', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychological Transfer', 'Publishing', 'Regulation', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Software Tools', 'Statistical Models', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Tissue-Specific Gene Expression', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'base', 'cell type', 'chromosome conformation capture', 'comparative', 'cost', 'epigenome', 'epigenomics', 'experimental study', 'follow-up', 'genomic locus', 'histone modification', 'human disease', 'improved', 'learning classifier', 'markov model', 'multi-task learning', 'multiple datasets', 'multitask', 'novel', 'promoter', 'tool', 'trait', 'transcription factor']",NHGRI,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R01,2020,352626,0.03949586043677248
"VISION: ValIdated Systematic IntegratiON of epigenomic data Project Summary VISION: ValIdated Systematic IntegratiON of hematopoietic epigenomes Technological advances enabling the production of large numbers of rich, genome-wide, sequence-based datasets have transformed biology. However, the volume of data is overwhelming for most investigators. Also, we do not know the mechanisms by which the vast majority of epigenetic features regulate normal differentiation or lead to aberrant function in disease. We have formed an interdisciplinary, collaborative team of investigators to address the problem of how to effectively utilize the enormous amount of epigenetic data both for basic research and precision medicine. At this point, acquisition of data is no longer the major barrier to understanding mechanisms of gene regulation during normal and pathological tissue development. The chief challenges are how to: (i) integrate epigenetic data in terms that are accessible and understandable to a broad community of researchers, (ii) build validated quantitative models explaining how the dynamics of gene expression relates to epigenetic features, and (iii) translate information effectively from mouse models to potential applications in human health. These needs are addressed by the proposed ValIdated Systematic IntegratiON (VISION) of epigenetic data to analyze mouse and human hematopoiesis, a tractable system with clear clinical significance and importance to NIDDK. By pursuing the following Specific Aims, the interdisciplinary collaboration will deliver comprehensive catalogs of cis regulatory modules (CRMs), extensive chromatin interaction maps and deduced regulatory domains, validated quantitative models for gene regulation, and a guide for investigators to translate insights from mouse models to human clinical studies. These deliverables will be provided to the community in readily accessible, web-based platforms including customized genome browsers, databases with facile query interfaces, and data-driven on-line tools. Specifically, the proposed work in Aim 1 will build comprehensive, integrative catalogs of hematopoietic CRMs and transcriptomes by compiling and determining informative epigenetic features and transcript levels in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells and in mature cells. CRMs will be predicted using the novel IDEAS (Integrative and Discriminative Epigenome Annotation System) method. Work proposed in Aim 2 will build and validate quantitative models for gene regulation informed by chromatin interaction maps and epigenetic data. Compiling and determining chromosome interaction frequencies will predict likely target genes for CRMs. Gene regulatory models will be built that predict the contributions of CRMs and specific proteins to regulated expression; these models will be validated by extensive testing using genome-editing in ten reference loci. Finally, work in Aim 3 will produce a guide for investigators to translate insights from mouse models to human clinical studies. This effort will include categorizing orthologous mouse and human genes by conservation versus divergence of expression patterns, assigning CRMs to informative categories of epigenomic evolution, and testing the interspecies functional maps experimentally by genome-editing. Project Narrative VISION: ValIdated Systematic IntegratiON of hematopoietic epigenomes Blood cell formation is vitally important to human health because we must continually replace old and damaged cells, and because many diseases result from mis-regulation of gene expression during blood formation. Global measurements of proteins bound to DNA and their modifications help us find the genetic differences most likely to account for the aberrant gene expression at the heart of some diseases.

"Identification of epigenetic subclones in lymphomas and leukemias Abstract Epigenetic modifications, such as DNA methylation, play a significant role in human disease. DNA methylation is altered in cancer, and DNA methylation-induced silencing of promoters of tumor-suppressors is thought to play a key role in tumorigenesis. Though there is an increasing number of methylation sequencing datasets generated from cancer, they are confounded by tumor heterogeneity. Understanding the subclonal architecture underlying heterogeneity is important because individual cancer subclones impact cancer growth, treatment resistance, and metastasis. Increased “epigenetic heterogeneity,” or variation in DNA methylation patterns, was determined to be correlated with worse prognosis in patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). However, these studies only profiled epigenetic heterogeneity at a global scale and did not analyze methylation of individual subclones. Many computational methods have been developed for this purpose in epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS), but these methods are not applicable for methylation sequencing data. As such, there is a need to develop new computational methods to study subclonal methylation profiles in cancer. I will develop a novel computational method (DXM) that deconvolves DNA methylation of heterogeneous clinical samples into their major subpopulations, their prevalence, and their respective DNA methylation profiles (Aim 1). DXM will be developed on simulations generated from data available from both the Roadmap Epigenomics Project and the Blueprint Epigenome Project and will be validated with methylation sequencing on DLBCL samples. I will then leverage DXM to study subclonal methylation profiles in AML (Aim 2). I hypothesize that methylation can confer fitness advantages in epigenetic subclones of AML, leading to clonal expansion following therapeutic intervention and subsequent relapse. Using DXM, I will first identify epigenetic subclones from whole genome bisulfite sequencing data from AML patients with well-characterized genetic subclonal architecture and compare the epigenetic subclonal architecture to that of the genetic subclones. In a second dataset containing methylation sequencing data from paired diagnosis-relapse samples, I will apply DXM, identify subclonal methylation profiles, and characterize all genes impacted by subclonal methylation to determine if they are expected to confer fitness advantages. Finally, I will test if mutations known to impact DNA methylation in AML (DNMT3A, IDH1/2) alter epigenetic subclonal expansion. Taken together, this proposal will result in a new computational approach to interpret epigenetic data from heterogeneous clinical samples as well as identification of DNA methylation changes in epigenetic subclones of AML that contribute to disease progression and correlate with prognosis. Project Narrative Studies that characterize which variations in cancer relate to worse outcome may do analysis on the entire tumor sample, which is composed of many different types of cells, each with distinct biology. The goal of this proposal is to develop a novel computational method to analyze variations in cancer at the level of cell-types. These results can be used to improve patient prognostics and care in multiple cancers.",Identification of epigenetic subclones in lymphomas and leukemias,9931169,F30CA224687,"['Acute Myelocytic Leukemia', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Antibodies', 'Architecture', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Cancer Biology', 'Cancer Patient', 'Caring', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Clonal Expansion', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'CpG dinucleotide', 'DNA Methylation', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease Progression', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Fluorescence-Activated Cell Sorting', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genome', 'Genomic Imprinting', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Heterogeneity', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'Modification', 'Mutation', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Play', 'Prevalence', 'Relapse', 'Retrotransposon', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Surface', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Training', 'Tumor Promoters', 'Tumor Suppressor Genes', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins', 'United States', 'Variant', 'X Inactivation', 'anticancer research', 'bisulfite', 'bisulfite sequencing', 'career', 'cell type', 'clinical care', 'design', 'epigenome', 'epigenome-wide association studies', 'epigenomics', 'fitness', 'genome sequencing', 'human disease', 'improved', 'large cell Diffuse non-Hodgkin&apos', 's lymphoma', 'leukemia/lymphoma', 'methylation pattern', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'patient stratification', 'prognostic', 'promoter', 'simulation', 'single cell sequencing', 'statistics', 'therapy resistant', 'tumor', 'tumor heterogeneity', 'tumorigenesis', 'whole genome']",NCI,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,F30,2020,47730,0.08468715793253405
