"Machine learning for the automated identification and tracking of rare myocardial diseases PROJECT SUMMARY Although cardiac amyloidosis and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) are relatively rare causes of heart failure (HF), they are particularly challenging to detect and treat for several shared reasons: (1) on routine clinical imaging (i.e., echocardiography [echo]), they can be difficult to distinguish from superficially similar, more common forms of cardiac disease that cause left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy; (2) the diagnoses are often missed and thus patients can present late in the course of disease at a time when treatment is difficult; (3) objective, noninvasive metrics that reliably reflect disease progression have not been identified; and (4) the small number of known patients with these diseases can make epidemiology studies and clinical trials difficult to organize and conduct. For both cardiac amyloidosis and HCM, echo plays a critical role in both diagnosis and longitudinal monitoring given its ubiquitous clinical availability, safety, and low cost. More broadly, echo dominates the current landscape of routine cardiac imaging, with tens of millions of echos performed in the United States each year. However, the clinical challenges described above highlight several shortcomings of echo: it is limited in its ability to (1) diagnose disease at its early stages; (2) discriminate between morphologically similar diseases; and (3) quantify disease progression. This proposal seeks to address deficiencies in the current echo reading workflow, which is subjective and captures only a small fraction of the data available in each study. The overall objective of this application is to use advances in machine learning to develop and validate fully-automated echo image analytic approaches to diagnose and track rare cardiomyopathies, focusing on cardiac amyloidosis and HCM. Our proposal is centered on the hypothesis that highly scalable computer vision methods can be applied to echo studies to overcome limitations of the standard clinical echo reading workflow. Accordingly our aims are: (1) Apply an automated method for echo quantification and disease identification to detect and differentiate cardiac diseases that cause increased LV wall thickness; and (2) Characterize quantifiable echo measures of disease progression in cardiac amyloidosis and HCM and associate these with clinical outcomes. Our multidisciplinary team, which is composed of experts in cardiomyopathies, echocardiography, computer vision, and machine learning, will analyze echos and patient data from 2 large patient registries: the Multicenter Amyloid Phenotyping Study (MAPS) and the Sarcomeric Human Cardiomyopathy Registry (SHaRe) HCM Network, with validation using a repository of nearly 400,000 echos. The successful completion of our aims will result in an innovative tool for early diagnosis of myocardial diseases and tracking of disease progression. Importantly, our project will set the stage for conducting larger epidemiology studies of rare myocardial diseases by automating the identification of these patients, and thereby developing previously unattainable broad-based cohorts for these conditions. PROJECT NARRATIVE Rare heart diseases such as amyloidosis (due to abnormal deposition of a protein into the heart muscle) and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (due to a genetic mutation) are important causes of heart failure and sudden death in the general population. These heart diseases are difficult to diagnose, monitor, and treat because: (1) they appear superficially similar to more common forms of heart disease (e.g., high blood pressure) on imaging tests; (2) the optimal monitoring of disease progression over time has not been established; and (3) there is a lack of large-scale studies of patients with these diseases given their rarity. This project aims to use machine learning (artificial intelligence) of digital echocardiographic images to create a completely automated method for diagnosing and tracking these rare heart diseases with the ultimate goal of broad deployment of artificial intelligence algorithms in hospitals and clinics to help identify patients with these rare heart diseases earlier, better predict adverse outcomes, and increase the size and scope of patient registries to enhance research of these conditions.",Machine learning for the automated identification and tracking of rare myocardial diseases,9838368,R01HL140731,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithm Design', 'Algorithms', 'Amyloid', 'Amyloidosis', 'Arrhythmia', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiomyopathies', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinics and Hospitals', 'Cohort Studies', 'Communities', 'Comorbidity', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Coronary heart disease', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Deposition', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Echocardiography', 'Face', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Heart Diseases', 'Heart failure', 'Hospitalization', 'Human', 'Hypertension', 'Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Inherited', 'Left', 'Left Ventricular Hypertrophy', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Morphology', 'Myocardium', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Reader', 'Reading', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Sudden Death', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Two-Dimensional Echocardiography', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Ventricular', 'adverse outcome', 'automated image analysis', 'base', 'career', 'clinical care', 'clinical imaging', 'cohort', 'cost', 'digital', 'disease diagnosis', 'epidemiology study', 'heart imaging', 'hypertensive heart disease', 'image processing', 'innovation', 'interest', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel therapeutics', 'particle', 'patient registry', 'repository', 'response', 'tool']",NHLBI,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2019,687155,0.026311669747620833
"Personalizing Preoperative Stress Testing Using Machine Learning Project Summary Dr. Pappas is a junior faculty member in the Medicine Institute at the Cleveland Clinic, with appointments in the Center for Value-Based Care Research and the Department of Hospital Medicine (Cleveland, OH). This career development award aims to provide training in propensity methods, deep learning techniques, and pilot intervention development, ultimately seeking to identify personalized approaches to cardiac stress testing before surgery. Noncardiac surgery carries risk of mortality and morbidity, and cardiac complications account for the largest share of perioperative mortality. Meanwhile, current approaches are expensive and may not effectively reduce cardiac risk. This proposal uses machine learning techniques to define the value of information provided by each different kind of stress test and the expected benefit of different therapeutic interventions through which preoperative risks might be modified. It then seeks to identify the most helpful cardiac stress test, if any. In this career development award, Dr. Pappas proposes three phases of investigation, and in so doing will acquire new skills critical to achieving his goal of becoming an expert in perioperative risk mitigation. In Aim 1, Dr. Pappas will use propensity matching techniques to evaluate prior associations between preoperative stress testing and improved postoperative mortality, when including rich clinical data not available to previous large studies. In Aim 2, he will use machine learning techniques to estimate the value of information provided by each modality of stress testing, and the impact on the risk of each event from each intervention. In Aim 3, Dr. Pappas will pilot an intervention presenting personalized estimates to physicians in the preoperative clinic. In addition to advanced training through formal coursework, this career development award is supported by an extraordinary mentorship team, including internationally-recognized experts in perioperative outcomes research, cardiovascular disease, use of observational healthcare data, and machine learning. The combination of formal training and mentored research outlined in this application is designed to ensure that Dr. Pappas will emerge from this award as an independent investigator and expert in personalized perioperative decision-making. Project Narrative Many patients die soon after surgery, and many of those deaths are from heart problems. Physicians have tried to reduce those risks in many ways, but our current approach is expensive, leads to unhelpful testing, and probably doesn't do a very good job reducing the risk of death. This proposal uses a form of machine learning and a large dataset to try to find more personalized, more helpful, and less expensive strategies to try to reduce the risks of surgery, and then tests whether we can present personalized estimates to doctors that they could use when thinking about the risks of surgery.",Personalizing Preoperative Stress Testing Using Machine Learning,9664901,K08HL141598,"['Appointment', 'Award', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Consultations', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Ensure', 'Event', 'Faculty', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Guidelines', 'Healthcare', 'Heart', 'Hospital Departments', 'Information Theory', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'Internal Medicine', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Observational Study', 'Occupations', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Perioperative', 'Perioperative complication', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Postoperative Period', 'Probability', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Role', 'Stress Tests', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thallium Myocardial Perfusion Imaging Stress Test', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Thinking', 'Training', 'Weight', 'base', 'clinical decision support', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'design', 'functional status', 'implementation science', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'member', 'mortality', 'mortality risk', 'perioperative mortality', 'personalized approach', 'personalized decision', 'prognostic value', 'randomized trial', 'risk mitigation', 'skills', 'surgical risk', 'therapy development', 'treatment center']",NHLBI,CLEVELAND CLINIC LERNER COM-CWRU,K08,2019,161047,0.044723060427731005
"Predicting Pulmonary and Cardiac Morbidity in Preterm Infants with Deep Learning RESEARCH SUMMARY The goal of this award is to provide Andrew Beam, PhD with research support and comprehensive mentoring designed to transition him to an independent investigator in perinatal and neonatal informatics. Preterm labor (PTL) is labor which occurs before 37 weeks of gestation and carries with it enormous health and financial consequences. Preterm infants have some of the highest levels of pulmonary and cardiac morbidity, yet machine-learning techniques for these important outcomes remains under developed. The research strategy is focused developing predictive models for two very important clinical scenarios using large sources of existing healthcare data. The focus of Specific Aim 1 develops a new form of machine learning known as deep learning for predicting PTL in pregnant women, while the focus of Specific Aim 2 investigates the use of deep learning for predicting clinical trajectories of preterm infants in the NICU. Currently, management and anticipation of both clinical scenarios is challenging and advancement in our predictive capacity could dramatically improve the quality and efficiency of the healthcare system. These models will be built using an existing database of 50 million patient-lives obtained through a partnership with a major US health insurer. Specific Aim 3 seeks to understand how the models constructed using this unique data resource translate and generalize to data from the electronic health records of Boston-area hospitals, which is a key concern for all healthcare data scientists. The education plan focuses on augmenting Dr. Beam’s graduate degrees in statistics and bioinformatics with additional training in clinical medicine and human pathology. This additional education will grant Dr. Beam a deeper understanding of the clinical problems faced by these populations and will allow for more fluid collaborations with clinicians in the future. The composition of Dr. Beam’s mentorship committee, which includes expertise in neonatology, biostatistics, and translational informatics, reflects his long-term desire to be quantitative scientist who works side-by-side practicing physicians so that quantitative research is translated into impactful clinical practice. PROJECT NARRATIVE Infants born prematurely experience some of the highest levels of pulmonary and cardiac morbidity and are among the most expensive patients in all of pediatrics. Now, with the availability of large sources of healthcare data from insurance claims databases and electronic health records, there is an opportunity to better understand prematurity and its predictors using computational techniques. We propose leveraging state of the art deep learning models built using data from hospitals and insurers to both predict which pregnancies will result in preterm birth and to predict which preterm infants will experience severe cardiac and pulmonary morbidity.",Predicting Pulmonary and Cardiac Morbidity in Preterm Infants with Deep Learning,9928552,K01HL141771,"['37 weeks gestation', 'Accounting', 'Acute Disease', 'Address', 'Adverse event', 'Affect', 'Area', 'Award', 'Big Data', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biometry', 'Birth', 'Birth Weight', 'Boston', 'Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia', 'Cardiac', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Collaborations', 'Computational Technique', 'Conceptions', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Scientist', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Diagnosis', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Education', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Future', 'Gestational Age', 'Goals', 'Graduate Degree', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heart', 'Heart Diseases', 'Hospitals', 'Human Pathology', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Informatics', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'Insurance Carriers', 'Life', 'Liquid substance', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Nature', 'Necrotizing Enterocolitis', 'Neonatal', 'Neonatal Intensive Care Units', 'Neonatology', 'Outcome', 'Patent Ductus Arteriosus', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pediatrics', 'Performance', 'Perinatal', 'Physicians', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnant Women', 'Premature Birth', 'Premature Infant', 'Premature Labor', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Support', 'Rest', 'Retinopathy of Prematurity', 'Risk', 'Risk Estimate', 'Scientist', 'Sepsis', 'Side', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Teaching Hospitals', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Update', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Work', 'clinical practice', 'clinical predictors', 'data resource', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'design', 'education planning', 'electronic data', 'experience', 'improved', 'insurance claims', 'mortality', 'peer', 'portability', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'premature', 'prognostic', 'respiratory distress syndrome', 'social', 'statistics']",NHLBI,HARVARD SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH,K01,2019,166320,0.029337125791700277
"Novel Non-Invasive Coronary Flow Patterning to Predict Early Coronary Microvascular Disease PROJECT SUMMARY  Coronary microvascular disease (CMD) is notoriously difficult to diagnose non-invasively, and current methods of assessing CMD utilize only the peak velocity of the coronary flow pattern. While new imaging techniques such as cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have improved the assessment coronary perfusion, there are currently no non-invasive methods that incorporate the coronary flow pattern over a complete cardiac cycle to definitively assess and predict the development of CMD.  Coronary blood flow (CBF) reflects the summation of flow in the coronary microcirculation, and our lab has begun to harness the full CBF pattern under varying flow and disease conditions (e.g. type 2 diabetes) to determine whether it might harbor novel clues leading to the early detection of CMD. Our past and preliminary data indicate an early onset of CMD in both type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and metabolic syndrome (MetS) that occurs prior to the onset of macrovascular complications and that are characterized by blood flow impairments and alterations in coronary resistance microvessel (CRM) structure, function, and biomechanics. Our data also uncovered innovative correlations between CRM structure/biomechanics and our newly-defined features of the coronary flow pattern, some of which were unique to normal or diabetic mice. We have initially utilized these CBF features, in the presence and absence of other factors such as cardiac function, to develop a mathematical model in collaboration with Drs. Christopher Bartlett and William Ray that to date demonstrated that 6 simple factors can predict a normal vs. diabetic coronary flow pattern with 85% predictive accuracy. Utilizing a multidisciplinary approach, these preliminary data strongly suggest that the coronary flow pattern and physiological modulators of it (e.g. coronary micovascular structure/function/biomechanics, cardiac function, etc), may be useful in directly diagnosing early CMD. Therefore, we hypothesize that dissecting the elements that influence coronary flow patterning will be critical determinants in the direct assessment of coronary microvascular disease using computational modeling. Using our previous publications and our preliminary data as guides, the hypothesis will be tested by addressing two specific aims: 1) Determine whether unique time-dependent CBF patterning in normal and T2DM is dictated by a combination of CRM remodeling and biomechanics, coronary flow pattern dynamics, and cardiac function, permitting the development of a computational model to accurately predict CMD; 2) Determine the reproducibility and robustness of the machine learning model in predicting CMD in a diet-induced obesity/diabetes mouse model. If successful, these studies will be the first to simultaneously examine the influence of CRMs, CBF, and cardiac structure/function on the distinct pattern of coronary flow, and it will determine whether a mathematical model may be useful in establishing a direct assessment of CMD to eventually enable clinicians to conduct a more direct non-invasive diagnosis of CMD for the prevention and/or treatment of heart disease. PROJECT NARRATIVE Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) is the leading cause of heart disease and is associated with hypertension, diabetes, and metabolic syndrome. Coronary Microvascular Disease (CMD) is comprised of structural and functional deficits of the tiny coronary arteries that may be an earlier indicator of disease prior to the onset of overt CAD. The proposed multidisciplinary research aims to develop a computational artificial intelligence model that will accurately predict CMD based on a non-invasive coronary flow pattern obtained by Doppler echocardiography.",Novel Non-Invasive Coronary Flow Patterning to Predict Early Coronary Microvascular Disease,9769734,R21EB026518,"['Address', 'Age', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biomechanics', 'Blood flow', 'Cardiac', 'Collaborations', 'Computer Simulation', 'Coronary', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Coronary artery', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diabetic mouse', 'Diet', 'Disease', 'Doppler Echocardiography', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Echocardiography', 'Elements', 'Heart Diseases', 'Hyperemia', 'Hypertension', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Impairment', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Metabolic syndrome', 'Methods', 'Microcirculation', 'Microvascular Dysfunction', 'Modeling', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Obesity', 'Pattern', 'Physiological', 'Publications', 'Reproducibility', 'Resistance', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'base', 'coronary perfusion', 'db/db mouse', 'diabetic', 'disorder prevention', 'early onset', 'experimental study', 'heart function', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'macrovascular disease', 'mathematical model', 'noninvasive diagnosis', 'novel', 'pressure', 'prevent']",NIBIB,RESEARCH INST NATIONWIDE CHILDREN'S HOSP,R21,2019,228000,0.10361940959582379
"Estimating Trajectory of Recovery in Cardiac Rehabilitation using Mobile Health Technology and Personalized Machine Learning Project Summary/Abstract The objective of our work leverages mobile health technology to develop machine learning models for longitudinal trajectories of recovery like those needed in cardiac rehabilitation. The investigation uses mobile health technology to quantify trajectories of recovery measures, personalizing understanding of exercise capacity and cardiac function. Exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation programs reduce cardiovascular mortality risks and improve patient outcomes in such longitudinal fashion, through increased exercise capacity as measured by peak V02 improvements over the course of care. These programs have recently been extended to include heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) patients. Despite the reduction in mortality and readmissions, participation and adherence in cardiac rehabilitation programs remains a challenge, especially in underserved communities because of limited program availability, the distance and transportation access to a program, its hours of operation, as well as a lack of diversity and gender-dominated programs. Home-based programs using smartphones have shown to increase adherence and achieve similar outcomes. While home-based programs also improved resting heart rate, systolic blood pressure, and levels of physical activity achieved through metabolic equivalent of tasks and peak V02 at the end of the study, users expressed a desire to have individualized education and treatment. Home-based systems still do not achieve real-time interaction, feedback, and monitoring that center-based rehabilitation does through a lack of feedback and necessity of self-reported exertion values. A system is needed that quantify measures of exercise capacity, which can lead to recovery, dynamically throughout the course of treatment. This proposal develops an unobtrusive system, with new mobile health technology sensors, and trains analytic models that allow for personalized quantification of rehabilitation trajectories in HFrEF patients, which can monitor patient adherence and improvement in measures during exercise as well as while at rest. This system investigates the improvement over the course of a 12-week cardiac rehabilitation study and designs trajectories of recovery to understand improvements in peak V02 and exercise capacity in HFrEF patients by also measuring improvements of measurements of heart rate and blood pressure while at rest. This allows for an investigation of additional measures, over time, that may better quantify recovery in HFrEF patients that can be used for center-based rehabilitation or home-based rehabilitation. This can provide a significant enhancement of metrics that define recovery for HFrEF patients with estimations to metrics that are difficult to collect and evaluate. Project Narrative Quantification of trajectories of recovery for patients through wearable mobile health technologies can provide personal understanding of improvements and challenges faced in recovery by patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. Such a system will indicate to each patient the improvement in exercise capacity needed to continue preventing any recurrent events, allowing participants to have the understanding and individualized feeling they get from clinic visits and center-based cardiac rehabilitation at home or any other location they wish to participate in recovery activities. The exploration of additional markers of recovery can continue to provide quantification of heart failure conditions useful for clinicians and patients alike.",Estimating Trajectory of Recovery in Cardiac Rehabilitation using Mobile Health Technology and Personalized Machine Learning,9809933,R21EB028486,"['Achievement', 'Adherence', 'Behavior', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Pressure', 'Cardiac rehabilitation', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Cellular Phone', 'Characteristics', 'Chest', 'Clinic Visits', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'EFRAC', 'Education', 'Event', 'Exercise', 'Exertion', 'Failure', 'Feedback', 'Feeling', 'Gender', 'Health Technology', 'Heart Rate', 'Heart failure', 'Home environment', 'Hour', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Physical activity', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Proxy', 'Pulse Pressure', 'Recovery', 'Recurrence', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Rest', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'Transportation', 'Update', 'Visit', 'Work', 'Wrist', 'analytical method', 'base', 'compliance behavior', 'design', 'exercise capacity', 'heart function', 'heart rate monitor', 'hospital readmission', 'improved', 'longitudinal analysis', 'mHealth', 'mortality', 'mortality risk', 'novel', 'operation', 'prevent', 'programs', 'rate of change', 'sensor technology', 'smart watch', 'wearable device']",NIBIB,TEXAS ENGINEERING EXPERIMENT STATION,R21,2019,208632,0.013195187817140113
"Validation of Physiologic CPR Quality Using NOn-inVasive Waveform Analytics (CPR-NOVA) Project Abstract  Pediatric cardiac arrest affects thousands of children each year. Progressive heart and lung failure is a predisposing cause in many of these events. Despite improvements in survival outcomes over the past two decades, more than half of these children still do not survive. As new brain injury complicates care among survivors, the burden to these children and the public's health is substantial.  Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) – the medical procedure of providing chest compressions and ventilations during cardiac arrest – saves lives, and higher quality CPR is more effective at doing so. One method to improve CPR quality is through the use of CPR quality monitoring defibrillators. By providing real- time feedback on CPR mechanics targets such as chest compression depth and rate, they represent the best patient care option currently available to improve CPR performance. Unfortunately, most of these devices are either not approved for children or use pads that are too large for many pediatric patients. Thus, current technology limits the benefit of meaningful CPR quality monitoring to a small percentage of the children who suffer a cardiac arrest. Given the strong association between pediatric CPR quality and outcomes, new methods to monitor CPR quality are urgently needed to improve the care of this vulnerable population.  Physiologic-directed CPR is a promising technique that uses the hemodynamic response of the patient to guide the ongoing resuscitation effort. This approach overcomes the technological limitations of existing CPR quality monitoring technology by using data from patient monitors. Unfortunately, because many patients do not have intra-arterial lines in place at the time of arrest to guide CPR, its clinical impact has been limited. To overcome this limitation, the objective of this ancillary application is to leverage the existing infrastructure of the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development-funded Collaborative Pediatric Critical Care Research Network (CPCCRN) and the unique hemodynamic waveform database of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute-funded parent R01 – the ICU-Resuscitation (ICU-RESUS) Project – to validate two noninvasive physiologic CPR monitors applicable to nearly every pediatric cardiac arrest: 1) end-tidal carbon dioxide (ETCO2); and 2) PhotoPlethysmoGraphy (PPG) obtained via pulse oximetry. Using sophisticated machine learning methods, a prospective observational analytic investigation is proposed with the following Aims: 1) Evaluate ETCO2 as a noninvasive CPR quality monitor among children receiving at least 1 minute of CPR in a CPCCRN intensive care unit; and 2) Using novel machine learning classification algorithms, evaluate PPG and other candidate physiologic waveforms as noninvasive CPR quality monitors.  By leveraging the substantial infrastructure of the CPCCRN, the novel hemodynamic waveform database of ICU-RESUS, and advanced machine learning analytics, this submission represents a unique opportunity to validate two noninvasive physiologic pediatric CPR quality monitors to improve clinical care and save lives. !

"Prospective Slice Tracking for Cardiac MRI Project Summary/Abstract Cardiac Magnetic Resonance (CMR) provides arguably the most comprehensive evaluation of the cardiovascular system; however, respiratory motion continues to adversely impact CMR, causing artifacts that lead to poor image quality, repeated scans, and decreased throughput, and thus represents a significant obstacle to clinical utility. For single-shot CMR, cardiac and breathing motions are “frozen” by limiting the acquisition to an end-diastolic window less than 200 ms. For first pass perfusion, breathing motion cannot be eliminated because data from 50 to 60 consecutive heartbeats are required to capture contrast dynamics. For other single-shot applications such as late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) and parameter mapping, respiratory motion is introduced when the acquisition is repeated across several heartbeats to improve spatial and temporal resolution. To eliminate respiratory motion from single-shot images, non-rigid motion correction (MOCO) has been promoted as an attractive option that provides 100% acquisition efficiently. MOCO can be used either after the reconstruction or during the reconstruction. Such techniques, however, cannot account for through-plane motion, which can only be corrected prospectively, and can fail depending on image quality and the extent of motion. Prospective compensation of the respiratory motion has been recognized as an attractive alternative to existing gating and MOCO methods. Proposed methods use one or more navigator echoes—incompatible with or inefficient for many CMR protocols—to capture the respiratory motion and rely on simple parametric models that are inadequate to describe complex respiratory-induced cardiac motion. Due to these limitations, prospective methods have found limited applicability even in research settings. We propose a new framework to prospectively compensate respiratory motion. The proposed method, called PROspective Motion compensation using Pilot Tone (PROMPT), employs Pilot Tone technology and leverages machine learning principles to first learn complex respiratory-induced cardiac motion on a patient-specific basis and then prospectively compensate the motion by tracking the imaging plane, in real time, as a function of a Pilot Tone based respiratory signal. If successful, this synergistic combination of Pilot Tone and machine learning will lead to 100% efficiency for single-shot CMR exams performed under free-breathing conditions, will eliminate the need to setup navigator echoes, respiratory bellows, or other inefficient prospective gating measures, will minimize through-plane motion that can render the images non-diagnostic for CMR applications including fast-pass perfusion, parameter mapping, LGE, and coronary angiography, will provide a reliable surrogate measure of respiratory motion, and will facilitate highly accelerated compressive recovery. Project Narrative Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) has many potential advantages over currently used imaging methods to diagnose heart disease, but MRI images can be ruined if the patient breathes during the scan. In this project, we will develop a method that is insensitive to breathing motion and compare it to existing methods. These efforts should lead to significant improvements in diagnosis of heart disease so that patients may benefit from appropriate treatment.",Prospective Slice Tracking for Cardiac MRI,9762101,R21EB026657,"['Anatomy', 'Breathing', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Coronary Angiography', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Diagnosis', 'Evaluation', 'Financial compensation', 'Freezing', 'Gadolinium', 'Heart Diseases', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Patients', 'Perfusion', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Protocols documentation', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Respiration', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Slice', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'artificial neural network', 'base', 'computerized data processing', 'data acquisition', 'healthy volunteer', 'heart motion', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'prospective', 'reconstruction', 'respiratory', 'technology development', 'temporal measurement', 'volunteer']",NIBIB,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,R21,2019,223680,0.03406563604626174
"The Impact of Cocaine Abstinence or Reduced Use on Radiomic Features of Noncalcified Coronary Plaques in HIV-Infected Cocaine Users with Silent Coronary Artery Disease ABSTRACT Despite the success of antiretroviral therapy (ART), individuals living with HIV experience an increased risk of coronary artery disease (CAD). Although increased arterial inflammation on 18F-FDG-PET was shown to be associated with high risk plaque features (HRPFs) in those with HIV and subclinical atherosclerosis, there is no evidence of increased arterial inflammation in optimally treated HIV-infected adults with full viral suppression, low cardiovascular risk and no known CAD when the imaging results are compared to those from HIV- uninfected controls. These findings suggest that HIV-associated atherosclerosis may be triggered by factors other than HIV-associated inflammation such as traditional cardiovascular risk factors or cocaine use. Other evidence indicates that cocaine is associated with coronary atherosclerosis. It was also shown that cocaine use modifies the effect of HIV on subclinical coronary atherosclerosis. Supported by DA035632, this research team enrolled 102 daily cocaine users (including 84 HIV-infected) with contrast-enhanced coronary CT angiography (CCTA)-confirmed significant (>50% in diameter) coronary stenosis, and employed a cash- incentive approach to systematically reinforce cocaine abstinence. The study demonstrated that continued cocaine use led to coronary plaque volume progression, while abstinent or reduced cocaine use led to plaque volume regression. However, whether cocaine use influences plaque characteristics in HIV-infected cocaine users has not been investigated. Plaque characteristics are important because rupture-prone coronary plaques might not necessarily be only those, which cause obstructive stenosis, and that HRPFs are independent of the severity of coronary artery luminal stenosis. However, identification of the strongest predictor of CAD among four HRPFs, the napkin-ring sign (NRS), at present, is based only on expert subjective opinion. A landmark cardiovascular radiomics study calculated 4,440 radiomic features for each coronary plaque and identified a subset of these parameters which predicted NRS, a qualitative feature of prognostic imaging marker of acute coronary syndrome. It is quite possible that with the cardiac radiomic approach, the association between cocaine use and this critical biomarker will be further clarified. The objective of the proposed study is to examine whether cocaine use influences plaque features in HIV-infected cocaine users. The proposed study will perform radiomic analyses on the imaging data from 102 participants on DA035632. The specific aims of this study are: (1) To examine whether continued cocaine use is associated with the NRS and its associated radiomic features in HIV-infected cocaine users with significant coronary plaques, (2) To examine whether abstinent or reduced cocaine use ameliorated NRS and its associated radiomic features in HIV-infected cocaine users with significant coronary plaques, (3) To compare NRS and its associated radiomic features between HIV infected and uninfected participants, and (4) To validate the findings generated from this study.

"Automated quantitative CT imaging of epicardial adipose tissue and risk of cardiac events PROJECT SUMMARY Coronary artery disease remains the leading cause of death worldwide, and more than half of the individuals suffering acute myocardial infarction have no prior symptoms. Coronary calcium scoring with non-contrast CT is increasingly used for cardiovascular risk stratification in the asymptomatic population. Epicardial adipose tissue (EAT), a local visceral fat depot surrounding the heart, has been recently reported as a significant imaging biomarker for cardiovascular risk stratification. Despite being routinely imaged noninvasively by non-contrast cardiac CT for coronary calcium scoring, EAT features are currently not measured or reported, primarily due to the absence of robust, automated quantification methods.  We propose to employ novel image processing algorithms to achieve fully automated, robust quantification of EAT features from cardiac CT, and to apply machine learning methods to efficiently combine patient clinical data, coronary calcium and EAT features into a new integrated risk score to predict future cardiac events. We will evaluate this risk score in two existing, prospective registries of asymptomatic patients with available coronary calcium scans, clinical data, and followup for cardiac events (myocardial infarction, cardiac death, late revascularization). These rich resources are: the Early Identification of Subclinical Atherosclerosis Using Non-Invasive Imaging Research [EISNER] registry (2614 patients) and the St. Francis Heart Study (4613 patients). We propose three specific aims: 1) To develop and evaluate the accuracy and reproducibility of new computational algorithms for automated quantification of EAT measures; 2) To evaluate the prognostic value of automatically-quantified EAT features, relative to atherosclerotic plaque burden and measures of obesity, for the prediction of future cardiac events in asymptomatic patients in the EISNER registry and the St. Francis Heart Study; 3) To derive and evaluate a new, integrated risk score—combining standard risk factors, coronary calcium score and EAT measures using machine learning—for the prediction of future cardiac events in the EISNER registry, and further, to additionally evaluate this risk score externally in the St. Francis Heart Study patient cohort.  This work in this proposal will provide a novel, personalized paradigm that will objectively and accurately identify asymptomatic patients undergoing coronary calcium scanning who are at increased risk for future cardiac events, without any additional imaging or risk to the patient. PROJECT NARRATIVE (lay language) CT scanning of the heart for coronary calcium scoring is a simple, widely-used, low-cost test with low radiation dose. Using these scans, the researchers propose to establish automated analysis of fat which surrounds the heart, as well as novel computerized scores that identify the patients who are at highest risk of suffering a heart attack. This new research will allow doctors to better identify patients for whom appropriate treatment could be prescribed, to avoid a heart attack or sudden cardiac death.",Automated quantitative CT imaging of epicardial adipose tissue and risk of cardiac events,9688580,R01HL133616,"['Acute myocardial infarction', 'Adipose tissue', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Arterial Fatty Streak', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Death', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Categories', 'Cause of Death', 'Clinical Data', 'Cohort Studies', 'Computational algorithm', 'Coronary', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Coronary artery', 'Data', 'Development', 'Dose', 'Early identification', 'Event', 'Expressed Sequence Tags', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Future', 'Heart', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Inflammation Mediators', 'Institution', 'Interleukin-1 beta', 'Interleukin-6', 'Language', 'Length', 'Lipids', 'Low Dose Radiation', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Obesity', 'Patients', 'Population', 'Reader', 'Registries', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk stratification', 'Scanning', 'Source', 'Standardization', 'Stenosis', 'Symptoms', 'TNF gene', 'Testing', 'Trees', 'Visceral fat', 'Woman', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'automated analysis', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'computerized', 'coronary artery calcium', 'coronary calcium scoring', 'coronary vasculature', 'cost', 'density', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'heart imaging', 'high risk', 'image processing', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'indexing', 'learning strategy', 'men', 'non-invasive imaging', 'novel', 'pericardial sac', 'predictive marker', 'prognostic value', 'prospective', 'routine imaging', 'sudden cardiac death']",NHLBI,CEDARS-SINAI MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2019,653101,0.15439013792027523
"Automatic quantification of myocardial motion in older adults Abstract  Heart failure (HF) is a common condition that represents the end stage of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) subsequent to progressing myocardial damage or ischemia. In populations at ages 65 and older, coronary artery disease (CAD) serves as the leading cause of HF. Although low left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction (EF) is a major evidence for the diagnosis of HF in clinical practice, impaired regional myocardial dysfunction is expected to present the existence of CAD in its early stage.  Heart deformation analysis (HDA) is a cutting-edge myocardial motion analysis technique that is able to automatically track the myocardium borders on time frames and calculate global and regional cardiac functional and motional indices on existing cine images without extra scans. In the present study, we will use the HDA tool to analyze existing cine images of CHARISMA study. From 2009 to 2012, cardiac MRI exams (including coronary wall imaging and cine MRI at two-chamber, four-chamber and short-axis views) and concurrent tests for traditional cardiovascular risk factors were performed on 440 older participants (age: 65 - 84 years old at the time of MRI scans) without documented history of CVDs. During the present R03 project (2019-2021), CHARISMA participants would have been followed-up for 10 - 12 years. We plan to relate newly- acquired regional myocardial motion indices (displacement, velocity, strain and strain rate) to clinical outcomes, existing coronary wall measures and results of lab tests in CHARISMA datasets. We will test the overall hypothesis that regional myocardial motion indices have the potential to present cardiovascular risk in asymptomatic elderly. Three specific aims are: 1) Predict cardiovascular events using baseline regional myocardial motion indices; 2) Relate regional myocardial motion indices to MRI-derived features of coronary remodeling; and 3) Determine correlations between regional myocardial motion indices and traditional cardiovascular risk biomarkers/conditions collected in CHARISMA study.  No new MRI scans or lab tests are required in this project. Through a cost-effective approach, the immediate objective of the proposed project is to evaluate the clinical value of regional myocardial motion for cardiovascular risk stratification in asymptomatic older adults, a major target population of cardiovascular prevention. This study will also help us better understand the correlations between impaired myocardial function/motion and subclinical CAD burden. Furthermore, the results will facilitate the selection of quantitative imaging biomarkers and their optimal cut-off points for predicting cardiovascular events in future clinical studies. Project Narrative  In the present study, we will use heart deformation analysis (HDA) to reanalyze existing cardiac MRI data of CHARISMA study.

"Blood and Urine Biomarkers for Predicting Long-Term Adverse Kidney and Cardiovascular Outcomes after Cardiac Surgery PROJECT SUMMARY In the United States over 500,000 cardiac surgeries are performed annually. Postoperative acute kidney injury (AKI) occurs in ~20% of cardiac surgical patients. Several cohort and registry studies have reported that AKI defined by rise in serum creatinine after cardiac surgery associates with development of chronic kidney disease and cardiovascular events. However, it is unclear which patients will develop long-term adverse kidney events, adverse cardiovascular events, or both. In recent years blood and urine AKI biomarkers have been identified that reflect different aspects of AKI biology and that detect serum creatinine defined AKI earlier than rise in serum creatinine or detect subclinical AKI that is not revealed by traditional serum creatinine assessment. Clinical outcomes and biomarker research has focused mainly on detecting cardiac surgery- associated AKI itself, but not on predicting which patients are at greatest risk for long-term adverse kidney and cardiovascular outcomes after AKI. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that perioperative blood and urine AKI biomarkers significantly associate with increased long-term (2 to 5 years) postoperative major adverse kidney events (MAKE) and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE). MAKE is defined as the composite of dialysis, death, renal hospitalization, or ≥ 30 day postoperative eGFR decline >25% from preoperative baseline. MACE is defined as the composite of death or hospitalizations for heart failure, myocardial infarction, coronary revascularization, arrhythmia, or stroke. We propose a prospective observational cohort study of 610 patients undergoing cardiac surgery at UT Southwestern Medical Center who will be followed for a minimum of 2 years and up to 5 years following cardiac surgery. Based on preliminary data we will assess plasma NT-pro- B-type natriuretic peptide, plasma intact fibroblast growth factor 23, serum cystatin C, urine TIMP-2*IGFBP7, and urine Kidney Injury Molecule-1 AKI biomarkers preoperatively and at 5 postoperative time points. This proposal will address three specific aims: 1) To determine the association between in-hospital AKI biomarkers and occurrence of MAKE during long-term follow-up; 2) To determine the association between in-hospital AKI biomarkers and occurrence of MACE during long-term follow-up; and 3) To develop clinical prediction models for long-term MAKE and MACE after cardiac surgery. In addition to traditional regression modeling, we will use machine learning that leverages detailed perioperative data including time-varying intraoperative and intensive care unit clinical data and blood and urine AKI biomarker data to create high performing prediction models. Our proposal is significant because knowing what blood and urine AKI biomarkers and clinical parameters accurately predict long-term major adverse kidney and cardiovascular outcomes after cardiac surgery provides the foundation for clinical trials that will identify effective short and long-term interventions for patients at highest risk. Our proposal is innovative because clinical and biomarker data has not been leveraged in this way to predict long-term MAKE and MACE after cardiac surgery. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research is relevant to public health because combining blood and urine acute kidney injury biomarkers and clinical data to identify cardiac surgical patients at highest risk for long-term major adverse kidney and cardiovascular outcomes will allow interventional studies to better individualize clinical management to prevent these outcomes. While acute kidney injury after cardiac surgery is associated with increased long-term adverse kidney and cardiovascular outcomes (~25% incidence), it remains unclear which patients with postoperative acute kidney injury are at highest risk. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to the NIH's mission to develop fundamental knowledge that can be applied to enhancing health, lengthening life, and reducing illness and disability.",Blood and Urine Biomarkers for Predicting Long-Term Adverse Kidney and Cardiovascular Outcomes after Cardiac Surgery,9800334,R01HL148448,"['Acute Renal Failure with Renal Papillary Necrosis', 'Address', 'Anesthesiology', 'Angiotensin Receptor', 'Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors', 'Applications Grants', 'Arrhythmia', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Biometry', 'Blood', 'Brain natriuretic peptide', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Surgery procedures', 'Cardiac rehabilitation', 'Cardiology', 'Cardiopulmonary Bypass', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cohort Studies', 'Computational Science', 'Coronary', 'Creatinine', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Dialysis procedure', 'Dose', 'Enrollment', 'Event', 'Foundations', 'Foxes', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Heart failure', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Incidence', 'Information Systems', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Intraoperative Care', 'Kidney', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Literature', 'Longterm Follow-up', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Nephrology', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Perioperative', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Plasma', 'Postoperative Period', 'Prospective Studies', 'Prospective cohort study', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Questionnaires', 'Records', 'Registries', 'Regression Analysis', 'Renal function', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Serum', 'Source', 'Stroke', 'Time', 'Transfusion', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Urine', 'base', 'biobank', 'clinical biomarkers', 'cohort', 'design', 'disability', 'fibroblast growth factor 23', 'health record', 'hemodynamics', 'high risk', 'innovation', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'post gamma-globulins', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'rat KIM-1 protein']",NHLBI,UT SOUTHWESTERN MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2019,802772,0.07975365375524064
"HLS-Cardiac Safety AI Trained Human Heart and Micro Heart Model HLS17-12. The US FDA is considering to establish a new cardiac safety assessment approach  defined by a new paradigm called, “Comprehensive in vitro Proarrhythmia Assay (CIPA)”. The CIPA will 1) assess drug effects on each cardiac ion channel type individually using a high- throughput assay ion channel assays, 2) compute net effect on repolarization and risks for  torsade pointes (TdP) using a mathematical model, and 3) confirm the computational prediction by measuring the drug’s effects on action potentials in induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) derived human cardiac myocytes (CMs). This paradigm shift, if successful, could reduce the cost of  cardiac safety analyses by replacing or lowering the requirement to perform an expensive ($2-4 million) thorough QT study during clinical trials. Protecting consumers from drug induced  arrhythmia and sudden deaths is a paramount importance for the regulators and pharmaceutical companies as well as lowing the cost of drug development. Many cardiac safety scientists, however, are skeptical about CIPA’s approach since CMs derived from human iPSCs exhibit a poor excitation-contraction coupling due to their immaturity. In addition, a proposed CIPA mathematical model was developed to simulate electrophysiology of human adult CMs, so there is a mismatch between experimental system and computational tool. To address these concerns, we proposed three specific aims in tw0 phases by following Fast- Track SBIR processes. Phase I feasibility Aim 1 will measure drug-induced changes in AP and CaT using human adult heart slices isolated from human donors. Here we will confirm our  successful handling and analyzing human adult heart slices, which will be based on a recently  published protocol by our collaborator, Dr. Igor Efimov, at George Washington University. After this validation, we will move on to perform the following two studies: Aim 2. Compare drug-induced changes in AP and CaT in NuHearts generated from adult CMs and cardiac fibroblasts from same human donor hearts; Aim 3. Validate and improve the computational models and train an artificial intelligence to predict cardiac safety risks of unknow compounds. After our successful completion proposed projects, we can establish an unprecedented cardiac safety assessment platform that can predict safety issues using a well-trained AI without doing any experiments using human heart slices that are rarely accessible for most of the safety  laboratories or biotech firms. Because nearly one third of drug candidates fails to reach market due to its cardiac safety concerns, a better safety assessment approach without increasing its cost is needed to improve productivity of pharmaceutical industry. The proposed project combines computational and experimental analyses of cardiac safety parameters using adult heart cells isolated from a donor heart and its stem cell derived heart muscle cells to build a better but cost-effective cardiac safety assessment system. A successfully validated system enables drug developers to arcuately predict a new drug’s cardiac safety profile by only running cost-effective experiments using stem cell derived heart muscle cells that are accessible to many drug developers.",HLS-Cardiac Safety AI Trained Human Heart and Micro Heart Model,9764845,R44HL139248,"['3-Dimensional', 'Action Potentials', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Arrhythmia', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biological Assay', 'Biomedical Research', 'Biotechnology', 'Calcium', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Myocytes', 'Cardiotoxicity', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communities', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer Simulation', 'Contracts', 'Coupling', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Development', 'Dose', 'Drug Costs', 'Drug Industry', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Exhibits', 'Expert Systems', 'Fibroblasts', 'Gene Expression', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Guidelines', 'Heart', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Ion Channel', 'Laboratories', 'Libraries', 'Marketing', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Mitochondria', 'Modeling', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Pharmacology', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physiology', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Preclinical Testing', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Productivity', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publishing', 'Pump', 'Reproducibility', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Safety', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Shipping', 'Ships', 'Slice', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Stem cells', 'Sudden Death', 'System', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Washington', 'Work', 'base', 'cardiac tissue engineering', 'commercialization', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'drug candidate', 'drug development', 'drug discovery', 'experimental analysis', 'experimental study', 'heart cell', 'heart preservation', 'high throughput screening', 'human data', 'improved', 'in vitro Assay', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'mathematical model', 'novel therapeutics', 'personalized medicine', 'response', 'safety assessment', 'screening', 'side effect', 'simulation', 'success']",NHLBI,"INVIVOSCIENCES, INC.",R44,2019,881652,0.091176379434087
"Cardiac Electrical Instability in Posttraumatic Stress Disorder: A Twin Study PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a chronic disabling psychiatric condition characterized by a persistent maladaptive reaction to the exposure to severe psychological stress, including trauma re-experiencing, hypervigilance, and hyperarousal. Our group has conducted seminal work to establish PTSD as a risk factor for coronary heart disease and autonomic dysfunction. A major concern, based on these findings, is that PTSD could increases the risk of ventricular arrhythmia and sudden cardiac death (SCD) through autonomic dysregulation. This has important clinical implications on management of cardiovascular risk in PTSD. Two important metrics that are potentially useful for risk stratification are T-wave alternans (TWA) and Morphological Beat Variability (MVB). We have found in preliminary investigations that TWA may be linked to acute stress and PTSD, but additional study is needed. In this R03 application, we seek to collaborate with Dr. Gari Clifford in Biomedical Informatics to create a custom program that measures TWA and MVB with state-of- the-art signal processing in a recently recruited cohort of male veteran twins with high-resolution ECG data. We will also study for genetic influences with twin modeling and the effects of acute stress with laboratory- based trauma reminder challenges. Our aims are to 1) Examine the relationship of PTSD with MVB and TWA a) over 24 hours, and b) during trauma recall challenge; 2) Evaluate the potential role for familial and genetic factors by comparing the within-pair difference in MVB and TWA between monozygotic and dizygotic twin pairs discordant for PTSD. We hypothesize that MVB and TWA will be higher, on average, during a 24 hour period, and will increase during trauma recall challenge in PTSD subjects compared to those without PTSD. In addition, we hypothesize that the relationship of PTSD with MVB and TWA will be stronger within DZ pairs than MZ pairs, implying that there is a common genetic pathway linking PTSD and SCD risk. The development of methods to measure these factors, as well as the study of these important mechanisms, will accelerate Dr. Shah’s progress towards research independence, and help to establish him as an expert in the field of mental stress and SCD. PROJECT NARRATIVE Posttraumatic stress disorder is a common and debilitating psychiatric condition that is associated with increased heart disease risk. Whether or not this means that it increases the risk of ventricular arrhythmia is not known, but important for clinical management. To study this, we aim to examine the risk of PTSD and its symptoms on electrocardiographic markers of sudden cardiac death.",Cardiac Electrical Instability in Posttraumatic Stress Disorder: A Twin Study,9723857,R03HL146879,"['3-Dimensional', 'Acute', 'Algorithms', 'Ambulatory Monitoring', 'Arrhythmia', 'Autonomic Dysfunction', 'Award', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Electrophysiologic Techniques', 'Charge', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Coronary heart disease', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Dizygotic Twins', 'EKG QRS Complex', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Emotional Stress', 'Evaluation', 'Exposure to', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genetic study', 'High Prevalence', 'Hour', 'Individual', 'International', 'Investigation', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Monozygotic twins', 'Morphology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Prevalence', 'Psyche structure', 'Psychological Stress', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Reaction', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk stratification', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Seminal', 'Stress', 'Symptoms', 'Tachyarrhythmias', 'Testing', 'Trauma', 'Twin Multiple Birth', 'Twin Studies', 'Ventricular', 'Ventricular Arrhythmia', 'Veterans', 'Viola', 'Visit', 'War', 'Work', 'acute stress', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'cohort', 'design', 'experience', 'heart disease risk', 'heart rate variability', 'high risk', 'improved', 'insight', 'interest', 'male', 'method development', 'mortality risk', 'novel', 'programs', 'recruit', 'signal processing', 'sudden cardiac death', 'traumatic event', 'vector']",NHLBI,EMORY UNIVERSITY,R03,2019,78000,0.043135556639212064
"Systems Biology Analysis of Cardiac Electrical Activity and Arrhythmias. Cardiac arrhythmias are a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States. Abnormalities in heart rate, cardiac conduction (PR and QRS) and repolarization (QT) measured on the ECG predispose to the clinically important cardiac arrhythmias of atrial fibrillation (AF) and ventricular fibrillation (VF) / sudden cardiac death (SCD). We examine the genomic basis of these ECG endophenotypes in order to deconstruct arrhythmias into more proximate traits and discrete components, allowing us to better understand underlying mechanisms, provide insight into arrhythmia generation, and help target development of novel therapies.  The molecular architecture of cardiac electrical activity and arrhythmias is not fully understood, but likely involves genomic, epigenomic, and environmental influences. Over the past 10 years, we have identified numerous common loci associated with cardiac electrical activity and arrhythmias, yet these common variants account for only a portion of the heritability of electrophysiologic and arrhythmic phenotypes. The agnostic examination of genotype-phenotype associations employed in genome- wide association studies (GWAS) does not incorporate knowledge of functional genomic regions or important biologic relationships. Additionally, we currently lack an understanding of the molecular mechanisms connecting mostly intergenic and intronic GWAS signals to phenotype. We therefore hypothesize that a systems biology approach integrating genetic sequence variation with omic data (epigenomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic data) will uncover novel associations and elucidate biologic mechanisms associated with arrhythmia-related phenotypes. We further hypothesize that examining the simultaneous association between sequence variation and multiple cardiac electrophysiologic phenotypes will help uncover additional novel mechanisms associated with cardiac electrical activity and arrhythmias.  TOPMed's combination of rich phenotype data, with whole genome sequence (WGS), epigenomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic data, provides a unique opportunity to more comprehensively explore these hypotheses. We leverage sequence, omic, and phenotype data from multiple cohort studies to efficiently and cost-effectively examine and dissect association of omic factors with cardiac electrophysiology and arrhythmia risk. Our application is an ambitious yet eminently feasible effort that integrates clinical, genetic, and systems biology expertise. We aim to discover associations using omics data (Aims 1 and 2) and elucidate specific genes and biologic pathways underlying these associations (Aims 3 and 4). Our ultimate goal is to identify pathways, genes, and genetic variation that are clinically relevant, and therefore potentially the target of new therapies, diagnostics, or risk predictions. Narrative Cardiac arrhythmias are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States. This proposal aims to use genomic, epigenomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic data, combined with complex systems biology and pleiotropic analyses, to better understand the underlying pathways and genes involved in normal electrophysiology and arrhythmia formation. The identification of biologic factors that influence cardiac electrical activity and arrhythmias will provide insight into the mechanisms of arrhythmia generation, and perhaps identify better targets for drug development and prevention.",Systems Biology Analysis of Cardiac Electrical Activity and Arrhythmias.,9737693,R01HL141989,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Architecture', 'Arrhythmia', 'Atrial Fibrillation', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Biological', 'Biological Factors', 'Biological Process', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Electrophysiologic Techniques', 'Clinical', 'Cohort Studies', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Drug Targeting', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genomic Segment', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Genotype-Tissue Expression Project', 'Goals', 'Grouping', 'Heart', 'Heart Rate', 'Heritability', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Medical Genetics', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Multiomic Data', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Regulator Genes', 'Risk', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Systems Biology', 'Testing', 'Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine', 'United States', 'Variant', 'Ventricular Fibrillation', 'base', 'causal variant', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinically relevant', 'cost', 'drug development', 'endophenotype', 'epigenomics', 'functional genomics', 'genome wide association study', 'heart electrical activity', 'insight', 'mortality', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'phenotypic data', 'pleiotropism', 'rare variant', 'sudden cardiac death', 'trait', 'transcriptomics', 'whole genome']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2019,490901,0.08323112777449669
"Cardiovascular Imaging in Ischemic Heart Disease Project Summary/Abstract The applicant Udo Hoffmann MD MPH is a Professor of Radiology at Harvard Medical School and the Chief of the Division for Cardiovascular Imaging in the Department of Radiology at MGH. Dr. Hoffmann has established a patient oriented research (POR) program that combines innovative translational, clinical, and outcomes research methods to demonstrate the value of advanced cardiovascular imaging. Dr. Hoffmann has published approximately 380 peer reviewed papers, among them many in premier medical journals and has received continued independent, peer-reviewed POR NIH funding since 2005. He is among the very few faculty members at Harvard Medical School who are both the PI and Director of a highly successful NHLBI funded T- 32 program (Cardiac MR and CT Research) and a recipient of a K24. Dr. Hoffmann has successfully mentored more than 60 clinical investigators, most of which currently hold faculty positions in major academic centers and actively perform POR. Moreover, Dr. Hoffmann has successfully accomplished all mentoring and scientific goals of the first K24 award period. Overall, these achievements document Dr. Hoffmann's long standing passion and commitment to POR. His excellent publication, funding, and mentoring record together with his current and planned research support provide an excellent foundation to accomplish the aims of this competitive renewal of the K24 Award “Cardiovascular Imaging in Ischemic Heart Disease”. Dr. Hoffmann proposes a mentoring and research plan that utilizes the synergies of past, ongoing, and future highly innovative independent research projects with educational and training opportunities offered by the cardiac MR CT PET Program, the T32 training program in cardiovascular imaging, the Harvard CTSA, and the Harvard School of Public Health. The specific aims addressing the charge of the K24 Award are to enable Dr. Hoffmann to: 1) dedicate 25% of his time to mentor clinical investigators based on NIH or equivalent funded projects in “Cardiovascular Imaging in Ischemic Heart Disease”, 2) to mentor junior and mid-career clinical investigators with the goal to develop them into clinical researchers who can successfully compete for peer reviewed grants, and 3) to continue to expand a POR program that combines translational, clinical, and outcomes research to develop future leaders in clinical research in cardiovascular imaging and beyond. The research plan encompasses four specific aims: 1) To determine the effects of statin treatment on coronary atherosclerosis in HIV patients in 800 patients with HIV randomized to statin therapy vs. placebo, 2) To determine whether high risk coronary plaque predicts cardiovascular events in 4600 patients with clinical suspicion of CAD, 3) To determine the cost effectiveness of CT FFR in patients with stable and acute chest pain, and 4) To use Radiomics to identify novel imaging markers predicting cardiovascular events in participants of the Framingham Heart Study.

"Gastrointestinal Safety of Antithrombotic Drug Regimens ABSTRACT Patients with atrial fibrillation, post-acute coronary syndrome and venous thromboembolism are prescribed antithrombotic drugs (antiplatelet agents and oral anticoagulants) in dual and triple combinations. These drugs independently cause gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) from mucosal defects or vascular abnormalities of the gastrointestinal tract. Cardiac patients are the fastest growing at-risk group due to the rapidly aging US population, their high-burden of co-morbidity, frequent antithrombotic polypharmacy and prescription of new antithrombotic drugs with higher incidence of GI adverse events. The real-world GIB risk of antithrombotic agents used in combination in a diverse cardiac population has yet to be characterized. Furthermore, we have previously demonstrated poor performance of existing risk scores (HAS-BLED, CHA2DS2-VASC etc.) for the prediction of non- warfarin antithrombotic drug bleeding; scores frequently used in the clinical setting despite their inaccuracy. Absence of knowledge regarding the real-world risk of antithrombotic-GIB, and the inability to accurately predict which patients will bleed, hampers patient counselling regarding a frequently occurring adverse event which is known to cause morbidity and mortality among cardiac patients. We propose to fill this knowledge gap by quantifying GIB risk in a large, geographically diverse cohort of elderly and non-elderly cardiac patients with atrial fibrillation, venous thromboembolism or post-acute coronary syndrome. GIB associated with antithrombotic drug combinations will be stratified by underlying cardiac conditions; incidence rates (events/100 patient-years) and propensity-matched Cox proportional models (with 95% confidence intervals) will be used to estimate outcome. We will examine heterogeneity of safety effects related to age, chronic co-morbidity, and hepatic or renal dysfunction. Machine learning techniques will then be used to derive and validate a highly sensitive algorithm for the prediction of antithrombotic-related GIB. Discovery of such an algorithm is the first step in the future application of a predictive model in any evidence-based clinical delivery platform, such as a decision rule or risk calculator. NARRATIVE Gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) in cardiac patients is common, deadly and on the rise due to an older population, antiplatelet and anticoagulant drugs used in combination, and availability of new drugs with higher GIB risk than their predecessors. Lack of data regarding the magnitude of GIB and limited knowledge of which patients are most at risk, prevents accurate counselling regarding cardiac drug safety. We will quantify this risk, study risk factors; and use machine learning techniques to derive and validate a clinical algorithm to better predict at-risk patients.",Gastrointestinal Safety of Antithrombotic Drug Regimens,9692475,R01HS025402,[' '],AHRQ,MAYO CLINIC ARIZONA,R01,2019,394737,0.07364789180476361
"Scalable platform for optimizing human cardiac tissue engineering via optical pacing and on-demand oxygenation PROJECT SUMMARY Induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (iPS-CM) are emerging as an invaluable in vitro human experimental platform for disease modeling, drug discovery, cardiotoxicity screening, gene editing and functional genomics. For the first time, cardiac electrophysiology has access to a scalable human experimental model, which, currently, offers the only path to personalized (cardiac) medicine as patient-derived iPS-CMs can be generated on a progressively faster time scale. The clear potential of this technology motivates efforts to address the main criticisms facing iPS-CMs, namely the need for further maturation and reduction of phenotype heterogeneity. As multiple approaches are being pursued to improve iPS-CM maturation and to approximate the functionality of the adult human myocardium, we argue that combinatorial optimizations necessitate new high-throughput (HT) technology and automation. The overall goal of this project is to develop and validate a scalable platform for optimizing cardiac tissue engineering via chronic reconfigurable optical pacing and “on-demand” oxygenation for gaining mechanistic insights into cardiac metabolism and electrophysiology, a platform we call ChROME. Chronic electrical stimulation is a viable lead to iPS-CM maturation, yet it has remained under-explored, specifically as related to the role of mass transport and oxygenation during such stimulation. Leveraging our expertise in the theoretical and experimental use of optogenetic tools for cardiac applications (Entcheva) and automation (Kostov, Li, Entcheva, Kay), we propose to design and validate the first-generation HT-ChROME platform, that will integrate continuous monitoring of key physiological parameters. Our team’s expertise in optical oxygen sensing (Kostov), in-house manufacturing of “on-demand” oxygenation nanocarriers (perfluorocarbons, PFC) (Kay) and metabolic characterization (Kay, Beard) will be applied to address the increased metabolic demands during stimulation. The ability to quantify “functional maturation” by relevant measures (voltage, calcium, contraction) in a high-throughput manner (Entcheva) in 2D and 3D cardiac tissue constructs (Vunjak-Novakovic), using our automated platform OptoDyCE (all-optical dynamic cardiac electrophysiology) is critical in this undertaking. Employing these HT tools and other imaging and omics modalities (Popratiloff, Horvath), we will elucidate the spectrum of responses triggered by chronic stimulation of iPS-CMs: beneficial/maturation effects vs. pathological overload effects, depending on load and oxygenation conditions. The proposed HT-ChROME platform represents a critical step in resolving issues impeding progress with iPS-CMs to accelerate their wide-spread adoption in basic and translational applications. The obtained large-scale data will inform a new generation of biophysical models linking human cardiac metabolism and electrophysiology. PROJECT NARRATIVE Recent advances in stem-cell technology enable patient-derived cells to be turned into functional heart cells, and this is an exciting direction towards personalized medicine; yet, there are many challenges in optimizing these cardiomyocytes to better mimic the real heart – a problem that the proposed engineering tools will help resolve.",Scalable platform for optimizing human cardiac tissue engineering via optical pacing and on-demand oxygenation,9687111,R01HL144157,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Adoption', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Automation', 'Biological', 'Calcium', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Electrophysiologic Techniques', 'Cardiac Myocytes', 'Cardiotoxicity', 'Cells', 'Chronic', 'Combinatorial Optimization', 'Data', 'Disease model', 'Electric Stimulation', 'Engineering', 'Event', 'Experimental Models', 'Fluorocarbons', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Heart', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hip region structure', 'Human', 'Human Engineering', 'Image', 'In Vitro', 'Incubators', 'Lead', 'Light', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Mediating', 'Medicine', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'Mitochondria', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Myocardium', 'NADH', 'Optics', 'Oxygen', 'Oxygen Consumption', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Physiological', 'Regression Analysis', 'Role', 'Site', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissue Engineering', 'Tissues', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Viral', 'Work', 'biophysical model', 'cardiac tissue engineering', 'design', 'drug discovery', 'functional genomics', 'heart cell', 'heart metabolism', 'high throughput technology', 'improved', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'insight', 'machine learning algorithm', 'nanocarrier', 'optogenetics', 'personalized medicine', 'programs', 'response', 'screening', 'side effect', 'stem cell technology', 'tool', 'transcriptomics', 'voltage']",NHLBI,GEORGE WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,728876,0.10135763982709271
"Network for Cardiothoracic Surgical Investigations in Cardiovascular Medicine Project Summary Cardiac surgery has been a highly innovative field of medicine. The introduction of major innovations, and ongoing incremental change in existing ones, have extended survival and improved quality of life for many patients suffering from cardiac disease. A rapid pace of innovation requires a rigorous infrastructure for clinical evaluation that provides timely assessments of the value of new and modified treatments. The Cardiothoracic Surgical Trials Network (CTSN) was created to provide a rigorous evidence base tor the surgical treatment of cardiothoracic disease. The International Center for Health Outcomes and Innovation Research (InCHOIR) enthusiastically embraces the opportunity to continue to work in partnership with clinical investigators and the NIH as the CTSN DCC. The Network has developed a rich research agenda for the renewal that includes trials of novel neuroprotective agents, long-term antithrombotic strategies, new regenerative medicine therapies, and surgical approaches to valvular disease, heart failure and atrial fibrillation. Given our long-standing interest and experience in the design and analysis of cardiac surgery multicenter studies, we are in a strong position to serve as the coordinating center for this vital clinical research effort. In particular, we will provide leadership in designing novel trials that optimize sample size, include patient- centered as well as clinical endpoints, and collect data from a variety of sources, including electronic data capture systems, mobile apps and wearable sensors, registries and electronic health records. We have a strong track record of obtaining efficient regulatory approval for our trials from the FDA and Health Canada, training and monitoring sites nationally and internationally, ensuring robust enrollment and retention, data management and quality assurance, data sharing, and overall administrative coordination. We have the infrastructure to expand our trials to include mechanistic studies that use biospecimens collected and managed through the CTSN biorepository. Finally, the DCC plays an important role in the analysis, interpretation and dissemination of research findings. We will continue to support the process of publishing in high-impact journals that should lead to revision of practice guidelines and to surgical practice itself. This goal should be further optimized by incorporating Implementation Science approaches into Network trials, which should decrease the well-recognized gap between publication of trial results and adoption of findings into widespread practice. NARRATIVE Clinical trials are a critical step in translating discoveries into better treatments for people burdened by cardiac disorders. Such trials typically require cooperation and coordination among a broad range of investigators, patients, government agencies, and industry partners. The objective of the Cardiothoracic Surgical Trials Network (CTSN) is to increase the effectiveness and efficiency of clinical research through shared infrastructure for important trials that will advance therapy for patients suffering from cardiac disease.",Network for Cardiothoracic Surgical Investigations in Cardiovascular Medicine,9753639,U01HL088942,"['Address', 'Administrative Coordination', 'Adoption', 'Agreement', 'Ancillary Study', 'Atrial Fibrillation', 'Canada', 'Cardiac Surgery procedures', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Data Monitoring Committees', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Communication', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Collection', 'Data Coordinating Center', 'Data Quality', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Enrollment', 'Ensure', 'Event', 'Fostering', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Government Agencies', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act', 'Heart Diseases', 'Heart failure', 'Industry', 'Information Technology', 'Infrastructure', 'Institutes', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'International', 'Investigation', 'Journals', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Link', 'Longterm Follow-up', 'Manuscripts', 'Mediation', 'Medicine', 'Monitor', 'Multicenter Studies', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neuroprotective Agents', 'Online Systems', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patients', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Practice Guidelines', 'Preparation', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Quality of life', 'Regenerative Medicine', 'Registries', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Review Committee', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Sample Size', 'Secure', 'Serious Adverse Event', 'Site', 'Source', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'System', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Visit', 'Work', 'adjudicate', 'adjudication', 'base', 'biobank', 'clinical infrastructure', 'clinical practice', 'clinical research site', 'data integrity', 'data management', 'data sharing', 'design', 'dissemination research', 'electronic data', 'electronic data capture system', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'implementation research', 'implementation science', 'improved', 'industry partner', 'innovation', 'interest', 'international center', 'meetings', 'mobile application', 'new technology', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'patient oriented', 'performance site', 'prospective', 'quality assurance', 'recruit', 'research clinical testing', 'research data dissemination', 'screening', 'tool', 'trial design', 'wearable device']",NHLBI,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,U01,2019,7220733,0.04362292674198091
"Machine learning for the automated identification and tracking of rare myocardial diseases PROJECT SUMMARY Although cardiac amyloidosis and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) are relatively rare causes of heart failure (HF), they are particularly challenging to detect and treat for several shared reasons: (1) on routine clinical imaging (i.e., echocardiography [echo]), they can be difficult to distinguish from superficially similar, more common forms of cardiac disease that cause left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy; (2) the diagnoses are often missed and thus patients can present late in the course of disease at a time when treatment is difficult; (3) objective, noninvasive metrics that reliably reflect disease progression have not been identified; and (4) the small number of known patients with these diseases can make epidemiology studies and clinical trials difficult to organize and conduct. For both cardiac amyloidosis and HCM, echo plays a critical role in both diagnosis and longitudinal monitoring given its ubiquitous clinical availability, safety, and low cost. More broadly, echo dominates the current landscape of routine cardiac imaging, with tens of millions of echos performed in the United States each year. However, the clinical challenges described above highlight several shortcomings of echo: it is limited in its ability to (1) diagnose disease at its early stages; (2) discriminate between morphologically similar diseases; and (3) quantify disease progression. This proposal seeks to address deficiencies in the current echo reading workflow, which is subjective and captures only a small fraction of the data available in each study. The overall objective of this application is to use advances in machine learning to develop and validate fully-automated echo image analytic approaches to diagnose and track rare cardiomyopathies, focusing on cardiac amyloidosis and HCM. Our proposal is centered on the hypothesis that highly scalable computer vision methods can be applied to echo studies to overcome limitations of the standard clinical echo reading workflow. Accordingly our aims are: (1) Apply an automated method for echo quantification and disease identification to detect and differentiate cardiac diseases that cause increased LV wall thickness; and (2) Characterize quantifiable echo measures of disease progression in cardiac amyloidosis and HCM and associate these with clinical outcomes. Our multidisciplinary team, which is composed of experts in cardiomyopathies, echocardiography, computer vision, and machine learning, will analyze echos and patient data from 2 large patient registries: the Multicenter Amyloid Phenotyping Study (MAPS) and the Sarcomeric Human Cardiomyopathy Registry (SHaRe) HCM Network, with validation using a repository of nearly 400,000 echos. The successful completion of our aims will result in an innovative tool for early diagnosis of myocardial diseases and tracking of disease progression. Importantly, our project will set the stage for conducting larger epidemiology studies of rare myocardial diseases by automating the identification of these patients, and thereby developing previously unattainable broad-based cohorts for these conditions. PROJECT NARRATIVE Rare heart diseases such as amyloidosis (due to abnormal deposition of a protein into the heart muscle) and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (due to a genetic mutation) are important causes of heart failure and sudden death in the general population. These heart diseases are difficult to diagnose, monitor, and treat because: (1) they appear superficially similar to more common forms of heart disease (e.g., high blood pressure) on imaging tests; (2) the optimal monitoring of disease progression over time has not been established; and (3) there is a lack of large-scale studies of patients with these diseases given their rarity. This project aims to use machine learning (artificial intelligence) of digital echocardiographic images to create a completely automated method for diagnosing and tracking these rare heart diseases with the ultimate goal of broad deployment of artificial intelligence algorithms in hospitals and clinics to help identify patients with these rare heart diseases earlier, better predict adverse outcomes, and increase the size and scope of patient registries to enhance research of these conditions.",Machine learning for the automated identification and tracking of rare myocardial diseases,9614825,R01HL140731,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithm Design', 'Algorithms', 'Amyloid', 'Amyloidosis', 'Arrhythmia', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiomyopathies', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinics and Hospitals', 'Cohort Studies', 'Communities', 'Comorbidity', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Coronary heart disease', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Deposition', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Echocardiography', 'Face', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Heart Diseases', 'Heart failure', 'Hospitalization', 'Human', 'Hypertension', 'Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Inherited', 'Left', 'Left Ventricular Hypertrophy', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Morphology', 'Myocardium', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Reader', 'Reading', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Sudden Death', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Two-Dimensional Echocardiography', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Ventricular', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'career', 'clinical care', 'clinical imaging', 'cohort', 'cost', 'digital', 'disease diagnosis', 'epidemiology study', 'heart imaging', 'hypertensive heart disease', 'image processing', 'innovation', 'interest', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel therapeutics', 'particle', 'patient registry', 'repository', 'response', 'tool']",NHLBI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2018,826025,0.026311669747620833
"Novel Non-Invasive Coronary Flow Patterning to Predict Early Coronary Microvascular Disease PROJECT SUMMARY  Coronary microvascular disease (CMD) is notoriously difficult to diagnose non-invasively, and current methods of assessing CMD utilize only the peak velocity of the coronary flow pattern. While new imaging techniques such as cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have improved the assessment coronary perfusion, there are currently no non-invasive methods that incorporate the coronary flow pattern over a complete cardiac cycle to definitively assess and predict the development of CMD.  Coronary blood flow (CBF) reflects the summation of flow in the coronary microcirculation, and our lab has begun to harness the full CBF pattern under varying flow and disease conditions (e.g. type 2 diabetes) to determine whether it might harbor novel clues leading to the early detection of CMD. Our past and preliminary data indicate an early onset of CMD in both type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and metabolic syndrome (MetS) that occurs prior to the onset of macrovascular complications and that are characterized by blood flow impairments and alterations in coronary resistance microvessel (CRM) structure, function, and biomechanics. Our data also uncovered innovative correlations between CRM structure/biomechanics and our newly-defined features of the coronary flow pattern, some of which were unique to normal or diabetic mice. We have initially utilized these CBF features, in the presence and absence of other factors such as cardiac function, to develop a mathematical model in collaboration with Drs. Christopher Bartlett and William Ray that to date demonstrated that 6 simple factors can predict a normal vs. diabetic coronary flow pattern with 85% predictive accuracy. Utilizing a multidisciplinary approach, these preliminary data strongly suggest that the coronary flow pattern and physiological modulators of it (e.g. coronary micovascular structure/function/biomechanics, cardiac function, etc), may be useful in directly diagnosing early CMD. Therefore, we hypothesize that dissecting the elements that influence coronary flow patterning will be critical determinants in the direct assessment of coronary microvascular disease using computational modeling. Using our previous publications and our preliminary data as guides, the hypothesis will be tested by addressing two specific aims: 1) Determine whether unique time-dependent CBF patterning in normal and T2DM is dictated by a combination of CRM remodeling and biomechanics, coronary flow pattern dynamics, and cardiac function, permitting the development of a computational model to accurately predict CMD; 2) Determine the reproducibility and robustness of the machine learning model in predicting CMD in a diet-induced obesity/diabetes mouse model. If successful, these studies will be the first to simultaneously examine the influence of CRMs, CBF, and cardiac structure/function on the distinct pattern of coronary flow, and it will determine whether a mathematical model may be useful in establishing a direct assessment of CMD to eventually enable clinicians to conduct a more direct non-invasive diagnosis of CMD for the prevention and/or treatment of heart disease. PROJECT NARRATIVE Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) is the leading cause of heart disease and is associated with hypertension, diabetes, and metabolic syndrome. Coronary Microvascular Disease (CMD) is comprised of structural and functional deficits of the tiny coronary arteries that may be an earlier indicator of disease prior to the onset of overt CAD. The proposed multidisciplinary research aims to develop a computational artificial intelligence model that will accurately predict CMD based on a non-invasive coronary flow pattern obtained by Doppler echocardiography.",Novel Non-Invasive Coronary Flow Patterning to Predict Early Coronary Microvascular Disease,9584176,R21EB026518,"['Address', 'Age', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biomechanics', 'Blood flow', 'Cardiac', 'Collaborations', 'Computer Simulation', 'Coronary', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Coronary artery', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diabetic mouse', 'Diet', 'Disease', 'Doppler Echocardiography', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Echocardiography', 'Elements', 'Heart Diseases', 'Hyperemia', 'Hypertension', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Impairment', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Metabolic syndrome', 'Methods', 'Microcirculation', 'Microvascular Dysfunction', 'Modeling', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Obesity', 'Pattern', 'Physiological', 'Publications', 'Reproducibility', 'Resistance', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'base', 'coronary perfusion', 'db/db mouse', 'diabetic', 'disorder prevention', 'early onset', 'experimental study', 'heart function', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'macrovascular disease', 'mathematical model', 'noninvasive diagnosis', 'novel', 'pressure', 'prevent']",NIBIB,RESEARCH INST NATIONWIDE CHILDREN'S HOSP,R21,2018,190000,0.10361940959582379
"Prospective Slice Tracking for Cardiac MRI Project Summary/Abstract Cardiac Magnetic Resonance (CMR) provides arguably the most comprehensive evaluation of the cardiovascular system; however, respiratory motion continues to adversely impact CMR, causing artifacts that lead to poor image quality, repeated scans, and decreased throughput, and thus represents a significant obstacle to clinical utility. For single-shot CMR, cardiac and breathing motions are “frozen” by limiting the acquisition to an end-diastolic window less than 200 ms. For first pass perfusion, breathing motion cannot be eliminated because data from 50 to 60 consecutive heartbeats are required to capture contrast dynamics. For other single-shot applications such as late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) and parameter mapping, respiratory motion is introduced when the acquisition is repeated across several heartbeats to improve spatial and temporal resolution. To eliminate respiratory motion from single-shot images, non-rigid motion correction (MOCO) has been promoted as an attractive option that provides 100% acquisition efficiently. MOCO can be used either after the reconstruction or during the reconstruction. Such techniques, however, cannot account for through-plane motion, which can only be corrected prospectively, and can fail depending on image quality and the extent of motion. Prospective compensation of the respiratory motion has been recognized as an attractive alternative to existing gating and MOCO methods. Proposed methods use one or more navigator echoes—incompatible with or inefficient for many CMR protocols—to capture the respiratory motion and rely on simple parametric models that are inadequate to describe complex respiratory-induced cardiac motion. Due to these limitations, prospective methods have found limited applicability even in research settings. We propose a new framework to prospectively compensate respiratory motion. The proposed method, called PROspective Motion compensation using Pilot Tone (PROMPT), employs Pilot Tone technology and leverages machine learning principles to first learn complex respiratory-induced cardiac motion on a patient-specific basis and then prospectively compensate the motion by tracking the imaging plane, in real time, as a function of a Pilot Tone based respiratory signal. If successful, this synergistic combination of Pilot Tone and machine learning will lead to 100% efficiency for single-shot CMR exams performed under free-breathing conditions, will eliminate the need to setup navigator echoes, respiratory bellows, or other inefficient prospective gating measures, will minimize through-plane motion that can render the images non-diagnostic for CMR applications including fast-pass perfusion, parameter mapping, LGE, and coronary angiography, will provide a reliable surrogate measure of respiratory motion, and will facilitate highly accelerated compressive recovery. Project Narrative Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) has many potential advantages over currently used imaging methods to diagnose heart disease, but MRI images can be ruined if the patient breathes during the scan. In this project, we will develop a method that is insensitive to breathing motion and compare it to existing methods. These efforts should lead to significant improvements in diagnosis of heart disease so that patients may benefit from appropriate treatment.",Prospective Slice Tracking for Cardiac MRI,9587091,R21EB026657,"['Anatomy', 'Breathing', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Coronary Angiography', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Diagnosis', 'Evaluation', 'Financial compensation', 'Freezing', 'Gadolinium', 'Heart Diseases', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Patients', 'Perfusion', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Protocols documentation', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Respiration', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Slice', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'artificial neural network', 'base', 'computerized data processing', 'data acquisition', 'healthy volunteer', 'heart motion', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'prospective', 'reconstruction', 'respiratory', 'technology development', 'temporal measurement', 'volunteer']",NIBIB,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,R21,2018,185264,0.03406563604626174
"Innovative MRI-based Characterization of Cardiac Dyssynchrony ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cardiac dyssynchrony deteriorates cardiac function and often cannot be treated effectively. The goal of this proposal is to develop and provide a new analysis technique for understanding the complex cardiac motion patterns (in time and space) of patients with cardiac dyssynchrony, with the hope of improving its treatment outcomes, specifically with respect to cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT). CRT, the most effective treatment for dyssynchrony with worsening heart failure, significantly improves outcome in only ~66% of heart failure patients selected for the treatment, which is based on ECG criteria. Selection criteria based on imaging are essential to improving the success rate. Unfortunately, response rates are not higher with selection criteria based on echocardiography, the most popular cardiac imaging technique. Cine cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) has the potential to better characterize dyssynchrony, as it shows cardiac mechanics and intramural wall motion with much higher spatial resolution than echocardiography. However, quantitative assessments of CMR have been mostly limited to global volumetric measures, which ignore most of the motion information captured by the images. For example, studies of a number of distinctive motion features of dyssynchrony (such as septal flash and apical rocking) have been confined to qualitative assessment, limiting inference of their potential utility for improving CRT treatment. To accurately quantify cardiac function through CMR, we have developed biomechanical models for describing cardiac function and machine learning technology for identifying morphological and functional patterns atypical for healthy hearts. We propose to combine these two technologies to accurately quantify cardiac dyssynchrony within the Left Ventricle (LV). Specifically, our methods will extract a rich description of LV motion and strain from the CMRs of a set of retrospectively selected subjects with synchronous or dyssynchronous LV motion. We will then use machine learning methods to identify local and global motion patterns specific to dyssynchrony. Finally, we will correlate these patterns to already existing clinical scores to find potentially predictive markers with respect to CRT outcome. We hypothesize that these markers will have a higher correlation to CRT outcome than current clinical markers alone. Identifying these markers will have the potential to further stratify the disease with respect to the expected outcome of CRT, which then can be used to derive new selection criteria that lead to higher success rates. The project will also disseminate our novel, data-driven methodology for quantifying that motion. Other research groups can apply our tools to specifically study dyssynchrony, as well as other cardiac diseases impacting LV motion in general. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: A significant proportion of patients with heart failure and cardiac dyssynchrony fail to positively respond to cardiac resynchronization therapy, as the current clinical selection criteria are too broad. Our goal is to more accurately characterize the complex shape and motion patterns of cardiac dyssynchrony, through new machine learning technology applied to dynamic cardiovascular magnetic resonance images. We envision that our findings would further improve both our understanding of cardiac dyssynchrony in relation to heart failure and the ability to predict its response to resynchronization therapy, potentially leading to new clinical guidelines and improved clinical outcomes.",Innovative MRI-based Characterization of Cardiac Dyssynchrony,9475862,R01HL127661,"['Apical', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Markers', 'Clinical Research', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Echocardiography', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Heart', 'Heart Diseases', 'Heart failure', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Left ventricular structure', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Motion', 'Movement', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Selection Criteria', 'Shapes', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Treatment outcome', 'base', 'biomechanical model', 'cardiac resynchronization therapy', 'effective therapy', 'heart function', 'heart imaging', 'heart motion', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'novel', 'predictive marker', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'spatiotemporal', 'success', 'therapy outcome', 'tool']",NHLBI,"RUTGERS, THE STATE UNIV OF N.J.",R01,2018,589455,0.10513656071713658
"Automated quantitative CT imaging of epicardial adipose tissue and risk of cardiac events PROJECT SUMMARY Coronary artery disease remains the leading cause of death worldwide, and more than half of the individuals suffering acute myocardial infarction have no prior symptoms. Coronary calcium scoring with non-contrast CT is increasingly used for cardiovascular risk stratification in the asymptomatic population. Epicardial adipose tissue (EAT), a local visceral fat depot surrounding the heart, has been recently reported as a significant imaging biomarker for cardiovascular risk stratification. Despite being routinely imaged noninvasively by non-contrast cardiac CT for coronary calcium scoring, EAT features are currently not measured or reported, primarily due to the absence of robust, automated quantification methods.  We propose to employ novel image processing algorithms to achieve fully automated, robust quantification of EAT features from cardiac CT, and to apply machine learning methods to efficiently combine patient clinical data, coronary calcium and EAT features into a new integrated risk score to predict future cardiac events. We will evaluate this risk score in two existing, prospective registries of asymptomatic patients with available coronary calcium scans, clinical data, and followup for cardiac events (myocardial infarction, cardiac death, late revascularization). These rich resources are: the Early Identification of Subclinical Atherosclerosis Using Non-Invasive Imaging Research [EISNER] registry (2614 patients) and the St. Francis Heart Study (4613 patients). We propose three specific aims: 1) To develop and evaluate the accuracy and reproducibility of new computational algorithms for automated quantification of EAT measures; 2) To evaluate the prognostic value of automatically-quantified EAT features, relative to atherosclerotic plaque burden and measures of obesity, for the prediction of future cardiac events in asymptomatic patients in the EISNER registry and the St. Francis Heart Study; 3) To derive and evaluate a new, integrated risk score—combining standard risk factors, coronary calcium score and EAT measures using machine learning—for the prediction of future cardiac events in the EISNER registry, and further, to additionally evaluate this risk score externally in the St. Francis Heart Study patient cohort.  This work in this proposal will provide a novel, personalized paradigm that will objectively and accurately identify asymptomatic patients undergoing coronary calcium scanning who are at increased risk for future cardiac events, without any additional imaging or risk to the patient. PROJECT NARRATIVE (lay language) CT scanning of the heart for coronary calcium scoring is a simple, widely-used, low-cost test with low radiation dose. Using these scans, the researchers propose to establish automated analysis of fat which surrounds the heart, as well as novel computerized scores that identify the patients who are at highest risk of suffering a heart attack.

"Real-time Monitoring of Zebrafish ECG with Automated Aberrant Pattern Detection Abstract Sensoriis, Inc is a company that, develops evidence-based sensing solutions to support biological investigations and address health care problems. The goal of this NIH STTR grant with University of Washington (UW) is to provide a flexible system to assess cardiac electrical activities in zebrafish models, supporting heart disease studies and drug screening. Unlike humans, zebrafish hearts can fully regenerate following cardiac injury, thereby providing a tractable model system to study endogenous heart regeneration. Zebrafish have also proven to be an ideal vertebrate model system for phenotype-based screening owing to their physiological similarity to mammals. Further, zebrafish model enables a forward genetic approach to reveal the genetic basis and underlying molecular mechanisms of numerous heart diseases. The conventional setup for cardiac phenotype acquisition in zebrafish (i.e. electrocardiogram – ECG) involves sedation causing variation in functionality. To date, there is no system which can offer cardiac phenotype monitoring in freely-swimming zebrafish, not to mention for multiple fish simultaneously. In this context, we propose and develop 1) a wireless flexible “jacket” to be worn by zebrafish for real-time assessment of electrical cardiac phenotypes, namely ECG; and 2) a simple-yet-novel apparatus to collect ECG of multiple awake fish. Our devices provide pivotal platforms for cardiac phenotype-related investigations. The obtained data will be processed by smart algorithms to detect aberrant ECG patterns in real time. The proposed systems will facilitate related studies using zebrafish models. Further, the success of this platform also paves the avenue for regenerative medicine and developmental biology studies as well as stem cell-based therapies for cardiac repair. In Phase I of this STTR grant, we will develop i) a polymer-based microelectrode array (MEA) jacket that could be comfortably worn by the zebrafish and provide wireless ECG acquisition; and ii) a 4-chamber apparatus for simultaneous recording of ECG in awake fish. Machine learning-based programs with embedded algorithms will be developed to distinguish ECG patterns such as heart rate, ST and QT intervals, thus can identify anomalies, such as arrhythmias or prolonged QTs. For proof of concept, the system will be validated and compared. PROJECT NARRATIVE In this Phase I STTR grant, Sensoriis, Inc and the University of Washington will develop 1) a world-first wireless flexible membrane for zebrafish with a micro-electrode array (MEA) for ECG measurement and electronics for wireless powering and communication with an external unit; 2) a simple-yet-novel 4-chamber apparatus to acquire ECG of 4 awake fish; and 3) Machine learning-based programs to process the data and detect desired patterns. The goal is to facilitate and reduce cost and time of cardiac phenotype-based screening in the zebrafish models, supporting numerous studies.

"Automatic quantification of myocardial motion in older adults Abstract  Heart failure (HF) is a common condition that represents the end stage of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) subsequent to progressing myocardial damage or ischemia. In populations at ages 65 and older, coronary artery disease (CAD) serves as the leading cause of HF. Although low left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction (EF) is a major evidence for the diagnosis of HF in clinical practice, impaired regional myocardial dysfunction is expected to present the existence of CAD in its early stage.  Heart deformation analysis (HDA) is a cutting-edge myocardial motion analysis technique that is able to automatically track the myocardium borders on time frames and calculate global and regional cardiac functional and motional indices on existing cine images without extra scans. In the present study, we will use the HDA tool to analyze existing cine images of CHARISMA study. From 2009 to 2012, cardiac MRI exams (including coronary wall imaging and cine MRI at two-chamber, four-chamber and short-axis views) and concurrent tests for traditional cardiovascular risk factors were performed on 440 older participants (age: 65 - 84 years old at the time of MRI scans) without documented history of CVDs. During the present R03 project (2019-2021), CHARISMA participants would have been followed-up for 10 - 12 years. We plan to relate newly- acquired regional myocardial motion indices (displacement, velocity, strain and strain rate) to clinical outcomes, existing coronary wall measures and results of lab tests in CHARISMA datasets. We will test the overall hypothesis that regional myocardial motion indices have the potential to present cardiovascular risk in asymptomatic elderly. Three specific aims are: 1) Predict cardiovascular events using baseline regional myocardial motion indices; 2) Relate regional myocardial motion indices to MRI-derived features of coronary remodeling; and 3) Determine correlations between regional myocardial motion indices and traditional cardiovascular risk biomarkers/conditions collected in CHARISMA study.  No new MRI scans or lab tests are required in this project. Through a cost-effective approach, the immediate objective of the proposed project is to evaluate the clinical value of regional myocardial motion for cardiovascular risk stratification in asymptomatic older adults, a major target population of cardiovascular prevention. This study will also help us better understand the correlations between impaired myocardial function/motion and subclinical CAD burden. Furthermore, the results will facilitate the selection of quantitative imaging biomarkers and their optimal cut-off points for predicting cardiovascular events in future clinical studies. Project Narrative  In the present study, we will use heart deformation analysis (HDA) to reanalyze existing cardiac MRI data of CHARISMA study.

"HLS-Cardiac Safety AI Trained Human Heart and Micro Heart Model HLS17-12. The US FDA is considering to establish a new cardiac safety assessment approach de- fined by a new paradigm called, “Comprehensive in vitro Proarrhythmia Assay (CIPA)”. The CIPA will 1) assess drug effects on each cardiac ion channel type individually using a high- throughput assay ion channel assays, 2) compute net effect on repolarization and risks for tor- sade pointes (TdP) using a mathematical model, and 3) confirm the computational prediction by measuring the drug’s effects on action potentials in induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) derived human cardiac myocytes (CMs). This paradigm shift, if successful, could reduce the cost of car- diac safety analyses by replacing or lowering the requirement to perform an expensive ($2-4 million) thorough QT study during clinical trials. Protecting consumers from drug induced ar- rhythmia and sudden deaths is a paramount importance for the regulators and pharmaceutical companies as well as lowing the cost of drug development. Many cardiac safety scientists, however, are skeptical about CIPA’s approach since CMs derived from human iPSCs exhibit a poor excitation-contraction coupling due to their immaturity. In addition, a proposed CIPA mathematical model was developed to simulate electrophysiology of human adult CMs, so there is a mismatch between experimental system and computational tool. To address these concerns, we proposed three specific aims in tw0 phases by following Fast- Track SBIR processes. Phase I feasibility Aim 1 will measure drug-induced changes in AP and CaT using human adult heart slices isolated from human donors. Here we will confirm our suc- cessful handling and analyzing human adult heart slices, which will be based on a recently pub- lished protocol by our collaborator, Dr. Igor Efimov, at George Washington University. After this validation, we will move on to perform the following two studies: Aim 2. Compare drug-induced changes in AP and CaT in NuHearts generated from adult CMs and cardiac fibroblasts from same human donor hearts; Aim 3. Validate and improve the computational models and train an artificial intelligence to predict cardiac safety risks of unknow compounds. After our successful completion proposed projects, we can establish an unprecedented cardiac safety assessment platform that can predict safety issues using a well-trained AI without doing any experiments using human heart slices that are rarely accessible for most of the safety labor- atories or biotech firms. Because nearly one third of drug candidates fails to reach market due to its cardiac safety concerns, a better safety assessment approach without increasing its cost is needed to improve productivity of pharmaceutical industry. The proposed project combines computational and experimental analyses of cardiac safety parameters using adult heart cells isolated from a donor heart and its stem cell derived heart muscle cells to build a better but cost-effective cardiac safety assessment system. A successfully validated system enables drug developers to arcuately predict a new drug’s cardiac safety profile by only running cost-effective experiments using stem cell derived heart muscle cells that are accessible to many drug developers.",HLS-Cardiac Safety AI Trained Human Heart and Micro Heart Model,9555779,R44HL139248,"['Action Potentials', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Adverse effects', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biological Assay', 'Biomedical Research', 'Biotechnology', 'Calcium', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Myocytes', 'Cardiotoxicity', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communities', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer Simulation', 'Contracts', 'Coupling', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Development', 'Dose', 'Drug Costs', 'Drug Industry', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Exhibits', 'Fibroblasts', 'Gene Expression', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Guidelines', 'Heart', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Ion Channel', 'Laboratories', 'Libraries', 'Marketing', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Mitochondria', 'Modeling', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Pharmacology', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physiology', 'Pluripotent Stem Cells', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Preclinical Testing', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Productivity', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publishing', 'Pump', 'Reproducibility', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Safety', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Shipping', 'Ships', 'Slice', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Stem cells', 'Sudden Death', 'System', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Washington', 'Work', 'base', 'cardiac tissue engineering', 'commercialization', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'drug candidate', 'drug development', 'drug discovery', 'experimental analysis', 'experimental study', 'heart cell', 'high throughput screening', 'human data', 'improved', 'in vitro Assay', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'man', 'mathematical model', 'novel therapeutics', 'personalized medicine', 'response', 'screening', 'simulation', 'success']",NHLBI,"INVIVOSCIENCES, INC.",R44,2018,349385,0.08299693722963393
"Cardiovascular Imaging in Ischemic Heart Disease Project Summary/Abstract The applicant Udo Hoffmann MD MPH is a Professor of Radiology at Harvard Medical School and the Chief of the Division for Cardiovascular Imaging in the Department of Radiology at MGH. Dr. Hoffmann has established a patient oriented research (POR) program that combines innovative translational, clinical, and outcomes research methods to demonstrate the value of advanced cardiovascular imaging. Dr. Hoffmann has published approximately 380 peer reviewed papers, among them many in premier medical journals and has received continued independent, peer-reviewed POR NIH funding since 2005. He is among the very few faculty members at Harvard Medical School who are both the PI and Director of a highly successful NHLBI funded T- 32 program (Cardiac MR and CT Research) and a recipient of a K24. Dr. Hoffmann has successfully mentored more than 60 clinical investigators, most of which currently hold faculty positions in major academic centers and actively perform POR. Moreover, Dr. Hoffmann has successfully accomplished all mentoring and scientific goals of the first K24 award period. Overall, these achievements document Dr. Hoffmann's long standing passion and commitment to POR. His excellent publication, funding, and mentoring record together with his current and planned research support provide an excellent foundation to accomplish the aims of this competitive renewal of the K24 Award “Cardiovascular Imaging in Ischemic Heart Disease”. Dr. Hoffmann proposes a mentoring and research plan that utilizes the synergies of past, ongoing, and future highly innovative independent research projects with educational and training opportunities offered by the cardiac MR CT PET Program, the T32 training program in cardiovascular imaging, the Harvard CTSA, and the Harvard School of Public Health. The specific aims addressing the charge of the K24 Award are to enable Dr. Hoffmann to: 1) dedicate 25% of his time to mentor clinical investigators based on NIH or equivalent funded projects in “Cardiovascular Imaging in Ischemic Heart Disease”, 2) to mentor junior and mid-career clinical investigators with the goal to develop them into clinical researchers who can successfully compete for peer reviewed grants, and 3) to continue to expand a POR program that combines translational, clinical, and outcomes research to develop future leaders in clinical research in cardiovascular imaging and beyond. The research plan encompasses four specific aims: 1) To determine the effects of statin treatment on coronary atherosclerosis in HIV patients in 800 patients with HIV randomized to statin therapy vs. placebo, 2) To determine whether high risk coronary plaque predicts cardiovascular events in 4600 patients with clinical suspicion of CAD, 3) To determine the cost effectiveness of CT FFR in patients with stable and acute chest pain, and 4) To use Radiomics to identify novel imaging markers predicting cardiovascular events in participants of the Framingham Heart Study. Narrative This research takes advantage of a rich body of independent funded research in “Cardiovascular Imaging in Ischemic Heart Disease”. It will permit Dr. Hoffmann to dedicate 25% of his time to mentor junior clinical investigators from the T32 program and the pool of residents, fellows, and junior faculty in Cardiology and Radiology with the goal to develop them into clinical researchers who can successfully compete for peer reviewed grants. In addition, it will allow to expand a patient orientated research program that combines innovative translational, clinical, and outcomes research in cardiovascular imaging and that provides an ideal environment to develop future leaders in clinical research.",Cardiovascular Imaging in Ischemic Heart Disease,9475268,K24HL113128,"['Achievement', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Age', 'Antiinflammatory Effect', 'Area', 'Blood Vessels', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiology', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Charge', 'Chest Pain', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical/Radiologic', 'Coronary', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Data', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Evaluation Studies', 'Event', 'Faculty', 'Foundations', 'Framingham Heart Study', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'HIV', 'Journals', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Mentors', 'Mid-Career Clinical Scientist Award (K24)', 'Myocardial Ischemia', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Natural History', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Paper', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Peer Review', 'Peer Review Grants', 'Placebos', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Public Health Schools', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Research Support', 'Risk stratification', 'Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training Programs', 'Translational Research', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'base', 'cardiovascular imaging', 'career', 'comparative effectiveness', 'coronary plaque', 'cost', 'cost effectiveness', 'effectiveness trial', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'markov model', 'medical schools', 'member', 'novel', 'patient oriented research', 'predictive marker', 'prevent', 'professor', 'programs', 'prospective', 'radiomics', 'randomized trial', 'repository', 'sex', 'skills', 'synergism', 'training opportunity']",NHLBI,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,K24,2018,120852,0.05707415129981189
"System-independent quantitative cardiac CT perfusion System-independent quantitative cardiac CT perfusion Summary BioInVision, Inc. and Case Western Reserve University researchers will develop software for quantitative anal- ysis of cardiac CT perfusion (CCTP), creating an important tool for evaluation of cardiovascular disease. With this product, cardiologists will be able to identify functional flow deficits in coronary artery territories. When one combines functional myocardial blood flow (MBF) with coronary anatomy from computed tomography angi- ography (CTA), it provides needed information on the physiologic significance of a stenosis. The CTA+CCTP combo could provide an ideal gateway exam for deciding whether to send a patient for percutaneous invasive coronary angiography and potential intervention (e.g., stenting). In addition, if flow is low and no stenosis is present, it will suggest microvascular disease, a very prevalent ailment of growing concern, especially among women and in diabetes. CT compares favorably to all other non-invasive cardiovascular imaging techniques (SPECT, PET, and MRI). It is available in many settings, including emergency departments. It provides both MBF and reliable coronary anatomy, not available in any other single modality. It has excellent resolution ena- bling detection of endocardial perfusion deficit, thought to be an early disease indicator that is impossible to assess with SPECT. CT is cheaper and has higher patient throughput than MRI or PET. With inclusion of MBF, CT would have an excellent opportunity to disrupt the diagnostic pathway leading to percutaneous intervention, a pathway now dominated by SPECT myocardial imaging, which includes zero information about coronary anatomy. To achieve reliable, accurate CT MBF measurements, we will invoke innovations to reduce beam hardening and to make reliable estimates of flow. Currently, CT perfusion is done on different CT machines with manufacturers’ proprietary software, using algorithms that can give erroneous MBFs. Applicable to any commercial scanner; our solution would harmonize measurements across acquisition systems providing trust- worthy, standardized measurements to clinicians, thereby improving management of cardiovascular patients. Narrative We will develop software to enable reliable evaluation of blood flow in heart tissue using CT imaging. With suc- cess, our project could lead to an improved gateway examination that could reduce unnecessary invasive cor- onary angiography, thereby reducing costs, patient discomfort, patient risk, and possibly unnecessary interven- tional therapies.",System-independent quantitative cardiac CT perfusion,9622204,R41HL144271,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Angiography', 'Attention', 'Benchmarking', 'Blood Vessels', 'Blood flow', 'Calibration', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cause of Death', 'Chest Pain', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Computer software', 'Confidence Intervals', 'Coronary', 'Coronary Angiography', 'Coronary artery', 'Cost Savings', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Evaluation', 'Family suidae', 'Heart', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Inferior', 'Intervention', 'Iodine', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manufacturer Name', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Microvascular Dysfunction', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Myocardial', 'Myocardium', 'Obesity', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Perfusion', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Pre-Clinical Model', 'Prevalence', 'Quantitative Evaluations', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Source', 'Standardization', 'Stenosis', 'Stents', 'System', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Tissues', 'Trust', 'Universities', 'Woman', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'blood flow measurement', 'cardiovascular imaging', 'cost', 'design', 'detector', 'digital', 'imaging system', 'improved', 'innovation', 'noninvasive diagnosis', 'perfusion imaging', 'pre-clinical', 'prototype', 'research and development', 'single photon emission computed tomography', 'software development', 'success', 'tool', 'virtual']",NHLBI,"BIOINVISION, INC.",R41,2018,224240,0.050817245922502356
"Comprehensive Cardiac Structure-Function Analysis in Heart Transplantation DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Heart transplant (Tx) surgery is a well-established life-saving procedure, but is associated with post- interventional risks such as acute cardiac rejection (ACR) which is one of the leading causes of death in the first year after transplant. Beyond the first year, cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV) is the single greatest risk factor for 5-year mortality. Monitoring the patient for post-transplant events is thus paramount. The standard monitoring strategy, however, relies on frequent (12-16 monitoring nodes during year 1 alone) invasive and costly procedures including endomyocardial biopsies (EMB) and catheter angiography. Since EMB and catheter angiography have limited sensitivity due to sampling errors (ACR) or the diffuse nature of the disease (CAV), a reliable non-invasive alternative for the early detection of ACR and CAV would be desirable to reduce the need for invasive procedures, improve sensitivity, and reduce cost. We have recently developed and applied cardiac MRI techniques for the non-invasive assessment of myocardial edema (T2-mapping), diffuse fibrosis (pre- and post-contrast T1-mapping), myocardial velocities (tissue phase mapping), and microvascular quantitative perfusion. We have shown that these techniques can identify distinct regional structural and functional alterations in the heart that correlate with te status of the allograft. Based on these findings, a detailed cost-effective analysis using Markov modeling and decision tree analysis has demonstrated that cardiac MR has tremendous potential to reduce monitoring costs by 40-50% during the first year after Tx alone. This proposal builds on these promising findings and our aim is to develop an new 15-minute structure-function cardiac MRI protocol for the improved detection regional abnormalities associated with ACR (edema, fibrosis, dysfunction) and CAV (perfusion, dysfunction). Integration of MRI with echocardiography and intravascular Ultrasound (IVUS) will provide unique multi-modality assessment of the allograft. The application in a longitudinal clinical study coupled with state-of-the-art cost-effectiveness analysis will allow redefining the most effective post-Tx mixed monitoring strategy. The aim is to to help clinicians identify the optimal mixed monitoring strategy, i.e. the optimal combination of multi-modality imaging (structure-function MRI, echo, IVUS) and invasive procedures (EMB, catheter angiography) which provide best outcome (quality adjusted life days) and lowest cost for the individual cardiac transplant patient. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We propose to develop a multi-modality imaging protocol for the non-invasive characterization of tissue and function of the left and right heart in patients after heart transplantation. Our aim is to develop a new non- invasive 15 minute diagnostic test in order to provide a previously unattainable quantitative characterization of myocardial structure-function deficits in cardiac transplant patients. The application in a longitudinal clinial study coupled with cost-effectiveness analysis and decision tree modeling will allow to improve current monitoring strategies by combining cardiac MRI, echocardiography, intravascular ultrasound and invasive tests (biopsy, catheter angiography) to provide the best outcome (quality of life days, mortality) and lowest cost for the individual cardiac transplant patient.",Comprehensive Cardiac Structure-Function Analysis in Heart Transplantation,9417961,R01HL117888,"['Acute', 'Allografting', 'Ambulatory Care Facilities', 'Angiography', 'Area', 'Biopsy', 'Blood Vessels', 'Cardiac', 'Catheters', 'Cause of Death', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Coronary', 'Coronary Angiography', 'Cost Effectiveness Analysis', 'Cost utility', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Decision Modeling', 'Decision Trees', 'Detection', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Diffuse', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Echocardiography', 'Edema', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Fibrosis', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Healthcare', 'Heart', 'Heart Transplantation', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Left', 'Life', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Myocardial', 'Nature', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patients', 'Perfusion', 'Phase', 'Procedures', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quality of life', 'Reference Standards', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling Errors', 'Savings', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Transplant Recipients', 'Transplantation', 'Ultrasonography', 'Vascular Diseases', 'Visit', 'base', 'comparative cost effectiveness', 'cost', 'extracellular', 'follow-up', 'heart allograft', 'heart function', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'markov model', 'mortality', 'non-invasive imaging', 'novel', 'post intervention', 'procedure cost', 'public health relevance', 'standard of care', 'two-arm study']",NHLBI,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R01,2018,658634,0.12802526378531956
"Gastrointestinal Safety of Antithrombotic Drug Regimens ABSTRACT Patients with atrial fibrillation, post-acute coronary syndrome and venous thromboembolism are prescribed antithrombotic drugs (antiplatelet agents and oral anticoagulants) in dual and triple combinations. These drugs independently cause gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) from mucosal defects or vascular abnormalities of the gastrointestinal tract. Cardiac patients are the fastest growing at-risk group due to the rapidly aging US population, their high-burden of co-morbidity, frequent antithrombotic polypharmacy and prescription of new antithrombotic drugs with higher incidence of GI adverse events. The real-world GIB risk of antithrombotic agents used in combination in a diverse cardiac population has yet to be characterized. Furthermore, we have previously demonstrated poor performance of existing risk scores (HAS-BLED, CHA2DS2-VASC etc.) for the prediction of non- warfarin antithrombotic drug bleeding; scores frequently used in the clinical setting despite their inaccuracy. Absence of knowledge regarding the real-world risk of antithrombotic-GIB, and the inability to accurately predict which patients will bleed, hampers patient counselling regarding a frequently occurring adverse event which is known to cause morbidity and mortality among cardiac patients. We propose to fill this knowledge gap by quantifying GIB risk in a large, geographically diverse cohort of elderly and non-elderly cardiac patients with atrial fibrillation, venous thromboembolism or post-acute coronary syndrome. GIB associated with antithrombotic drug combinations will be stratified by underlying cardiac conditions; incidence rates (events/100 patient-years) and propensity-matched Cox proportional models (with 95% confidence intervals) will be used to estimate outcome. We will examine heterogeneity of safety effects related to age, chronic co-morbidity, and hepatic or renal dysfunction. Machine learning techniques will then be used to derive and validate a highly sensitive algorithm for the prediction of antithrombotic-related GIB. Discovery of such an algorithm is the first step in the future application of a predictive model in any evidence-based clinical delivery platform, such as a decision rule or risk calculator. NARRATIVE Gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) in cardiac patients is common, deadly and on the rise due to an older population, antiplatelet and anticoagulant drugs used in combination, and availability of new drugs with higher GIB risk than their predecessors. Lack of data regarding the magnitude of GIB and limited knowledge of which patients are most at risk, prevents accurate counselling regarding cardiac drug safety.

"Automated coronary artery calcification scoring for cardiovascular risk screening ABSTRACT The World Health Organization lists cardiovascular disease as the most common cause of death worldwide at 31% of all deaths. Coronary artery calcium (CAC) scoring has become the most reliable predictor of future coronary artery disease (CAD) events in the asymptomatic population. CAC scores are currently only reported on ECG-gated CT examinations that are ordered when the primary indication is cardiac in nature. However, in 2007 there were 7.1 million non-cardiac thoracic CT scans ordered with lungs as the primary indication where CAC scores could have been reported. An additional 7-10 million CT lung screening scans are expected to be ordered per year as lung screening programs grow. Because lung cancer risk factors and CAD risk factors overlap significantly, most these patients could benefit greatly from having their CAC score reported as part of their non-cardiac CT examination. This could dramatically improve decision making, quality of care, and lower expenses due to future CAD interventions and cardiac specific CT scans. The goal of this project is to develop a fully automated software application that can report CAC scores on both gated and ungated thoracic CT scans with seamless integration into the Radiology workflow. A successful completion of this project will deliver a product capable of dramatically increasing the number of people that receive early intervention for CAD, thereby increasing quality of care and lowering costs. This Phase I application proposes first creating an algorithm capable of automatically calculating global CAC scores from both ECG-gated and ungated CT scans using CAC segmentations performed by an expert physician. If successful, the Phase II project will perform robust clinical validation adequate for an FDA 510(k) submission.

"Innovative MRI-based Characterization of Cardiac Dyssynchrony ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cardiac dyssynchrony deteriorates cardiac function and often cannot be treated effectively. The goal of this proposal is to develop and provide a new analysis technique for understanding the complex cardiac motion patterns (in time and space) of patients with cardiac dyssynchrony, with the hope of improving its treatment outcomes, specifically with respect to cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT). CRT, the most effective treatment for dyssynchrony with worsening heart failure, significantly improves outcome in only ~66% of heart failure patients selected for the treatment, which is based on ECG criteria. Selection criteria based on imaging are essential to improving the success rate. Unfortunately, response rates are not higher with selection criteria based on echocardiography, the most popular cardiac imaging technique. Cine cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) has the potential to better characterize dyssynchrony, as it shows cardiac mechanics and intramural wall motion with much higher spatial resolution than echocardiography. However, quantitative assessments of CMR have been mostly limited to global volumetric measures, which ignore most of the motion information captured by the images. For example, studies of a number of distinctive motion features of dyssynchrony (such as septal flash and apical rocking) have been confined to qualitative assessment, limiting inference of their potential utility for improving CRT treatment. To accurately quantify cardiac function through CMR, we have developed biomechanical models for describing cardiac function and machine learning technology for identifying morphological and functional patterns atypical for healthy hearts. We propose to combine these two technologies to accurately quantify cardiac dyssynchrony within the Left Ventricle (LV). Specifically, our methods will extract a rich description of LV motion and strain from the CMRs of a set of retrospectively selected subjects with synchronous or dyssynchronous LV motion. We will then use machine learning methods to identify local and global motion patterns specific to dyssynchrony. Finally, we will correlate these patterns to already existing clinical scores to find potentially predictive markers with respect to CRT outcome. We hypothesize that these markers will have a higher correlation to CRT outcome than current clinical markers alone. Identifying these markers will have the potential to further stratify the disease with respect to the expected outcome of CRT, which then can be used to derive new selection criteria that lead to higher success rates. The project will also disseminate our novel, data-driven methodology for quantifying that motion. Other research groups can apply our tools to specifically study dyssynchrony, as well as other cardiac diseases impacting LV motion in general.

"Automated quantitative CT imaging of epicardial adipose tissue and risk of cardiac events PROJECT SUMMARY Coronary artery disease remains the leading cause of death worldwide, and more than half of the individuals suffering acute myocardial infarction have no prior symptoms. Coronary calcium scoring with non-contrast CT is increasingly used for cardiovascular risk stratification in the asymptomatic population. Epicardial adipose tissue (EAT), a local visceral fat depot surrounding the heart, has been recently reported as a significant imaging biomarker for cardiovascular risk stratification. Despite being routinely imaged noninvasively by non-contrast cardiac CT for coronary calcium scoring, EAT features are currently not measured or reported, primarily due to the absence of robust, automated quantification methods.  We propose to employ novel image processing algorithms to achieve fully automated, robust quantification of EAT features from cardiac CT, and to apply machine learning methods to efficiently combine patient clinical data, coronary calcium and EAT features into a new integrated risk score to predict future cardiac events. We will evaluate this risk score in two existing, prospective registries of asymptomatic patients with available coronary calcium scans, clinical data, and followup for cardiac events (myocardial infarction, cardiac death, late revascularization). These rich resources are: the Early Identification of Subclinical Atherosclerosis Using Non-Invasive Imaging Research [EISNER] registry (2614 patients) and the St. Francis Heart Study (4613 patients). We propose three specific aims: 1) To develop and evaluate the accuracy and reproducibility of new computational algorithms for automated quantification of EAT measures; 2) To evaluate the prognostic value of automatically-quantified EAT features, relative to atherosclerotic plaque burden and measures of obesity, for the prediction of future cardiac events in asymptomatic patients in the EISNER registry and the St. Francis Heart Study; 3) To derive and evaluate a new, integrated risk score—combining standard risk factors, coronary calcium score and EAT measures using machine learning—for the prediction of future cardiac events in the EISNER registry, and further, to additionally evaluate this risk score externally in the St. Francis Heart Study patient cohort.  This work in this proposal will provide a novel, personalized paradigm that will objectively and accurately identify asymptomatic patients undergoing coronary calcium scanning who are at increased risk for future cardiac events, without any additional imaging or risk to the patient. PROJECT NARRATIVE (lay language) CT scanning of the heart for coronary calcium scoring is a simple, widely-used, low-cost test with low radiation dose. Using these scans, the researchers propose to establish automated analysis of fat which surrounds the heart, as well as novel computerized scores that identify the patients who are at highest risk of suffering a heart attack. This new research will allow doctors to better identify patients for whom appropriate treatment could be prescribed, to avoid a heart attack or sudden cardiac death.",Automated quantitative CT imaging of epicardial adipose tissue and risk of cardiac events,9310380,R01HL133616,"['Acute myocardial infarction', 'Adipose tissue', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Arterial Fatty Streak', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Calcium', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Death', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Categories', 'Cause of Death', 'Clinical Data', 'Cohort Studies', 'Computational algorithm', 'Coronary', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Coronary artery', 'Data', 'Development', 'Dose', 'Early identification', 'Event', 'Expressed Sequence Tags', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Future', 'Heart', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Inflammation Mediators', 'Institution', 'Interleukin-1 beta', 'Interleukin-6', 'Language', 'Length', 'Lipids', 'Low Dose Radiation', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Obesity', 'Patients', 'Population', 'Reader', 'Registries', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk stratification', 'Scanning', 'Source', 'Standardization', 'Stenosis', 'Symptoms', 'TNF gene', 'Testing', 'Trees', 'Visceral', 'Woman', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'computerized', 'cost', 'density', 'experience', 'heart imaging', 'high risk', 'image processing', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'indexing', 'learning strategy', 'men', 'non-invasive imaging', 'novel', 'pericardial sac', 'predictive marker', 'prognostic value', 'prospective', 'routine imaging', 'sudden cardiac death']",NHLBI,CEDARS-SINAI MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2017,653101,0.15439013792027523
"High Performance Automated System for Analysis of Fast Cardiac SPECT DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Coronary artery disease remains a major public health problem worldwide. It causes approximately 1 of every 6 deaths in the United States. Imaging of myocardial perfusion (delivery of blood to the heart muscle) by myocardial perfusion single photon emission tomography (MPS) allows physicians to detect disease before a heart attack, and predict risk in millions of patients annually. This is currently limited by the need fo visual interpretation, which is highly variable and depends on the physician's experience. The long-term objective of this program is to improve the interpretation of this widely used heart imaging technique-achieving higher accuracy for disease detection than it is possible by the best attainable visual analysis. This proposal builds on our prior work in conventional myocardial MPS, and focuses on fast, low-radiation MPS imaging (fast-MPS) obtained by new high-efficiency scanners. Specifically, we aim to: 1) develop new image processing algorithms for a fully automated analysis of fast-MPS. The algorithms will include better heart muscle detection by training with correlated anatomical data and a novel approach for mapping the probability of abnormal perfusion for each location of the heart muscle; 2) enhance the diagnosis of heart disease from fast-MPS by machine- learning algorithms that integrate clinical data, stress test parameters, and quantitative image features; 3) demonstrate the clinical utility of the new algorithms applied to automatic canceling of the rest portion of the MPS scan, when not needed. The new system will be more accurate than the clinical expert analysis in the detection of obstructive coronary disease. By immediately indicating whether a stress scan is normal, the system will allow for the automatic cancellation of the rest imaging portion when it is not needed (estimated in over 60% of all MPS studies). Our research will demonstrate that the computer decision regarding rest-scan cancellation is safe for the patient, both from a diagnostic and prognostic standpoint. This will lead to a wide adoption of low-dose stress-only imaging for MPS studies, which would reduce the amount of radiation that patients are exposed to, and allow for significant healthcare savings. It will additionally lead to a paradigm shift in the practice of nuclear cardiology, which will ultimately result in better selection of patients who need intervention, and reduce the number of deaths due coronary artery disease. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Imaging of myocardial perfusion (heart muscle blood flow) at rest and stress allows physicians to detect disease and predict risk in millions of patients in the US each year, but it is currently limited by the need of visual interpretation, which is dependent on doctor's experience. The investigators propose to develop and validate an automated, highly-accurate and objective computer system which will outperform even experienced physicians in interpreting these images using latest generation scanners and novel machine learning computer tools. The computer will be able to better select patients needing treatment and automatically indicate the normal stress-scan immediately, and more accurately than physicians allowing automatic cancellation of the rest imaging, when not needed; this will result in large healthcare savings and reduced radiation to the patients.",High Performance Automated System for Analysis of Fast Cardiac SPECT,9282634,R01HL089765,"['Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Blood', 'Blood flow', 'Cardiology', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Collimator', 'Complex', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Coronary Angiography', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Coronary heart disease', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Generations', 'Grant', 'Healthcare', 'Heart Diseases', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Industry', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methods', 'Mitral Valve', 'Multicenter Studies', 'Myocardial', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Myocardial perfusion', 'Myocardium', 'Nuclear', 'Patient Selection', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Perfusion', 'Photons', 'Physicians', 'Probability', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Radiation', 'Reader', 'Reading', 'Recovery', 'Registries', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Savings', 'Scanning', 'Site', 'Stress', 'Stress Tests', 'System', 'Systems Analysis', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'United States', 'Visual', 'Work', 'attenuation', 'base', 'cardiac single photon emission computed tomography', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'clinical imaging', 'computer generated', 'cost', 'detector', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'experience', 'heart imaging', 'image processing', 'improved', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'patient population', 'prognostic', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'quantitative imaging', 'reconstruction', 'single photon emission computed tomography', 'solid state', 'tomography', 'tool']",NHLBI,CEDARS-SINAI MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2017,600120,0.05513306353496703
"Cardiovascular Imaging in Ischemic Heart Disease Project Summary/Abstract The applicant Udo Hoffmann MD MPH is a Professor of Radiology at Harvard Medical School and the Chief of the Division for Cardiovascular Imaging in the Department of Radiology at MGH. Dr. Hoffmann has established a patient oriented research (POR) program that combines innovative translational, clinical, and outcomes research methods to demonstrate the value of advanced cardiovascular imaging. Dr. Hoffmann has published approximately 380 peer reviewed papers, among them many in premier medical journals and has received continued independent, peer-reviewed POR NIH funding since 2005. He is among the very few faculty members at Harvard Medical School who are both the PI and Director of a highly successful NHLBI funded T- 32 program (Cardiac MR and CT Research) and a recipient of a K24. Dr. Hoffmann has successfully mentored more than 60 clinical investigators, most of which currently hold faculty positions in major academic centers and actively perform POR. Moreover, Dr. Hoffmann has successfully accomplished all mentoring and scientific goals of the first K24 award period. Overall, these achievements document Dr. Hoffmann's long standing passion and commitment to POR. His excellent publication, funding, and mentoring record together with his current and planned research support provide an excellent foundation to accomplish the aims of this competitive renewal of the K24 Award “Cardiovascular Imaging in Ischemic Heart Disease”. Dr. Hoffmann proposes a mentoring and research plan that utilizes the synergies of past, ongoing, and future highly innovative independent research projects with educational and training opportunities offered by the cardiac MR CT PET Program, the T32 training program in cardiovascular imaging, the Harvard CTSA, and the Harvard School of Public Health. The specific aims addressing the charge of the K24 Award are to enable Dr. Hoffmann to: 1) dedicate 25% of his time to mentor clinical investigators based on NIH or equivalent funded projects in “Cardiovascular Imaging in Ischemic Heart Disease”, 2) to mentor junior and mid-career clinical investigators with the goal to develop them into clinical researchers who can successfully compete for peer reviewed grants, and 3) to continue to expand a POR program that combines translational, clinical, and outcomes research to develop future leaders in clinical research in cardiovascular imaging and beyond. The research plan encompasses four specific aims: 1) To determine the effects of statin treatment on coronary atherosclerosis in HIV patients in 800 patients with HIV randomized to statin therapy vs. placebo, 2) To determine whether high risk coronary plaque predicts cardiovascular events in 4600 patients with clinical suspicion of CAD, 3) To determine the cost effectiveness of CT FFR in patients with stable and acute chest pain, and 4) To use Radiomics to identify novel imaging markers predicting cardiovascular events in participants of the Framingham Heart Study. Narrative This research takes advantage of a rich body of independent funded research in “Cardiovascular Imaging in Ischemic Heart Disease”. It will permit Dr. Hoffmann to dedicate 25% of his time to mentor junior clinical investigators from the T32 program and the pool of residents, fellows, and junior faculty in Cardiology and Radiology with the goal to develop them into clinical researchers who can successfully compete for peer reviewed grants. In addition, it will allow to expand a patient orientated research program that combines innovative translational, clinical, and outcomes research in cardiovascular imaging and that provides an ideal environment to develop future leaders in clinical research.",Cardiovascular Imaging in Ischemic Heart Disease,9314834,K24HL113128,"['Achievement', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Age', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents', 'Anti-inflammatory', 'Area', 'Blood Vessels', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiology', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Charge', 'Chest Pain', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical/Radiologic', 'Coronary', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Data', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Evaluation Studies', 'Event', 'Faculty', 'Foundations', 'Framingham Heart Study', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'HIV', 'Journals', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Mentors', 'Mid-Career Clinical Scientist Award (K24)', 'Myocardial Ischemia', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Natural History', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Paper', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Peer Review', 'Peer Review Grants', 'Placebos', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Public Health Schools', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Research Support', 'Risk stratification', 'Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training Programs', 'Translational Research', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'base', 'cardiovascular imaging', 'career', 'comparative effectiveness', 'cost', 'cost effectiveness', 'effectiveness trial', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'markov model', 'medical schools', 'member', 'novel', 'patient oriented research', 'predictive marker', 'prevent', 'professor', 'programs', 'prospective', 'radiomics', 'randomized trial', 'repository', 'sex', 'skills', 'synergism', 'training opportunity']",NHLBI,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,K24,2017,121969,0.05707415129981189
"Comprehensive Cardiac Structure-Function Analysis in Heart Transplantation DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Heart transplant (Tx) surgery is a well-established life-saving procedure, but is associated with post- interventional risks such as acute cardiac rejection (ACR) which is one of the leading causes of death in the first year after transplant. Beyond the first year, cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV) is the single greatest risk factor for 5-year mortality. Monitoring the patient for post-transplant events is thus paramount. The standard monitoring strategy, however, relies on frequent (12-16 monitoring nodes during year 1 alone) invasive and costly procedures including endomyocardial biopsies (EMB) and catheter angiography. Since EMB and catheter angiography have limited sensitivity due to sampling errors (ACR) or the diffuse nature of the disease (CAV), a reliable non-invasive alternative for the early detection of ACR and CAV would be desirable to reduce the need for invasive procedures, improve sensitivity, and reduce cost. We have recently developed and applied cardiac MRI techniques for the non-invasive assessment of myocardial edema (T2-mapping), diffuse fibrosis (pre- and post-contrast T1-mapping), myocardial velocities (tissue phase mapping), and microvascular quantitative perfusion. We have shown that these techniques can identify distinct regional structural and functional alterations in the heart that correlate with te status of the allograft. Based on these findings, a detailed cost-effective analysis using Markov modeling and decision tree analysis has demonstrated that cardiac MR has tremendous potential to reduce monitoring costs by 40-50% during the first year after Tx alone. This proposal builds on these promising findings and our aim is to develop an new 15-minute structure-function cardiac MRI protocol for the improved detection regional abnormalities associated with ACR (edema, fibrosis, dysfunction) and CAV (perfusion, dysfunction). Integration of MRI with echocardiography and intravascular Ultrasound (IVUS) will provide unique multi-modality assessment of the allograft. The application in a longitudinal clinical study coupled with state-of-the-art cost-effectiveness analysis will allow redefining the most effective post-Tx mixed monitoring strategy. The aim is to to help clinicians identify the optimal mixed monitoring strategy, i.e. the optimal combination of multi-modality imaging (structure-function MRI, echo, IVUS) and invasive procedures (EMB, catheter angiography) which provide best outcome (quality adjusted life days) and lowest cost for the individual cardiac transplant patient. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We propose to develop a multi-modality imaging protocol for the non-invasive characterization of tissue and function of the left and right heart in patients after heart transplantation. Our aim is to develop a new non- invasive 15 minute diagnostic test in order to provide a previously unattainable quantitative characterization of myocardial structure-function deficits in cardiac transplant patients. The application in a longitudinal clinial study coupled with cost-effectiveness analysis and decision tree modeling will allow to improve current monitoring strategies by combining cardiac MRI, echocardiography, intravascular ultrasound and invasive tests (biopsy, catheter angiography) to provide the best outcome (quality of life days, mortality) and lowest cost for the individual cardiac transplant patient.",Comprehensive Cardiac Structure-Function Analysis in Heart Transplantation,9229057,R01HL117888,"['Acute', 'Allografting', 'Ambulatory Care Facilities', 'Angiography', 'Area', 'Biopsy', 'Blood Vessels', 'Cardiac', 'Catheters', 'Cause of Death', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Coronary', 'Coronary Angiography', 'Cost Effectiveness Analysis', 'Cost utility', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Decision Modeling', 'Decision Trees', 'Detection', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Diffuse', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Echocardiography', 'Edema', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Fibrosis', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Healthcare', 'Heart', 'Heart Transplantation', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Left', 'Life', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Myocardial', 'Nature', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patients', 'Perfusion', 'Phase', 'Procedures', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quality of life', 'Reference Standards', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling Errors', 'Savings', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Transplant Recipients', 'Transplantation', 'Ultrasonography', 'Vascular Diseases', 'Visit', 'base', 'comparative cost effectiveness', 'cost', 'extracellular', 'follow-up', 'heart allograft', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'markov model', 'mortality', 'non-invasive imaging', 'novel', 'post intervention', 'public health relevance', 'standard of care', 'two-arm study']",NHLBI,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R01,2017,680651,0.12802526378531956
"Gastrointestinal Safety of Antithrombotic Drug Regimens ABSTRACT Patients with atrial fibrillation, post-acute coronary syndrome and venous thromboembolism are prescribed antithrombotic drugs (antiplatelet agents and oral anticoagulants) in dual and triple combinations. These drugs independently cause gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) from mucosal defects or vascular abnormalities of the gastrointestinal tract. Cardiac patients are the fastest growing at-risk group due to the rapidly aging US population, their high-burden of co-morbidity, frequent antithrombotic polypharmacy and prescription of new antithrombotic drugs with higher incidence of GI adverse events. The real-world GIB risk of antithrombotic agents used in combination in a diverse cardiac population has yet to be characterized. Furthermore, we have previously demonstrated poor performance of existing risk scores (HAS-BLED, CHA2DS2-VASC etc.) for the prediction of non- warfarin antithrombotic drug bleeding; scores frequently used in the clinical setting despite their inaccuracy. Absence of knowledge regarding the real-world risk of antithrombotic-GIB, and the inability to accurately predict which patients will bleed, hampers patient counselling regarding a frequently occurring adverse event which is known to cause morbidity and mortality among cardiac patients. We propose to fill this knowledge gap by quantifying GIB risk in a large, geographically diverse cohort of elderly and non-elderly cardiac patients with atrial fibrillation, venous thromboembolism or post-acute coronary syndrome. GIB associated with antithrombotic drug combinations will be stratified by underlying cardiac conditions; incidence rates (events/100 patient-years) and propensity-matched Cox proportional models (with 95% confidence intervals) will be used to estimate outcome. We will examine heterogeneity of safety effects related to age, chronic co-morbidity, and hepatic or renal dysfunction. Machine learning techniques will then be used to derive and validate a highly sensitive algorithm for the prediction of antithrombotic-related GIB. Discovery of such an algorithm is the first step in the future application of a predictive model in any evidence-based clinical delivery platform, such as a decision rule or risk calculator. NARRATIVE Gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) in cardiac patients is common, deadly and on the rise due to an older population, antiplatelet and anticoagulant drugs used in combination, and availability of new drugs with higher GIB risk than their predecessors. Lack of data regarding the magnitude of GIB and limited knowledge of which patients are most at risk, prevents accurate counselling regarding cardiac drug safety. We will quantify this risk, study risk factors; and use machine learning techniques to derive and validate a clinical algorithm to better predict at-risk patients.",Gastrointestinal Safety of Antithrombotic Drug Regimens,9365658,R01HS025402,[' '],AHRQ,MAYO CLINIC ARIZONA,R01,2017,400000,0.07364789180476361

"Automated quantitative CT imaging of epicardial adipose tissue and risk of cardiac events PROJECT SUMMARY Coronary artery disease remains the leading cause of death worldwide, and more than half of the individuals suffering acute myocardial infarction have no prior symptoms. Coronary calcium scoring with non-contrast CT is increasingly used for cardiovascular risk stratification in the asymptomatic population. Epicardial adipose tissue (EAT), a local visceral fat depot surrounding the heart, has been recently reported as a significant imaging biomarker for cardiovascular risk stratification. Despite being routinely imaged noninvasively by non-contrast cardiac CT for coronary calcium scoring, EAT features are currently not measured or reported, primarily due to the absence of robust, automated quantification methods.  We propose to employ novel image processing algorithms to achieve fully automated, robust quantification of EAT features from cardiac CT, and to apply machine learning methods to efficiently combine patient clinical data, coronary calcium and EAT features into a new integrated risk score to predict future cardiac events. We will evaluate this risk score in two existing, prospective registries of asymptomatic patients with available coronary calcium scans, clinical data, and followup for cardiac events (myocardial infarction, cardiac death, late revascularization). These rich resources are: the Early Identification of Subclinical Atherosclerosis Using Non-Invasive Imaging Research [EISNER] registry (2614 patients) and the St. Francis Heart Study (4613 patients). We propose three specific aims: 1) To develop and evaluate the accuracy and reproducibility of new computational algorithms for automated quantification of EAT measures; 2) To evaluate the prognostic value of automatically-quantified EAT features, relative to atherosclerotic plaque burden and measures of obesity, for the prediction of future cardiac events in asymptomatic patients in the EISNER registry and the St. Francis Heart Study; 3) To derive and evaluate a new, integrated risk score—combining standard risk factors, coronary calcium score and EAT measures using machine learning—for the prediction of future cardiac events in the EISNER registry, and further, to additionally evaluate this risk score externally in the St. Francis Heart Study patient cohort.  This work in this proposal will provide a novel, personalized paradigm that will objectively and accurately identify asymptomatic patients undergoing coronary calcium scanning who are at increased risk for future cardiac events, without any additional imaging or risk to the patient. PROJECT NARRATIVE (lay language) CT scanning of the heart for coronary calcium scoring is a simple, widely-used, low-cost test with low radiation dose. Using these scans, the researchers propose to establish automated analysis of fat which surrounds the heart, as well as novel computerized scores that identify the patients who are at highest risk of suffering a heart attack. This new research will allow doctors to better identify patients for whom appropriate treatment could be prescribed, to avoid a heart attack or sudden cardiac death.",Automated quantitative CT imaging of epicardial adipose tissue and risk of cardiac events,9159185,R01HL133616,"['Acute myocardial infarction', 'Adipose tissue', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Arterial Fatty Streak', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Calcium', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Death', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Categories', 'Cause of Death', 'Clinical Data', 'Cohort Studies', 'Computational algorithm', 'Coronary', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Coronary artery', 'Data', 'Development', 'Dose', 'Early identification', 'Event', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Future', 'Heart', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Inflammation Mediators', 'Institution', 'Interleukin-1 beta', 'Interleukin-6', 'Investigation', 'Language', 'Length', 'Lipids', 'Low Dose Radiation', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Obesity', 'Patients', 'Population', 'Process', 'Reader', 'Registries', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Scanning', 'Source', 'Stenosis', 'Stratification', 'Symptoms', 'TNF gene', 'Testing', 'Trees', 'Visceral', 'Woman', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'computerized', 'cost', 'density', 'experience', 'high risk', 'image processing', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'indexing', 'learning strategy', 'men', 'non-invasive imaging', 'novel', 'pericardial sac', 'predictive marker', 'prognostic value', 'prospective', 'sudden cardiac death']",NHLBI,CEDARS-SINAI MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2016,671851,0.15439013792027523
"Comprehensive Cardiac Structure-Function Analysis in Heart Transplantation DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Heart transplant (Tx) surgery is a well-established life-saving procedure, but is associated with post- interventional risks such as acute cardiac rejection (ACR) which is one of the leading causes of death in the first year after transplant. Beyond the first year, cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV) is the single greatest risk factor for 5-year mortality. Monitoring the patient for post-transplant events is thus paramount. The standard monitoring strategy, however, relies on frequent (12-16 monitoring nodes during year 1 alone) invasive and costly procedures including endomyocardial biopsies (EMB) and catheter angiography. Since EMB and catheter angiography have limited sensitivity due to sampling errors (ACR) or the diffuse nature of the disease (CAV), a reliable non-invasive alternative for the early detection of ACR and CAV would be desirable to reduce the need for invasive procedures, improve sensitivity, and reduce cost. We have recently developed and applied cardiac MRI techniques for the non-invasive assessment of myocardial edema (T2-mapping), diffuse fibrosis (pre- and post-contrast T1-mapping), myocardial velocities (tissue phase mapping), and microvascular quantitative perfusion. We have shown that these techniques can identify distinct regional structural and functional alterations in the heart that correlate with te status of the allograft. Based on these findings, a detailed cost-effective analysis using Markov modeling and decision tree analysis has demonstrated that cardiac MR has tremendous potential to reduce monitoring costs by 40-50% during the first year after Tx alone. This proposal builds on these promising findings and our aim is to develop an new 15-minute structure-function cardiac MRI protocol for the improved detection regional abnormalities associated with ACR (edema, fibrosis, dysfunction) and CAV (perfusion, dysfunction). Integration of MRI with echocardiography and intravascular Ultrasound (IVUS) will provide unique multi-modality assessment of the allograft. The application in a longitudinal clinical study coupled with state-of-the-art cost-effectiveness analysis will allow redefining the most effective post-Tx mixed monitoring strategy. The aim is to to help clinicians identify the optimal mixed monitoring strategy, i.e. the optimal combination of multi-modality imaging (structure-function MRI, echo, IVUS) and invasive procedures (EMB, catheter angiography) which provide best outcome (quality adjusted life days) and lowest cost for the individual cardiac transplant patient. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We propose to develop a multi-modality imaging protocol for the non-invasive characterization of tissue and function of the left and right heart in patients after heart transplantation. Our aim is to develop a new non- invasive 15 minute diagnostic test in order to provide a previously unattainable quantitative characterization of myocardial structure-function deficits in cardiac transplant patients.

"Innovative MRI-based Characterization of Cardiac Dyssynchrony ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cardiac dyssynchrony deteriorates cardiac function and often cannot be treated effectively. The goal of this proposal is to develop and provide a new analysis technique for understanding the complex cardiac motion patterns (in time and space) of patients with cardiac dyssynchrony, with the hope of improving its treatment outcomes, specifically with respect to cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT). CRT, the most effective treatment for dyssynchrony with worsening heart failure, significantly improves outcome in only ~66% of heart failure patients selected for the treatment, which is based on ECG criteria. Selection criteria based on imaging are essential to improving the success rate. Unfortunately, response rates are not higher with selection criteria based on echocardiography, the most popular cardiac imaging technique. Cine cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) has the potential to better characterize dyssynchrony, as it shows cardiac mechanics and intramural wall motion with much higher spatial resolution than echocardiography. However, quantitative assessments of CMR have been mostly limited to global volumetric measures, which ignore most of the motion information captured by the images. For example, studies of a number of distinctive motion features of dyssynchrony (such as septal flash and apical rocking) have been confined to qualitative assessment, limiting inference of their potential utility for improving CRT treatment. To accurately quantify cardiac function through CMR, we have developed biomechanical models for describing cardiac function and machine learning technology for identifying morphological and functional patterns atypical for healthy hearts. We propose to combine these two technologies to accurately quantify cardiac dyssynchrony within the Left Ventricle (LV). Specifically, our methods will extract a rich description of LV motion and strain from the CMRs of a set of retrospectively selected subjects with synchronous or dyssynchronous LV motion. We will then use machine learning methods to identify local and global motion patterns specific to dyssynchrony. Finally, we will correlate these patterns to already existing clinical scores to find potentially predictive markers with respect to CRT outcome. We hypothesize that these markers will have a higher correlation to CRT outcome than current clinical markers alone. Identifying these markers will have the potential to further stratify the disease with respect to the expected outcome of CRT, which then can be used to derive new selection criteria that lead to higher success rates. The project will also disseminate our novel, data-driven methodology for quantifying that motion. Other research groups can apply our tools to specifically study dyssynchrony, as well as other cardiac diseases impacting LV motion in general.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: A significant proportion of patients with heart failure and cardiac dyssynchrony fail to positively respond to cardiac resynchronization therapy, as the current clinical selection criteria are too broad.

"Computer-aided detection of non-calcified plaques in coronary CT angiograms   Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in both men and women in the United States. Over 16 million Americans have coronary heart disease (CHD), causing about 0.5 million deaths each year. The most common CHD is coronary artery disease which is mainly caused by atherosclerosis. Clinical evidence in recent years shows that noncalcified plaques (NCPs) are more vulnerable to rupture than calcified plaques. Plaque rupture and the thrombosis that follows is the main cause of acute myocardial infarction. Multidetector coronary CT angiography (cCTA) has the potential to help clinicians in early detection and in quantification of NCPs. cCTA may thus be useful for CHD detection, risk stratification, monitoring, and evaluation of the effectiveness of risk reduction treatment. However, many of these potential applications have not been utilized clinically.  The goal of this project is to develop a computer-aided detection (CADe) system to serve as a second reader for assisting clinicians in detection and quantification of NCPs in cCTA exams. Our specific aims are to (1) develop machine learning methods for detection of NCPs causing stenosis and/or positive remodeling along coronary arteries, and (2) evaluate the effect of CADe on radiologists' detection of NCPs on cCTA by observer ROC study. To achieve these aims, we will collect a database of cCTA cases for training and testing the CADe system, define the search space by designing 3D multiscale coronary artery response enhancement, segmentation, and dynamic balloon vessel tracking methods, develop a unique vessel- stitching method to automatically identify the best-quality phase for each individual artery segment from all available phases in prospectively or retrospectively gated cCTA exams, develop innovative vessel-sector- profile analysis and vessel lumen analysis to detect NCPs that cause stenosis or positive remodeling, estimate the total NCP volume, and explore calibration method to quantify plaque density by phantom studies. To demonstrate the usefulness of CADe, a preclinical reader study will be conducted to compare radiologists' detection accuracy of NCPs with and without CADe.  The major innovations of this project include (1) being the first CADe system to automatically detect non-calcified plaques including those cause positive remodeling or stenosis in cCTA, (2) development of new machine learning techniques including the vessel-stitching method, vessel-sector-profile analysis, multiscale enhancement response, and dynamic balloon tracking specifically suited for coronary arterial trees, and (3) conducting the first ROC study to evaluate the effect of CADe on radiologists' detection of NCPs.  Narrative:  Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in both men and women in the United States. If the proposed CADe system is successfully developed, it will (1) provide an accurate, efficient, and consistent tool to assist clinicians in detecting and quantifying non-calcified plaques (NCP) including those causing positive remodeling and/or stenosis for an individual patient, (2) help clinicians estimate the total NCP burden and study its significance, in analogy to that of the total calcium score, which may lead to improved clinical management of the vulnerable plaques, and (3) accelerate studies to develop new treatment options of coronary heart disease by providing a monitoring tool of treatment response. The proposed CADe system can thus serve as a foundation for these broader future applications and improve the efficacy of cCTA. Improved detection and management of NCPs may reduce the risk of myocardial infarctions and will have strong and long-lasting impact on health care.",Computer-aided detection of non-calcified plaques in coronary CT angiograms,8586273,R01HL106545,"['Acute myocardial infarction', 'American', 'Angiography', 'Arterial Fatty Streak', 'Arteries', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Calcified', 'Calcium', 'Calibration', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Catheters', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Coronary', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Coronary artery', 'Coronary heart disease', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Dose', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Effectiveness', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Monitor', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Procedures', 'Radiation', 'Reader', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Recording of previous events', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Risk Reduction', 'Rupture', 'Scanning', 'Stenosis', 'Stratification', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thrombosis', 'Time', 'Training', 'Trees', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States', 'Visual', 'Woman', 'computer aided detection', 'density', 'design', 'detector', 'improved', 'innovation', 'men', 'pre-clinical', 'prospective', 'radiologist', 'response', 'tool', 'treatment response', 'virtual']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2014,610289,0.02302235721630304

By immediately indicating whether a stress scan is normal, the system will allow for the automatic cancellation of the rest imaging portion when it is not needed (estimated in over 60% of all MPS studies). Our research will demonstrate that the computer decision regarding rest-scan cancellation is safe for the patient, both from a diagnostic and prognostic standpoint. This will lead to a wide adoption of low-dose stress-only imaging for MPS studies, which would reduce the amount of radiation that patients are exposed to, and allow for significant healthcare savings. It will additionally lead to a paradigm shift in the practice of nuclear cardiology, which will ultimately result in better selection of patients who need intervention, and reduce the number of deaths due coronary artery disease.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Imaging of myocardial perfusion (heart muscle blood flow) at rest and stress allows physicians to detect disease and predict risk in millions of patients in the US each year, but it is currently limited by the need of visual interpretation, which is dependent on doctor's experience. The investigators propose to develop and validate an automated, highly-accurate and objective computer system which will outperform even experienced physicians in interpreting these images using latest generation scanners and novel machine learning computer tools. The computer will be able to better select patients needing treatment and automatically indicate the normal stress-scan immediately, and more accurately than physicians allowing automatic cancellation of the rest imaging, when not needed; this will result in large healthcare savings and reduced radiation to the patients.            ",High Performance Automated System for Analysis of Fast Cardiac SPECT,8762268,R01HL089765,"['Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Blood', 'Blood flow', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiology', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Computer Systems', 'Computers', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Coronary heart disease', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Generations', 'Healthcare', 'Heart Diseases', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Myocardial', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Myocardial perfusion', 'Myocardium', 'Nuclear', 'Patient Selection', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Perfusion', 'Photons', 'Physicians', 'Probability', 'Public Health', 'Radiation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Savings', 'Scanning', 'Stress', 'Stress Tests', 'System', 'Systems Analysis', 'Training', 'United States', 'Visual', 'Work', 'experience', 'heart imaging', 'image processing', 'improved', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'prognostic', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'single photon emission computed tomography', 'tomography', 'tool']",NHLBI,CEDARS-SINAI MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2014,653934,0.05513306353496703
"Comprehensive Cardiac Structure-Function Analysis in Heart Transplantation  SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Heart transplant (Tx) surgery is a well-established life-saving procedure, but is associated with post- interventional risks such as acute cardiac rejection (ACR) which is one of the leading causes of death in the first year after transplant. Beyond the first year, cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV) is the single greatest risk factor for 5-year mortality. Monitoring the patient for post-transplant events is thus paramount. The standard monitoring strategy, however, relies on frequent (12-16 monitoring nodes during year 1 alone) invasive and costly procedures including endomyocardial biopsies (EMB) and catheter angiography. Since EMB and catheter angiography have limited sensitivity due to sampling errors (ACR) or the diffuse nature of the disease (CAV), a reliable non-invasive alternative for the early detection of ACR and CAV would be desirable to reduce the need for invasive procedures, improve sensitivity, and reduce cost. We have recently developed and applied cardiac MRI techniques for the non-invasive assessment of myocardial edema (T2-mapping), diffuse fibrosis (pre- and post-contrast T1-mapping), myocardial velocities (tissue phase mapping), and microvascular quantitative perfusion. We have shown that these techniques can identify distinct regional structural and functional alterations in the heart that correlate with the status of the allograft. Based on these findings, a detailed cost-effective analysis using Markov modeling and decision tree analysis has demonstrated that cardiac MR has tremendous potential to reduce monitoring costs by 40-50% during the first year after Tx alone. This proposal builds on these promising findings and our aim is to develop an new 15-minute structure-function cardiac MRI protocol for the improved detection regional abnormalities associated with ACR (edema, fibrosis, dysfunction) and CAV (perfusion, dysfunction). Integration of MRI with echocardiography and intravascular Ultrasound (IVUS) will provide unique multi-modality assessment of the allograft. The application in a longitudinal clinical study coupled with state-of-the-art cost-effectiveness analysis will allow redefining the most effective post-Tx mixed monitoring strategy. The aim is to to help clinicians identify the optimal mixed monitoring strategy, i.e. the optimal combination of multi-modality imaging (structure-function MRI, echo, IVUS) and invasive procedures (EMB, catheter angiography) which provide best outcome (quality adjusted life days) and lowest cost for the individual cardiac transplant patient. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We propose to develop a multi-modality imaging protocol for the non-invasive characterization of tissue and function of the left and right heart in patients after heart transplantation. Our aim is to develop a new non- invasive 15 minute diagnostic test in order to provide a previously unattainable quantitative characterization of myocardial structure-function deficits in cardiac transplant patients. The application in a longitudinal clinial study coupled with cost-effectiveness analysis and decision tree modeling will allow to improve current monitoring strategies by combining cardiac MRI, echocardiography, intravascular ultrasound and invasive tests (biopsy, catheter angiography) to provide the best outcome (quality of life days, mortality) and lowest cost for the individual cardiac transplant patient.            ",Comprehensive Cardiac Structure-Function Analysis in Heart Transplantation,8630169,R01HL117888,"['Acute', 'Allografting', 'Ambulatory Care Facilities', 'Angiography', 'Area', 'Biopsy', 'Blood Vessels', 'Cardiac', 'Caring', 'Catheters', 'Cause of Death', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Coronary', 'Coronary Angiography', 'Cost Effectiveness Analysis', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Decision Modeling', 'Decision Trees', 'Detection', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Diffuse', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Echocardiography', 'Edema', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Fibrosis', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Healthcare', 'Heart', 'Heart Transplantation', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Left', 'Life', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Myocardial', 'Nature', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patients', 'Perfusion', 'Phase', 'Procedures', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quality of life', 'Reference Standards', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk Marker', 'Sampling Errors', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Transplant Recipients', 'Transplantation', 'Ultrasonography', 'Vascular Diseases', 'Visit', 'base', 'comparative', 'cost', 'cost effectiveness', 'extracellular', 'follow-up', 'heart allograft', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'markov model', 'mortality', 'non-invasive imaging', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'two-arm study']",NHLBI,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R01,2014,467351,0.12655937541320758
"Computer-aided detection of non-calcified plaques in coronary CT angiograms   Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in both men and women in the United States. Over 16 million Americans have coronary heart disease (CHD), causing about 0.5 million deaths each year. The most common CHD is coronary artery disease which is mainly caused by atherosclerosis. Clinical evidence in recent years shows that noncalcified plaques (NCPs) are more vulnerable to rupture than calcified plaques. Plaque rupture and the thrombosis that follows is the main cause of acute myocardial infarction. Multidetector coronary CT angiography (cCTA) has the potential to help clinicians in early detection and in quantification of NCPs. cCTA may thus be useful for CHD detection, risk stratification, monitoring, and evaluation of the effectiveness of risk reduction treatment. However, many of these potential applications have not been utilized clinically.  The goal of this project is to develop a computer-aided detection (CADe) system to serve as a second reader for assisting clinicians in detection and quantification of NCPs in cCTA exams. Our specific aims are to (1) develop machine learning methods for detection of NCPs causing stenosis and/or positive remodeling along coronary arteries, and (2) evaluate the effect of CADe on radiologists' detection of NCPs on cCTA by observer ROC study. To achieve these aims, we will collect a database of cCTA cases for training and testing the CADe system, define the search space by designing 3D multiscale coronary artery response enhancement, segmentation, and dynamic balloon vessel tracking methods, develop a unique vessel- stitching method to automatically identify the best-quality phase for each individual artery segment from all available phases in prospectively or retrospectively gated cCTA exams, develop innovative vessel-sector- profile analysis and vessel lumen analysis to detect NCPs that cause stenosis or positive remodeling, estimate the total NCP volume, and explore calibration method to quantify plaque density by phantom studies. To demonstrate the usefulness of CADe, a preclinical reader study will be conducted to compare radiologists' detection accuracy of NCPs with and without CADe.  The major innovations of this project include (1) being the first CADe system to automatically detect non-calcified plaques including those cause positive remodeling or stenosis in cCTA, (2) development of new machine learning techniques including the vessel-stitching method, vessel-sector-profile analysis, multiscale enhancement response, and dynamic balloon tracking specifically suited for coronary arterial trees, and (3) conducting the first ROC study to evaluate the effect of CADe on radiologists' detection of NCPs.  Narrative:  Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in both men and women in the United States. If the proposed CADe system is successfully developed, it will (1) provide an accurate, efficient, and consistent tool to assist clinicians in detecting and quantifying non-calcified plaques (NCP) including those causing positive remodeling and/or stenosis for an individual patient, (2) help clinicians estimate the total NCP burden and study its significance, in analogy to that of the total calcium score, which may lead to improved clinical management of the vulnerable plaques, and (3) accelerate studies to develop new treatment options of coronary heart disease by providing a monitoring tool of treatment response. The proposed CADe system can thus serve as a foundation for these broader future applications and improve the efficacy of cCTA.

"Exploring the Feasibility of Computational Markers to Predict Atrial Fibrillation    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Postoperative atrial fibrillation (PAF) affects a large fraction of patients undergoing cardiac surgery. It is associated with increased postoperative mortality and morbidity, and also results in longer and more expensive hospital stays. While treatments such as prophylactic administration of beta-adrenergic blockers and amiodarone can reduce the incidence of PAF, existing tools to match patients to treatments that are appropriate for their risk need to be improved. Many high-risk patients may benefit from more aggressive treatment than they receive presently. Conversely, many low-risk patients are currently treated in excess of their actual risk of developing PAF. The aim of our research is to develop novel computational markers that can be used to risk stratify patients undergoing cardiac surgery for PAF. Our research uses sophisticated signal processing and machine learning techniques to discover information in the electrocardiogram (ECG) signal related to autonomic and impulse conduction abnormalities. We describe how this information can be combined with existing metrics to identify high risk patients. In addition, we propose the creation of a large public dataset of ECG signals with detailed patient meta-data and outcomes for research by the broader scientific community on predicting PAF. The specific aims of this proposal are: (1) To develop a public database with ECG signals and detailed patient metadata for research on predictive PAF. We will collect ECG data from over 900 patients undergoing cardiac surgery at the University of Michigan Medical Center during the first 12 months of this project with an expected PAF incidence of around 30%. We will share this data and other clinical information (i.e., demographics, comorbidities, laboratory reports, information related to the procedure, and the outcome of PAF) in a de- identified manner with the broader research community through PhysioNet; and (2) To develop and validate novel ECG-based risk markers for PAF. We will explore metrics based on the sympathovagal modulation of the heart, e.g., heart rate turbulence (HRT) and deceleration capacity (DC), which have shown recent promise in predicting ventricular arrhythmias. We will also develop new metrics based on the shape of the ECG to assess atrial myocardial instability. These approaches will be validated on the data collected in Aim 1, and will be used to develop models based on non-parametric machine learning techniques to accurately assess PAF risk.           Postoperative atrial fibrillation commonly occurs in patients undergoing cardiac surgery (e.g., coronary artery bypass graft or valve repair). It is associated with an increased risk of both mortality and morbidity, and increases the cost of hospitalization significantly. Successful management of patients undergoing cardiac surgery therefore relies on the ability of clinicians to estimate the risk of postoperative atrial fibrillation, and ideally, to anticipate and prevent this event. We propose to develop low-cost, and widely applicable methods that would improve the ability of physicians to identify patients at high risk of postoperative atrial fibrillation. They key concept for this proposal is that ECG signals contain valuable information that can help predict high or low risk cases using sophisticated techniques from signal processing and machine learning. This information can be used to develop clinical tools to improve management of patients undergoing cardiac surgery. In addition to developing these tools, we also propose the creation of a large public database that can help other researchers with an interest in predicting postoperative atrial fibrillation.",Exploring the Feasibility of Computational Markers to Predict Atrial Fibrillation,8484439,R21LM011026,"['Address', 'Adrenergic beta-Antagonists', 'Adverse effects', 'Affect', 'Amiodarone', 'Arrhythmia', 'Atrial Fibrillation', 'Blinded', 'Bradycardia', 'Cardiac Surgery procedures', 'Clinical', 'Coagulation Process', 'Communities', 'Comorbidity', 'Coronary Artery Bypass', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Deceleration', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Equilibrium', 'Event', 'Heart', 'Heart Atrium', 'Heart Rate', 'Hospitalization', 'Incidence', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'Laboratories', 'Length of Stay', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical center', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Metric', 'Michigan', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Myocardial', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Postoperative Period', 'Prevention', 'Procedures', 'Prophylactic treatment', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Estimate', 'Risk Marker', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Techniques', 'Universities', 'Ventricular Arrhythmia', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'computerized data processing', 'cost', 'data sharing', 'demographics', 'high risk', 'improved', 'interest', 'millisecond', 'mortality', 'novel', 'prevent', 'prophylactic', 'repaired', 'tool', 'valve replacement']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R21,2013,152303,0.07702924862233221
"CHRiSS: Cardiac Health Risk Stratification System     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): SUMMARY This project aims to produce and beta-test a clinical decision support application for end- stage heart failure, titled CHRiSS: Cardiac Health Risk Stratification System. It will be designed for patients with progressive heart failure who may eventually become candidates for ventricular assist device (VAD) therapy. The software will be build upon existing machine learning and data mining technology, developed by the PI and colleagues, designed to predict 90-day mortality following VAD implantation. This Phase- 1 effort will entail development of graphic user interfaces for both patients and clinicians to incorporate personalized prognostic information into a functional decision-support utility. The inference algorithm will also be expanded to encompass adverse events, and risk of readmission. In this Phase-1 feasibility project, CHRiSS will be programmed and beta-tested at West Penn Allegheny Health System (WPAHS). This will entail semi- structured interviews to collect relevant expert knowledge, and mining the electronic medical records (EMR) to calibrate the prognostic algorithm to the institution-specific data. Successful completion of this Phase I project will lead to a multi-center trial in which the software is fully validated. Ultimate succes of this project will result in a software application that will optimize the benefit of VAD therapy to public health, while reducing cost by reducing the unacceptably high rate of adverse events and unnecessary readmissions.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Narrative Heart-assist devices are becoming more commonly used to treat people with severe cardiac failure - who otherwise have few options to return to a normal life. It is estimated that tens of thousands of Americans could benefit from this therapy annually; however, only a few thousand are performed per year. This project aims to develop a software application to better inform patients and doctors about the risks and benefits of this therapy. It will assist patients and doctors to work together when weighing options - with respect to both survival and quality of life. The long-term benefits would be to improve the efficiency of delivering this therapy, thereby reducing the cost, and expanding its distribution to the many people that need it.            ",CHRiSS: Cardiac Health Risk Stratification System,8592756,R41HL120428,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Adverse event', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Businesses', 'Cardiac', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Computer software', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Cost Effectiveness Analysis', 'Cost Savings', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Education', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Foundations', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health system', 'Heart failure', 'Heart-Assist Devices', 'Hospitals', 'Incidence', 'Institution', 'Intensive Care', 'Interview', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Length of Stay', 'Life', 'Life Style', 'Machine Learning', 'Marketing', 'Medical', 'Medicare', 'Methods', 'Metric', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Needs Assessment', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Postoperative Period', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Risk', 'Savings', 'Software Tools', 'Staging', 'Stratification', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Update', 'Work', 'computer human interaction', 'cost', 'data mining', 'design', 'graphical user interface', 'implantation', 'improved', 'mortality', 'outcome forecast', 'patient population', 'preference', 'prognostic', 'programs', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'satisfaction', 'success', 'tool', 'trend', 'usability', 'ventricular assist device']",NHLBI,BLENDERHOUSE,R41,2013,150000,-0.022903218171948143

If the proposed CADe system is successfully developed, it will (1) provide an accurate, efficient, and consistent tool to assist clinicians in detecting and quantifying non-calcified plaques (NCP) including those causing positive remodeling and/or stenosis for an individual patient, (2) help clinicians estimate the total NCP burden and study its significance, in analogy to that of the total calcium score, which may lead to improved clinical management of the vulnerable plaques, and (3) accelerate studies to develop new treatment options of coronary heart disease by providing a monitoring tool of treatment response.

"AUTOMATIC QUANTITATIVE CT IMAGING OF PERICARDIAL FAT: A NOVEL ISCHEMIA PREDICTOR    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Every year, 1 million people in the US will experience a heart attack or sudden cardiac death. A large percentage of these patients have no prior symptoms of any kind but suffer from silent heart disease (ischemia), which may cause a heart attack at any time. Currently there is no reliable screening method to identify people who may have silent heart disease and therefore are at risk of ""heart attack"".       We seek to extract additional data from a non-invasive Computed Tomography (CT) scan of the heart (commonly used in most imaging centers), which will better identify patients who are ""vulnerable"" to sudden heart attack. These images are acquired without contrast agents, as a common screening test for measuring coronary calcium, another clinical marker of coronary artery disease. We will prove that additional information about cardiovascular risk can be obtained by quantifying pericardial fat surrounding the heart in these cardiac CT images. Although this information exists in the cardiac CT scans acquired today, it is ignored in clinical practice because currently there are no tools to measure it automatically and reliably, and no information regarding its significance for a given patient.       We will develop fully automated, accurate, new computer software for quantitation of pericardial fat from cardiac CT images acquired for routine assessment of coronary calcium. We plan to achieve complete automation and accuracy, by applying a combination of robust and effective algorithms in machine learning with anatomical knowledge. We aim to prove that the developed automatic software will be as accurate, and more reproducible than experienced imaging physicians in quantifying pericardial fat, and will accomplish the measurement in a fraction of the time. Such software could be immediately made available worldwide to standard imaging workstations. For the first time, this will allow its use as a standard practical imaging tool for cardiovascular risk assessment, without requiring additional time, imaging or radiation risk to the patient.       We will also show that this new quantitative information has important additional value compared to other clinical cardiovascular risk factors and information from blood samples (such as cholesterol, glucose and CRP), and the amount of calcium in the patient's coronary arteries seen on CT scans, and establish its significance in the prediction of silent heart disease.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This new research will allow accurate prediction of who might be more likely to have heart disease which may ultimately cause a heart attack. It will allow doctors to identify patients for whom appropriate treatment could be prescribed to avoid a heart attack, or more extensive testing, could be recommended, to confirm or rule out heart disease.          n/a",AUTOMATIC QUANTITATIVE CT IMAGING OF PERICARDIAL FAT: A NOVEL ISCHEMIA PREDICTOR,7588839,R21EB006829,"['Abdomen', 'Algorithms', 'Automation', 'Biochemical', 'Blood specimen', 'C-reactive protein', 'Calcium', 'Cardiac', 'Cholesterol', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Markers', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer software', 'Contrast Media', 'Coronary', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Coronary artery', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Evaluation', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Glucose', 'Goals', 'Heart', 'Heart Diseases', 'Image', 'Imaging Device', 'Ischemia', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Patients', 'Pericardial body location', 'Physicians', 'Predictive Value', 'Radiation', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Scanning', 'Screening procedure', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Visceral', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'clinical practice', 'experience', 'heart imaging', 'indexing', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'sudden cardiac death', 'tool', 'waist circumference']",NIBIB,CEDARS-SINAI MEDICAL CENTER,R21,2009,196375,0.057985225837970875
"Predicting Cardiac Arrest in Pediatric Critical Illness    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The broad purpose of this proposal is to create a framework for bedside decision support to predict life threatening events before they happen. The specific hypothesis is that models predicting cardiac arrest can be generated from physiologic and laboratory data obtained in the 12 hours preceding the event using logistic regression analysis (LR) and data mining techniques such as support vector machines (SVM), neural networks (NN), Bayesian networks (BN) and decision tree classification (DTC). We further hypothesize that a support vector machine technique will yield the model with the best performance. Specific Aim 1 is to acquire and prepare data for eligible patients by merging information from physiologic, laboratory, and clinical databases and selecting data from twelve hours prior to either a cardiac arrest or the maximum severity of illness. Noise will be removed with automated methods that can be used in real time. Missing data elements will be imputed by statistical methods that are regarded as state of the art. Since the optimum time window to investigate before an arrest has not been established, and since there is no standard process of abstracting trend information, we will generate multiple candidate data sets in an effort to determine the optimum combination of parameters. Data dimensionality will be reduced by three separate feature selection methods, each of which will be used in subsequent modeling procedures. Specific Aim 2 is to create cardiac arrest prediction models from the candidate data sets using LR, SVM, NN, BN and DTC. We will assess model performance with sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and area under the Receiver Operating Characteristics curve (AUROC) using 10- fold cross validation. We will then assess the ability to generalize by testing the model on unseen data. We will determine the impact of training sample size on model performance by varying the percentage of data used during the 10-fold cross validation for each modeling technique's best performing model. We will then perform a false prediction analysis to determine the etiology of the false prediction. Specific Aim 3 is to determine which modeling process and configuration parameters performs the best, and to determine optimum timing windows for: time to analyze pre-arrest and size of feature window.

"A Cardiac Screening Device DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    The broad, long-term objectives and aims of this project are to provide a reliable and easily-used device for qualified health care professionals to screen for and detect heart murmurs produced from congenital and acquired cardiac defects in children and adults. The device will be designed to distinguish between innocent and pathological heart murmurs with a high degree of accuracy.    The applicant organization, Cardiac Screening Partners, is a joint venture between Cardiac Access, Denver, Colorado and Cardionics, Inc., Webster, Texas. Cardiac Access is comprised of physicians and scientists with a past record of research in cardiac screening (specifically in heart murmurs) and artificial neural networks. Cardionics is a developer and manufacturer of medical devices specifically related to heart and lung sound instrumentation and software.       The proposed research is designed to gather heart sound data from approximately 1600 in children (phase I) and later in adults (phase II). The data will be analyzed using state of the art digital signal analysis processing techniques and custom artificial neural network algorithms. The goal of Phase I research is to build on the success of the preliminary work done by our consultants by further refining and training of artificial neural network algorithms for accuracy in differentiating between innocent and pathologic heart murmurs. n/a",A Cardiac Screening Device,6644431,R43HL073616,"['arrhythmia', ' artificial intelligence', ' child (0-11)', ' clinical research', ' computer data analysis', ' diagnosis design /evaluation', ' electronic recording system', ' heart disorder diagnosis', ' heart function', ' heart sonography', ' human subject', ' sound', ' sound frequency']",NHLBI,CARDIAC SCREENING PARTNERS,R43,2003,99723,0.059737328872357005
"Reliable and Robust ECG Gating Signal for MR Imaging The focus of this project is to develop and evaluate a noel and reliable system for ECG triggering during cardiac MR imaging. Understanding the mechanism of heart failure and cardiomyopathy using MRI requires reliable and robust ECG gating (or triggering). To provide effective ECG gating, the first specific aim of this Phase I project is to design and develop an ECG lead system and concomitant signal processing methodology to allow for improved ECG detection with the magnetic. Our preliminary data describing our optimal vector signal set approach , coupled with a dual derivative ECG detections scheme, appear to be effective in reliably detecting the ECG during MR imaging. An improved ECG trigger will provide cardiac MRI imaging without the artifacts of cardiac and respiratory motion. Our second specific aim is to design and develop a wireless (telemetry) infrared (IR) system for ECG trigger transmission to eliminate the need for either wiring or a fiber optic cable during MRI examinations. Additionally preliminary data demonstrates the capability of our IR telemetry system to transmit the ECG in laboratory tests. Our optimal telemetry system will also mitigate against many of the artifacts involved in the development of an effective MRI ECG trigger. During Phase I we will demonstrate the feasibility of our system by evaluating system performance in 20 human subjects undergoing cardiac MR imaging. We believe our approach should provide a reliable and robust ECG gated trigger with minimal delay from the onset of the R-wave. Such a trigger would minimize blurring artifacts from cardiac and respiratory motion and improve MR tagging studies. Should our phase I project be successful, we would develop a real-time implementation of the entire system in an expanded Phase II biomedical engineering and extended clinical study. A successful Phase I and II project would likely receive commercial backing from a major MRI instrument manufacturer. PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS: Potential Commercial applications: Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is one of the most promising areas of MRI technology.

"MODEL BASED INTERPRETATION OF INTRACARDIAC ELECTROGRAMS Catheter ablation is a medical procedure that involves the destruction of        small volumes of heart tissue with radiofrequency energy.  To be                 successful, catheter ablation requires precise localization of the tissue        to be destroyed. To accomplish this in a typical ablation procedure, five        catheters containing a total of 19 electrode pairs are utilized to record        potentials (called electrograms) from spatially distinct locations within        the heart throughout the cardiac cycle. Experienced cardiologists                interpret the electrograms to locate the conduction pathways responsible         for the arrhythmia. The pathways are destroyed by applications of                radiofrequency energy, thus treating the arrhythmia.                                                                                                              Ablation procedures are performed by highly trained and experienced              cardiology sub-specialists yet the massive amount of data produced during        these procedures creates a data overload problem that can impede the             performance of even the best practitioners. This may be evidenced by (1)         overlooking important signal features, (2) misinterpreting the signals,          and (3) misinterpreting catheter locations in the heart, all of which may        lead to increased procedure duration and/or applications of radiofrequency       energy to the wrong part of the heart.                                                                                                                            The purpose of this project is to develop a model-based system for               interpreting intracardiac electrograms in near real-time. The system is          intended to assist physicians in ""making sense"" of the enormous amounts of       data recorded during a cardiac electrophysiology study. New computer             algorithms for reasoning about the time- and space-varying nature of             intracardiac electrograms from underlying causal models of the heart will        be developed. The models can be represented as a graph of nodes connected        by arcs. The nodes represent specific an atomic regions of the heart while       the arcs represent the connections between the regions.                                                                                                           The analytic approach will be a variation of the hypothesize-and-test            paradigm. The control loop will be based on the ""tracking"" concept whereby       models will be tracked as long as the data supports the model. Rule-based        knowledge will be utilized to generate models based on the observed data.        The output of the system will be a series of ladder diagrams describing          the data. In the event that the data admits more than a single explanatory       model, ladder diagrams will be generated for all created models.                                                                                                  This proposal is an extension of the applicant's graduate and post-              doctoral project, which used the same approach to the simpler domain of          the interpretation of the body-surface electrocardiogram. The domain of          this proposal is more complex because it adds reasoning with a more              detailed three dimensional cardiac model to the temporal reasoning               required for previous work. Also, this domain requires the ability to            account for simultaneous activation of the heart at multiple locations,          which was performed at a rudimentary level in the previous work.                                                                                                  This project is important for three reasons: (1) it offers new knowledge-        based algorithms for reasoning about time- and space-varying data, (2) a         comprehensive and extensible model of the cardiac conduction will be             created that incorporates the spatial resolution necessary for                   interpreting intracardiac electrograms, and (3) a software tool such the         one proposed may help clinicians improve the quality of health care.              n/a",MODEL BASED INTERPRETATION OF INTRACARDIAC ELECTROGRAMS,6126011,R29LM006004,"['arrhythmia', ' artificial intelligence', ' computer assisted diagnosis', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' diagnosis design /evaluation', ' electrocardiography', ' heart catheterization', ' heart conduction system', ' human data', ' interactive multimedia', ' mathematical model', ' model design /development']",NLM,SOUTHWEST RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R29,2000,149839,0.023472169106948933
"Machine learning driven transthoracic echocardiographic analysis and screening for cardiac amyloidosis Machine learning driven transthoracic echocardiographic analysis and screening for cardiac amyloidosis Cardiac amyloidosis (CA) is a serious but increasingly treatable cause of heart failure. Autopsy studies have estimated the prevalence of CA at approximately 25% of all octogenarians, and 15 to 20% of patients with aortic stenosis. Despite the increasing prevalence of CA within the general population and specific subpopulations, its diagnosis as a cause of heart failure is hampered by under recognition and subsequent underdiagnosis in clinical practice. Data suggest that the average time from onset of symptoms to diagnosis is 2 years and that patients report seeing an average of 5 physicians prior to establishing a definitive diagnosis. Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) testing is the most common initial evaluation because of its wide availability. A recent utilization review in the Medicare population indicated over 7 Million echocardiographic tests are performed each year accounting for $1.2 Billion in healthcare costs. TTEs provide comprehensive information about cardiac structure and function, yet complexity of interpretation has limited its screening performance in patients with CA, and diagnosis can be challenging. Thus, our group seeks to offer a computer vision and machine learning based TTE analysis and screening solution for CA. We are uniquely positioned for accelerated development with a cohort of 359 patients with confirmed CA and 4,862 controls. In Phase I, we will build a deep learning neural network-based image processing pipeline. It maps the TTE sequence into a 2-dimensional space that allows for the identification of the 4-chamber peak diastolic and peak systolic images within the cardiac heartbeat cycle. This will enable our screening model to recognize regional myocardial wall motion changes and hypertrophic patterns that characterize amyloidosis in comparison to controls with normal cardiac function. The operational point defining the performance characteristics of our screening-oriented model (including sensitivity, specificity, and negative predictive value) will be optimized using an average weighted accuracy (AWA) approach which accounts for CA disease prevalence along with a desired false positive and false negative tradeoff. If we are successful, we envision a Phase II proposal to build and deploy an automated TTE analysis tool, and to evaluate it in a multi- center clinical study. This sets the stage for our long-term goal to implement a computer assisted TTE screening solution to improve identification and by extension care of patients with cardiac amyloidosis. PROJECT NARRATIVE While non-invasive echocardiography is a first line tool for diagnosis for many cardiovascular symptoms, it is underutilized for less common diseases such as cardiac amyloidosis which recently has been shown to be increasingly prevalent in general and specific subpopulations. In this project, we will develop and validate a novel computer-assistive echocardiographic analysis tool to recognize the presence of cardiac amyloidosis. It is our hope that this technology will enhance the screening and subsequent diagnosis of cardiac amyloidosis, ultimately, leading to improved patient outcomes.",Machine learning driven transthoracic echocardiographic analysis and screening for cardiac amyloidosis,10081836,R43HL154896,"['Accounting', 'Adult', 'Age-Years', 'Amyloid', 'Amyloidosis', 'Aortic Valve Stenosis', 'Area', 'Autopsy', 'Awareness', 'Biopsy', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Echocardiography', 'Evaluation', 'Future', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'Heart failure', 'Image', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'Laboratories', 'Left Ventricular Hypertrophy', 'Left ventricular structure', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Medicare', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Multi-site clinical study', 'Multicenter Studies', 'Myocardial', 'Octogenarian', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predictive Value', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Review Literature', 'Screening procedure', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'Target Populations', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Ultrasonography', 'Utilization Review', 'Validation', 'Ventricular', 'Work', 'autoencoder', 'base', 'case control', 'classification algorithm', 'clinical application', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'convolutional neural network', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'genetic analysis', 'heart function', 'image processing', 'imaging genetics', 'improved', 'neural network', 'neural network classifier', 'novel', 'point of care', 'screening', 'tool', 'two-dimensional']",NHLBI,"VIGILANT MEDICAL, INC.",R43,2020,249373,0.08420201661814207
"Machine learning for the automated identification and tracking of rare myocardial diseases PROJECT SUMMARY Although cardiac amyloidosis and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) are relatively rare causes of heart failure (HF), they are particularly challenging to detect and treat for several shared reasons: (1) on routine clinical imaging (i.e., echocardiography [echo]), they can be difficult to distinguish from superficially similar, more common forms of cardiac disease that cause left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy; (2) the diagnoses are often missed and thus patients can present late in the course of disease at a time when treatment is difficult; (3) objective, noninvasive metrics that reliably reflect disease progression have not been identified; and (4) the small number of known patients with these diseases can make epidemiology studies and clinical trials difficult to organize and conduct. For both cardiac amyloidosis and HCM, echo plays a critical role in both diagnosis and longitudinal monitoring given its ubiquitous clinical availability, safety, and low cost. More broadly, echo dominates the current landscape of routine cardiac imaging, with tens of millions of echos performed in the United States each year. However, the clinical challenges described above highlight several shortcomings of echo: it is limited in its ability to (1) diagnose disease at its early stages; (2) discriminate between morphologically similar diseases; and (3) quantify disease progression. This proposal seeks to address deficiencies in the current echo reading workflow, which is subjective and captures only a small fraction of the data available in each study. The overall objective of this application is to use advances in machine learning to develop and validate fully-automated echo image analytic approaches to diagnose and track rare cardiomyopathies, focusing on cardiac amyloidosis and HCM. Our proposal is centered on the hypothesis that highly scalable computer vision methods can be applied to echo studies to overcome limitations of the standard clinical echo reading workflow. Accordingly our aims are: (1) Apply an automated method for echo quantification and disease identification to detect and differentiate cardiac diseases that cause increased LV wall thickness; and (2) Characterize quantifiable echo measures of disease progression in cardiac amyloidosis and HCM and associate these with clinical outcomes. Our multidisciplinary team, which is composed of experts in cardiomyopathies, echocardiography, computer vision, and machine learning, will analyze echos and patient data from 2 large patient registries: the Multicenter Amyloid Phenotyping Study (MAPS) and the Sarcomeric Human Cardiomyopathy Registry (SHaRe) HCM Network, with validation using a repository of nearly 400,000 echos. The successful completion of our aims will result in an innovative tool for early diagnosis of myocardial diseases and tracking of disease progression. Importantly, our project will set the stage for conducting larger epidemiology studies of rare myocardial diseases by automating the identification of these patients, and thereby developing previously unattainable broad-based cohorts for these conditions. PROJECT NARRATIVE Rare heart diseases such as amyloidosis (due to abnormal deposition of a protein into the heart muscle) and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (due to a genetic mutation) are important causes of heart failure and sudden death in the general population. These heart diseases are difficult to diagnose, monitor, and treat because: (1) they appear superficially similar to more common forms of heart disease (e.g., high blood pressure) on imaging tests; (2) the optimal monitoring of disease progression over time has not been established; and (3) there is a lack of large-scale studies of patients with these diseases given their rarity. This project aims to use machine learning (artificial intelligence) of digital echocardiographic images to create a completely automated method for diagnosing and tracking these rare heart diseases with the ultimate goal of broad deployment of artificial intelligence algorithms in hospitals and clinics to help identify patients with these rare heart diseases earlier, better predict adverse outcomes, and increase the size and scope of patient registries to enhance research of these conditions.",Machine learning for the automated identification and tracking of rare myocardial diseases,9739345,R01HL140731,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithm Design', 'Amyloid', 'Amyloidosis', 'Arrhythmia', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiomyopathies', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinics and Hospitals', 'Cohort Studies', 'Communities', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Coronary heart disease', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Deposition', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Echocardiography', 'Face', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Heart Diseases', 'Heart failure', 'Hospitalization', 'Human', 'Hypertension', 'Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Information Retrieval', 'Inherited', 'Left', 'Left Ventricular Hypertrophy', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Morphology', 'Myocardium', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Reader', 'Reading', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Sudden Death', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Two-Dimensional Echocardiography', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Ventricular', 'adverse outcome', 'automated image analysis', 'base', 'career', 'clinical care', 'clinical imaging', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'cost', 'digital', 'disease diagnosis', 'epidemiology study', 'heart imaging', 'hypertensive heart disease', 'image processing', 'innovation', 'intelligent algorithm', 'interest', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel therapeutics', 'particle', 'patient registry', 'repository', 'response', 'statistical learning', 'tool']",NHLBI,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2020,687210,0.026311669747620833
"Predicting Pulmonary and Cardiac Morbidity in Preterm Infants with Deep Learning RESEARCH SUMMARY The goal of this award is to provide Andrew Beam, PhD with research support and comprehensive mentoring designed to transition him to an independent investigator in perinatal and neonatal informatics. Preterm labor (PTL) is labor which occurs before 37 weeks of gestation and carries with it enormous health and financial consequences. Preterm infants have some of the highest levels of pulmonary and cardiac morbidity, yet machine-learning techniques for these important outcomes remains under developed. The research strategy is focused developing predictive models for two very important clinical scenarios using large sources of existing healthcare data. The focus of Specific Aim 1 develops a new form of machine learning known as deep learning for predicting PTL in pregnant women, while the focus of Specific Aim 2 investigates the use of deep learning for predicting clinical trajectories of preterm infants in the NICU. Currently, management and anticipation of both clinical scenarios is challenging and advancement in our predictive capacity could dramatically improve the quality and efficiency of the healthcare system. These models will be built using an existing database of 50 million patient-lives obtained through a partnership with a major US health insurer. Specific Aim 3 seeks to understand how the models constructed using this unique data resource translate and generalize to data from the electronic health records of Boston-area hospitals, which is a key concern for all healthcare data scientists. The education plan focuses on augmenting Dr. Beam’s graduate degrees in statistics and bioinformatics with additional training in clinical medicine and human pathology. This additional education will grant Dr. Beam a deeper understanding of the clinical problems faced by these populations and will allow for more fluid collaborations with clinicians in the future. The composition of Dr. Beam’s mentorship committee, which includes expertise in neonatology, biostatistics, and translational informatics, reflects his long-term desire to be quantitative scientist who works side-by-side practicing physicians so that quantitative research is translated into impactful clinical practice. PROJECT NARRATIVE Infants born prematurely experience some of the highest levels of pulmonary and cardiac morbidity and are among the most expensive patients in all of pediatrics. Now, with the availability of large sources of healthcare data from insurance claims databases and electronic health records, there is an opportunity to better understand prematurity and its predictors using computational techniques. We propose leveraging state of the art deep learning models built using data from hospitals and insurers to both predict which pregnancies will result in preterm birth and to predict which preterm infants will experience severe cardiac and pulmonary morbidity.",Predicting Pulmonary and Cardiac Morbidity in Preterm Infants with Deep Learning,9850130,K01HL141771,"['37 weeks gestation', 'Accounting', 'Acute Disease', 'Address', 'Adverse event', 'Affect', 'Area', 'Award', 'Big Data', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biometry', 'Birth', 'Birth Weight', 'Boston', 'Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia', 'Cardiac', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Collaborations', 'Computational Technique', 'Conceptions', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Scientist', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Diagnosis', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Education', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Future', 'Gestational Age', 'Goals', 'Graduate Degree', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heart', 'Heart Diseases', 'Hospitals', 'Human Pathology', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Informatics', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'Insurance Carriers', 'Life', 'Liquid substance', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Nature', 'Necrotizing Enterocolitis', 'Neonatal', 'Neonatal Intensive Care Units', 'Neonatology', 'Outcome', 'Patent Ductus Arteriosus', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pediatrics', 'Performance', 'Perinatal', 'Physicians', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnant Women', 'Premature Birth', 'Premature Infant', 'Premature Labor', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Support', 'Rest', 'Retinopathy of Prematurity', 'Risk', 'Risk Estimate', 'Scientist', 'Sepsis', 'Side', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Teaching Hospitals', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Update', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Work', 'clinical practice', 'clinical predictors', 'data resource', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'design', 'education planning', 'electronic data', 'experience', 'improved', 'insurance claims', 'mortality', 'peer', 'portability', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'premature', 'prognostic', 'respiratory distress syndrome', 'social', 'statistical and machine learning', 'statistics', 'structured data']",NHLBI,HARVARD SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH,K01,2020,166320,0.029337125791700277
"Personalizing Preoperative Stress Testing Using Machine Learning Project Summary Dr. Pappas is a junior faculty member in the Medicine Institute at the Cleveland Clinic, with appointments in the Center for Value-Based Care Research and the Department of Hospital Medicine (Cleveland, OH). This career development award aims to provide training in propensity methods, deep learning techniques, and pilot intervention development, ultimately seeking to identify personalized approaches to cardiac stress testing before surgery. Noncardiac surgery carries risk of mortality and morbidity, and cardiac complications account for the largest share of perioperative mortality. Meanwhile, current approaches are expensive and may not effectively reduce cardiac risk. This proposal uses machine learning techniques to define the value of information provided by each different kind of stress test and the expected benefit of different therapeutic interventions through which preoperative risks might be modified. It then seeks to identify the most helpful cardiac stress test, if any. In this career development award, Dr. Pappas proposes three phases of investigation, and in so doing will acquire new skills critical to achieving his goal of becoming an expert in perioperative risk mitigation. In Aim 1, Dr. Pappas will use propensity matching techniques to evaluate prior associations between preoperative stress testing and improved postoperative mortality, when including rich clinical data not available to previous large studies. In Aim 2, he will use machine learning techniques to estimate the value of information provided by each modality of stress testing, and the impact on the risk of each event from each intervention. In Aim 3, Dr. Pappas will pilot an intervention presenting personalized estimates to physicians in the preoperative clinic. In addition to advanced training through formal coursework, this career development award is supported by an extraordinary mentorship team, including internationally-recognized experts in perioperative outcomes research, cardiovascular disease, use of observational healthcare data, and machine learning. The combination of formal training and mentored research outlined in this application is designed to ensure that Dr. Pappas will emerge from this award as an independent investigator and expert in personalized perioperative decision-making. Project Narrative Many patients die soon after surgery, and many of those deaths are from heart problems. Physicians have tried to reduce those risks in many ways, but our current approach is expensive, leads to unhelpful testing, and probably doesn't do a very good job reducing the risk of death. This proposal uses a form of machine learning and a large dataset to try to find more personalized, more helpful, and less expensive strategies to try to reduce the risks of surgery, and then tests whether we can present personalized estimates to doctors that they could use when thinking about the risks of surgery.",Personalizing Preoperative Stress Testing Using Machine Learning,9849333,K08HL141598,"['Appointment', 'Award', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Consultations', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Ensure', 'Event', 'Faculty', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Guidelines', 'Healthcare', 'Heart', 'Hospital Departments', 'Information Theory', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'Internal Medicine', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Observational Study', 'Occupations', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Perioperative', 'Perioperative complication', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Postoperative Period', 'Probability', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Role', 'Stress Tests', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thallium Myocardial Perfusion Imaging Stress Test', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Thinking', 'Training', 'Weight', 'base', 'clinical decision support', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'design', 'functional status', 'implementation science', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'large datasets', 'member', 'mortality', 'mortality risk', 'perioperative mortality', 'personalized approach', 'personalized decision', 'prognostic value', 'randomized trial', 'risk mitigation', 'skills', 'surgical risk', 'therapy development', 'treatment center']",NHLBI,CLEVELAND CLINIC LERNER COM-CWRU,K08,2020,161047,0.044723060427731005
"Cardiac CT Deblooming PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Coronary artery disease (CAD) is the most common type of heart disease, killing over 370,000 Americans annu- ally2. Cardiac CT is a safe, accurate, non-invasive method widely employed for diagnosis of CAD and planning therapeutic interventions. With the current CT technology, calcium blooming artifacts severely limit the accuracy of coronary stenosis assessment. Similarly, stent blooming artifacts lead to overestimation of in-stent restenosis. As a result, many coronary CT angiography (CCTA) scans are non-diagnostic and result in patients receiving costly and invasive coronary angiography (ICA) procedures.  Based on extensive feasibility results, the goal of this project is to use deep learning innovations to fundamen- tally eliminate blooming artifacts without costly redesign of the CT hardware. A consortium between GE Re- search, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute and Weill Cornell Medicine will develop dedicated imaging protocols and machine learning methods to avoid or minimize blooming artifacts and evaluate the clinical impact of the proposed solutions. In Aim 1, the CT scan protocol will be optimized and paired with deep learning reconstruc- tion and post-processing algorithms to generate high-resolution CT images and prevent blooming artifacts. In Aim 2, image-domain and raw-data-domain deep learning processing algorithms will be developed to correct for residual blooming. After successful demonstration of the proposed methods on phantom scans and emulated clinical datasets, in Aim 3 the proposed CT methods will be clinically demonstrated and optimized based on 100 patients with coronary artery disease, using intravascular ultrasound as the ground-truth reference.  At the end of the project, we will have demonstrated and publicly disseminated a systematic methodology to essentially remove blooming artifacts in cardiac CT without a costly hardware upgrade. This will be another suc- cess of deep learning, enabling accurate coronary stenosis assessment and eliminating many unnecessary diag- nostic catheterizations. PROJECT NARRATIVE Blooming artifacts severely limit the accuracy of coronary stenosis assessment with cardiac CT, leading to un- necessary invasive coronary angiography procedures. The goal of this project is to eliminate blooming artifacts without costly redesign of the CT hardware, but based on optimized scan protocols and deep-learning-based image reconstruction and post-processing techniques.

"Robot-Assisted 3D ICE Catheter for Cardiac Ablation ABSTRACT  Although the cardiac ablation procedure for atrial fibrillation has a wide adoption rate, it also has a high recurrence of arrhythmia primarily due to the creation of suboptimal lesions. The procedure is also associated with complications including cardiac perforation, tamponade, atrio-esophageal fistulas and thrombus. Repeated and prolonged X-ray exposure for the clinician can also lead to enhanced risk of cancer. A fluoroless approach using intracardiac echocardiography (ICE) is becoming a more widely adopted imaging option due to the absence of ionizing radiation and the possibility of real-time monitoring of the created lesions. However, the ICE- guided approach suffers from significant shortcomings, which include poor dexterity of the ICE catheter, difficulty in simultaneously manipulating the ICE and ablation catheters, unintuitive image orientation and noisy image quality. There is therefore an unmet need to overcome these shortcomings of the ICE-guided approach to enable better lesion creation and reduced complications associated with the cardiac ablation procedure. The long-term goal of this research is to develop robotic technologies, control and machine learning algorithms to enable ICE- guided cardiac ablation procedures. The objective is to develop a novel robotic manipulator, a steerable ICE catheter, and machine learning and control algorithms to manipulate the ICE catheter and monitor the created lesions in real-time. The rationale that underlies the proposed research is that the robot-assisted steerable ICE catheter with the catheter tracking algorithms will enable simultaneous manipulation of the ICE and ablation catheters. Further, the machine learning algorithms to monitor therapy will reduce the risk of complications, while ensuring the creation of necrotic lesions, thereby reducing the recurrence of AF. In this proposal, we plan to pursue the following specific aims: 1) Design, develop, and model a steerable 3D ICE catheter with enhanced dexterity. 2) Design and develop a robotic manipulator and associated control algorithms to allow for precise manipulation of the ICE catheter. 3) Develop machine-learning and vision-based algorithms integrated with a navigation system for tracking the ablation catheter, and monitoring therapy. 4) Validate the robotic ICE system in heart phantom and porcine models. The proposed research is significant since it will allow for better therapeutic outcomes by reducing recurrence rates and complications associated with cardiac ablation, and avoiding exposure of the patient and clinical care team to X-ray radiation. The proposed research is innovative in that it builds on state-of-the-art robotics technology, machine learning and vision algorithms to enable fluoroless ICE- guided cardiac ablation procedures. PROJECT NARRATIVE  The proposed study addresses an important and under-investigated area of treating atrial fibrillation using a completely fluoroless approach with ICE imaging.

"Prospective sudden cardiac death risk stratification using CMR and echocardiography machine learning in mitral valve prolapse PROJECT SUMMARY Mitral valve prolapse (MVP) is a common valvulopathy affecting over 170 million worldwide. Every year, 0.4- 1.9% of individuals with MVP will develop sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) or sudden cardiac death (SCD), and 7% of SCDs in the young are caused by MVP. However, predictors of this devastating outcome are not readily available, and indications for a primary prevention implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) in MVP are lacking. Severe mitral regurgitation explains only 50% of SCA cases in MVP. SCD/SCA risk has also been linked to a bileaflet phenotype with mild MR, mitral annular disjunction (MAD), and left ventricular focal fibrosis on cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR)-late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) images. Such imaging parameters (including LGE) have not been evaluated prospectively. Moreover, they are not consistently found in SCA survivors, and diffuse fibrosis has been proposed as an alternative arrhythmic substrate by our group and others based on CMR/T1 mapping, strain echocardiography, and post-mortem data. Overall, it is challenging to pinpoint a unique imaging phenotype, and uncertainty exists about which MVP patients should undergo CMR. Regardless of arrhythmic phenotype, complex ventricular ectopy (ComVE - defined as frequent polymorphic PVCs, bigeminy or non-sustained ventricular tachycardia) is detected in 80-100% of MVP cases prior to SCA or SCD. ComVE, commonly associated with left ventricular fibrosis on CMR, is linked to higher all-cause mortality and SCA rates (20% versus 12% if no ComVE, p < 0.05) based on preliminary cross-sectional data. Our central hypothesis is that MVP patients with ComVE, because of the higher prevalence of either LGE or abnormal T1 mapping, represent ideal CMR candidates regardless of leaflet involvement or MAD, and can be rapidly identified by an automated “surveillance” tool within a large echocardiographic database. Moreover, we hypothesize that fibrosis is the strongest predictor of SCD/SCA in an unprecedented, multi-center effort to longitudinally assess clinical and CMR parameters of arrhythmic risk in MVP. Specifically, we aim to 1) Assess the role of CMR as a screening tool for fibrosis in MVP with ComVE incorporating T1 mapping in addition to LGE in an unselected MVP sample; 2) Develop an echo-based machine-learning algorithm to detect MVP with ComVE, test its association with myocardial fibrosis on CMR and longitudinal SCD/SCA risk; and 3) Build a novel prospective SCD/SCA risk prediction model in MVP. Better selection of CMR candidates and development of a SCD/SCA risk prediction tool inclusive of fibrosis by CMR are expected to dramatically improve risk stratification in MVP and establish future criteria for primary prevention ICD trials. PROJECT NARRATIVE Every year, 0.4-1.9% of individuals with mitral valve prolapse (MVP) will develop sudden cardiac death or arrest. In this application we propose to better identify those at risk by using cardiac magnetic resonance and echocardiography-based artificial intelligence, with the long-term goal of selecting those that may benefit most from a defibrillator. .",Prospective sudden cardiac death risk stratification using CMR and echocardiography machine learning in mitral valve prolapse,10034460,R01HL153447,"['Affect', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Autopsy', 'California', 'Cardiac', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Markers', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Defibrillators', 'Development', 'Diffuse', 'Echocardiography', 'Fibrosis', 'Future', 'Gadolinium', 'Goals', 'Heart Arrest', 'High Prevalence', 'Holter Electrocardiography', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Image Enhancement', 'Implantable Defibrillators', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Left', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Mission', 'Mitral Valve Insufficiency', 'Mitral Valve Prolapse', 'Myocardial', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Primary Prevention', 'Registries', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk', 'Risk stratification', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'San Francisco', 'Screening procedure', 'Survivors', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Uncertainty', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Ventricular', 'Ventricular Tachycardia', 'base', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'coronary fibrosis', 'cost', 'extracellular', 'hemodynamics', 'high risk', 'improved', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mortality', 'neural network architecture', 'novel', 'prognostic significance', 'prospective', 'recurrent neural network', 'risk prediction model', 'secondary analysis', 'stem', 'sudden cardiac death', 'tool']",NHLBI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2020,810751,0.07517356957419513
"Machine Learning and Deformable Model-based 4D Characterization of Cardiac Dyssynchrony from MRI Summary/Abstract In the presence of diseases such as ischemic heart disease (IHD), cardiac dyssynchrony deteriorates cardiac function and often cannot be treated effectively. However, while imaging methods such as cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) can provide high quality images of the moving heart, conventional clinical quantitative analysis of cardiac function is largely limited to global function analysis of the left ventricle (LV), with only qualitative and subjective characterization of regional function. An obstacle to better quantification of regional function is the complex 3D structure and motion of the heart wall, which has typically necessitated time-consuming user-guided processing of the images to carry out the associated 3D-motion analysis.  Recent advances in machine-learning (ML) approaches for image analysis are promising as new means to speed up the processing of cardiac images, as well as to analyze the underlying regional motion patterns. However, current Deep ML (DML) approaches to image analysis largely function as “black boxes”, without clear indications of which features contribute most to the analysis results, thus limiting their clinical utility. In the initial funded period of this research project, we have been developing integrated approaches to the segmentation, 3D reconstruction, and analysis of CMR data, with application to the evaluation of cardiac dyssynchrony. Today, treatment of dyssynchrony in HF with cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) leads to improvement in only ~2/3 patients selected with conventional criteria (usually by electrocardiogram [ECG]). Our initial results show encouraging results of correlation between MRI evaluation of dyssynchrony and cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) outcomes. In the new proposed research, we will further develop these methods, with the goal of automating the cardiac analysis methods. This will include the introduction of new ML-based methods, which will incorporate information on the specific cardiac motion factors that lead to classification of different disease states in dyssynchrony. Our Hypothesis is that by using these new ML-based methods for cardiac motion analysis, we will discover and evaluate significant quantitative correlations between different cardiac dyssynchrony motion patterns and CRT outcomes. Also, late-gadolinium enhancement (LGE) provides images for infarction visualization. Incorporation of tissue characterization into the motion-pattern analysis could lead to increased understanding of how infarcted areas affect regional motion in concert with dyssynchrony. The unearthing of these findings will allow us to validate them in future clinical studies. The project will also disseminate our novel, coupled DML and model-based methodology for quantifying and classifying cardiac motion in diseases affecting regional wall motion. Other research groups can then apply our tools to specifically study dyssynchrony, as well as other cardiac diseases affecting LV motion. Project Narrative A significant proportion of patients with heart failure and cardiac dyssynchrony fail to positively respond to cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT), as the current clinical selection criteria do not take into account regional cardiac function. We will develop improved methods for 4D-analysis and -visualization of both global and regional cardiac function from cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) data, including novel deep learning methods that will provide additional information on the salient features that contribute most to characterization of cardiac dyssynchrony. These new methods will be applied to the analysis of CMR data from both a stratified sample of normal subjects and patients with cardiac dyssynchrony (with and without infarction), with correlation with therapeutic results following CRT, potentially leading to improved clinical guidelines and clinical outcomes, as well as increased understanding of cardiac physiology and pathophysiology.",Machine Learning and Deformable Model-based 4D Characterization of Cardiac Dyssynchrony from MRI,10052934,R01HL127661,"['3-Dimensional', 'Affect', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Automation', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular Physiology', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Complex', 'Consumption', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'EKG QRS Complex', 'Echocardiography', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Evaluation', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gadolinium', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Heart', 'Heart Diseases', 'Heart failure', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Image Enhancement', 'Infarction', 'Ischemia', 'Lead', 'Left ventricular structure', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Myocardial Ischemia', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Patient Selection', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Physiology', 'Prospective Studies', 'Pump', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Schedule', 'Selection Criteria', 'Speed', 'Sweden', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Treatment outcome', 'Universities', 'Visualization', 'Width', 'base', 'cardiac resynchronization therapy', 'deep learning', 'effective therapy', 'heart function', 'heart imaging', 'heart motion', 'image processing', 'imaging approach', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning method', 'novel', 'patient subsets', 'reconstruction', 'response', 'spatiotemporal', 'success', 'therapy outcome', 'three dimensional structure', 'tool']",NHLBI,"RUTGERS, THE STATE UNIV OF N.J.",R01,2020,763531,0.1376563464640093
"International Consortium for Multimodality Phenotyping in Adults with Non-compaction Summary Non-compaction cardiomyopathy (NCCM) is a heterogeneous, poorly understood disorder characterized by a prominent inner layer of loose myocardial tissue. Patients with NCCM are at increased risk of heart failure, stroke, severe rhythm irregularities and death. Current imaging techniques cannot differentiate pathological from benign hypertrabeculation. In addition, current echo/MRI-based criteria of NCCM lead to over-diagnosis of NCCM, provide no prognostic value, and lead to implantation of defibrillators (ICD) and the use of anticoagulation without a positive benefit in many otherwise healthy individuals with non-compacted myocardium. For a growing population diagnosed with NCCM there is an urgent need for better risk stratification to appropriately allocate (or safely withhold) these impactful preventive measures. Our international consortium combines expertise in myocardial disease, cardiac imaging and advanced computer analytics from 5 centers dedicated to the care of patients with cardiomyopathies, and has the ultimate goal to improve care of patients with non-compaction cardiomyopathy. We hypothesize that comprehensive analysis of clinical, genetic, structural and functional information will improve risk stratification. In addition, we hypothesize that detailed structural analysis will allow for differentiation of pathological and benign patterns of non-compaction. In a large cohort of adult patients with suspected NCCM we will perform in-depth phenotyping, including clinical information, pedigree data, genetics, echocardiography and MRI, and follow patients for up to 3 years. We will apply machine-learning based analytics to develop predictive models and compare their performance to currently used models and treatment criteria. Secondly, in a subset of patients we will perform high-resolution cardiac CT for detailed structural characterization of the myocardial wall. Novel analytical methods will be developed to characterize the 3D architectural complexity based on pathophysiological hypothesis, but also using hypothesis-free analyses of raw images using deep learning techniques. In addition, we will investigate associations between myocardial structure and regional contractile function, as assessed by echo and MRI. The aim of this proposal is to identify a structural signature associated with pathological non-compaction and improve developed risk prediction models. This international consortium dedicated to NCCM will be the first to collect genetic and multi-modality imaging data. Discovery of pathological structural signatures through innovative imaging techniques, in relation to myocardial contractility, will advance our understanding of NCCM. There is an urgent clinical need for diagnostic techniques that detect pathological non-compaction and identify patients at risk of devastating complications. This study is clinically relevant because the developed predictive models may permit more effective, personalized preventive care in a growing number of individuals diagnosed with non-compaction cardiomyopathy. Project Narrative The proposed research is relevant to the public health because recognition of pathological myocardial non- compaction and identification of patients at risk for embolic stroke, ventricular arrhythmia and sudden cardiac death will allow for more effective use of life-saving measures, but also avoid unnecessary ICD implantations and anticoagulation in healthy individuals with benign hypertrabeculation. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to the NIH's mission that pertains to the discovery of fundamental knowledge about the nature and behavior of living systems and the application of that knowledge to enhance health, lengthen life, and reduce illness and disability.",International Consortium for Multimodality Phenotyping in Adults with Non-compaction,9977674,R01HL146754,"['3-Dimensional', 'Adult', 'Adverse event', 'Anticoagulation', 'Architecture', 'Arrhythmia', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Awareness', 'Behavior', 'Benign', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiomyopathies', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Defibrillators', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Disease', 'Echocardiography', 'Event', 'Family member', 'Foundations', 'Fractals', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Structures', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Heart failure', 'Histologic', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Individual', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Left ventricular non-compaction', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Medical Genetics', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Mutation', 'Myocardial', 'Myocardial tissue', 'Myocardium', 'Nature', 'Non-compaction cardiomyopathy', 'Organism', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pennsylvania', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Preventive care', 'Preventive measure', 'Preventive therapy', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk stratification', 'Savings', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'Sudden Death', 'Techniques', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Ventricular Arrhythmia', 'accurate diagnosis', 'adjudicate', 'adjudication', 'adverse event risk', 'analytical method', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'deep learning', 'density', 'disability', 'embolic stroke', 'genetic pedigree', 'heart imaging', 'high risk', 'imaging genetics', 'implantation', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'multimodality', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'patient subsets', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic value', 'prospective', 'radiomics', 'research clinical testing', 'risk prediction model', 'sudden cardiac death', 'thrombogenesis', 'young adult']",NHLBI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,805761,0.01984357332678897
"Integrated prediction of cardiovascular events by automated coronary plaque and pericoronary adipose tissue quantification from CT Angiography PROJECT SUMMARY Coronary artery disease remains the leading cause of death worldwide, and more than half of the individuals suffering myocardial infarction (heart attacks) have no premonitory symptoms. Studies of patients with coronary artery disease have traditionally focused only on the severity of narrowing (stenosis) of the coronary arteries by atherosclerotic plaques, rather than the adverse features of coronary plaques which are predisposed to rupture and precipitate myocardial infarction. Coronary CT Angiography (CTA) is a noninvasive test that allows assessment of both coronary stenosis and plaque characteristics. Currently, however, CTA is interpreted visually for stenosis. Quantitative measurements of CTA stenosis severity and plaque features are not part of current clinical routine.  We propose to develop novel image processing algorithms for fully automated, robust quantification of coronary plaque features from CTA. We also propose to automatically quantify the characteristics of adipose tissue around the coronary arteries (pericoronary adipose tissue, PCAT), which have been shown to differentiate rupture-prone, high-risk coronary plaques from stable ones. We propose to apply machine learning methods to efficiently combine stenosis, plaque and PCAT features, along with patient clinical data, into a new integrated risk score for the prediction of future adverse cardiovascular events. We will evaluate this risk score in the real-world, prospective, landmark SCOT-HEART trial (including all 2073 patients in the CTA arm of the trial), with added external validation in large multicenter patient registries, with available CTA scans, clinical data, and followup for cardiovascular events (fatal and non-fatal myocardial infarction and cardiovascular death in a grand total of 7844 patients). We propose three specific aims: 1) To refine, expand and automate measurements of coronary plaque and lumen for the entire coronary artery tree, and to standardize measurement of plaque changes in serial CTA; 2) To evaluate the prognostic value of automatically-quantified plaque features and PCAT characteristics for the prediction of future MACE in the prospective SCOT-HEART trial and multicenter CTA registries; 3) To develop and evaluate with full external validation a new automated patient risk score—combining patient clinical data, CTA-measured quantitative plaque features and PCAT characteristics, using machine learning—for the prediction of future MACE events in the prospective SCOT-HEART trial and multicenter CTA registries.  The proposed work will enable automated, multi-faceted and reproducible analysis of plaque, stenosis and PCAT from CTA, combined with objective risk scores reflecting likelihood of adverse cardiovascular events. This work will provide a novel, personalized, real-world paradigm that objectively and accurately identifies individual patients at risk of future cardiovascular events, from routine CTA imaging. PROJECT NARRATIVE (lay language) In patients who are at risk of developing a heart attack, imaging of the heart with coronary Computed Tomography Angiography (CTA) allows doctors to noninvasively assess the narrowing of the coronary arteries caused by coronary plaque deposits, as well as the coronary plaques themselves. The researchers propose to develop and validate novel computerized scores derived from real-world CTA and clinical patient data using artificial intelligence, that will automatically identify the patients who are at highest risk of suffering a heart attack or cardiovascular death. This new research will allow physicians to more precisely identify patients for whom appropriate treatment could be prescribed, to reduce their risk of future adverse cardiovascular events.",Integrated prediction of cardiovascular events by automated coronary plaque and pericoronary adipose tissue quantification from CT Angiography,9981397,R01HL148787,"['Adipose tissue', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Angiography', 'Arterial Fatty Streak', 'Arteries', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Cardiac Death', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical assessments', 'Complex', 'Consumption', 'Coronary', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Coronary Stenosis', 'Coronary artery', 'Data', 'Deposition', 'Event', 'Future', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Individual', 'Language', 'Longterm Follow-up', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical center', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Patient risk', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Registries', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Rupture', 'Scanning', 'Severities', 'Site', 'Standardization', 'Stenosis', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Trees', 'Validation', 'Visual', 'Work', 'acute coronary syndrome', 'arm', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'clinically significant', 'computerized', 'coronary calcium scoring', 'coronary computed tomography angiography', 'coronary event', 'coronary plaque', 'density', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'heart imaging', 'high risk', 'image processing', 'improved', 'indexing', 'individual patient', 'machine learning method', 'mortality', 'noninvasive diagnosis', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'patient registry', 'prognostic significance', 'prognostic value', 'prospective']",NHLBI,CEDARS-SINAI MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2020,714763,0.07970023632589603
"Optimization of diagnostic accuracy, radiation dose, and patient throughput for cardiac SPECT via advanced and clinically practical cardiac-respiratory motion correction and deep learning Single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) is widely used to detect and evaluate coronary artery disease. The goal of this project is to reduce the radiation dose and/or scan time of SPECT MPI by a combined factor of 16x, while maintaining or increasing diagnostic accuracy. This would enable SPECT MPI to be performed, e.g., with 4x reduced radiation dose and 4x shorter scan time (~2.5 minutes) than typical protocols. Radiation dose in SPECT MPI has been recognized as an important issue, accounting for ~25% of all radiation exposure to patients in medical imaging. Dose reduction particularly addresses the increased prevalence of obese patients (who receive higher dose) and younger cardiac patients (whose radiation risk is higher due to longer life expectancy). Reduction in scan time would improve comfort for elderly and infirm cardiac patients, while mitigating body-motion image artifacts and reducing healthcare costs by increasing clinical throughput. We will reduce dose and scan time through innovative image reconstruction methods that involve little or no cost and require no additional patient setup steps. We will employ new respiratory and cardiac motion compensation to reduce image artifacts, as well as new deep learning techniques, which will be used for both respiratory-signal estimation and high-performance denoising. We will methodically optimize these techniques and then validate our algorithms in multicenter clinical reader studies. SA1: Develop clinically practical respiratory motion surrogates for low-count studies. T1: Perfect data- driven respiratory surrogate estimation; T2: Optimize data-driven surrogate estimation at reduced counts; T3: Develop and clinically validate depth-sensing cameras for respiratory and body-motion surrogate estimation; T4: Generalization of data-driven surrogate estimation to SPECT systems not having a CT. SA2: Develop deep-learning reconstruction methods and optimize for diagnostic accuracy and dose/scan time. T1: Post-reconstruction DL denoising algorithms for 3D perfusion images for reduced-count and standard- count studies; T2: DL denoising algorithms for 4D cardiac-gated studies; T3: 4D reconstruction with embedded DL denoising, cardiac motion estimation and correction; and T4: DL reconstruction methods with both RMC and CMC, with projection data binned using respiratory surrogate signals derived in SA1. SA3: Perform multicenter clinical reader studies (6 clinicians, 3 institutions) to validate the new algorithms and compare to current clinically-available methods based on diagnostic performance and repeatability in assessing both perfusion and wall motion defects. T1: In comparison to baseline clinical reconstruction, evaluate added benefit of: a) including attenuation and scatter correction, and b) additionally including RMC; T2: Validate DL for improvement of perfusion and function (wall motion) task performance at full-count levels; and T3: Validate DL for improvement of task performance at reduced counts. PROJECT NARRATIVE In this project we will employ new methods of image reconstruction and processing to reduce radiation dose and scan time in cardiac SPECT imaging, which is used 15-20 million times per year to evaluate coronary artery disease. Dose reduction is important because cardiac SPECT accounts for ~25% of all radiation exposure to the public due to medical imaging; reducing scan time would make SPECT more comfortable for elderly and infirm cardiac patients, while mitigating image artifacts, as well as and reducing healthcare costs by allowing more patients to be scanned per day. Our goal will be to achieve a combined 16x reduction in dose and scan time while maintaining or improving diagnostic accuracy, thereby permitting a 4x reduction in dose while reducing scan time from ~10 minutes to ~2.5 minutes.","Optimization of diagnostic accuracy, radiation dose, and patient throughput for cardiac SPECT via advanced and clinically practical cardiac-respiratory motion correction and deep learning",10072432,R01HL154687,"['3-Dimensional', '4D Imaging', 'Accounting', 'Address', 'Advocate', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Cardiac', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Computer software', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Data', 'Defect', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Effectiveness', 'Elderly', 'Electromagnetic Energy', 'Exposure to', 'Financial compensation', 'Functional Imaging', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Institution', 'Left Ventricular Function', 'Life Expectancy', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Myocardial perfusion', 'Noise', 'Nuclear', 'Obesity', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Perfusion', 'Photons', 'Play', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Protocols documentation', 'Radiation Dose Unit', 'Radiation exposure', 'Reader', 'Recommendation', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Societies', 'System', 'Task Performances', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Validation', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'attenuation', 'base', 'cardiac single photon emission computed tomography', 'clinical care', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'denoising', 'denoising deep learning', 'diagnosis evaluation', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'heart motion', 'hemodynamics', 'image processing', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging modality', 'imaging system', 'improved', 'innovation', 'perfusion imaging', 'preservation', 'prognostic', 'quantum', 'radiation risk', 'radiologist', 'reconstruction', 'respiratory', 'single photon emission computed tomography', 'tool', 'visual tracking']",NHLBI,ILLINOIS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2020,786840,0.023292469873203842
"Novel Non-Invasive Coronary Flow Patterning to Predict Early Coronary Microvascular Disease PROJECT SUMMARY  Coronary microvascular disease (CMD) is notoriously difficult to diagnose non-invasively, and current methods of assessing CMD utilize only the peak velocity of the coronary flow pattern. While new imaging techniques such as cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have improved the assessment coronary perfusion, there are currently no non-invasive methods that incorporate the coronary flow pattern over a complete cardiac cycle to definitively assess and predict the development of CMD.  Coronary blood flow (CBF) reflects the summation of flow in the coronary microcirculation, and our lab has begun to harness the full CBF pattern under varying flow and disease conditions (e.g. type 2 diabetes) to determine whether it might harbor novel clues leading to the early detection of CMD. Our past and preliminary data indicate an early onset of CMD in both type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and metabolic syndrome (MetS) that occurs prior to the onset of macrovascular complications and that are characterized by blood flow impairments and alterations in coronary resistance microvessel (CRM) structure, function, and biomechanics. Our data also uncovered innovative correlations between CRM structure/biomechanics and our newly-defined features of the coronary flow pattern, some of which were unique to normal or diabetic mice. We have initially utilized these CBF features, in the presence and absence of other factors such as cardiac function, to develop a mathematical model in collaboration with Drs. Christopher Bartlett and William Ray that to date demonstrated that 6 simple factors can predict a normal vs. diabetic coronary flow pattern with 85% predictive accuracy. Utilizing a multidisciplinary approach, these preliminary data strongly suggest that the coronary flow pattern and physiological modulators of it (e.g. coronary micovascular structure/function/biomechanics, cardiac function, etc), may be useful in directly diagnosing early CMD. Therefore, we hypothesize that dissecting the elements that influence coronary flow patterning will be critical determinants in the direct assessment of coronary microvascular disease using computational modeling. Using our previous publications and our preliminary data as guides, the hypothesis will be tested by addressing two specific aims: 1) Determine whether unique time-dependent CBF patterning in normal and T2DM is dictated by a combination of CRM remodeling and biomechanics, coronary flow pattern dynamics, and cardiac function, permitting the development of a computational model to accurately predict CMD; 2) Determine the reproducibility and robustness of the machine learning model in predicting CMD in a diet-induced obesity/diabetes mouse model. If successful, these studies will be the first to simultaneously examine the influence of CRMs, CBF, and cardiac structure/function on the distinct pattern of coronary flow, and it will determine whether a mathematical model may be useful in establishing a direct assessment of CMD to eventually enable clinicians to conduct a more direct non-invasive diagnosis of CMD for the prevention and/or treatment of heart disease.

"Estimating Trajectory of Recovery in Cardiac Rehabilitation using Mobile Health Technology and Personalized Machine Learning Project Summary/Abstract The objective of our work leverages mobile health technology to develop machine learning models for longitudinal trajectories of recovery like those needed in cardiac rehabilitation. The investigation uses mobile health technology to quantify trajectories of recovery measures, personalizing understanding of exercise capacity and cardiac function. Exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation programs reduce cardiovascular mortality risks and improve patient outcomes in such longitudinal fashion, through increased exercise capacity as measured by peak V02 improvements over the course of care. These programs have recently been extended to include heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) patients. Despite the reduction in mortality and readmissions, participation and adherence in cardiac rehabilitation programs remains a challenge, especially in underserved communities because of limited program availability, the distance and transportation access to a program, its hours of operation, as well as a lack of diversity and gender-dominated programs. Home-based programs using smartphones have shown to increase adherence and achieve similar outcomes. While home-based programs also improved resting heart rate, systolic blood pressure, and levels of physical activity achieved through metabolic equivalent of tasks and peak V02 at the end of the study, users expressed a desire to have individualized education and treatment. Home-based systems still do not achieve real-time interaction, feedback, and monitoring that center-based rehabilitation does through a lack of feedback and necessity of self-reported exertion values. A system is needed that quantify measures of exercise capacity, which can lead to recovery, dynamically throughout the course of treatment. This proposal develops an unobtrusive system, with new mobile health technology sensors, and trains analytic models that allow for personalized quantification of rehabilitation trajectories in HFrEF patients, which can monitor patient adherence and improvement in measures during exercise as well as while at rest. This system investigates the improvement over the course of a 12-week cardiac rehabilitation study and designs trajectories of recovery to understand improvements in peak V02 and exercise capacity in HFrEF patients by also measuring improvements of measurements of heart rate and blood pressure while at rest. This allows for an investigation of additional measures, over time, that may better quantify recovery in HFrEF patients that can be used for center-based rehabilitation or home-based rehabilitation. This can provide a significant enhancement of metrics that define recovery for HFrEF patients with estimations to metrics that are difficult to collect and evaluate. Project Narrative Quantification of trajectories of recovery for patients through wearable mobile health technologies can provide personal understanding of improvements and challenges faced in recovery by patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. Such a system will indicate to each patient the improvement in exercise capacity needed to continue preventing any recurrent events, allowing participants to have the understanding and individualized feeling they get from clinic visits and center-based cardiac rehabilitation at home or any other location they wish to participate in recovery activities. The exploration of additional markers of recovery can continue to provide quantification of heart failure conditions useful for clinicians and patients alike.",Estimating Trajectory of Recovery in Cardiac Rehabilitation using Mobile Health Technology and Personalized Machine Learning,10018016,R21EB028486,"['Achievement', 'Adherence', 'Behavior', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Pressure', 'Cardiac rehabilitation', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Cellular Phone', 'Characteristics', 'Chest', 'Clinic Visits', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'EFRAC', 'Education', 'Event', 'Exercise', 'Exertion', 'Failure', 'Feedback', 'Feeling', 'Gender', 'Health Technology', 'Heart Rate', 'Heart failure', 'Home environment', 'Hour', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Physical activity', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Proxy', 'Pulse Pressure', 'Recovery', 'Recurrence', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Rest', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'Transportation', 'Update', 'Visit', 'Work', 'Wrist', 'advanced analytics', 'analytical method', 'base', 'compliance behavior', 'design', 'exercise capacity', 'heart function', 'heart rate monitor', 'hospital readmission', 'improved', 'longitudinal analysis', 'mHealth', 'mortality', 'mortality risk', 'novel', 'operation', 'prevent', 'programs', 'rate of change', 'sensor technology', 'smart watch', 'wearable device', 'wearable sensor technology']",NIBIB,TEXAS ENGINEERING EXPERIMENT STATION,R21,2020,177045,0.013195187817140113
"Validation of Physiologic CPR Quality Using NOn-inVasive Waveform Analytics (CPR-NOVA) Project Abstract  Pediatric cardiac arrest affects thousands of children each year. Progressive heart and lung failure is a predisposing cause in many of these events. Despite improvements in survival outcomes over the past two decades, more than half of these children still do not survive. As new brain injury complicates care among survivors, the burden to these children and the public's health is substantial.  Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) – the medical procedure of providing chest compressions and ventilations during cardiac arrest – saves lives, and higher quality CPR is more effective at doing so. One method to improve CPR quality is through the use of CPR quality monitoring defibrillators. By providing real- time feedback on CPR mechanics targets such as chest compression depth and rate, they represent the best patient care option currently available to improve CPR performance. Unfortunately, most of these devices are either not approved for children or use pads that are too large for many pediatric patients. Thus, current technology limits the benefit of meaningful CPR quality monitoring to a small percentage of the children who suffer a cardiac arrest. Given the strong association between pediatric CPR quality and outcomes, new methods to monitor CPR quality are urgently needed to improve the care of this vulnerable population.  Physiologic-directed CPR is a promising technique that uses the hemodynamic response of the patient to guide the ongoing resuscitation effort. This approach overcomes the technological limitations of existing CPR quality monitoring technology by using data from patient monitors. Unfortunately, because many patients do not have intra-arterial lines in place at the time of arrest to guide CPR, its clinical impact has been limited. To overcome this limitation, the objective of this ancillary application is to leverage the existing infrastructure of the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development-funded Collaborative Pediatric Critical Care Research Network (CPCCRN) and the unique hemodynamic waveform database of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute-funded parent R01 – the ICU-Resuscitation (ICU-RESUS) Project – to validate two noninvasive physiologic CPR monitors applicable to nearly every pediatric cardiac arrest: 1) end-tidal carbon dioxide (ETCO2); and 2) PhotoPlethysmoGraphy (PPG) obtained via pulse oximetry. Using sophisticated machine learning methods, a prospective observational analytic investigation is proposed with the following Aims: 1) Evaluate ETCO2 as a noninvasive CPR quality monitor among children receiving at least 1 minute of CPR in a CPCCRN intensive care unit; and 2) Using novel machine learning classification algorithms, evaluate PPG and other candidate physiologic waveforms as noninvasive CPR quality monitors.  By leveraging the substantial infrastructure of the CPCCRN, the novel hemodynamic waveform database of ICU-RESUS, and advanced machine learning analytics, this submission represents a unique opportunity to validate two noninvasive physiologic pediatric CPR quality monitors to improve clinical care and save lives. !

"Deviceless and Autonomous Prospective Cardiac CT Triggering PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Coronary heart disease (CHD) is the leading cause of death worldwide. An estimated 3.8 million men and 3.4 million women die each year from CHD. Cardiac CT is a safe, accurate, non-invasive imaging modality used for diagnosing CHD and for planning therapeutic interventions. Cardiac CT exams are still challenging to perform due to the beating heart and the need to carefully time the scan based on cardiac phase and based on when the peak iodine contrast enhancement is reached. The overall exam duration and the complexity of performing these exams (contrasted with limited reimbursement levels) have limited patient access to cardiac CT to academic hospitals and specialized cardiac imaging centers. As compared to other CT exams, cardiac CT exams require additional patient preparation time, additional CT scans to track the bolus, and additional contrast agent to avoid missing the peak enhancement.  The goal of this project is to develop a smart cardiac CT scanner that autonomously determines the optimal scan time interval without ECG, traditional bolus tracking or timing bolus. Initial results show that it is possible to extract cardiac gating information from a few CT projection measurements prior to the diagnostic CT scan, without reconstruction. This is made possible by an innovative combination of fast X-ray tube pulsing and deep learning raw data analysis. This project builds on GE Research's experience with cardiac CT technologies, deep learning algorithms and X-ray tube physics, as well as the strong clinical cardiac CT expertise at the University of California San Diego.  The outcome of this project will be a clinical feasibility study of the autonomous triggering approach, which has the potential to simplify and increase patient access to cardiac CT, while reducing exam time, reducing con- trast agent volume, and ensuring robust image quality. PROJECT NARRATIVE The goal of this project is to develop a smart cardiac CT scanner that autonomously determines the optimal scan time interval without ECG, traditional bolus tracking or timing bolus. The result will be a patient-friendly and technologist-friendly cardiac CT exam with reduced exam time, minimal contrast agent volume and radia- tion dose, and robust image quality.",Deviceless and Autonomous Prospective Cardiac CT Triggering,10029731,R01HL153250,"['Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Angiography', 'Bolus Infusion', 'California', 'Cardiac', 'Cause of Death', 'Clinical', 'Contrast Media', 'Coronary', 'Coronary heart disease', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Ensure', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Financial compensation', 'Goals', 'Heart', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'Iodine', 'Measurement', 'Morphology', 'Motion', 'Myocardial', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Perfusion', 'Phase', 'Physics', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Preparation', 'Prospective Studies', 'Protocols documentation', 'Radiation Dose Unit', 'Research', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Rotation', 'Scanning', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Tube', 'Universities', 'Woman', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'algorithm development', 'base', 'contrast enhanced', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'experience', 'heart imaging', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging modality', 'innovation', 'men', 'non-invasive imaging', 'prospective', 'reconstruction', 'standard of care', 'temporal measurement', 'time interval']",NHLBI,GENERAL ELECTRIC GLOBAL RESEARCH CTR,R01,2020,1060608,0.13301645639713205
"HLS-Cardiac Safety AI Trained Human Heart and Micro Heart Model HLS17-12. The US FDA is considering to establish a new cardiac safety assessment approach  defined by a new paradigm called, “Comprehensive in vitro Proarrhythmia Assay (CIPA)”. The CIPA will 1) assess drug effects on each cardiac ion channel type individually using a high- throughput assay ion channel assays, 2) compute net effect on repolarization and risks for  torsade pointes (TdP) using a mathematical model, and 3) confirm the computational prediction by measuring the drug’s effects on action potentials in induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) derived human cardiac myocytes (CMs). This paradigm shift, if successful, could reduce the cost of  cardiac safety analyses by replacing or lowering the requirement to perform an expensive ($2-4 million) thorough QT study during clinical trials. Protecting consumers from drug induced  arrhythmia and sudden deaths is a paramount importance for the regulators and pharmaceutical companies as well as lowing the cost of drug development. Many cardiac safety scientists, however, are skeptical about CIPA’s approach since CMs derived from human iPSCs exhibit a poor excitation-contraction coupling due to their immaturity. In addition, a proposed CIPA mathematical model was developed to simulate electrophysiology of human adult CMs, so there is a mismatch between experimental system and computational tool. To address these concerns, we proposed three specific aims in tw0 phases by following Fast- Track SBIR processes. Phase I feasibility Aim 1 will measure drug-induced changes in AP and CaT using human adult heart slices isolated from human donors. Here we will confirm our  successful handling and analyzing human adult heart slices, which will be based on a recently  published protocol by our collaborator, Dr. Igor Efimov, at George Washington University. After this validation, we will move on to perform the following two studies: Aim 2. Compare drug-induced changes in AP and CaT in NuHearts generated from adult CMs and cardiac fibroblasts from same human donor hearts; Aim 3. Validate and improve the computational models and train an artificial intelligence to predict cardiac safety risks of unknow compounds. After our successful completion proposed projects, we can establish an unprecedented cardiac safety assessment platform that can predict safety issues using a well-trained AI without doing any experiments using human heart slices that are rarely accessible for most of the safety  laboratories or biotech firms. Because nearly one third of drug candidates fails to reach market due to its cardiac safety concerns, a better safety assessment approach without increasing its cost is needed to improve productivity of pharmaceutical industry. The proposed project combines computational and experimental analyses of cardiac safety parameters using adult heart cells isolated from a donor heart and its stem cell derived heart muscle cells to build a better but cost-effective cardiac safety assessment system. A successfully validated system enables drug developers to arcuately predict a new drug’s cardiac safety profile by only running cost-effective experiments using stem cell derived heart muscle cells that are accessible to many drug developers.",HLS-Cardiac Safety AI Trained Human Heart and Micro Heart Model,9948757,R44HL139248,"['3-Dimensional', 'Action Potentials', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Arrhythmia', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biological Assay', 'Biomedical Research', 'Biotechnology', 'Calcium', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Myocytes', 'Cardiotoxicity', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communities', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer Models', 'Contracts', 'Coupling', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Development', 'Dose', 'Drug Costs', 'Drug Industry', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Exhibits', 'Expert Systems', 'Fibroblasts', 'Gene Expression', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Guidelines', 'Heart', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Ion Channel', 'Laboratories', 'Marketing', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Mitochondria', 'Modeling', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Pharmacology', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physiology', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Preclinical Testing', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Productivity', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publishing', 'Pump', 'Reproducibility', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Safety', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Shipping', 'Ships', 'Slice', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Sudden Death', 'System', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Washington', 'Work', 'base', 'cardiac tissue engineering', 'commercialization', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'data archive', 'drug candidate', 'drug development', 'drug discovery', 'experimental analysis', 'experimental study', 'heart cell', 'heart preservation', 'high throughput screening', 'human data', 'improved', 'in vitro Assay', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'mathematical model', 'novel therapeutics', 'personalized medicine', 'precision drugs', 'response', 'safety assessment', 'screening', 'side effect', 'simulation', 'stem cells', 'success']",NHLBI,"INVIVOSCIENCES, INC.",R44,2020,861204,0.091176379434087
"Development of advanced cardiac SPECT imaging technologies Project Abstract Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT) continues to play a critical role in the diagnosis and management of coronary artery disease (CAD). While conventional SPECT scanners using parallel-hole collimators are still the foundation of cardiac SPECT, recently our field observed an exciting growth of new developments of dedicated cardiac scanners. Such dedicated scanners, such as the GE Alcyone 530/570c systems and the D-SPECT systems both with CZT detectors, typically have multiple detectors collecting photons emitted from the heart simultaneously, leading to dramatically improved sensitivity (2-5 X). In addition, the GE systems use pinhole collimators and can achieve much higher resolution. These dedicated scanners opened doors to new applications with significant clinical impact, including ultra-low-dose imaging, absolute quantification of myocardial blood flow (MBF) and coronary flow reserve (CFR), high resolution molecular imaging, multi-isotope imaging, motion correction, and many more. Most of these new applications are uniquely achievable only using dedicated scanners. While the dedicated cardiac SPECT systems can improve clinical practice and lead to numerous new clinical applications, such systems are far from being optimized to fully realize their great potentials. In this grant, we propose to systematically develop and optimize innovative imaging technologies for the GE 530/570c systems to further improve its clinical efficacy in a variety of significant ways. In Aim 1, we will develop and optimize methods for static cardiac SPECT imaging. We will develop various deep learning methods and investigate approaches to increase angular sampling to reduce noise, and improve resolution and quantitative accuracy. In Aim 2, we will develop and validate methods for dynamic SPECT imaging, particularly involving direct parametric image reconstruction. In Aim 3, we will develop and validate methods for dual-isotope SPECT. Monte Carso simulation and deep learning based methods will be developed for tracers with different spatial distributions and fast kinetics. In all three aims, large animal studies and human subject data will be used for optimization and validation. Narrative The success of imaging technology developments proposed in this grant will substantially improve the image quality, reduce patient dose, expand the applications of cardiac SPECT from mainly static imaging to dynamic imaging, and establish multi-isotope clinical imaging.",Development of advanced cardiac SPECT imaging technologies,10064473,R01HL154345,"['Address', 'Advanced Development', 'Algorithms', 'Amyloidosis', 'Anatomy', 'Animals', 'Blood flow', 'Cardiac', 'Charge', 'Clinical', 'Collimator', 'Computed Tomography Scanners', 'Coronary', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'DCNU', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dose', 'Event', 'Foundations', 'Gold', 'Grant', 'Heart', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Imaging technology', 'Infarction', 'Isotopes', 'Kidney', 'Kinetics', 'Lead', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Microspheres', 'Molecular Target', 'Monte Carlo Method', 'Motion', 'Myocardial', 'Myopathy', 'Noise', 'Patients', 'Perfusion', 'Photons', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Radiation Dose Unit', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Study Subject', 'System', 'Tail', 'Toxic effect', 'Tracer', 'Training', 'Validation', 'animal data', 'attenuation', 'base', 'cardiac single photon emission computed tomography', 'clinical application', 'clinical efficacy', 'clinical imaging', 'clinical practice', 'contrast enhanced', 'convolutional neural network', 'deep learning', 'detector', 'human subject', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging agent', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'molecular imaging', 'new growth', 'parametric imaging', 'prospective', 'reconstruction', 'respiratory', 'simulation', 'single photon emission computed tomography', 'success', 'technology development']",NHLBI,YALE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,806926,0.05613069627037582
"The Impact of Cocaine Abstinence or Reduced Use on Radiomic Features of Noncalcified Coronary Plaques in HIV-Infected Cocaine Users with Silent Coronary Artery Disease ABSTRACT Despite the success of antiretroviral therapy (ART), individuals living with HIV experience an increased risk of coronary artery disease (CAD). Although increased arterial inflammation on 18F-FDG-PET was shown to be associated with high risk plaque features (HRPFs) in those with HIV and subclinical atherosclerosis, there is no evidence of increased arterial inflammation in optimally treated HIV-infected adults with full viral suppression, low cardiovascular risk and no known CAD when the imaging results are compared to those from HIV- uninfected controls. These findings suggest that HIV-associated atherosclerosis may be triggered by factors other than HIV-associated inflammation such as traditional cardiovascular risk factors or cocaine use. Other evidence indicates that cocaine is associated with coronary atherosclerosis. It was also shown that cocaine use modifies the effect of HIV on subclinical coronary atherosclerosis. Supported by DA035632, this research team enrolled 102 daily cocaine users (including 84 HIV-infected) with contrast-enhanced coronary CT angiography (CCTA)-confirmed significant (>50% in diameter) coronary stenosis, and employed a cash- incentive approach to systematically reinforce cocaine abstinence. The study demonstrated that continued cocaine use led to coronary plaque volume progression, while abstinent or reduced cocaine use led to plaque volume regression. However, whether cocaine use influences plaque characteristics in HIV-infected cocaine users has not been investigated. Plaque characteristics are important because rupture-prone coronary plaques might not necessarily be only those, which cause obstructive stenosis, and that HRPFs are independent of the severity of coronary artery luminal stenosis. However, identification of the strongest predictor of CAD among four HRPFs, the napkin-ring sign (NRS), at present, is based only on expert subjective opinion. A landmark cardiovascular radiomics study calculated 4,440 radiomic features for each coronary plaque and identified a subset of these parameters which predicted NRS, a qualitative feature of prognostic imaging marker of acute coronary syndrome. It is quite possible that with the cardiac radiomic approach, the association between cocaine use and this critical biomarker will be further clarified. The objective of the proposed study is to examine whether cocaine use influences plaque features in HIV-infected cocaine users. The proposed study will perform radiomic analyses on the imaging data from 102 participants on DA035632. The specific aims of this study are: (1) To examine whether continued cocaine use is associated with the NRS and its associated radiomic features in HIV-infected cocaine users with significant coronary plaques, (2) To examine whether abstinent or reduced cocaine use ameliorated NRS and its associated radiomic features in HIV-infected cocaine users with significant coronary plaques, (3) To compare NRS and its associated radiomic features between HIV infected and uninfected participants, and (4) To validate the findings generated from this study. The proposed study will convert heart CT images into numeric data, and use artificial intelligence techniques to examine whether continued cocaine use worsens hidden heart disease, and reduced cocaine use slows down hidden heart disease in HIV infected chronic cocaine users.",The Impact of Cocaine Abstinence or Reduced Use on Radiomic Features of Noncalcified Coronary Plaques in HIV-Infected Cocaine Users with Silent Coronary Artery Disease,10148238,R21DA048780,"['AIDS prevention', 'Abstinence', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Angiography', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Baltimore', 'Biological Markers', 'Caliber', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Cocaine', 'Cocaine Users', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Coronary', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Coronary Stenosis', 'Coronary artery', 'Data', 'Enrollment', 'Event', 'Expert Opinion', 'Future', 'HIV', 'HIV antiretroviral', 'Heart', 'Heart Diseases', 'Image', 'Incentives', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Paper', 'Participant', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Rupture', 'Severities', 'Stenosis', 'Techniques', 'Viral', 'Visual', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'acute coronary syndrome', 'antiretroviral therapy', 'base', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'clinical practice', 'cocaine use', 'comorbidity', 'contrast enhanced', 'coronary plaque', 'experience', 'fluorodeoxyglucose', 'fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography', 'high risk', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'mortality', 'prognostic', 'radiomics', 'success', 'tool']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND BALTIMORE,R21,2020,231750,0.0400564503005645
"Gadolinium Free Cardiac MR Imaging of Scar and Fibrosis Cardiovascular disease continues to be the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of scarred or fibrotic heart tissue plays a major diagnostic and prognostic role in patients with coronary heart disease (CHD) or non-ischemic cardiomyopathy (NICM). Cardiac MRI is a non-invasive, multifaceted imaging modality and is the clinical gold standard for scar and fibrotic cardiac tissue imaging with use of gadolinium-based contrast injection. However, administration of such gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCA) prolongs the scan time, increases scan cost, and is contra-indicated in patients with impaired kidney function? a highly prevalent comorbidity in CHD patients. Until recently, GBCA was presumed to be safe in patients with normal kidney function; however, there are emerging data on long-term GBCA retention in the body. We aim to develop two complimentary approaches to reduce GBCA use in myocardial, or cardiac muscle, scar imaging. Initially, we will develop a quantitative risk-benefit model to identify NICM patients with a low chance of having scarred myocardium. Concurrently, we will develop a GBCA-free cardiac MR myocardial tissue probe platform based on AI (MyoProbe.ai) to quantify scarred regions of the heart. To accomplish this, we will develop and evaluate an individualized, patient-specific scar prediction model to reduce GBCA use in NICM patients with different etiologies by training the model to learn to identify whether the patient is likely to have scarring based on non-contrast images. If it is unlikely that a patient has scarring, contrast administration can be avoided. To develop and evaluate MyoProbe.ai for GBCA-free quantification of myocardial scar in CHD patients, we will use AI to integrate signal intensity and heart motion data from MRI images to accurately locate and quantify scar tissue. This information can then be used by cardiologists to diagnose and treat the patient. We will rigorously validate our risk-benefit model and AI myocardial probe platform using retrospectively and prospectively collected cardiac MRI images from multiple healthcare centers, MRI vendors, and magnetic field strengths. Our dataset will include different types of NICM and CHD patient populations to ensure that our work is applicable to patients with many different types of NICM and CHD. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of scarred/fibrotic heart tissue with gadolinium- based contrast agents (GBCA) plays a major diagnostic and prognostic role in patients with coronary heart disease (CHD) or non-ischemic cardiomyopathy (NICM). However, administration of GBCAs prolongs the scan time, increases scan cost, contaminates surface and drinking water, is retained in the body long-term, and is contra-indicated in patients with impaired renal function– a highly prevalent comorbidity in CHD patients. The goal of our study is to reduce or eliminate GBCA use in cardiac MR scar imaging using artificial intelligence (AI) by concurrently developing a quantitative model to identify NICM patients with a low likelihood of scarring and a GBCA-free cardiac MR AI platform to quantify scar tissue.",Gadolinium Free Cardiac MR Imaging of Scar and Fibrosis,10072898,R01HL154744,"['Adopted', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Blood Vessels', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Cicatrix', 'Clinical', 'Contrast Media', 'Coronary heart disease', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffuse', 'Ensure', 'Etiology', 'Fibrosis', 'Fostering', 'Gadolinium', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Growth', 'Healthcare', 'Heart', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Impaired Renal Function', 'Impairment', 'Injections', 'Ischemia', 'Kidney', 'Learning', 'Location', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Motion', 'Myocardial', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Myocardial tissue', 'Myocardium', 'Noise', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reference Standards', 'Relaxation', 'Renal function', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Surface', 'Technical Expertise', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissue imaging', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Vendor', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical application', 'clinical practice', 'comorbidity', 'coronary fibrosis', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'drinking water', 'heart imaging', 'heart motion', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'magnetic field', 'mortality', 'non-invasive imaging', 'novel', 'patient population', 'patient safety', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'prospective', 'radiomics']",NHLBI,BETH ISRAEL DEACONESS MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2020,946194,0.10256323192933231
"Refining repeat screening for coronary artery disease in kidney transplant candidates 7. Project Summary This K23 proposal will provide Xingxing S. Cheng, MD, MS with the protected time, mentorship, training, and research experience to become an independent clinical investigator. Dr. Cheng is a board-certified nephrologist and accredited transplant nephrologist, with a long-term vision of improving the effectiveness of health care for kidney transplant patients. She seeks to combine patient-oriented research and decision science to find innovative solutions to clinical problems. Skills she will acquire in this grant, under the guidance of a strong mentorship team, include 1) integration of patient-oriented research and decision analytic models; 2) assessing the heterogeneity of response in different patient subgroups; and 3) advanced modelling skills. This grant proposes to refine the process of screening of coronary artery disease in patients with chronic kidney disease on the wait-list awaiting kidney transplantation. Currently, patients undergo repeat cardiac screening tests at frequent intervals, few of which result in interventions. These tests impose a high treatment burden on patients and potentially delay time to transplant, while bringing unclear benefit to the patient. This grant proposes to refine the cardiac screening strategy and personalize it for specific patient subgroups (e.g. elderly patients with diabetes mellitus). It will examine strategies that vary the frequency of cardiac testing and risk stratification for cardiac testing based on a simple, inexpensive, and non-invasive test that can be performed in routine clinical settings, a 6-minute walk test (6MWT). This project will achieve this broad aim by three specific aims: 1) to characterize the 6MWT in identifying low-risk patients who do not additional cardiac testing; 2) to model strategies varying the frequency of cardiac testing and use of 6MWT; 3) to design strategies personalized for specific patient subgroups and model them in the entire kidney transplant candidate population of the United States (US). The first two aims will arise from a well-characterized cohort of patients at Dr. Cheng’s institution. Machine-learning systems will be used to identify which patient subgroups are best served by which strategies (i.e. the heterogeneity of response). The third aim will leverage the US Renal Data System, which Dr. Cheng’s mentors and institution has a track record of leveraging for innovative research. The proposed work has high potential to make a significant clinical impact. Its completion will enable the identification and characterization of rational strategies for pre-transplant screening of coronary artery disease that may be incorporated into clinical practice or pave the way for a future multi-center comparative effectiveness trial. The proposed work is realistic and feasible within the award period, and will allow Dr. Cheng to build research skills, advance and disseminate scientific knowledge, create additional collaborative networks, and compete for R01 or equivalent funding. In summary, the K23 award will provide the support to enable Dr. Cheng to become a successful independent clinical investigator. 8. Project Narrative Currently, patients on the kidney transplant waitlist undergo repeat cardiac screening tests at frequent intervals, but relatively few interventions result. This project proposes to refine the cardiac screening strategy and personalize it for specific patient subgroups (e.g. elderly patients without diabetes mellitus), by examining strategies that reduce the frequency of cardiac testing and use performance-based risk stratification to reduce the number of patients who need cardiac testing.

"Noninvasive Testing of Coronary Microvascular Reactivity Using High-resolution Free-breathing MRI PROJECT SUMMARY It was long taken for granted that obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD) is the primary driver of angina and major adverse cardiac events. However, recent landmark studies have shown that up to 50% of the patients referred for diagnostic testing have ischemia with no obstructive CAD (INOCA). A large proportion of INOCA patients have coronary microvascular dysfunction (CMD), which even in the absence of flow-limiting stenoses can lead to myocardial ischemia and carries a high risk of adverse events. The reference standard for assessment of CMD is the functional coronary reactivity (CR) test, which is invasive. Despite key studies showing value of stratifying therapy based on CR testing, the practical utility of CR testing in the INOCA population is limited by its invasive nature, which carries serious risks even at experienced centers. Hence, a noninvasive approach that can detect and stage the severity of CMD would be invaluable for managing INOCA patients. Driven by this unmet need, prior studies have employed imaging approaches to index myocardial perfusion reserve (MPR) against CR; however, the association shown to date between MPR and CR impairment has been weak, likely due to the suboptimal sensitivity of MPR to subendocardial myocardial blood flow (MBF) deficits which is a hallmark of CMD. Studies using invasive microsphere-based methods have established a stress subendocardial-to-subepicardial (endo-epi) MBF gradient of larger than 1.0 in healthy animals, and shown that it decreases well below 1 under abnormally elevated microvascular resistance. However, noninvasive detection of endo-epi MBF gradients using existing imaging strategies is challenging because of the need to resolve MBF transmurally. We have developed new MRI strategies aimed at overcoming key barriers for accurate evaluation of endo-epi MBF gradients and applied them in preliminary animal and patient studies. Based on our preliminary data, we hypothesize that in the setting of CMD, impaired microvascular CR manifests as a stress-induced endo- epi MBF gradient, and the magnitude of this gradient significantly correlates with CMD severity. To test this hypothesis, we propose 3 specific aims. In Aim 1, we will develop a free-breathing artifact-free MRI technique optimized for high-resolution imaging of endo-epi MBF gradients, combined with a machine learning approach for fully-automated objective quantification of MBF gradients. In Aim 2, we will test the hypothesis that CMD severity can be staged on the basis of MRI-derived stress MBF gradient in a pig model of CMD. In Aim 3, we will test the hypothesis that CMD severity in INOCA patients is highly correlated with MRI-derived stress MBF gradient. This project brings together multiple interdisciplinary investigators with a strong collective track record in developing cardiac imaging strategies to advance a noninvasive approach for determining CMD severity based on the MRI-derived stress MBF gradient. Hence the proposal is a major step towards improving the management of INOCA patients and towards imaging-guided evaluation of novel therapies aimed at CMD. PROJECT NARRATIVE Recent landmark studies have provided evidence that “small vessel” coronary dysfunction in patients with otherwise normal coronary arteries is a major cause of heart disease and can lead to poor health outcomes including heart failure. This research proposal seeks to develop a noninvasive approach for diagnosis and monitoring of small-vessel coronary dysfunction by developing innovative and reliable magnetic resonance imaging strategies. Our proposal has the potential to improve patient care in this population by providing a noninvasive alternative to the established invasive testing procedure, which carries a risk of complications and is only available at highly specialized medical centers.",Noninvasive Testing of Coronary Microvascular Reactivity Using High-resolution Free-breathing MRI,10037606,R01HL153430,"['Animals', 'Blood flow', 'Breathing', 'Cardiac', 'Clinical', 'Coronary', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Coronary Vessels', 'Coronary artery', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Diet', 'Echocardiography', 'Endothelium', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Family suidae', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Health', 'Heart Diseases', 'Heart failure', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hypertrophy', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Ischemia', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Microcirculation', 'Microspheres', 'Microvascular Dysfunction', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Myocardial', 'Myocardial Ischemia', 'Myocardial perfusion', 'Nature', 'Non-Invasive Cancer Detection', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patient imaging', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Procedures', 'Quality of life', 'Reference Standards', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Proposals', 'Resistance', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Scanning', 'Severities', 'Staging', 'Stress', 'Systole', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Vasodilator Agents', 'adverse event risk', 'base', 'experience', 'heart imaging', 'high resolution imaging', 'high risk', 'image guided', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging approach', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'outcome forecast', 'perfusion imaging', 'personalized medicine', 'recruit', 'sequence learning']",NHLBI,CEDARS-SINAI MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2020,699398,0.059475031396657774
"Comprehensive characterization of coronary atherosclerotic disease using photon-counting-detector dual-source CT and its impact on patient management PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Coronary artery disease (CAD) remains the main cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States. Cardiac CT provides fast non-invasive assessment of CAD with a high sensitivity and negative predictive value – provided that the lumen can be visualized. However, heavily calcified or stented coronary segments are non- assessable, precluding non-invasive diagnosis of flow-limiting coronary plaques in an estimated 2 million U.S. adults. In addition, the spatial resolution of state-of-the-art CT systems is insufficient for robust visualization of features associated with high risk plaques. Further, while CT can quantitatively evaluate the impact of obstructive CAD on myocardial function using dynamic perfusion imaging, this requires relatively high patient radiation doses, which has limited widespread adoption. Considering the high personal and societal cost of CAD, robust, accurate, non-invasive imaging of calcified and stented coronary arteries, high-risk plaque features, and myocardial perfusion defects in a single, low-radiation-dose exam is critically needed. Built by Siemens Healthcare, a first-of-its-kind, whole-body, photon-counting-detector (PCD) CT system was installed in 2014 at the Mayo Clinic. With support from NIH award EB016966, we showed that the increased iodine contrast-to-noise ratio, decreased electronic noise, spectral imaging capabilities, and improved spatial resolution of PCD-CT relative to commercial CT enabled us to accurately measure increased vasa vasorum density in injured swine carotid arterial walls, demonstrating the exceptional potential of PCD-CT in vascular imaging. Because this system lacks cardiac imaging capabilities, our objective is to develop and validate a PCD dual-source (DS) CT system and novel imaging algorithms to accurately assess CAD in humans, especially in patients with heavily calcified, stented, or high-risk plaques, and to identify patients with myocardial perfusion defects. Our premise is that the established benefits of PCD-CT, used with a DS geometry and advanced noise reduction and material decomposition algorithms, can meet these objectives. Our proposal is significant in many ways: the technology developments will benefit all of CT imaging; robust, accurate, non-invasive imaging of calcified and stented coronary arteries, high-risk plaque features, and myocardial perfusion defects in a single, low-radiation-dose exam will obviate the need for additional imaging, reducing the overall time and cost to comprehensively evaluate CAD and its clinical significance. To extend the demonstrated benefits of PCDs to cardiac CT will require numerous physics, engineering, and algorithm innovations, including novel noise reduction and material decomposition algorithms using energy, spatial and temporal domain redundancies, as well as deep learning. These advances will culminate in a large clinical study to demonstrate not merely that the images are “better,” as is so often done, but that PCD-DSCT provides clinically-significant improvements in the diagnosis and management of patients with suspected CAD. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project will develop a new type of cardiac computed tomography (CT) scanner that is able to comprehensively assess coronary artery disease in humans. This technology, known as photon-counting- detector dual-source CT, is capable of exceptional spatial and temporal resolution, multi-energy spectral imaging and reduced radiation doses, allowing it to image the coronary artery and myocardium with unparalleled quality. This will enable comprehensive assessment of coronary artery anatomy and myocardial function from a single imaging exam, reducing time to diagnosis and cost, while also improving patient diagnosis and management.",Comprehensive characterization of coronary atherosclerotic disease using photon-counting-detector dual-source CT and its impact on patient management,9972330,R01EB028590,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Award', 'Blood Vessels', 'Cardiac', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Computed Tomography Scanners', 'Contrast Media', 'Coronary', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Coronary artery', 'Defect', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dose', 'Engineering', 'Equipment', 'Family suidae', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Heart failure', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Iodine', 'Lesion', 'Low Dose Radiation', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Myocardial', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Myocardial perfusion', 'Myocardium', 'Noise', 'Patients', 'Perfusion', 'Physics', 'Physiological', 'Predictive Value', 'Radiation', 'Radiation Dose Unit', 'Reproducibility', 'Resolution', 'Signal Transduction', 'Societies', 'Source', 'Specimen', 'Stents', 'Sudden Death', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Translating', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Visualization', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'algorithm development', 'calcification', 'clinically significant', 'coronary plaque', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'density', 'design', 'detector', 'heart imaging', 'heart motion', 'high risk', 'human subject', 'imaging capabilities', 'improved', 'industry partner', 'injured', 'innovation', 'mortality', 'non-invasive imaging', 'noninvasive diagnosis', 'novel', 'perfusion imaging', 'photon-counting detector', 'routine practice', 'single photon emission computed tomography', 'societal costs', 'spectral energy', 'spectrograph', 'technology development', 'temporal measurement', 'vasa vasorum']",NIBIB,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,R01,2020,628053,-0.006389616444305457
"Blood and Urine Biomarkers for Predicting Long-Term Adverse Kidney and Cardiovascular Outcomes after Cardiac Surgery PROJECT SUMMARY In the United States over 500,000 cardiac surgeries are performed annually. Postoperative acute kidney injury (AKI) occurs in ~20% of cardiac surgical patients. Several cohort and registry studies have reported that AKI defined by rise in serum creatinine after cardiac surgery associates with development of chronic kidney disease and cardiovascular events. However, it is unclear which patients will develop long-term adverse kidney events, adverse cardiovascular events, or both. In recent years blood and urine AKI biomarkers have been identified that reflect different aspects of AKI biology and that detect serum creatinine defined AKI earlier than rise in serum creatinine or detect subclinical AKI that is not revealed by traditional serum creatinine assessment. Clinical outcomes and biomarker research has focused mainly on detecting cardiac surgery- associated AKI itself, but not on predicting which patients are at greatest risk for long-term adverse kidney and cardiovascular outcomes after AKI. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that perioperative blood and urine AKI biomarkers significantly associate with increased long-term (2 to 5 years) postoperative major adverse kidney events (MAKE) and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE). MAKE is defined as the composite of dialysis, death, renal hospitalization, or ≥ 30 day postoperative eGFR decline >25% from preoperative baseline. MACE is defined as the composite of death or hospitalizations for heart failure, myocardial infarction, coronary revascularization, arrhythmia, or stroke. We propose a prospective observational cohort study of 610 patients undergoing cardiac surgery at UT Southwestern Medical Center who will be followed for a minimum of 2 years and up to 5 years following cardiac surgery. Based on preliminary data we will assess plasma NT-pro- B-type natriuretic peptide, plasma intact fibroblast growth factor 23, serum cystatin C, urine TIMP-2*IGFBP7, and urine Kidney Injury Molecule-1 AKI biomarkers preoperatively and at 5 postoperative time points. This proposal will address three specific aims: 1) To determine the association between in-hospital AKI biomarkers and occurrence of MAKE during long-term follow-up; 2) To determine the association between in-hospital AKI biomarkers and occurrence of MACE during long-term follow-up; and 3) To develop clinical prediction models for long-term MAKE and MACE after cardiac surgery. In addition to traditional regression modeling, we will use machine learning that leverages detailed perioperative data including time-varying intraoperative and intensive care unit clinical data and blood and urine AKI biomarker data to create high performing prediction models. Our proposal is significant because knowing what blood and urine AKI biomarkers and clinical parameters accurately predict long-term major adverse kidney and cardiovascular outcomes after cardiac surgery provides the foundation for clinical trials that will identify effective short and long-term interventions for patients at highest risk. Our proposal is innovative because clinical and biomarker data has not been leveraged in this way to predict long-term MAKE and MACE after cardiac surgery. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research is relevant to public health because combining blood and urine acute kidney injury biomarkers and clinical data to identify cardiac surgical patients at highest risk for long-term major adverse kidney and cardiovascular outcomes will allow interventional studies to better individualize clinical management to prevent these outcomes. While acute kidney injury after cardiac surgery is associated with increased long-term adverse kidney and cardiovascular outcomes (~25% incidence), it remains unclear which patients with postoperative acute kidney injury are at highest risk. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to the NIH's mission to develop fundamental knowledge that can be applied to enhancing health, lengthening life, and reducing illness and disability.",Blood and Urine Biomarkers for Predicting Long-Term Adverse Kidney and Cardiovascular Outcomes after Cardiac Surgery,9930135,R01HL148448,"['Acute Renal Failure with Renal Papillary Necrosis', 'Address', 'Anesthesiology', 'Angiotensin Receptor', 'Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors', 'Applications Grants', 'Arrhythmia', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Biometry', 'Blood', 'Brain natriuretic peptide', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Surgery procedures', 'Cardiac rehabilitation', 'Cardiology', 'Cardiopulmonary Bypass', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cohort Studies', 'Computational Science', 'Coronary', 'Creatinine', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Dialysis procedure', 'Dose', 'Enrollment', 'Event', 'Foundations', 'Foxes', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Heart failure', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Incidence', 'Information Systems', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Intraoperative Care', 'Kidney', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Literature', 'Longterm Follow-up', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Nephrology', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Perioperative', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Plasma', 'Postoperative Period', 'Prospective Studies', 'Prospective cohort study', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Questionnaires', 'Records', 'Registries', 'Regression Analysis', 'Renal function', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Serum', 'Source', 'Stroke', 'Time', 'Transfusion', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Urine', 'base', 'biobank', 'clinical biomarkers', 'cohort', 'design', 'disability', 'fibroblast growth factor 23', 'health record', 'hemodynamics', 'high risk', 'innovation', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'post gamma-globulins', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'rat KIM-1 protein']",NHLBI,UT SOUTHWESTERN MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2020,797215,0.07975365375524064
"Computer-Assisted Histologic Evaluation of Cardiac Allograft Rejection Project Summary Though cardiac transplantation is a lifesaving intervention, cardiac allograft rejection (CAR) remains a relatively common and serious complication that confers an increased risk of acute graft failure and adverse patient outcomes. For three decades, endomyocardial biopsy (EMB) with histological grading, as recommended by the International Society of Heart and Lung Transplantation (ISHLT) has been the broadly applied standard for CAR diagnosis. However, it is widely appreciated that the ISHLT rejection grading standard lacks diagnostic accuracy and has limited ability to discern the mechanism of rejection. These limitations expose patients to risks of both over-treatment and under-treatment, and highlight the unmet need for more accurate and informative approaches to histopathologic analysis of EMB samples. Our team is a leader in computational pathology image analysis with over 200 papers and >30 issued patents in this area. We have already developed and evaluated a computer assisted histopathology grading evaluation (CACHE) scheme which (1) in N=205 patients, had an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC)=0.95 compared to two cardiac pathologists (mean AUC=0.74) in distinguishing normal from failing hearts and (2) could distinguish low and high ISHLT rejection grades in N=1109 patients with a performance that exceeds that of trained cardiac pathologists. Recognizing the frequent discordance between ISHLT rejection grade and the clinical trajectory of a rejection event, we will further develop and optimize CACHE to identify new “grade agnostic” morphologic biomarkers of clinically serious CAR. Our scientific premise is that morphologic biomarkers prioritized based on their correlation to patients’ clinical trajectories and underlying immunological disease mechanisms will generate an accurate, consistent and informative classifier for diagnosing allograft rejection. In service of this hypothesis, the proposed research will address three specific aims. In Aim 1, we will utilize computational image analysis to discover the morphologic biomarkers of rejection-related injury which are needed to develop a classifier capable of assessing the clinical trajectory of CAR. In Aim 2, we will provide mechanistic annotation of biomarkers identified in Aim 1 through correlation with in-situ immunologic markers using custom multi-parameter immunofluorescence panels. In Aim 3, we employ a multicenter, prospective cohort to validate the diagnostic and mechanistic accuracy of the new rejection classifier developed in Aims 1 and 2. Ultimately, development of a more accurate and mechanistically informative tool for morphologic diagnosis of CAR will improve patient outcomes by reducing over- and under- treatment and inspire applications in other organ transplants. Interestingly, development of a superior histologic diagnostic tool will empower development of alternative, biopsy-free diagnostic approaches that have been handicapped by the necessity of comparison with the flawed ISHLT rejection grade as a reference standard. Project Narrative For heart transplant recipients, allograft rejection remains a relatively common and serious complication associated with adverse patient outcomes. Shortcomings of the current rejection grading standard for heart biopsies leads to both over- and under-treatment, accordingly, this proposal will develop and validate a computer assisted rejection grading classifier that is more accurate, consistent and informative for diagnosing heart allograft rejection. Improved diagnostic accuracy will improve patient outcomes, inspire similar applications in other organ transplants and empower development of additional technologies that have been constrained by the current flawed rejection standard.",Computer-Assisted Histologic Evaluation of Cardiac Allograft Rejection,10070406,R01HL151277,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Allografting', 'Antibodies', 'Archives', 'Area', 'Benign', 'Biological Markers', 'Biopsy', 'Biopsy Specimen', 'Cardiac', 'Cells', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Complication', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Derivation procedure', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disabled Persons', 'Disease', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Functional disorder', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Graft Rejection', 'Guidelines', 'Heart', 'Heart Transplantation', 'Heart-Lung Transplantation', 'Histologic', 'Histopathologic Grade', 'Histopathology', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Immune', 'Immune System Diseases', 'Immunofluorescence Immunologic', 'Immunologic Markers', 'Immunologics', 'In Situ', 'Injury', 'International', 'Interobserver Variability', 'Intervention', 'Journals', 'Legal patent', 'Lymphocyte', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Morphology', 'Organ Transplantation', 'Outcome', 'Paper', 'Pathologist', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Prospective cohort', 'Protocols documentation', 'ROC Curve', 'Recurrence', 'Reference Standards', 'Research', 'Retrospective cohort', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Scheme', 'Services', 'Severities', 'Slide', 'Societies', 'Stains', 'Syndrome', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissue imaging', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Transplant Recipients', 'Transplantation', 'allograft rejection', 'base', 'biomarker discovery', 'biomarker validation', 'clinical predictors', 'clinically significant', 'cohort', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'feature detection', 'graft failure', 'heart allograft', 'heart imaging', 'improved', 'innovation', 'molecular marker', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'overtreatment', 'pathology imaging', 'phenotypic data', 'population based', 'post-transplant', 'prospective', 'screening', 'success', 'tool', 'transplant centers', 'treatment as usual', 'treatment choice']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2020,845590,0.04104325813598665
"QT prolonging medications and sudden cardiac death among individuals on hemodialysis PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT Individuals receiving maintenance hemodialysis (HD) have exceedingly high mortality, driven largely by cardiovascular events. The rate of sudden cardiac death (SCD) in the HD population exceeds that of the general population by more than 20-fold. Risk factors for SCD such as structural heart disease and conduction abnormalities are common among people with end-stage kidney disease, but traditional preventive strategies, such as antiarrhythmic medications and implantable cardioverter defibrillators, do not lower SCD risk in HD patients. However, medication-provoked SCD may be preventable, and, to-date, has been understudied in HD patients. Dialysis patients are often prescribed medications that have the undesirable, off-target effect of delayed ventricular repolarization, which manifests as QT-interval prolongation on an electrocardiogram, and can trigger fatal arrhythmias. Although more than 50% of dialysis patients are prescribed medications that can prolong the QT-interval (e.g. certain antidepressants, antibiotics, antiemetics), there are critical knowledge gaps about the cardiac safety of these medications. In fact, their safety profiles rest on data obtained from healthy volunteers and have not been explicitly evaluated in HD patients. By executing the proposed studies, we will provide a comprehensive understanding of the essential safety data relevant to the prescription of non- cardiac QT-prolonging medications to HD patients. In Aim 1, we will determine the relative SCD risk of the most commonly prescribed non-cardiac medications with higher QT-prolonging potential vs. clinically relevant comparator medications with lower QT-prolonging potential among HD patients. In Aim 2, we will identify modifiable clinical factors (e.g. dialysate composition and concurrent prescription medications) that may be targeted to mitigate SCD risk from QT-prolonging medications. In Aim 3, we will identify prescribers of higher risk QT-prolonging medications and associated encounters that should prompt medication reconciliation and decision support tool use. Then, in Aim 4, we will develop individualized decision support tools for QT- prolonging medication prescribing that integrate many comorbid conditions, HD treatment, and medication- related risk factors. This work will yield decision support tools that facilitate personalized SCD risk assessments and safer prescribing of QT-prolonging medications to reduce SCD risk among HD patients. Moreover, the decision support tools generated in this project will serve as the subject of future pragmatic trials testing the impact of tool implementation on cardiovascular outcomes. PROJECT NARRATIVE Hemodialysis patients experience a disproportionately high burden of sudden cardiac death. Medication- provoked sudden cardiac death (i.e. death triggered by QT-prolonging medications) may be preventable and has not been studied enough in this population. Our project aims to uncover medication-related risk factors for sudden cardiac death and develop clinical decision support tools that will promote safer medication prescribing.",QT prolonging medications and sudden cardiac death among individuals on hemodialysis,9943546,R01HL152034,"['Antibiotics', 'Antidepressive Agents', 'Antiemetics', 'Arrhythmia', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Biometry', 'Calcium', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Dialysis patients', 'Dialysis procedure', 'Drug Interactions', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Electrolytes', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emergency Care', 'End stage renal failure', 'Epidemiology', 'Event', 'Future', 'General Population', 'Hemodialysis', 'Implantable Defibrillators', 'Individual', 'Investments', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Life', 'Link', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Medicare', 'Observational Study', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Polypharmacy', 'Population', 'Potassium', 'Prevention strategy', 'Publishing', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk-Benefit Assessment', 'Safety', 'Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor', 'Testing', 'Ventricular', 'Work', 'base', 'case control', 'clinical decision support', 'clinically relevant', 'comorbidity', 'experience', 'healthy volunteer', 'high risk', 'machine learning algorithm', 'medication safety', 'modifiable risk', 'mortality', 'mortality risk', 'personalized decision', 'point of care', 'pragmatic trial', 'structural heart disease', 'sudden cardiac death', 'support tools', 'tool']",NHLBI,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2020,606842,0.047846234747502485
"Gastrointestinal Safety of Antithrombotic Drug Regimens ABSTRACT Patients with atrial fibrillation, post-acute coronary syndrome and venous thromboembolism are prescribed antithrombotic drugs (antiplatelet agents and oral anticoagulants) in dual and triple combinations. These drugs independently cause gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) from mucosal defects or vascular abnormalities of the gastrointestinal tract. Cardiac patients are the fastest growing at-risk group due to the rapidly aging US population, their high-burden of co-morbidity, frequent antithrombotic polypharmacy and prescription of new antithrombotic drugs with higher incidence of GI adverse events. The real-world GIB risk of antithrombotic agents used in combination in a diverse cardiac population has yet to be characterized. Furthermore, we have previously demonstrated poor performance of existing risk scores (HAS-BLED, CHA2DS2-VASC etc.) for the prediction of non- warfarin antithrombotic drug bleeding; scores frequently used in the clinical setting despite their inaccuracy. Absence of knowledge regarding the real-world risk of antithrombotic-GIB, and the inability to accurately predict which patients will bleed, hampers patient counselling regarding a frequently occurring adverse event which is known to cause morbidity and mortality among cardiac patients. We propose to fill this knowledge gap by quantifying GIB risk in a large, geographically diverse cohort of elderly and non-elderly cardiac patients with atrial fibrillation, venous thromboembolism or post-acute coronary syndrome. GIB associated with antithrombotic drug combinations will be stratified by underlying cardiac conditions; incidence rates (events/100 patient-years) and propensity-matched Cox proportional models (with 95% confidence intervals) will be used to estimate outcome. We will examine heterogeneity of safety effects related to age, chronic co-morbidity, and hepatic or renal dysfunction. Machine learning techniques will then be used to derive and validate a highly sensitive algorithm for the prediction of antithrombotic-related GIB. Discovery of such an algorithm is the first step in the future application of a predictive model in any evidence-based clinical delivery platform, such as a decision rule or risk calculator. NARRATIVE Gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) in cardiac patients is common, deadly and on the rise due to an older population, antiplatelet and anticoagulant drugs used in combination, and availability of new drugs with higher GIB risk than their predecessors. Lack of data regarding the magnitude of GIB and limited knowledge of which patients are most at risk, prevents accurate counselling regarding cardiac drug safety. We will quantify this risk, study risk factors; and use machine learning techniques to derive and validate a clinical algorithm to better predict at-risk patients.",Gastrointestinal Safety of Antithrombotic Drug Regimens,9916670,R01HS025402,[' '],AHRQ,MAYO CLINIC ARIZONA,R01,2020,394737,0.07364789180476361
"Cloud-based High-throughput Acquisition and Analytics of Zebrafish Electrocardiogram for Cardiac Studies and Drug Development Project Summary Sensoriis, Inc is a company that, develops evidence-based sensing solutions to support biological investigations and address health care problems. The goal of this NIH SBIR Phase II grant with University of California Irvine is to provide novel systems to assess cardiac electrophysiology in zebrafish models, supporting heart disease studies and drug screening. Heart disease plagues the world as the leading cause of mortality. Cardiac arrhythmic diseases alone contributed about 350,000 deaths annually in the U.S. Although causative genes for some of them have been partially discovered, genetic basis for the majority remains poorly understood. The zebrafish (Dario rerio) model system is an important vertebrate experimental model owing to its small size, low-cost for maintenance, short generation time, amenable and conserved genetics, and optical transparency. Zebrafish have long been used as model system for understanding human cardiac development, disease, and regeneration. Further, zebrafish model enables a forward genetic approach to reveal the genetic basis and underlying molecular mechanisms of numerous heart diseases. Owing to the physiological similarities to humans’, zebrafish have also proven to be an ideal model system for drug screening. The conventional setup for cardiac phenotype acquisition in zebrafish (i.e. electrocardiogram – ECG) involves anesthesia causing variation in functionality. To date, there is no system which can offer cardiac phenotype monitoring in freely-swimming zebrafish, not to mention for multiple fish simultaneously. Further, data processing and analysis have been done manually, making it impossible to conduct large-scale studies. In this context, we propose to establish a long-term roadmap using multidisciplinary approaches to enable i) novel devices and systems to provide reliable ECG data of multiple fish (both adult fish and larvae) over a long period of time; ii) cloud-based systems to effectively process and interpret as well as study large-scale data; and iii) a host of cardiac studies as well as drug investigations using the zebrafish models and our novel tools. PROJECT NARRATIVE In this Phase II SBIR grant, Sensoriis, Inc and the University of California Irvine will develop novel bioengineering tools to collect and study electrocardiogram of the zebrafish model with high throughput. The goal is to facilitate and reduce cost and time of cardiac phenotype-based acquisition and analytics in the zebrafish models, supporting numerous cardiac studies and drug screening applications.

"Novel mechanisms and treatment of arrhythmia during resuscitation Resuscitation from sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) is typically initiated in patients with ongoing ischemia and ventricular fibrillation (VF) or tachycardia (VT) that, even if successful, is commonly followed by repeated rearrest. Despite significant efforts to improve resuscitation from SCA, survival remains poor prompting NIH to identify resuscitation as a high priority for emergency care research. Beat-to-beat alternans of cellular repolarization in the myocardium (repolarization alternans) is a substrate for arrhythmias, is rampant during resuscitation, and is manifested on the ECG as T-wave oscillations that can alternate (2:1) or as more complex oscillations. In preliminary studies, we observed in resuscitation patients and in an in vivo translational model of resuscitation from SCA, that rearrest due to VT/VF is preceded by T-wave oscillations that are complex; whereas, rearrest due to pulseless electrical activity (PEA) is preceded by increased T-wave oscillations that alternate. Accordingly, we contend that when T-wave oscillations are complex, repolarization alternans in the myocardium is spatially discordant, which is repolarization alternans occurring out-of-phase in adjacent regions and is highly arrhythmogenic. In contrast, when T-wave oscillations alternate, repolarization alternans in the myocardium is spatially in-phase (concordant), which poses no known immediate arrhythmia risk but is associated with mechanical dysfunction and, thus, PEA. Finally, in the absence of any repolarization alternans, risk of rearrest due to PEA or VT/VF is low. We hypothesize that during resuscitation rearrest due to VT/VF or PEA is strongly linked to repolarization alternans in the myocardium that is spatially discordant or not, respectively, and that specifically targeting the underlying mechanisms can prevent rearrest due to VT/VF and, possibly, PEA. In addition, the full spectrum of ECG T-wave oscillations can be utilized to predict no rearrest and rearrest from VT/VF or PEA and, thus, be used in the future as a biomarker to guide therapy and significantly improve outcomes. Our hypotheses will be tested with the following aims. 1) Determine the mechanistic relationship between cellular repolarization alternans and rearrest due to VT/VF or PEA in an in vivo model of resuscitation. 2) Determine if targeting the mechanisms of repolarization alternans can prevent rearrest during resuscitation, thereby gaining additional mechanistic insight. 3) Develop and test an ECG biomarker for predicting risk of rearrest due to VT/VF and PEA in resuscitation patients. To achieve these aims, we will utilize sophisticated instrumentation and signal processing in an in vivo translational model of resuscitation as well as in pre-hospital and in- hospital resuscitation patients. We have also established a highly translational collaboration that combines expertise in emergency medicine, cardiac arrhythmia, and clinical electrophysiology. Our scientific environment provides a unique opportunity to develop a better understanding of arrhythmia mechanisms relevant to resuscitation in order to develop novel and effective therapies. Project Narrative Sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) due to arrhythmia is a major public health problem and despite significant efforts to improve resuscitation from SCA, rearrest and survival remain poor. Consequently, improved approaches are needed, and NIH has recently identified resuscitation as a high priority for emergency care research. We propose to investigate the mechanisms of rearrest during resuscitation to develop novel and effective therapeutic strategies that improve outcomes.",Novel mechanisms and treatment of arrhythmia during resuscitation,9886863,R01HL142754,"['Acute', 'Arrhythmia', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Circulation', 'Cardiac', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Development', 'Distress', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Emergency Medicine', 'Emergency research', 'Environment', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Gap Junctions', 'Heart', 'Heart Arrest', 'Hospitals', 'Ischemia', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mechanics', 'Metabolic', 'Modeling', 'Myocardial Ischemia', 'Myocardium', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Public Health', 'Reperfusion Therapy', 'Resuscitation', 'Risk', 'Sum', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Translating', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Ventricular Fibrillation', 'Ventricular Tachycardia', 'base', 'effective therapy', 'epicardial mapping', 'hemodynamics', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'in vivo', 'in vivo Model', 'insight', 'instrument', 'instrumentation', 'mortality', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'predictive marker', 'prevent', 'rearrest', 'signal processing', 'translational model']",NHLBI,CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,668976,0.03139218759880206
"Scalable platform for optimizing human cardiac tissue engineering via optical pacing and on-demand oxygenation PROJECT SUMMARY Induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (iPS-CM) are emerging as an invaluable in vitro human experimental platform for disease modeling, drug discovery, cardiotoxicity screening, gene editing and functional genomics. For the first time, cardiac electrophysiology has access to a scalable human experimental model, which, currently, offers the only path to personalized (cardiac) medicine as patient-derived iPS-CMs can be generated on a progressively faster time scale. The clear potential of this technology motivates efforts to address the main criticisms facing iPS-CMs, namely the need for further maturation and reduction of phenotype heterogeneity. As multiple approaches are being pursued to improve iPS-CM maturation and to approximate the functionality of the adult human myocardium, we argue that combinatorial optimizations necessitate new high-throughput (HT) technology and automation. The overall goal of this project is to develop and validate a scalable platform for optimizing cardiac tissue engineering via chronic reconfigurable optical pacing and “on-demand” oxygenation for gaining mechanistic insights into cardiac metabolism and electrophysiology, a platform we call ChROME. Chronic electrical stimulation is a viable lead to iPS-CM maturation, yet it has remained under-explored, specifically as related to the role of mass transport and oxygenation during such stimulation. Leveraging our expertise in the theoretical and experimental use of optogenetic tools for cardiac applications (Entcheva) and automation (Kostov, Li, Entcheva, Kay), we propose to design and validate the first-generation HT-ChROME platform, that will integrate continuous monitoring of key physiological parameters. Our team’s expertise in optical oxygen sensing (Kostov), in-house manufacturing of “on-demand” oxygenation nanocarriers (perfluorocarbons, PFC) (Kay) and metabolic characterization (Kay, Beard) will be applied to address the increased metabolic demands during stimulation. The ability to quantify “functional maturation” by relevant measures (voltage, calcium, contraction) in a high-throughput manner (Entcheva) in 2D and 3D cardiac tissue constructs (Vunjak-Novakovic), using our automated platform OptoDyCE (all-optical dynamic cardiac electrophysiology) is critical in this undertaking. Employing these HT tools and other imaging and omics modalities (Popratiloff, Horvath), we will elucidate the spectrum of responses triggered by chronic stimulation of iPS-CMs: beneficial/maturation effects vs. pathological overload effects, depending on load and oxygenation conditions. The proposed HT-ChROME platform represents a critical step in resolving issues impeding progress with iPS-CMs to accelerate their wide-spread adoption in basic and translational applications. The obtained large-scale data will inform a new generation of biophysical models linking human cardiac metabolism and electrophysiology.

"Multi-Omic Markers of Cardiac Function and Structure within the Pressure Overloaded Heart PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT This proposed study is motivated by the public health importance of aortic stenosis (AS), a common form of valvular heart disease that is associated with substantial morbidity and mortality. Once symptomatic, survival is a dismal 50% at 1-year if left untreated. Clinical symptoms develop once cardiac compensatory mechanisms fail, indicating the need for aortic valve replacement (AVR), but because AS primarily affects the elderly, symptoms are often incorrectly attributed to comorbid conditions, advanced age, or both—resulting in delayed treatment. While most patients that eventually undergo AVR experience improvements in symptoms and survival, nearly half of patients die within the first year after AVR or fail to reap the symptom and health status improvements for which they underwent AVR. Our research suggests that irreversible cardiac remodeling and injury related to delayed treatment contribute to these poor clinical outcomes, highlighting the unmet need for objective and sensitive measures to inform clinical decisions regarding the timing of AVR. Our long-term goal is to develop and implement an omics-based precision medicine approach for identifying patients with severe AS at-risk for irreversible cardiac remodeling and injury who would benefit from earlier AVR, and our central hypothesis is that multi-omic signatures reflective of dimensions of cardiac structure and function will identify irreversible cardiac remodeling and therefore predict the clinical response to AVR. Our prior work and preliminary studies provide strong support for our hypothesis and demonstrate that our experienced multidisciplinary team is uniquely qualified to complete the proposed study. We have identified metabolomic signatures that relate strongly to measures of cardiac function and structure and predict mortality after AVR, and also proteomic signatures relating to cardiac function that differentiate severe AS and associate with mortality. Within this proposal, we adopt a longitudinal systems biology approach that leverages the latest in proteomic and metabolomic (multi-omic) sciences to: discover, test, and cross-validate multi-omic signatures of cardiac function and structure in patients with severe AS (Aim 1); characterize longitudinal multi-omic signatures and associations with changes in cardiac structure and function after AVR (Aim 2); and evaluate the accuracy with which multi-omic signatures predict response to AVR (Aim 3). Our approach will enable us to identify multi-omic signatures of irreversible cardiac remodeling and injury in patients with severe AS. These data will support the development of new precision medicine-based strategies for identifying patients who would benefit from earlier clinical intervention in an effort to reduce mortality and maximize health after AVR. PROJECT NARRATIVE Aortic stenosis ultimately leads to heart failure and death, but valve replacement is curative. For many patients, valve replacement is performed too late, after damage to the heart muscle is no longer reversible, resulting in persistent symptoms and increased risk for death. The goal of my research is to identify compounds within the blood that can serve as an early warning that the heart is struggling to overcome aortic stenosis and can therefore help physicians plan the optimal timing of valve replacement surgery.",Multi-Omic Markers of Cardiac Function and Structure within the Pressure Overloaded Heart,9946858,R01HL151838,"['Adopted', 'Affect', 'Aortic Valve Stenosis', 'Biological Process', 'Blood', 'Cardiac', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Practice Guideline', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Distress', 'EFRAC', 'Early Intervention', 'Elderly', 'Energy Metabolism', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Health Status', 'Heart', 'Heart Injuries', 'Heart Valve Diseases', 'Heart failure', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Left', 'Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction', 'Left Ventricular Remodeling', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Myocardial dysfunction', 'Myocardium', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Prospective cohort', 'Proteomics', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Systems Biology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Ventricular', 'Work', 'aortic valve replacement', 'classification algorithm', 'clinical predictors', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'experience', 'heart dimension/size', 'heart function', 'metabolomics', 'mortality', 'mortality risk', 'multidisciplinary', 'multiple omics', 'patient registry', 'persistent symptom', 'precision medicine', 'predict clinical outcome', 'predicting response', 'predictive signature', 'pressure', 'protein metabolite', 'proteomic signature', 'response', 'valve replacement']",NHLBI,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2020,696226,0.07633325805873295
"Cardiac Electrical Instability in Posttraumatic Stress Disorder: A Twin Study PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a chronic disabling psychiatric condition characterized by a persistent maladaptive reaction to the exposure to severe psychological stress, including trauma re-experiencing, hypervigilance, and hyperarousal. Our group has conducted seminal work to establish PTSD as a risk factor for coronary heart disease and autonomic dysfunction. A major concern, based on these findings, is that PTSD could increases the risk of ventricular arrhythmia and sudden cardiac death (SCD) through autonomic dysregulation. This has important clinical implications on management of cardiovascular risk in PTSD. Two important metrics that are potentially useful for risk stratification are T-wave alternans (TWA) and Morphological Beat Variability (MVB). We have found in preliminary investigations that TWA may be linked to acute stress and PTSD, but additional study is needed. In this R03 application, we seek to collaborate with Dr. Gari Clifford in Biomedical Informatics to create a custom program that measures TWA and MVB with state-of- the-art signal processing in a recently recruited cohort of male veteran twins with high-resolution ECG data. We will also study for genetic influences with twin modeling and the effects of acute stress with laboratory- based trauma reminder challenges. Our aims are to 1) Examine the relationship of PTSD with MVB and TWA a) over 24 hours, and b) during trauma recall challenge; 2) Evaluate the potential role for familial and genetic factors by comparing the within-pair difference in MVB and TWA between monozygotic and dizygotic twin pairs discordant for PTSD. We hypothesize that MVB and TWA will be higher, on average, during a 24 hour period, and will increase during trauma recall challenge in PTSD subjects compared to those without PTSD. In addition, we hypothesize that the relationship of PTSD with MVB and TWA will be stronger within DZ pairs than MZ pairs, implying that there is a common genetic pathway linking PTSD and SCD risk. The development of methods to measure these factors, as well as the study of these important mechanisms, will accelerate Dr. Shah’s progress towards research independence, and help to establish him as an expert in the field of mental stress and SCD. PROJECT NARRATIVE Posttraumatic stress disorder is a common and debilitating psychiatric condition that is associated with increased heart disease risk. Whether or not this means that it increases the risk of ventricular arrhythmia is not known, but important for clinical management. To study this, we aim to examine the risk of PTSD and its symptoms on electrocardiographic markers of sudden cardiac death.",Cardiac Electrical Instability in Posttraumatic Stress Disorder: A Twin Study,9915968,R03HL146879,"['3-Dimensional', 'Acute', 'Algorithms', 'Ambulatory Monitoring', 'Arrhythmia', 'Autonomic Dysfunction', 'Award', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Electrophysiologic Techniques', 'Charge', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Coronary heart disease', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Dizygotic Twins', 'EKG QRS Complex', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Emotional Stress', 'Evaluation', 'Exposure to', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genetic study', 'High Prevalence', 'Hour', 'Individual', 'International', 'Investigation', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Monozygotic twins', 'Morphology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Prevalence', 'Psyche structure', 'Psychological Stress', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Reaction', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk stratification', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Seminal', 'Stress', 'Symptoms', 'Tachyarrhythmias', 'Testing', 'Trauma', 'Twin Multiple Birth', 'Twin Studies', 'Ventricular', 'Ventricular Arrhythmia', 'Veterans', 'Viola', 'Visit', 'War', 'Work', 'acute stress', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'cohort', 'design', 'experience', 'heart disease risk', 'heart rate variability', 'high risk', 'improved', 'insight', 'interest', 'male', 'method development', 'mortality risk', 'novel', 'post-traumatic symptoms', 'programs', 'recruit', 'signal processing', 'sudden cardiac death', 'traumatic event', 'traumatic stress', 'vector']",NHLBI,EMORY UNIVERSITY,R03,2020,78000,0.043135556639212064
"Systems Biology Analysis of Cardiac Electrical Activity and Arrhythmias. Cardiac arrhythmias are a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States. Abnormalities in heart rate, cardiac conduction (PR and QRS) and repolarization (QT) measured on the ECG predispose to the clinically important cardiac arrhythmias of atrial fibrillation (AF) and ventricular fibrillation (VF) / sudden cardiac death (SCD). We examine the genomic basis of these ECG endophenotypes in order to deconstruct arrhythmias into more proximate traits and discrete components, allowing us to better understand underlying mechanisms, provide insight into arrhythmia generation, and help target development of novel therapies.  The molecular architecture of cardiac electrical activity and arrhythmias is not fully understood, but likely involves genomic, epigenomic, and environmental influences. Over the past 10 years, we have identified numerous common loci associated with cardiac electrical activity and arrhythmias, yet these common variants account for only a portion of the heritability of electrophysiologic and arrhythmic phenotypes. The agnostic examination of genotype-phenotype associations employed in genome- wide association studies (GWAS) does not incorporate knowledge of functional genomic regions or important biologic relationships. Additionally, we currently lack an understanding of the molecular mechanisms connecting mostly intergenic and intronic GWAS signals to phenotype. We therefore hypothesize that a systems biology approach integrating genetic sequence variation with omic data (epigenomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic data) will uncover novel associations and elucidate biologic mechanisms associated with arrhythmia-related phenotypes. We further hypothesize that examining the simultaneous association between sequence variation and multiple cardiac electrophysiologic phenotypes will help uncover additional novel mechanisms associated with cardiac electrical activity and arrhythmias.  TOPMed's combination of rich phenotype data, with whole genome sequence (WGS), epigenomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic data, provides a unique opportunity to more comprehensively explore these hypotheses. We leverage sequence, omic, and phenotype data from multiple cohort studies to efficiently and cost-effectively examine and dissect association of omic factors with cardiac electrophysiology and arrhythmia risk. Our application is an ambitious yet eminently feasible effort that integrates clinical, genetic, and systems biology expertise. We aim to discover associations using omics data (Aims 1 and 2) and elucidate specific genes and biologic pathways underlying these associations (Aims 3 and 4). Our ultimate goal is to identify pathways, genes, and genetic variation that are clinically relevant, and therefore potentially the target of new therapies, diagnostics, or risk predictions. Narrative Cardiac arrhythmias are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States. This proposal aims to use genomic, epigenomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic data, combined with complex systems biology and pleiotropic analyses, to better understand the underlying pathways and genes involved in normal electrophysiology and arrhythmia formation. The identification of biologic factors that influence cardiac electrical activity and arrhythmias will provide insight into the mechanisms of arrhythmia generation, and perhaps identify better targets for drug development and prevention.",Systems Biology Analysis of Cardiac Electrical Activity and Arrhythmias.,9921462,R01HL141989,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Architecture', 'Arrhythmia', 'Atrial Fibrillation', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Biological', 'Biological Factors', 'Biological Process', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Electrophysiologic Techniques', 'Clinical', 'Cohort Studies', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Drug Targeting', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genomic Segment', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Genotype-Tissue Expression Project', 'Goals', 'Grouping', 'Heart', 'Heart Rate', 'Heritability', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Medical Genetics', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Multiomic Data', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Regulator Genes', 'Risk', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Systems Biology', 'Testing', 'Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine', 'United States', 'Variant', 'Ventricular Fibrillation', 'base', 'causal variant', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinically relevant', 'cost', 'drug development', 'endophenotype', 'epigenomics', 'functional genomics', 'genome wide association study', 'heart electrical activity', 'insight', 'mortality', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'phenotypic data', 'pleiotropism', 'rare variant', 'sudden cardiac death', 'trait', 'transcriptomics', 'whole genome']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2020,476969,0.08323112777449669
"Network for Cardiothoracic Surgical Investigations in Cardiovascular Medicine Project Summary Cardiac surgery has been a highly innovative field of medicine. The introduction of major innovations, and ongoing incremental change in existing ones, have extended survival and improved quality of life for many patients suffering from cardiac disease. A rapid pace of innovation requires a rigorous infrastructure for clinical evaluation that provides timely assessments of the value of new and modified treatments. The Cardiothoracic Surgical Trials Network (CTSN) was created to provide a rigorous evidence base tor the surgical treatment of cardiothoracic disease. The International Center for Health Outcomes and Innovation Research (InCHOIR) enthusiastically embraces the opportunity to continue to work in partnership with clinical investigators and the NIH as the CTSN DCC. The Network has developed a rich research agenda for the renewal that includes trials of novel neuroprotective agents, long-term antithrombotic strategies, new regenerative medicine therapies, and surgical approaches to valvular disease, heart failure and atrial fibrillation. Given our long-standing interest and experience in the design and analysis of cardiac surgery multicenter studies, we are in a strong position to serve as the coordinating center for this vital clinical research effort. In particular, we will provide leadership in designing novel trials that optimize sample size, include patient- centered as well as clinical endpoints, and collect data from a variety of sources, including electronic data capture systems, mobile apps and wearable sensors, registries and electronic health records. We have a strong track record of obtaining efficient regulatory approval for our trials from the FDA and Health Canada, training and monitoring sites nationally and internationally, ensuring robust enrollment and retention, data management and quality assurance, data sharing, and overall administrative coordination. We have the infrastructure to expand our trials to include mechanistic studies that use biospecimens collected and managed through the CTSN biorepository. Finally, the DCC plays an important role in the analysis, interpretation and dissemination of research findings. We will continue to support the process of publishing in high-impact journals that should lead to revision of practice guidelines and to surgical practice itself. This goal should be further optimized by incorporating Implementation Science approaches into Network trials, which should decrease the well-recognized gap between publication of trial results and adoption of findings into widespread practice. NARRATIVE Clinical trials are a critical step in translating discoveries into better treatments for people burdened by cardiac disorders. Such trials typically require cooperation and coordination among a broad range of investigators, patients, government agencies, and industry partners. The objective of the Cardiothoracic Surgical Trials Network (CTSN) is to increase the effectiveness and efficiency of clinical research through shared infrastructure for important trials that will advance therapy for patients suffering from cardiac disease.",Network for Cardiothoracic Surgical Investigations in Cardiovascular Medicine,9914111,U01HL088942,"['Address', 'Administrative Coordination', 'Adoption', 'Agreement', 'Ancillary Study', 'Atrial Fibrillation', 'Canada', 'Cardiac Surgery procedures', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Data Monitoring Committees', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Communication', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Collection', 'Data Coordinating Center', 'Data Management Resources', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Enrollment', 'Ensure', 'Event', 'Fostering', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Government Agencies', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act', 'Heart Diseases', 'Heart failure', 'Industry', 'Information Technology', 'Infrastructure', 'Institutes', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'International', 'Investigation', 'Journals', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Link', 'Longterm Follow-up', 'Manuscripts', 'Mediation', 'Medicine', 'Monitor', 'Multicenter Studies', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neuroprotective Agents', 'Online Systems', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patients', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Practice Guidelines', 'Preparation', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Quality of life', 'Regenerative Medicine', 'Registries', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Review Committee', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Sample Size', 'Secure', 'Serious Adverse Event', 'Site', 'Source', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Visit', 'Work', 'adjudicate', 'adjudication', 'base', 'biobank', 'clinical center', 'clinical infrastructure', 'clinical practice', 'clinical research site', 'data integrity', 'data management', 'data quality', 'data sharing', 'design', 'dissemination research', 'electronic data', 'electronic data capture system', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'implementation research', 'implementation science', 'improved', 'industry partner', 'innovation', 'interest', 'international center', 'large datasets', 'meetings', 'mobile application', 'new technology', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'patient oriented', 'performance site', 'prospective', 'quality assurance', 'recruit', 'research clinical testing', 'research data dissemination', 'screening', 'tool', 'trial design', 'wearable sensor technology']",NHLBI,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,U01,2020,7231781,0.04362292674198091
"Cardiovascular Imaging in Ischemic Heart Disease Project Summary/Abstract The applicant Udo Hoffmann MD MPH is a Professor of Radiology at Harvard Medical School and the Chief of the Division for Cardiovascular Imaging in the Department of Radiology at MGH. Dr. Hoffmann has established a patient oriented research (POR) program that combines innovative translational, clinical, and outcomes research methods to demonstrate the value of advanced cardiovascular imaging. Dr. Hoffmann has published approximately 380 peer reviewed papers, among them many in premier medical journals and has received continued independent, peer-reviewed POR NIH funding since 2005. He is among the very few faculty members at Harvard Medical School who are both the PI and Director of a highly successful NHLBI funded T- 32 program (Cardiac MR and CT Research) and a recipient of a K24. Dr. Hoffmann has successfully mentored more than 60 clinical investigators, most of which currently hold faculty positions in major academic centers and actively perform POR. Moreover, Dr. Hoffmann has successfully accomplished all mentoring and scientific goals of the first K24 award period. Overall, these achievements document Dr. Hoffmann's long standing passion and commitment to POR. His excellent publication, funding, and mentoring record together with his current and planned research support provide an excellent foundation to accomplish the aims of this competitive renewal of the K24 Award “Cardiovascular Imaging in Ischemic Heart Disease”. Dr. Hoffmann proposes a mentoring and research plan that utilizes the synergies of past, ongoing, and future highly innovative independent research projects with educational and training opportunities offered by the cardiac MR CT PET Program, the T32 training program in cardiovascular imaging, the Harvard CTSA, and the Harvard School of Public Health. The specific aims addressing the charge of the K24 Award are to enable Dr. Hoffmann to: 1) dedicate 25% of his time to mentor clinical investigators based on NIH or equivalent funded projects in “Cardiovascular Imaging in Ischemic Heart Disease”, 2) to mentor junior and mid-career clinical investigators with the goal to develop them into clinical researchers who can successfully compete for peer reviewed grants, and 3) to continue to expand a POR program that combines translational, clinical, and outcomes research to develop future leaders in clinical research in cardiovascular imaging and beyond. The research plan encompasses four specific aims: 1) To determine the effects of statin treatment on coronary atherosclerosis in HIV patients in 800 patients with HIV randomized to statin therapy vs. placebo, 2) To determine whether high risk coronary plaque predicts cardiovascular events in 4600 patients with clinical suspicion of CAD, 3) To determine the cost effectiveness of CT FFR in patients with stable and acute chest pain, and 4) To use Radiomics to identify novel imaging markers predicting cardiovascular events in participants of the Framingham Heart Study. Narrative This research takes advantage of a rich body of independent funded research in “Cardiovascular Imaging in Ischemic Heart Disease”. It will permit Dr. Hoffmann to dedicate 25% of his time to mentor junior clinical investigators from the T32 program and the pool of residents, fellows, and junior faculty in Cardiology and Radiology with the goal to develop them into clinical researchers who can successfully compete for peer reviewed grants.
