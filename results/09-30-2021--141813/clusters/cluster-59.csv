"A hybrid artificial intelligence framework for glaucoma monitoring Glaucoma is a complex neurodegenerative disease that results in degeneration of retinal ganglion cells and their axons. With older people making up the fastest growing part of the US population, glaucoma will become even more prevalent in the US in the coming decades. Due to the complex interaction of multiple factors in glaucoma, better structural and functional predictors are needed for its progression. The main impediments are massive health record data and sophisticated computational models. Our overall goal is to leverage the power of big data and rapidly evolving machine learning approaches. The NEI's “Big Data to Knowledge (BD2K)” initiative and the American Academy of Ophthalmology Intelligent Research in Sight (IRIS) registry are all efforts to exploit the power of data and to better understand diseases and to provide improved prevention and treatment.  In this multi-PI proposal, we offer to assemble over 1 million optical coherence tomography (OCT) and visual fields (VFs) from the glaucoma research network (GRN). We propose to develop a hybrid artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm that synthesizes Gaussian mixture model expectation maximization (GEM) and archetypal machine learning approach to identify glaucoma progression and its monitoring using VFs and retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness measurements. We will make these tools openly available to the vision and ophthalmology research communities.  Our proposed studies could offer substantial improvements in the prognosis of glaucoma as well as potentially providing OCT and joint VF/OCT surrogate endpoints to be used in glaucoma clinical trials. Leveraging big data in eye care is challenging. This study uses big functional and structural glaucoma data and develops hybrid machine learning models to identify glaucoma progression and its monitoring. Results could offer substantial improvements in prognosis of glaucoma and may provide surrogate endpoints for use in glaucoma clinical trials.",A hybrid artificial intelligence framework for glaucoma monitoring,9723609,R21EY030142,"['Academy', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Axon', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Big Data', 'Big Data to Knowledge', 'Blindness', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Evolution', 'Eye', 'Gaussian model', 'Glaucoma', 'Goals', 'Hybrids', 'Institutes', 'Intelligence', 'Joints', 'Judgment', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Ophthalmology', 'Optic Nerve', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Public Health', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Retinal', 'Severity of illness', 'Source', 'Structural Models', 'Structure', 'Surrogate Endpoint', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Thinness', 'Time', 'Training', 'Vision', 'Visual Fields', 'analytical method', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'data space', 'design', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'early onset', 'evidence base', 'expectation', 'field study', 'health record', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'machine learning algorithm', 'multidimensional data', 'novel', 'open source', 'optical imaging', 'outcome forecast', 'programs', 'retinal ganglion cell degeneration', 'retinal nerve fiber layer', 'tool']",NEI,UNIVERSITY OF TENNESSEE HEALTH SCI CTR,R21,2019,278421,0.042899223393918606
"Learning an Optimized Variational Network for Medical Image Reconstruction Project Summary We propose a novel way of reconstructing medical images rooted in deep learning and computer vision that models the process how human radiologists are using years of experience from reading thousands of cases to recognize anatomical structures, pathologies and image artifacts. Our approach is based on the novel idea of a variational network, which embeds a generalized compressed sensing concept within a deep learning framework. We propose to learn a complete reconstruction procedure, including filter kernels and penalty functions to separate between true image content and artifacts, all parameters that normally have to be tuned manually as well as the associated numerical algorithm described by this variational network. The training step is decoupled from the time critical image reconstruction step, which can then be performed in near-real-time without interruption of clinical workflow. Our preliminary patient data from accelerated magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) acquisitions suggest that our learning approach outperforms the state-of-the-art of currently existing image reconstruction methods and is robust with respect to the variations that arise in a daily clinical imaging situation. In our first aim, we will test the hypothesis that learning can be performed such that it is robust against changes in data acquisition. In the second aim, we will answer the question if it is possible to learn a single reconstruction procedure for multiple MR imaging applications. Finally, we will perform a clinical reader study for 300 patients undergoing imaging for internal derangement of the knee. We will compare our proposed approach to a clinical standard reconstruction. Our hypothesis is that our approach will lead to the same clinical diagnosis and patient management decisions when using a 5min exam. The immediate benefit of the project is to bring accelerated imaging to an application with wide public-health impact, thereby improving clinical outcomes and reducing health-care costs. Additionally, the insights gained from the developments in this project will answer the currently most important open questions in the emerging field of machine learning for medical image reconstruction. Finally, given the recent increase of activities in this field, there is a significant demand for a publicly available data repository for raw k-space data that can be used for training and validation. Since all data that will be acquired in this project will be made available to the research community, this project will be a first step to meet this demand. Project Narrative The overarching goal of the proposal is to develop a novel machine learning-based image reconstruction approach and validate it for accelerated magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The approach is able to learn the characteristic appearance of clinical imaging datasets, as well as suppression of artifacts that arise during data acquisition. We will test the hypotheses that learning can be performed such that it is robust against changes in data acquisition, answer the question if it is possible to learn a single reconstruction procedure for multiple MR imaging applications, and validate our approach in a clinical reader study for 300 patients undergoing imaging for internal derangement of the knee.",Learning an Optimized Variational Network for Medical Image Reconstruction,9783816,R01EB024532,"['Acceleration', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Appearance', 'Area', 'Blinded', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Protocols', 'Communities', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Evaluation Studies', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Interruption', 'Joints', 'Knee', 'Learning', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manuals', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Motivation', 'Musculoskeletal', 'Neurologic', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Plant Roots', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Reader', 'Reading', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Step training', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Touch sensation', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'base', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinical imaging', 'clinical translation', 'conditioning', 'cost', 'data acquisition', 'data space', 'data warehouse', 'deep learning', 'experience', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'indexing', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'novel', 'pathology imaging', 'patient population', 'performance tests', 'prospective', 'radiologist', 'reconstruction', 'research clinical testing']",NIBIB,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R01,2019,438449,0.010428297451690046
"Generalizing Deep Learning Reconstruction for Free-Breathing and Quantitative MRI Project Summary/Abstract The goal of this project is to increase the precision and resolution of quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Quantitative information such as tissue relaxation parameters (e.g., T1 and T2) measure tissue function and indicate disease-related changes in the heart, liver, brain, and other organs. For instance, T1 changes can provide evidence of diffuse fibrosis in the myocardium that can signal heart disease. Quantitative maps also are reproducible, directly comparable longitudinally and across subjects, and less affected by the properties of the scanner used, when compared versus common weighted (non-quantitative) clinical imaging. But, quantitative imaging involves more complicated and time-consuming pulse sequences. To accomplish this goal, this project will develop new machine learning algorithms for high-quality parameter mapping from free-breathing data. The first aim of this project will increase parameter map resolution achievable from highly accelerated, noisy data. The proposed method will integrate existing deep cascade network-based image reconstructions with convolutional network-based blocks for super-resolution and parameter map estimation. Preliminary studies suggest these new blocks improve sharpness and mitigate artifacts in the reconstructed parameter maps. The next aim will improve the training precision of such artificial neural networks to account for the significant per-voxel nonlinear fit variability in quantitative MRI. The proposed method will reweight the loss function used for calibrating these networks by the goodness-of-fit (coefficient of determination) of the reference maps obtained from fully sampled training data. Preliminary results demonstrate that quality-aware reweighting significantly improves reconstructed image quality when working with noisy training data. Experiments will evaluate the precision of both of these innovations against existing deep-learning-based reconstructions on T1 maps obtained from pre- and post-contrast cardiac images of volunteer patients. The final aim will address motion during the acquisition by estimating and tracking nonrigid motion in the data consistency stages of the deep cascade artificial neural network architecture. Two methods are proposed: deformable motion estimation already demonstrated on compressive model-based image reconstructions, and a new “re-blurring” convolutional neural network that automatically introduces artifacts into a “clean” image to match the motion-corrupted data. Both of these methods enforce consistency between motion-affected data and a motion-free image during the reconstruction. Both methods will be validated on both cardiac and abdominal images for motion artifacts and reconstruction quality against breath-held parameter mapping acquisitions. Project Narrative Quantitative magnetic resonance imaging noninvasively measures physical properties of tissue connected to cardiovascular disease and many other conditions. Novel machine learning methods for processing data to produce higher quality maps will facilitate earlier and more accurate treatment of these diseases. This project will facilitate rapid quantitative imaging with freely breathing subjects.",Generalizing Deep Learning Reconstruction for Free-Breathing and Quantitative MRI,10007241,R56EB028254,"['Abdomen', 'Address', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Awareness', 'Balance training', 'Brain', 'Breathing', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Clinical', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffuse', 'Disease', 'Fibrosis', 'Financial compensation', 'Goals', 'Heart', 'Heart Diseases', 'Heart failure', 'Image', 'Infiltration', 'Literature', 'Liver', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Mainstreaming', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Myocardium', 'Network-based', 'Noise', 'Non-linear Models', 'Organ', 'Patients', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Relaxation', 'Reproducibility', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Weight', 'artificial neural network', 'base', 'clinical imaging', 'clinically relevant', 'computerized data processing', 'contrast imaging', 'convolutional neural network', 'coronary fibrosis', 'data space', 'deep learning', 'design', 'experimental study', 'heart imaging', 'image reconstruction', 'improved', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'loss of function', 'machine learning algorithm', 'motion sensitivity', 'multitask', 'neural network architecture', 'non-invasive imaging', 'novel', 'physical property', 'quantitative imaging', 'reconstruction', 'volunteer']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA,R56,2019,347527,0.0014998930535135477
"Developing Database and Software infrastructure for Quantitative Radiologic Analysis of Lumbar Radiculopathy Project Summary/Abstract Diagnosis of lumbar radiculopathy (LR) currently relies on a qualitative interpretation of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies and lacks standardization. This has led to inconsistent treatment and rising costs, while quality of life metrics have remained stagnant. To standardize the diagnosis of LR, the subjective and qualitative radiologic assessment needs to be augmented with accurate measurements of neuroforamina (NF) and central canal (CC) areas, two anatomical structures that are critical to the etiology of LR. However, precise measurements will require manual delineations of these regions on MRI. This is a tedious and time-consuming process that is not feasible on a daily, large-scale basis in the clinic. Deep Learning (DL) is a relatively new machine learning technique, which holds the promise of automating NF and CC segmentation. None the less, there remain several challenges to making DL-based segmentation routine in clinical practice. First, training and validating a DL model for segmentation of a given anatomical structure requires a large amount of expert annotated training data. Expert annotated data is expensive and time consuming to obtain, thus thwarting the development of quantitative imaging diagnostics for LR. To address this, we propose an expert-led manual delineation of NF and CC using de-identified MRI data extracted from UCLA's picture archiving and communications system (PACS). We expect the resulting database to contain data from over 35,000 lumbar MRI scans, with associated clinical history, demographics, and patient outcomes data. In a subset (1000) of these data, NFs and CCs will be annotated by multiple human expert raters. The consensus of these delineations will be used as ground truth segmentations to train, validate and improve our understanding of DL models. Secondly, as a part of this proposal, we aim to address several technical challenges that limit the deployment of automated image segmentation techniques to the clinic. Chief amongst these challenges is the failure of automated methodologies in the face of variation due to factors such as pathology, scanner protocol alterations, and general demographic variation. Additionally, our current understanding of DL does not allow us to categorically state the total number of expert annotated data that will be needed to train a model with a specified level of accuracy. Finally, we do not currently understand how selection of training cases for expert delineation affects generalization accuracy. To address the aforementioned challenges, we propose experiments to define the relationship between DL algorithms and the cardinality of training data. We will also explore the use of unsupervised machine learning strategies, namely clustering and reinforcement learning, to understand how training data selection influences algorithmic accuracy. In summary, we propose to address data availability and technical knowledge gaps to the development of accurate DL-based techniques for automated NF and CC delineation, with a broader view to standardize the diagnosis and treatment of LR. Project Narrative Basing radiological diagnoses on a quantitative characterization of neuroforamina (NF) and central canal (CC) areas would greatly improve the diagnosis and treatment of lumbar radiculopathy (LR). Manual measurement of this anatomy on every clinical study is not feasible; however, deep learning- (DL) based automated methods can reliable perform this task if 1) expert annotations to train DL algorithms are available and 2) we can train DL models to work accurately despite image heterogeneity. We address these knowledge gaps by developing 1) a database containing spine MR images with expert annotation of NFs and CCs and 2) intelligent training data selection frameworks to train DL algorithms and assess their robustness to heterogeneity.",Developing Database and Software infrastructure for Quantitative Radiologic Analysis of Lumbar Radiculopathy,9746373,R21EB026665,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Categories', 'Central cord canal structure', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Communities', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer software', 'Consensus', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Expenditure', 'Face', 'Failure', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Health system', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Infrastructure', 'Intelligence', 'Intraobserver Variability', 'Investigative Techniques', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Link', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Natural History', 'Needs Assessment', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Picture Archiving and Communication System', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Quality of life', 'Radiculopathy', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Selection for Treatments', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Specialist', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Spinal Diseases', 'Standardization', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Treatment Effectiveness', 'United States', 'Variant', 'Vertebral column', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical application', 'clinical database', 'clinical practice', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'deep neural network', 'demographics', 'experimental study', 'imaging Segmentation', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'network architecture', 'neural network architecture', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'quantitative imaging', 'relational database', 'theories', 'treatment adherence', 'treatment optimization', 'unsupervised learning']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R21,2019,234000,0.008518145833094282
"Motion-Resolved, Comprehensive Quantitative Tissue Characterization Using MR Multitasking PROJECT SUMMARY  Quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measures tissue parameters such as T1, T2, T2*, and diffusion to detect subtle differences in tissue states (such as microstructure, diffuse fibrosis, edema, hemorrhage, and iron content) from neurological, oncological, and cardiovascular diseases. Because each parameter offers complementary tissue information, multiparameter mapping is very promising for risk assessment, early detection, accurate staging, and treatment monitoring of disease. However, quantitative MRI is typically very time consuming and difficult to perform. Each parameter is typically measured from its own series of images, so measuring multiple parameters leads to long, inefficient scanning sessions. Furthermore, cardiac and breathing motion creates misalignment between images, causing additional problems.  The standard approach to motion is to either remove it (e.g., ask the patient to hold their breath) or to synchronize image acquisition with it (e.g., using electrocardiography (ECG) to monitor cardiac motion). This approach makes scan times even longer, limits imaging to patients who can repeatedly perform long breath holds (which is difficult for aging or weak patients) and who have predictable cardiac motion (which is not true of patients with cardiac arrhythmias). Furthermore, these methods are often unreliable and difficult to perform.  This project is to develop and validate a new technology, MR Multitasking, to perform multiple simultaneous measurements in a single, push-button scan that is both comfortable for patients and simple for technologists to perform. MR Multitasking redesigns quantitative MRI around the concept of images as functions of many time dimensions, each corresponding to a different dynamic process (e.g., motion, T1, T2, T2*, and diffusion), and then uses mathematical models called low-rank tensors to perform fast, multidimensional imaging. This allows continuous acquisition of imaging data even while the subject is moving, providing motion-resolved parameter maps without breath holding or motion synchronization. We will scan healthy subjects, liver patients, prostate cancer patients, and cardiovascular patients to develop and validate this technology and use artificial intelligence to quickly reconstruct images from the collected data. The resulting tool will be applicable to any organ system, offering clinicians and investigators a valuable tool to answer a wide range of biomedical questions. PROJECT NARRATIVE  This project is to develop and validate a one-stop, push-button solution for comprehensive, motion- resolved quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). This will be accomplished by cultivating a new technology, MR Multitasking, which can measure multiple tissue biomarkers in a single scan, even in moving organs. The resulting technology will be applicable to any organ system, offering clinicians and investigators a valuable tool to diagnose, monitor, and study a wide range of diseases.","Motion-Resolved, Comprehensive Quantitative Tissue Characterization Using MR Multitasking",9766063,R01EB028146,"['Address', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Arrhythmia', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Blood flow', 'Breathing', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diffuse', 'Diffusion', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Edema', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Fibrosis', 'Hemorrhage', 'Image', 'Iron', 'Joints', 'Lead', 'Lipids', 'Liver', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Magnetism', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Nature', 'Neurologic', 'Organ', 'Patients', 'Physiological', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predisposition', 'Process', 'Property', 'Recovery', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Respiration', 'Risk Assessment', 'Scanning', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Staging', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissue imaging', 'Tissues', 'Validation', 'body system', 'deep learning', 'heart motion', 'image reconstruction', 'magnetic field', 'magnetohydrodynamic', 'mathematical model', 'multitask', 'new technology', 'prospective', 'quantitative imaging', 'reconstruction', 'respiratory', 'time use', 'tissue biomarkers', 'tool']",NIBIB,CEDARS-SINAI MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2019,676760,-0.012315008065946018
"IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging Project Summary This proposal requests funds to provide travel support for graduates to attend and participate in the IEEE Inter- national Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI) 2019 conference, Venice, Italy on April 08-11, 2019. The main objective of the IEEE ISBI is to bring together researchers with interests in mathematical and computa- tional aspects of biomedical imaging, with a focus on addressing problems of significance to the development and application of imaging systems across spatial scales, from microscopy to whole-body imaging. ISBI partici- pants – on the order of 600-700 from across the world are involved in biomedical imaging research and development in academic institutions, government laboratories, or R&D departments of private companies. ISBI is co-sponsored by two IEEE societies: Signal Processing Society (SPS) and Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBS), representing academia, industry, and healthcare, and considered the world's foremost societies in biomedical engineering and imaging. SPS and EMBS publish IEEE Transactions on Medical Imag- ing, Transactions on Image Processing, Transactions on Biomedical Engineering, Transactions on Computational Imaging, and IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics, among others. Since incep- tion in 2002, ISBI has become the leading international conference bringing together researchers from diverse algorithmic fields, applications, modalities, and size scales, to facilitate cross-fertilization of ideas across imag- ing modalities and scales. Conference topics include physical, biological and statistical modeling, image formation and reconstruction, computational and statistical image analysis, visualization and image quality as- sessment, and artificial intelligence and machine learning for big image data. ISBI, like other IEEE SPS and EMBS conferences, requires submission and review of a 4-page paper. Peer reviews are handled by a 50-mem- ber editorial board (area editors) of leading experts in the community, who in turn assign papers to well- qualified reviewers. All oral and poster papers are published in IEEExplore as Proceedings of ISBI. If awarded, IEEE anticipates the primary impact of this R13 grant will be increased attendance of U.S.-based students, postdoctoral fellows, and early career faculty. By offering to cover a significant portion of attendee's travel expenses, the cost-benefit ratio for attending ISBI 2019 will be extremely favorable. Furthermore, IEEE will award travel grants based on need and scientific excellence, creating opportunities for those early career researchers who have accepted papers (of which less than 50% are accepted to ISBI) and who have limited means to travel. IEEE will be particularly supportive in providing travel awards to women, under-represented groups, and persons with disabilities. Benefits can largely be summarized as “exposure” and education. ISBI provides opportunity for student exposure to many more areas of computational imaging research than generally available in her/his home institution, and concurrently provides opportunity for students to interact with leaders in the field through tutorials, plenary, oral, and poster presentations, and individual discussions.

"Deep Learning for Characterizing Knee Joint Degeneration Predicting Progression of Osteoarthritis and Total Knee Replacement ABSTRACT This proposal aims to develop deep learning methods to automate the extraction of morphological imaging features relevant to knee osteoarthritis (OA), and total knee replacement. While, quantitative evaluation Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) plays a central role in OA research in the clinical setting MR reports often tend to be subjective, qualitative, and the grading schemes utilized in epidemiological research are not used because they are extraordinarily time consuming and do not lend themselves to the demands of todays changing healthcare scenario. The “Big Data” challenge and opportunity facing us makes it necessary to build enabling tools (i) to automate the extraction of morphological OA imaging features, with the aim of evaluating disease progression prediction capabilities on larger sample sizes that have never been explored before; (ii) to discover latent patterns by uncovering unexplored data-driven imaging features by the application of state of the art deep learning approaches (1); (iii) combine multi-modality imaging with clinical, functional, activity, and other data to define the trajectory of joint degeneration in OA. Leveraging the power of these state of the art techniques, and with the extraordinary availability of a large datasets of annotated images; in this project, we propose to develop an automatic post-processing pipeline able to segment musculoskeletal tissues and identify morphological OA features in Magnetic Resonance Images (MRI), as defined by commonly used MRI grading systems. Automation of morphological grading of the tissues in the joint would be a significant breakthrough in both OA research and clinical practice. It would enable the analysis of large sample sizes, assist the radiologist/clinician in the grading of images, take a relatively short amount of time, reduce cost, and could potentially, improve classification models. The availability of automatic pipelines for the identification of morphological abnormities in MRI would drastically change clinical practice, and include semi-quantitative grades, rather than subjective impressions in radiology clinical reports. In this study, we also aim to develop a complete supervised deep learning approach to obtain data-driven representations as non-linear and semantic aggregation among elementary features able to exploit the latent information hidden in the complexity of a 3D MR images, eliminating the need for nominal grades of selected features. This second aim, while being at high risk has also a potential exceptional high impact; as it departs from the classical hypothesis driven studies, and builds a novel translational platform to revolutionize morphological grading of MR images in research studies, but also is paradigm-shifting in that it may provide a more quantitative feature driven basis for routine radiological clinical reports. The clinical impact of this proposal lies in the third aim (R33 phase), in which we propose to translate the solutions developed in the R61 phase on images in the UCSF clinical archives (PACS), and plan to include also demographic and clinical data in the electronic health records, to build the models defining total knee replacements. PROJECT NARRATIVE Deep learning is revolutionizing medical imaging by solving challenging problems in disease classification, progression and therapeutic response. In this project, we focus on using deep learning methodology on magnetic resonance images of the knee to study osteoarthritis prevalence, and progression. The usage of features derived from the imaging data, rather than established, and often subjective grading schemes, will have significant impact on clinical radiology, establishing quantitative physician assist tools with an ultimate goal of reducing the economic and healthcare burden of total knee replacement.!",Deep Learning for Characterizing Knee Joint Degeneration Predicting Progression of Osteoarthritis and Total Knee Replacement,9669002,R61AR073552,"['3-Dimensional', 'Algorithms', 'Archives', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Automation', 'Big Data', 'Bone Marrow', 'Cartilage', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical/Radiologic', 'Computer Simulation', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Data Reporting', 'Data Set', 'Degenerative polyarthritis', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Economics', 'Edema', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Epidemiology', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Image', 'Incidence', 'Joints', 'Knee', 'Knee Osteoarthritis', 'Knee joint', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Ligaments', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Medical Imaging', 'Meniscus structure of joint', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Musculoskeletal', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Physical activity', 'Physicians', 'Picture Archiving and Communication System', 'Play', 'Prevalence', 'Quantitative Evaluations', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Role', 'Sample Size', 'Scheme', 'Semantics', 'Structure', 'Subchondral Cyst', 'Supervision', 'Synovitis', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Visual', 'bone', 'clinical practice', 'clinical translation', 'convolutional neural network', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'disease classification', 'drug discovery', 'epidemiology study', 'high risk', 'impression', 'improved', 'joint destruction', 'knee replacement arthroplasty', 'learning strategy', 'musculoskeletal imaging', 'novel', 'parallel processing', 'patient population', 'radiologist', 'research study', 'speech recognition', 'tool', 'treatment response']",NIAMS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R61,2019,447173,0.024940026305794716
"Quantitative, non-invasive characterization of urinary stone composition and fragility using multi-energy CT and machine learning techniques PROJECT SUMMARY Symptomatic urinary stone disease (USD) affects >8% of the United States population, resulting in an estimated annual medical cost exceeding $10 billion. Computed tomography (CT) is the established method for imaging urinary calculi and can provide accurate sub-millimeter details of the size and location of renal stones. However, in vivo characterization of more than just size and location is critical for quantifying stone characteristics important for optimal patient health management and essential for clinical research. A complete characterization of renal stones, including stone composition and fragility, is needed for safe and cost effective management of USD, as well as for phenotyping of research subjects. Our proposal meets these needs by developing methods to accurately and non-invasively characterize stones using low-dose, multi-energy CT. Our long-term goal is to use advanced CT methodologies to characterize urinary calculi for the purpose of directing clinical treatment and facilitating clinical investigation. Our objectives in this application are to develop and validate in vivo quantitative techniques for characterizing mixed and non-uric-acid stone types, as well as for predicting the likelihood of successful stone comminution, a novel concept we refer to as stone fragility. These image-based stone biometrics will enable evidence-based identification of treatment strategies that maximize effectiveness while minimizing risk, as well as accurate and non-invasive classification of research subjects to accelerate scientific advances in the understanding and treatment of USD. We will meet these objectives by accomplishing the following specific aims:  Specific Aim 1: Develop and validate CT techniques to characterize mixed and non-uric-acid  stone types.  Specific Aim 2: Develop and validate CT techniques to predict stone fragility. Current state-of-the-art stone imaging technology cannot accurately identify the composition of mixed and non- uric-acid stone types, nor can it provide quantitative indications of the likelihood of efficient comminution using the lowest risk technique. The innovation of this proposal lies in the use of newly developed statistical, deep learning and texture analysis techniques to quantitatively describe essential characteristics of urinary calculi, namely composition and fragility. The significance of this proposal is that the knowledge derived from using such techniques represents unique quantitative biomarkers that will allow physicians and researchers to more effectively manage and study USD.

"Novel Glaucoma Diagnostics for Structure and Function  - Renewal - 1 Project Summary Glaucoma is a leading cause of vision morbidity and blindness worldwide. Early disease detection and sensitive monitoring of progression are crucial to allow timely treatment for preservation of vision. The introduction of ocular imaging technologies significantly improves these capabilities, but in clinical practice there are still substantial challenges at certain stages of the disease severity spectrum, specifically in the early stage and in advanced disease. These difficulties are due to a variety of causes that change over the course of the disease, including large between-subject variability, inherent measurement variability, image quality, varying dynamic ranges of measurements, minimal measurable level of tissues, etc. In this proposal, we build on our long-standing contribution to ocular imaging and propose novel and sensitive means to detect glaucoma and its progression that are optimized to the various stages of disease severity. We will use information gathered from visual fields (functional information) and a leading ocular imaging technology – optical coherence tomography (OCT; structural information) to map the capability of detecting changes across the entire disease severity spectrum to identify optimal parameters for each stage of the disease. Both commonly used parameters provided by the technologies and newly developed parameters with good diagnostic potential will be analyzed. We will use state-of-the-art automated computerized machine learning methods, namely the deep learning approach, to identify structural features embedded within OCT images that are associated with glaucoma and its progression without any a priori assumptions. This will provide novel insight into structural information, and has shown very encouraging preliminary results. We will also utilize a new imaging technology, the visible light OCT, to generate retinal images with outstanding resolution to extract information about the oxygen saturation of the tissue. This will provide in-vivo, real time, and noninvasive insight into tissue functionality. Taken together, this program will advance the use of structural and functional information with a substantial impact on the clinical management of subjects with glaucoma Project Narrative This research proposal is focusing on the development and refinement of innovative analytical methods and cutting-edge technologies that will substantially improve detection of glaucoma and its progression monitoring in order to prevent blindness.",Novel Glaucoma Diagnostics for Structure and Function  - Renewal - 1,9819321,R01EY013178,"['3-Dimensional', 'Blindness', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Research', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Evaluation', 'Eye', 'Floor', 'Future', 'Glaucoma', 'Health', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging technology', 'Inner Plexiform Layer', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurable', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Optic Disk', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Outcome', 'Oxygen Consumption', 'Oxygen saturation measurement', 'Pathology', 'Research Proposals', 'Resolution', 'Retinal', 'Retinal Diseases', 'Scanning', 'Severities', 'Severity of illness', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Tissue Extracts', 'Tissues', 'Translating', 'Visible Radiation', 'Vision', 'Visual Fields', 'Width', 'advanced disease', 'analytical method', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'computerized', 'deep learning', 'density', 'ganglion cell', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'innovative technologies', 'insight', 'instrument', 'invention', 'knowledge base', 'learning strategy', 'longitudinal dataset', 'macula', 'mathematical methods', 'new technology', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'ocular imaging', 'preservation', 'prevent', 'programs', 'research study', 'retinal imaging', 'retinal nerve fiber layer', 'tissue oxygenation', 'tool']",NEI,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R01,2019,715489,0.05074468078725102
"Functional and Structural Optical Coherence Tomography for Glaucoma PROJECT SUMMARY Glaucoma is a leading cause of blindness. Early diagnosis and close monitoring of glaucoma are important because the onset is insidious and the damage is irreversible. Advanced imaging modalities such as optical coherence tomography (OCT) have been used in the past 2 decades to improve the objective evaluation of glaucoma. OCT has higher axial spatial resolution than other posterior eye imaging modalities and can precisely measure neural structures. However, structural imaging alone has limited sensitivity for detecting early glaucoma and only moderate correlation with visual field (VF) loss. Using high-speed OCT systems, we have developed novel OCT angiography technologies to image vascular plexuses that supply the retinal nerve fibers and ganglion cells damaged by glaucoma. Our results showed that OCT angiographic parameters have better correlation with VF parameters. We have also found that measurement of focal and sectoral glaucoma damage using high-definition volumetric OCT angiographic and structural parameters improves diagnostic performance. The goal of the proposed project is to further improve the diagnosis and monitoring of glaucoma using ultrahigh-speed OCT and artificial intelligence machine learning techniques. The specific aims are: 1. Develop quantitative wide-field OCT angiography. We will develop a swept-source OCT prototype that  is 4 times faster than current commercial OCT systems. The higher speed will be used to fully sample the  neural structures and associated capillary plexuses damaged by glaucoma. 2. Simulate VF by combining structural and angiographic OCT. Preliminary results showed that both  structural and angiographic OCT parameters have high correlation with VF on a sector basis. It may be  possible to accurately simulate VF results by combining these parameters using an artificial neural  network. The simulated VF may be more precise and reliable than subjective VF testing. 3. Longitudinal clinical study in glaucoma diagnosis and monitoring. Our novel OCT structural and  angiographic parameters have high accuracy in diagnosing glaucoma. Neural network analysis of structural  and angiographic data from a larger clinical study could further improve diagnostic accuracy. Longitudinal  follow-up will assess if simulated VF could monitor disease progression as well as actual VF. 4. Clinical study to assess the effects of glaucoma treatments. Preliminary results suggest that OCT  angiography could detect the improvement in capillary density after glaucoma surgery and the effects of  drugs. These intriguing effects will be tested in before-and-after comparison studies. If successful, we will have an OCT diagnostic system that in minutes provides objective information on the location and severity of glaucoma damage. This approach could replace time-consuming and unreliable VF testing. Measuring the improvement in retinal circulation could be a quicker way to detect the benefit of glaucoma therapies that work through neuroprotection or regeneration, compared to monitoring VF. PROJECT NARRATIVE Optical coherence tomography is a high-resolution imaging technology that can non-invasively measure both the eye structures and small blood vessels that are damaged by glaucoma, a leading cause of blindness. The proposed research will further improve this technology so that it can provide detailed measurement over wider areas inside the eye, detect earlier stages of glaucoma, evaluate the location and severity of glaucoma damage, monitor disease progression, and provide more timely assessment of the effectiveness of therapy. A goal of this project is to determine if this objective imaging technology can provide information that is equivalent to or better than subjective visual field testing, which though time-consuming and poorly reliable, is the current gold standard for long-term monitoring and management of glaucoma.",Functional and Structural Optical Coherence Tomography for Glaucoma,9697824,R01EY023285,"['Abbreviations', 'Affect', 'Angiography', 'Applications Grants', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Blindness', 'Blood Circulation', 'Blood Vessels', 'Blood capillaries', 'Blood flow', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Effectiveness', 'Evaluation', 'Eye', 'Eyedrops', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Geography', 'Glaucoma', 'Glossary', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Grant', 'Image', 'Imaging technology', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Lasers', 'Location', 'Longitudinal observational study', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Natural regeneration', 'Nerve Fibers', 'Noise', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Optic Disk', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Outcome', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Perfusion', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiologic Intraocular Pressure', 'Postoperative Period', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Retina', 'Retinal', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Severities', 'Shunt Device', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Speed', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Trabeculectomy', 'Variant', 'Vision', 'Visit', 'Visual Fields', 'Work', 'analytical tool', 'artificial neural network', 'base', 'bulk motion', 'cell injury', 'clinical practice', 'cost', 'density', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'fiber cell', 'field study', 'follow-up', 'ganglion cell', 'glaucoma surgery', 'high resolution imaging', 'high risk', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'macula', 'neural network', 'neuroprotection', 'new technology', 'novel', 'prototype', 'quantitative imaging', 'relating to nervous system', 'screening', 'tool', 'treatment effect', 'vascular factor', 'visual performance']",NEI,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,564228,0.07747365751868607
"Neuroimaging Analysis Center (NAC) Project Summary/Abstract The ability to access huge cohorts of patient medical records and radiology data, the emergence of ever-more detailed imaging modalities, and the availability of unprecedented computer processing power marks the pos- sibility for a new era in neuroimaging, disease understanding, and patient treatment. To unlock the full medical potential made possible by these new technologies, new algorithms and clinically-relevant techniques must be developed by close collaboration between computer scientists, physicians, and medical researchers. We are excited to propose a national resource center with the goal of finding new ways of extracting disease characteristics from advanced imaging and computation, and to make these methods available to the larger medical community through a proven methodology of world-class research, open-source software, and exten- sive collaboration. The overarching theme for this P41 renewal is the discovery and analysis of novel imaging phenotypes to characterize disease. We use the term imaging phenotypes to describe patterns or features of disease that can be detected through imaging (predominantly MRI) followed by machine learning, statistical analysis, feature detection, and correlation with other indicators of disease such as structured patient infor- mation. The three proposed Technology Research & Development (TR&D) projects address this common question us- ing a variety of complementary approaches and clinical testbeds. TR&D 1 addresses microstructure of tissue, including novel imaging methods to detect tumor microstructure. TR&D 2 investigates rich spatial patterns of disease extracted from clinical imaging with a focus on cerebrovascular and neurodegenerative conditions such as stroke. Finally, TR&D 3 proposes novel image and connectivity-based features that can be correlated with a variety of diseases, with a clinical emphasis on pediatric brain development. Technical innovation will be driven by intense collaboration between the TR&Ds and key collaborators in neurosurgery, neurology, and pe- diatrics. The TR&Ds will leverage recent important developments in the fields of image acquisition, machine learning, and data science to identify and exploit novel imaging phenotypes of disease. Building on our long history of developing clinically-relevant methods, each TR&D includes a translational and clinical validation aim to ensure our work is clinically relevant and effective at meeting the driving clinical goals. NAC's proven software engi- neering, translation, and dissemination infrastructure, along with its established network of academic, medical, and industrial partners, enhance the center's value as a national resource.

"Deep Learning-based Imaging Biomarkers for Knee Osteoarthritis ABSTRACT In the U.S., more than 600,000 knee osteoarthritis (OA)-related total knee joint replacement (TKR) cases are reported every year, exceeding $17 billion estimated direct costs annually. There is a growing need for disease- modifying therapies that prevent or delay the need for TKR. However, development of such therapies remains challenging due to the lack of objective and measurable OA biomarkers for disease progression. The course of the OA is highly variable between individuals and the OA progresses too slowly, making it difficult to identify sensitive OA biomarkers capable of capturing minor changes on the knee joint. This has slowed development of effective therapies and prevents physicians from providing the most effective advice about minimizing the need for TKR. In this project, our goal is to develop imaging biomarkers to monitor minor OA-related changes in knee joint health that lead to TKR. To achieve this goal, we will combine novel deep learning algorithms with clinical and imaging data from the Osteoarthritis Initiative (OAI). The OAI dataset includes clinical data, biospecimens, radiographs, and magnetic resonance (MR) images collected over 8 years. The proposed project has three Specific Aims: (i) to develop an automated OA-relevant biomarker identification tool from the bilateral posteroanterior fixed-flexion knee radiographs using deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) combined with the OA progression outcome of subjects (n = 882); (ii) to develop an automated OA-relevant biomarker identification tool from structural and compositional MR images using 3D CNNs with RNNs combined with the OA progression outcome of subjects (n = 882); and (iii) to determine whether deep learning–based imaging biomarkers can act as surrogates to predict the OA progression using a subject cohort (n = 296) independent of the cohort used to identify imaging biomarkers. The proposed project will couple deep learning with diagnostic radiology to unveil key combinations of OA-relevant features directly from images with minimal user interaction. This will facilitate fast individualized assessment of OA progression using whole knee joint images directly. If successful, this study will bring new insights into the development of imaging biomarkers for OA progression and more broadly into our understanding and treatment of OA. The knowledge gained in this project will help to advance close monitoring of OA progression by opening new perspectives on the regions and parameters for potential inclusion in both intervention studies and clinical practice. NARRATIVE Osteoarthritis (OA) is a chronic degenerative disorder of joints and is the most common reason leading to total knee joint replacement. Our proposed study aims to develop a novel automated OA-relevant imaging biomarker identification system based on radiographs, magnetic resonance images, and deep learning methods to study knee OA progression. We will address whether combining deep learning algorithms with medical images will determine the key combinations of features relevant to knee OA that are required to accurately predict the OA progression outcome.",Deep Learning-based Imaging Biomarkers for Knee Osteoarthritis,9818000,R01AR074453,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Bilateral', 'Biological Markers', 'Case Study', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cohort Studies', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Degenerative Disorder', 'Degenerative polyarthritis', 'Development', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Direct Costs', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Joints', 'Knee', 'Knee Osteoarthritis', 'Knee joint', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Length', 'Location', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurable', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methods', 'Minor', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Musculoskeletal System', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Play', 'Probability', 'Replacement Arthroplasty', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Severities', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Training', 'Visit', 'arthropathies', 'automated analysis', 'base', 'biomarker identification', 'bone', 'clinical practice', 'clinical risk', 'cohort', 'convolutional neural network', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'effective therapy', 'high risk', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'information model', 'innovation', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'outcome prediction', 'patient stratification', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'recurrent neural network', 'tool']",NIAMS,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R01,2019,489349,0.013047824872355987
"Molecular mapping of microbial communities at the host-pathogen interface by multi-modal 3-dimensional imaging mass spectrometry PROJECT SUMMARY  Cellular interactions with the environment form the basis of health and disease for all organisms. Exposure to nutrients, toxins, and neighboring cells trigger coordinated molecular responses that impact cell function and metabolism in a beneficial, adaptive, or detrimental manner. Although the benefits of multicellularity for the formation of complex tissue structures or the function of entire organ systems has been long appreciated, it has only recently been understood that microbial inhabitants of vertebrates also have a tremendous impact on host cell function and dysfunction. Despite this, an understanding of these interactions has not moved beyond simple associations, and there are virtually no molecular technologies available that adequately define how a complex microbial ecosystem impacts host cell function, or how the host response to microbial colonization affects the bacterial community. This gap in knowledge is striking when one considers the broad and significant impact that microbes have on human health. In this application, we propose to expressly fill this knowledge gap through development of a novel multimodal imaging pipeline that will provide 3-dimensional information on the molecular heterogeneity of microbial communities and the immune response at the host-pathogen interface.  This proposal combines our expertise in immunology, infection biology, mass spectrometry, small animal imaging, machine learning, and computer vision to develop an integrated multimodal visualization method for studying infectious disease. Our unique approach will computationally combine ultra-high speed (~50px/s) MALDI-TOF images, ultra-high mass resolution (>200,000 resolving power) MALDI FTICR IMS, metal imaging by LA-ICP-IMS, high-spatial resolution optical microscopy, and MR imaging using data-driven image fusion. This strategy will enable 3-D molecular images to be generated for thousands of elements, metabolites, lipids, and proteins with an unprecedented combination of chemical specificity and spatial fidelity more than 50x faster than is currently possible. We will use this next-generation imaging capability to (i) define the heterogeneous microbial subpopulations throughout the 3-D volume of a S. aureus community, (ii) uncover the host molecules that form the abscess and accumulate to restrict microbial growth in murine models, and (iii) elucidate molecular markers that differentiate in vivo biofilms at the host-pathogen interface, between abscesses at various stages of progression, and under distinct degrees of nutrient stress. These studies will uncover new targets for therapeutic intervention and the techniques developed as a result of this proposal will be broadly applicable to all physiologically relevant processes, profoundly impacting biomedical research. PROJECT NARRATIVE This proposal will enable detailed views of the molecular components of infectious disease with unprecedented resolution through the development of a multimodal, 3-dimensional imaging platform. The proposed technologies will improve throughput and molecular specificity, enable automated high-precision and high-accuracy image alignment, and allow for descriptions of molecular signals in 3-D through the fusion of multi-modal imaging data. These studies will uncover targets for therapeutic intervention and antibiotic development and the techniques developed as a result of this proposal will be broadly applicable to all physiologically relevant processes, profoundly impacting biomedical research.",Molecular mapping of microbial communities at the host-pathogen interface by multi-modal 3-dimensional imaging mass spectrometry,9788239,R01AI138581,"['3-Dimensional', 'Abscess', 'Affect', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Anterior nares', 'Antibiotics', 'Antibodies', 'Architecture', 'Awareness', 'Bacteria', 'Bacterial Infections', 'Bacterial Proteins', 'Behavior', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Research', 'Cell Differentiation process', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Cellular Metabolic Process', 'Chemicals', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Differentiation Antigens', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Ecosystem', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Exposure to', 'Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance', 'Functional disorder', 'Genus staphylococcus', 'Glean', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Health Promotion', 'Heterogeneity', 'Histology', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Imaging technology', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immunology', 'Imprisonment', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Infectious Diseases Research', 'Integration Host Factors', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Lesion', 'Lipids', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Metals', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Microbe', 'Microbial Biofilms', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Nutrient', 'Optics', 'Organism', 'Pathogenesis', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Reagent', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Source', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Specificity', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization', 'Speed', 'Staphylococcus aureus', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Three-dimensional analysis', 'Tissues', 'Toxin', 'Vertebrates', 'Work', 'animal imaging', 'bacterial community', 'base', 'body system', 'commensal bacteria', 'experimental study', 'host colonization', 'imaging capabilities', 'imaging detection', 'imaging modality', 'imaging platform', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'interest', 'microbial', 'microbial colonization', 'microbial community', 'microscopic imaging', 'molecular imaging', 'molecular marker', 'mouse model', 'multimodality', 'neutrophil', 'new therapeutic target', 'next generation', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'protein expression', 'response', 'supervised learning', 'targeted treatment', 'virtual']",NIAID,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2019,562232,-0.013867721461531094
"Development of Multi-Compartment MR-Fingerprinting for Subvoxel Estimation of Quantitative Tissue Biomarkers Project Summary Magnetic resonance fingerprinting (MRF) has been proposed as a technique to quantify tissue parameters, such as T1 and T2 relaxation times, which are biomarkers for various pathologies. One assumption of MRF is that the signal in each voxel is generated by exactly one set of tissue parameters. Due to MRI resolution at the range of millimeter in combination with the cellular structure of biological tissue, each voxel consists of multiple tissue compartments. An over-simplified single compartment model results in apparent relaxation times that are influenced by the relaxation times and the fractional proton densities of all contributing compartments. This can lead to a misinterpretation of signal changes. For example, in diseases that causes demyelination in white matter (Multiple Sclerosis, Dementia), a reduction of the myelin water fraction would result in a misleading change of the apparent relaxation time of the voxel. We propose a multi-compartment MRF method that allows to identify multiple tissue contributions within a voxel, including the fractional proton density (PD) of different compartments. Our machine learning based approach automatically identifies the number of compartments within each voxel that can be identified with the available SNR in that voxel. We will correct for partial-volume effects at the borders of two types of tissues, as well as analyze tissue microstructure. For the second case our learned model will also include chemical exchange between compartments. After an initial validation phase using numerical simulations, we will first perform MRF scans of dedicated 3D printed phantoms with multiple compartments. Our quality criterion is successful estimation of all simulated tissue compartments for all voxels with a relative error of less than 5% to the ground truth. We will then perform in-vivo MRF measurements of healthy volunteers (n=5). We will generate synthetic FLAIR and MP-RAGE contrasts from parameter maps estimated with conventional and the proposed multi-compartment MRF technique. We will compare them with currently used clinical contrasts acquired using established pulse sequences and validate the performance of our approach by measuring the cortical thickness. Further, we will validate the performance for microstructure composition in white matter. Our hypothesis is that it will be possible separate the compartments for myelin, intra- and extra-cellular water and compare the results to ex-vivo data found in literature. In summary, the methods developed in this R21 proposal will provide a novel technique to accurately and reproducibly identify biomarkers beyond the resolution of a voxel. It will allow to identify changes in tissue composition and fractional proton density at the microstructure level. Project Narrative The overarching goal of this proposal is to establish a MR imaging technique for quantifying biomarkers at the sub-voxel level. We will develop a machine learning based MR fingerprinting image reconstruction that enables the identification and characterization of multiple compartments within a voxel in terms of fractional proton density and relaxation times. We will generate accurate synthetic fluid suppressed images such as the FLAIR and MP- RAGE with accurate partial volume behavior and analyze the myelin water fraction and the corresponding relaxation times in white matter.",Development of Multi-Compartment MR-Fingerprinting for Subvoxel Estimation of Quantitative Tissue Biomarkers,9825278,R21EB027241,"['3D Print', 'Address', 'Behavior', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Cellular Structures', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Chemicals', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Computer-Assisted Diagnosis', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dementia', 'Demyelinations', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dictionary', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Fingerprint', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Liquid substance', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Multicenter Studies', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Myelin', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Noise', 'Pathology', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physics', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Procedures', 'Protons', 'Relaxation', 'Reproducibility', 'Resolution', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Standardization', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Water', 'base', 'clinical translation', 'conditioning', 'deep neural network', 'density', 'gray matter', 'healthy volunteer', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging system', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'magnetic resonance imaging biomarker', 'millimeter', 'neuroimaging', 'noninvasive diagnosis', 'novel', 'physical process', 'reconstruction', 'simulation', 'soft tissue', 'tissue biomarkers', 'white matter']",NIBIB,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R21,2019,209851,0.01670131035091195
"Ultraportable Stroke CT Based on Stationary Carbon Nanotube X-ray Source and Deep Learning Image Formation PROJECT SUMMARY The goal of this 12-month SBIR phase 1 project is developing an imaging device that will enable highly efficient and cost-effective stroke imaging for patients suffered trauma events. The expected technical outcome will be a proof-of-concept head CT imaging system with sub- second imaging speed, sub-mSv radiation dose, and high-quality images. Imaging systems with such capabilities will address the current deficiency in timely diagnosis of stroke patients, and benefit society with higher efficiency and lower cost. Such imaging device will make a strong economic impact on the global head CT imaging market, which is estimated to be about $36 billion in the U.S. In a longer term, the novel imaging technology could be translated into markets for security screening, industry inspection, and dental imaging. This project is based on the recent research results by Dr. Cao's team under the support of an NSF CAREER award (PI Dr. Cao, 08/01/2014-07/31/2019, $400,000) and a Dr. Cao's Commonwealth Research Commercialization Fund (CRCF) award (Title: “Computed Tomography Without Moving Parts for Fast and Portable Biomedical Imaging”, 07/01/2017- 06/30/2019, $100,000). The project has a strong footing in intellectual property. The technology is protected by a few patent applications at the Virginia Tech, including US. 62/316649, “Ultrafast Micro-CT for Imaging Free-Moving Animals” (Inventor: Guohua Cao), and PCT/US2013/061049 and US14/429835, “System and Method of Stationary Source Computed Tomography” (Inventor: Guohua Cao, et. al.). In this project, the team will design and build a proof-of-concept head CT platform to test the feasibility of ultraportable and compact head CT based on the stationary carbon nanotube x-ray source design and deep learning image reconstruction algorithm. The expected outcomes from this project include demonstration of the feasibility for ultrafast, low dose, and diagnostic imaging capabilities for intracerebral hemorrhage in head phantoms (ICH), with potential automatic ICH identification through deep learning algorithm. A ready-to- prototype head CT device will be optimized and designed, and a corresponding business plan will be developed. PROJECT NARRATIVE Stroke is a common of death in the world at tremendous social and healthcare costs.

"Relationship between Glaucoma and the Three-Dimensional Optic Nerve Head Related Structure Project Summary Glaucoma is the second leading cause of blindness globally, and is characterized by optic nerve damage that leads to the death of retinal ganglion cells with accompanying visual field (VF) loss. The optic nerve head (ONH) is the site of injury to the optic nerve fibers and plays a central role in glaucoma pathogenesis and diagnosis. Traditionally, glaucoma is diagnosed based on fundus inspection of the ONH, which provides information about the surface contour of the ONH. However, the optic nerve damage occurs in the deeper layers. With the development of optical coherence tomography (OCT) techniques for three-dimensional (3D) retinal imaging, parameters derived from the 3D ONH related structure (e.g., Bruch's membrane opening minimum rim width, peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer thickness, disc tilt etc.) have been studied to better understand glaucoma pathogenesis, and are used to supplement clinical diagnosis. In addition, studies of the ONH biomechanics have also shown that the strain level at the ONH at any given intraocular pressure level depends on the 3D geometry of the ONH related structure. A high strain level is hypothesized to contribute to retinal ganglion cell injury. Previous research has suggested that the 3D ONH related structure is correlated to glaucoma pathogenesis and critically important to glaucoma diagnosis. However, to date, a systematic study using clinical data to determine the impact of the 3D ONH related structure on glaucoma has not been conducted.  We propose to study the relationship between the 3D ONH related structure and glaucoma with a diverse set of combined techniques including image processing, computational mechanics and machine learning. The specific aims of this project are to: (1) Derive features from the 3D ONH related structure and study their implications on VF loss patterns (K99 Phase). (2) Investigate the impact of the strain field patterns at the ONH on glaucoma (K99 Phase). (3) Study the effect of the 3D ONH related features on OCT diagnostic parameters (R00 Phase). (4) Model central vision loss from the 3D ONH related structural features (R00 Phase). Collectively, these studies will provide new insights and perspectives into the structure-function relationships in glaucoma and establish ocular anatomy specific norms of retinal nerve fiber layer profiles, which will advance our current understanding of glaucoma pathogenesis and improve glaucoma diagnosis. Our research is of high clinical relevance and can be potentially translated into clinical practice for better glaucoma diagnosis, monitoring and treatment.  Through the proposed research and training plans, the applicant will build a solid knowledge base in ophthalmology and further improve his expertise in mathematical modeling and data science. This project will provide critical training opportunities to further enhance the applicant's capabilities to become an independent computational vision scientist in ophthalmology. Project Narrative The proposed research will study the relationship between the three-dimensional (3D) optic nerve head (ONH) related structure and glaucoma.

"THE XNAT IMAGING INFORMATICS PLATFORM PROJECT SUMMARY This proposal aims to continue the development of XNAT. XNAT is an imaging informatics platform designed to facilitate common management and productivity tasks for imaging and associated data. We will develop the next generation of XNAT technology to support the ongoing evolution of imaging research. Development will focus on modernizing and expanding the current system. In Aim 1, we will implement new web application infrastructure that includes a new archive file management system, a new event bus to manage cross-service orchestration and a new Javascript library to simplify user interface development. We will also implement new core services, including a Docker Container service, a dynamic scripting engine, and a global XNAT federation. In Aim 2, we will implement two innovative new capabilities that build on the services developed in Aim 1. The XNAT Publisher framework will streamline the process of data sharing by automating the creation and curation of data releases following best practices for data publication and stewardship. The XNAT Machine Learning framework will streamline the development and use of machine learning applications by integrating XNAT with the TensorFlow machine learning environment and implementing provenance and other monitoring features to help avoid the pitfalls that often plague machine learning efforts. For both Aim 1 and 2, all capabilities will be developed and evaluated in the context of real world scientific programs that are actively using the XNAT platform. In Aim 3, we will provide extensive support to the XNAT community, including training workshops, online documentation, discussion forums, and . These activities will be targeted at both XNAT users and developers. RELEVANCE Medical imaging is one of the key methods used by biomedical researchers to study human biology in health and disease.

"Center for Advanced Imaging Innovation and Research (CAI2R) Overall Project Summary  The Center for Advanced Imaging Innovation and Research (CAI2R) pursues a mission of bringing people together to create new ways of seeing. The work of our Center has been focused on creating new paradigms for the acquisition, reconstruction, and interpretation of biomedical images, and on implementing new collaboration models in order to translate these developments rapidly into clinical practice.  The world of biomedical imaging is changing, and CAI2R has been at the forefront of that change. Tasks that were once the sole domain of meticulously-engineered imaging hardware are now beginning to be accomplished in software, increasingly informed by diverse arrays of inexpensive auxiliary sensors. Information once pursued through the laborious acquisition of carefully separated image datasets is now being derived from newly integrated, and richly quantitative, data streams. In keeping with these themes, our Center will be organized around the following four Technology Research and Development (TR&D) projects going forward: 1. Reimagining the Future of Scanning: Intelligent image acquisition, reconstruction, and analysis. 2. Unshackling the Scanners of the Future: Flexible, self-correcting, multisensor machines. 3. Enriching the Data Stream: MRI and PET in concert. 4. Revealing Microstructure: Biophysical modeling and validation for discovery and clinical care.  In each of these projects, we aim to push medical imaging technology to the next level, both in hardware and in software. Having made great strides in developing rapid, continuous imaging data streams, we will next aim to add key new information to those streams, both from physics-driven microstructural modeling and from data- driven machine learning. Having focused on the development of robust tools for image acquisition and reconstruction, we will extend the pipeline to image interpretation, using the results of human- or machine- derived evaluations of image content as feedback for the further improvement of acquisition strategies and sensor designs. We will also aim to close the loop between diagnostic sensing and therapeutic intervention, exploring new ways to guide therapy with continuously-acquired information about tissue bioeffects.  Our Center has an explicit translational focus, which is reflected in the day-to-day operation of TR&D projects as well as in the topics of Collaborative Projects (CPs) and Service Projects (SPs), which are focused on three general areas of high public health impact: cancer, musculoskeletal disease, and neurologic disease.  In keeping with this translational emphasis, CAI2R is also be driven by an embedded collaboration model in which basic scientists, clinicians, and industry developers sit down together regularly at the scanners for interactive technology development and assessment. With early involvement of clinical stakeholders and industry partners, we aim to make CAI2R technologies widely available, for the advancement of biomedical knowledge and for the benefit of patients and the physicians who care for them. Overall Project Narrative  The Center for Advanced Imaging Innovation and Research (CAI2R) develops novel imaging techniques and technologies for the improved diagnosis and management of cancer, musculoskeletal disease, neurological disease and other disorders with a profound impact on human health. By exploiting connections between imaging modalities such as MRI and PET, we aim to advance the fundamental capabilities of each, so as to expand biomedical knowledge and improve the care of patients.",Center for Advanced Imaging Innovation and Research (CAI2R),9804438,P41EB017183,"['Adopted', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biology', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Color', 'Computer software', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Engineering', 'Feedback', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imagination', 'Imaging Device', 'Imaging technology', 'Industrial Product', 'Industry', 'Institution', 'Intelligence', 'Knowledge', 'Legal patent', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Musculoskeletal Diseases', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Philosophy', 'Physicians', 'Physics', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Process', 'Productivity', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Scanning', 'Scientist', 'Services', 'Software Tools', 'Stream', 'Technology', 'Technology Assessment', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Ursidae Family', 'Validation', 'Visit', 'Work', 'bioimaging', 'biophysical model', 'cancer imaging', 'clinical care', 'clinical practice', 'data acquisition', 'design', 'flexibility', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging approach', 'imaging modality', 'imaging scientist', 'improved', 'industry partner', 'innovation', 'interest', 'medical schools', 'multidisciplinary', 'musculoskeletal imaging', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'novel imaging technique', 'off-patent', 'open source', 'operation', 'radio frequency', 'reconstruction', 'sensor', 'technology development', 'technology research and development', 'tool', 'web site']",NIBIB,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,P41,2019,1715698,-0.016071698630333062
"Deep Learning for Pulmonary Embolism Imaging Decision Support: A Multi-institutional Collaboration Project Summary Diagnostic imaging costs $100 billion annually. These healthcare costs are expected to increase in the coming decade as the national population ages and the pool of insured patients increases. The size and growth of these costs concern policy makers, payers, and society alike. The use of advanced imaging for PE has increased 27 fold in recent years, and this sharp escalation has the potential to expose patients to unnecessary procedures, tests, and risks due to incidental findings. Although radiologists do not order most radiology exams, these physicians are the target of criticism about the rising costs and possible overuse of radiology services. The healthcare industry has called upon radiologists to manage the potential overuse of advanced imaging and to take the lead on investigating best practices for the optimal use of advanced imaging. The ideal sources of information for imaging utilization guidelines are randomized, controlled imaging clinical trials. However, these trials are cost and time intensive, exceedingly difficult to conduct, and typically use narrow patient-inclusion criteria, making it challenging to generalize the results to broader clinical situations. Alternative sources of reliable evidence, such as observational or retrospective studies, have been lacking. The widespread adoption of electronic medical records (EMRs) and the increasing availability of computational methods to process vast amounts of unstructured information now make it possible to learn directly from practice-based evidence. We propose that “big data” clinical repositories, including radiology reports, can lend themselves to a treasure trove of point-of-care, relevant, actionable data that can be used in an innovative and cost-sensitive approach to evaluate the appropriate use of medical imaging. We aim to create a predictive model that leverages real-time EMR clinical data from top national medical centers to arrive at a patient-specific imaging outcome prediction. We recognize that clinicians have to make on-the-spot medical imaging-ordering decisions and they generally do not comply with existing clinical decision support rules. Our study aims to provide clinicians with a tool that can leverage aggregate patient data for medical imaging decision making at the point of care. The overarching approach of this study is to utilize scalable methodology that can be widely applied to leverage EMR data to predict the outcome of a several other high-cost, low-yield imaging tests. This proposal has the potential to better inform advanced imaging in the learning healthcare system of the future and reduce unnecessary imaging examinations and healthcare costs. Project Narrative Imaging costs make up a significant proportion of health care expenditures and cause concern among policy makers, insurers, and patients alike; the inappropriate use of imaging technology is in part a result of imperfect risk models for imaging clinical decision support tools. Current risk models are often irrelevant to patients and as such, clinicians do not always heed to these recommendations, which in turn leads to unnecessary treatments and increased costs. We propose to create a precision health predictive model that leverages real-time electronic medical record data to arrive at a patient-specific imaging prediction in order to enhance imaging decision making at the point of care and optimize advanced image utilization.",Deep Learning for Pulmonary Embolism Imaging Decision Support: A Multi-institutional Collaboration,9782996,R01LM012966,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Acute', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Big Data', 'Biometry', 'Caring', 'Cigarette', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Support Model', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Evidence based practice', 'Exposure to', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Gold', 'Growth', 'Guidelines', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Expenditures', 'Healthcare Industry', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Image', 'Image Enhancement', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Imaging technology', 'Immune System Diseases', 'Incidental Findings', 'Informatics', 'Institution', 'Insurance Carriers', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Medical center', 'Medicare', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Obesity', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Policy Maker', 'Population', 'Precision Health', 'Pregnancy', 'Principal Investigator', 'Process', 'Pulmonary Embolism', 'Radiation exposure', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Randomized', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Research Personnel', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Services', 'Societies', 'Source', 'Spottings', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Unnecessary Procedures', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'aged', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'chemotherapy', 'clinical data warehouse', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical imaging', 'cohort', 'comparative effectiveness', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'diagnosis standard', 'effectiveness research', 'flexibility', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'inclusion criteria', 'informatics\xa0tool', 'innovation', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'lung imaging', 'model building', 'mortality', 'new technology', 'outcome prediction', 'patient oriented', 'payment', 'personalized risk prediction', 'point of care', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'pressure', 'radiologist', 'support tools', 'tool', 'unnecessary treatment']",NLM,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,348107,0.011762962401556049
"Novel Platform for Quantitative Subcellular Resolution Imaging of Human Tissues Using Mass Spectrometry Novel Platform for Quantitative Subcellular Resolution Imaging of Human Tissues Using Mass Spectrometry Mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) is a powerful technique that enables label-free spatial mapping of different classes of biomolecules in biological systems. Because it does not require any special sample pretreatment, ambient MSI is particularly attractive for high throughput automated imaging applications. The throughput of ambient MSI experiments is typically limited by the inherently slow microprobe-type sampling from surfaces, which is a characteristic shortcoming of many chemical imaging modalities. This project will combine several highly innovative approaches to address challenges associated with the high-throughput high- resolution ambient MSI of lipids and metabolites using nanospray desorption electrospray ionization (nano-DESI). Nano-DESI is an ambient ionization technique, which relies on gentle localized liquid extraction of molecules from tissue sections into a flowing solvent confined between two glass capillaries. The extracted molecules are efficiently delivered to a mass spectrometer inlet and ionized by soft electrospray ionization. Nano-DESI MSI enables detection of hundreds of metabolites, lipids, and peptides in tissue sections with high sensitivity, high spatial resolution, and without special sample pretreatment. Furthermore, on-the-fly quantification of lipids and metabolites in tissue sections during nano-DESI imaging experiments is achieved by doping the working solvent with appropriate standards of known concentration. This project will extend these powerful capabilities of nano-DESI MSI to enable high-throughput imaging of large tissue sections of interest to the HubMAP Consortium. This will be achieved using a combination of a conceptually different nano-DESI probe design optimized for robustness, ease of fabrication, and spatial resolution and a suite of advanced machine learning and compressed sensing computational approaches. These developments will be applicable to different types of human tissues and will transform quantitative molecular imaging of multiple classes of biomolecules in tissue sections. Although the capabilities of the new imaging platform will be demonstrated using non-diseased tissue, these developments will be broadly applicable to scientific problems associated with understanding health and disease Project Narrative This research is focused on the development of a transformative technology for rapid, quantitative, and robust imaging of different classes of biomolecules in human tissues using mass spectrometry.

"In vivo Imaging of Neuroactivity in the Deep Forward Scattering Regime Using Speckle Identification and Demixing (SPID) Microscopy PROJECT SUMMARY Optical imaging of neuronal activity in the mammalian brain at depth and at high spatial and temporal resolution remains a key challenge in neuroscience. This is because tissue scattering eliminates directional information carried by photons, with a characteristic length scale of hundreds of microns. As a result, the remaining unscattered, or “ballistic” component of light decays exponentially with depth. Since all optical microscopy modalities rely—either in the excitation or the emission—on this ballistic component of light for image formation, the limitations imposed by scattering limit the maximally obtainable imaging depths to ~1.5 mm in the rodent brain. Hereby, we propose a systematic approach for exploring and developing a new platform for in vivo deep tissue calcium imaging that actively exploits the scattering properties of the tissue as a resource to localize, demix and extract neuronal activity traces in the millimeter depth range in the highly scattering rodent brain. Our approach utilizes the fact that the scattering process results in an accumulation of different relative phases between scattered light components, leading to the formation of deterministic but complex interference patterns known as speckles. Emission from different locations of the sample results in speckles with different intensity distributions. Thus, these patterns carry complex information about both the location of the emitter and the properties of the scattering medium. Our current results show that the obtainable contrast for these speckle patterns should be sufficient to identify, localize and demix them even for extended objects and with partially coherent light. We will design and build an array of hardware and computational tools that will allow us to systematically explore the limits within which such demixing and neuronal signal extraction can be achieved in vivo. We will use these insights and develop an optical platform for volumetric calcium imaging in the mouse brain in the deep forward-scattering regime, as well as for transcranial calcium imaging in the mouse brain. Our approach will synergistically combine the expertise on the physics of light propagation in disordered media in the Gigan Lab with the experience in machine learning, computational imaging and in vivo high-speed volumetric neuronal recording in the Vaziri Lab. Our method has the potential of opening up a new paradigm for neuronal imagining and signal extraction in the multiple scattering regime by enabling millimeter-range calcium imaging in the highly scattering rodent brain. PROJECT NARRATIVE Optical recording of neuronal activity in the mammalian brain at depth with high spatial resolution remains, due to the highly scattering properties of brain tissue, a key challenge in neuroscience. This is because all microscopy modalities rely on the non-scattered ballistic component of light—which is exponentially attenuated with tissue depth—either in the excitation or the emission for image formation. We will overcome this issue by developing a deep-tissue calcium imaging platform that exploits the scattering properties of the tissue to localize, demix and extract neuronal activity traces in the millimeter range in the highly scattering rodent brain.",In vivo Imaging of Neuroactivity in the Deep Forward Scattering Regime Using Speckle Identification and Demixing (SPID) Microscopy,9828367,RF1NS113251,"['Algorithms', 'Attenuated', 'Ballistics', 'Brain', 'Calcium', 'Characteristics', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer software', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Image', 'In Vitro', 'Joints', 'Left', 'Length', 'Light', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Microscope', 'Microscopy', 'Modality', 'Motion', 'Mus', 'Nature', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Optics', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Photons', 'Physics', 'Process', 'Property', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Rodent', 'Sampling', 'Scheme', 'Signal Transduction', 'Snakes', 'Speed', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Tissue imaging', 'Tissues', 'attenuation', 'base', 'brain tissue', 'computerized tools', 'cranium', 'design', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging platform', 'imaging system', 'in vivo', 'in vivo calcium imaging', 'in vivo imaging', 'insight', 'light scattering', 'method development', 'millimeter', 'neuroimaging', 'neuronal cell body', 'neurotransmission', 'optical imaging', 'practical application', 'temporal measurement', 'two photon microscopy']",NINDS,ROCKEFELLER UNIVERSITY,RF1,2019,1549615,0.007551464051750943
"Groundwork for a Synchrotron MicroCT Imaging Resource for Biology (SMIRB) Project Summary Each major human disease is associated with a specific range of morphological changes to cells and tissues in the micron scale. Normal and abnormal structure was discovered and is still characterized using histology - a microscopic technique that depends on physical tissue slices. Presently, histology’s use in systems biology is limited by its largely descriptive and two-dimensional nature. Making histology quantitative and three-dimensional would be potentially transformational for research and diagnostics, but has been impractical. Accordingly, we have now created a 3D form of histology by customizing X-ray microtomography (micro-CT) of fixed and stained, millimeter-scale, whole organisms and tissue samples. We used fixed and metal-stained, whole zebrafish because they contain a full range of tissues within the size range currently studied histologically. The result is the first practical way to create virtual histology-like “sections” in any plane. Three-dimensional, complete histological phenotyping has potential use in genetic and chemical screens, and in clinical and toxicological tissue diagnostics. Here, we propose the next steps needed to enable high-throughput, quantitative, 3D histological phenotyping of whole, millimeter-scale animals. The proposed work applies the principles of chemistry, physics, and computer science to improve image resolution, throughput, and analytics, organized into three specific aims. Specific Aim 1 will build on our developments in this project and further improve imaging volume and resolution by upgrading imaging array, optics, and sub-pixel shifting, and to throughput by changes in sample embedding, loading geometry and mechanics, helical CT scanning, scintillator material, and to data sharing by improvements to the ViewTool infrastructure and user interface. Specific Aim 2 will yield reference images to define the range of normal phenotypic variation and to obtain samples related to a range of potential applications. Specific Aim 3 will apply the power of machine learning to segmentation, annotation, and analytics. Together, this work will establish a practical foundation for large-scale genetic and chemical screens involving mm-scale, whole organisms based on 3-dimensional, quantitative, histological phenotyping. The instrumentation and analytics will be state-of-the-art in its combination of resolution, field-of-view, pancellularity, image quality, analytical potential, throughput, sample stability, and reproducibility and largely usable with both tube and synchrotron X-ray sources. The voxel resolution will be at least 0.5 μm across fields-of-view of up to 1 cm. Representation of every cell type make the images suitable for cross-referencing across imaging modalities. Potential applications will be explored, “wild-type” will begin to be defined, and training sets for automated segmentation generated. The potential impact will encompass the missions of most NIH Institutes and Centers. The whole-animal genetic and chemical screens enabled are expected to impact drug development, diagnostics, and our basic understanding of how genes and environment define phenotype. Project Narrative Our group has established the only three-dimensional form of histology that is suitable for histopathology and quantitative tissue phenotyping, tissue X-ray microtomography (micro-CT). We outline here a plan to establish mechanisms for increasing resolution and field-of-view, to add sample multiplexing, to simply sample preparation, and to explore machine learning mechanisms for defining normal and abnormal structure towards whole-organism complete tissue phenotyping. The resulting tools will allow the community to comprehensively and computationally determine the roles of genes and environment in defining phenotype, which has implications in drug development, biomedical research, and medicine.",Groundwork for a Synchrotron MicroCT Imaging Resource for Biology (SMIRB),9792960,R24OD018559,"['3-Dimensional', 'Adolescent', 'Age', 'Animal Genetics', 'Animals', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Research', 'Body measure procedure', 'Caenorhabditis elegans', 'Cells', 'Cellular Structures', 'Cesium', 'Chemicals', 'Chemistry', 'Communities', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Drosophila genus', 'Embryo', 'Environment', 'Fishes', 'Foundations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Histologic', 'Histology', 'Histopathology', 'Image', 'Infrastructure', 'Institutes', 'Iodides', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Medicine', 'Metals', 'Microscopic', 'Mission', 'Morphology', 'Mus', 'Mutation', 'Nature', 'Nerve', 'Normal Range', 'Online Systems', 'Optics', 'Organ', 'Output', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Physics', 'Preparation', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Robotics', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Series', 'Siblings', 'Signal Transduction', 'Slice', 'Source', 'Spiral Computed Tomography', 'Stains', 'Structural defect', 'Structure', 'Synchrotrons', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Time', 'Tissue Sample', 'Tissue imaging', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Travel', 'Tube', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'Whole Organism', 'Work', 'Writing', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'Zebrafish', 'base', 'bone', 'cell type', 'clinical toxicology', 'computer science', 'computerized tools', 'crowdsourcing', 'data sharing', 'detector', 'disease phenotype', 'drug development', 'feature detection', 'histological studies', 'human disease', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'instrumentation', 'microCT', 'millimeter', 'mutant', 'programs', 'supervised learning', 'tool', 'two-dimensional', 'unsupervised learning', 'virtual']",OD,PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIV HERSHEY MED CTR,R24,2019,667280,0.012211165192320026
"Structural and functional tests of ganglion cell damage in glaucoma This project will use a combination of structural and functional measurements to test the hypothesis that early- stage damage in human glaucoma occurs first in the inner plexiform layer (IPL) of the retina – especially its OFF sub-lamina – as suggested by murine glaucoma models. In the first Aim, we will use a novel visible-light optical coherence tomograph (VIS OCT) to study structural changes in the retina of glaucoma patients. The newly developed VIS OCT has sufficient image contrast and resolution to segment the IPL boundaries and to define sub-lamination in volumetric OCT data, something not currently possible with existing near-infrared OCT instruments. We will make comparative measurements within the IPL and between the IPL, the ganglion cell layer (GCL) and the retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL). Because data from mouse models of glaucoma suggests that early damage occurs preferentially within the OFF sub-lamina of the IPL, we will make separate VIS OCT measurements biased for the OFF- and ON-sublaminae of the IPL and use machine learning approaches to determine whether a similar damage process can be demonstrated in human. To test whether OFF-pathway function is preferentially lost in glaucoma, we will use a novel Steady-State Visual Evoked Potential (SSVEP) paradigm that employs sawtooth increments and decrements to bias the measurement to ON vs OFF pathways, respectively, a paradigm our data suggests discriminates glaucoma from control patients. The second Aim will optimize this SSVEP measurement for testing localized areas of the visual field. The third Aim will make comparative measurements of visual-field, VIS OCT and SSVEP loss patterns in a large sample of glaucoma patients and in age- and sex-matched controls. Thickness and interface reflectivity amplitude maps derived from VIS OCT imaging of the RNFL, GCL and IPL including sublaminae will be correlated topographically with visual field defects to assess the relative sensitivity of our structural biomarkers at and near visual field locations with demonstrable losses on conventional (Humphrey) perimetry. Similarly, SSVEP responses from different locations in the visual field will be correlated topographically with visual field loss patterns and to VIS OCT losses, with special emphasis on correlating structural damage in OFF vs ON sub-laminae of the IPL with the functional correlates derived from regional decremental and incremental SSVEPs. Separately and in combination, our structural and functional measurements are designed to provide strong tests of the biological hypothesis that the OFF pathway is preferentially damaged in human glaucoma, and to reveal new biomarkers for the disease. Improving visual outcomes in glaucoma will require a better understanding of the earliest sites and processes of damage and methods to measure them quickly and accurately in patients. This project will address both needs through a combination of novel Optical Coherence Tomography and electrophysiological measurements. The new imaging and electrophysiological tests that will be developed here, either separately or together, could eventually replace conventional visual field testing which is time-consuming and unreliable.",Structural and functional tests of ganglion cell damage in glaucoma,9765006,R01EY030361,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Animal Model', 'Area', 'Atrophic', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Testing', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Economic Burden', 'Electrodes', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Elements', 'Frequencies', 'Ganglion Cell Layer', 'Glaucoma', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Human', 'Image', 'Inner Plexiform Layer', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Mus', 'Noise', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Optics', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perimetry', 'Process', 'Property', 'Resolution', 'Retina', 'Retinal', 'Retinal Ganglion Cells', 'Rodent Model', 'Sampling', 'Scotoma', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'Speed', 'Structural defect', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Visible Radiation', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'Visual Fields', 'Visual evoked cortical potential', 'base', 'cell injury', 'comparative', 'contrast imaging', 'design', 'extrastriate visual cortex', 'field study', 'ganglion cell', 'improved', 'instrument', 'mouse model', 'novel', 'optic nerve disorder', 'response', 'retinal imaging', 'retinal nerve fiber layer', 'sex']",NEI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,551932,0.05246616808883982
"I-Corps Program Application for Market Assessment of Non-invasive Imaging Device to Improve Outcomes of Amputations Surgery in Critical Limb Ischemia. 1. Executive Summary Nearly 150,000 patients in the US undergo lower extremity amputations annually secondary to peripheral arterial disease (PAD) complicated by critical limb ischemia (CLI).1,2,3 To increase a patient’s post-operative quality of life, surgeons attempt to salvage as much limb tissue as possible while also considering the likelihood of primary wound healing at a given level of amputation (LOA).4 The principal challenge in this decision is that surgeons overestimate the likelihood of healing at the selected LOA. Therefore, in the first year, 10% to 35% of amputations eventually require re-amputation to a more proximal level.5-7 This additional treatment prolongs the patient’s return to walking, worsening their condition and deteriorating their mental health. The burden to the healthcare system is immense. The average cost for each amputation is over $70,000, as evidenced by a recent publication that shows diabetic foot ulcer complications, mainly attributed to amputation, cost more than the five most costly forms of cancer.8 Despite these facts, there are no objective studies for selection of LOA in patients with PAD. To address this critical problem, Spectral MD (SMD) has developed a point-of-care imaging device (DeepView), which simultaneously performs multispectral imaging (MSI) and Photoplethysmography (PPG) imaging across the visible and infrared spectrum to obtain a quantitative microvascular tissue assessment. These optical measurements are integrated using artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms to provide a quantitative aid to the physician’s determination of tissue viability at a proposed amputation site. If used for routine assessment prior to amputation, SMD expects DeepView to reduce the rate of re- amputation by 70%, resulting in up to 38,000 fewer re-amputations per year while improving quality of life for amputees and reducing associated health costs. The central objective for SMD’s Phase I SBIR is to perform a feasibility clinical study to demonstrate the DeepView device will achieve greater than 90% accuracy in identifying the healing potential of tissue at the amputation site. This hypothesis will be tested by the following specific aims: Aim 1: Complete a Feasibility Study creating a database of pre-amputation images. This data will be used for construction of the AI algorithm to predict amputation site healing potential. Aim 2: Identify MSI and PPG features that can accurately predict amputation site healing potential. Aim 3: Using Aim I clinical data, finalize the AI algorithm architecture and estimate sample size needed for a Phase II Pivotal Study in which the necessary training data to achieve at least 90% sensitivity and 90% specificity will be obtained. As of this Supplement request, SMD has initiated a clinical study for feasibility and enrolled the first subject. Through collaboration with the clinical study site Principal Investigator (PI), Dr. Dennis Gable, SMD developed the protocol and trained his research staff at the study site, Baylor Medical Center Plano, in the use of the DeepView device. SMD anticipates enrollment of five subjects each month over the next 6 months. The I-Corps team will consist of the following members: Michael DiMaio, MD – Role: C-Level Corporate Officer. Dr. DiMaio, MD is Founder and Chief Executive Officer of SMD and has led SMD in obtaining over $30M in non-dilutive government funding and private investments. His distinguished career includes extensive experience as an entrepreneur, clinician, and scientist. With over 20 years’ experience as a cardiovascular surgeon, Dr. DiMaio has a widespread network of physicians and hospitals from which to draw contacts for customer interviews. Jeffrey Thatcher, PhD – Role: PI. Dr. Thatcher is the Chief Scientist at SMD and is a leader in the development of diagnostic imaging for soft tissue diseases. He led SMD in conceptualizing and inventing SMD’s core imaging technology undergoing clinical trials in three wound diagnostics applications including: burns; diabetic ulcers; and amputation. Wensheng Fan, MS – Role: Industry Expert. Wensheng Fan is Executive Vice President and Chief Technology Officer at SMD. He is an executive, entrepreneur, and innovator with over 20 years of experience in natural speech recognition and real time imaging systems. At SMD, he leads market engagement, strategic financial planning, and device development. Narrative In patients with peripheral arterial disease, reported rates of re-amputation due to non-healing of a primary amputation are very significant—approximately 20% of below-the-knee amputations require eventual revision, with even higher rates established for amputations at the level of the foot. There are no gold-standard tests for selection of level of amputation (LOA) to aid clinical judgment. To address this critical problem, SpectralMD is developing the DeepView-Gen2 imaging device that integrates multispectral imaging and a machine learning algorithm to quantitatively measure microvascular blood flow and tissue healing potential to assist in the clinical selection of LOA and minimize the incidence of re-amputation and its associated morbidity and mortality.",I-Corps Program Application for Market Assessment of Non-invasive Imaging Device to Improve Outcomes of Amputations Surgery in Critical Limb Ischemia.,9827388,R43HL142428,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Amputation', 'Amputees', 'Architecture', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Blood flow', 'Burn injury', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Device or Instrument Development', 'Devices', 'Diabetic Foot Ulcer', 'Diabetic ulcer', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Enrollment', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Funding', 'Gold', 'Government', 'Health Care Costs', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Imaging Device', 'Imaging technology', 'Incidence', 'Industry', 'Innovation Corps', 'Interview', 'Investments', 'Ischemia', 'Judgment', 'Knee', 'Limb structure', 'Lower Extremity', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical center', 'Mental Health', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Optics', 'Patients', 'Peripheral arterial disease', 'Phase', 'Photoplethysmography', 'Physicians', 'Postoperative Period', 'Principal Investigator', 'Privatization', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publications', 'Quality of life', 'Reporting', 'Research Training', 'Role', 'S Phase', 'Sample Size', 'Scientist', 'Secondary to', 'Site', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Soft Tissue Disorder', 'Specificity', 'Surgeon', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Tissue Viability', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Walking', 'Wound Healing', 'career', 'cost', 'experience', 'foot', 'healing', 'imaging system', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'member', 'mortality', 'non-invasive imaging', 'point of care', 'programs', 'real-time images', 'speech recognition', 'wound']",NHLBI,"SPECTRAL MD, INC.",R43,2019,54976,0.01725027706665965
"Augmented reality visualization for intraoperative guidance based on fluorescence lifetime Project summary/Abstract Optical imaging techniques have demonstrated potential to delineate tumor margins in vivo during surgery as they can rapidly characterize structural, biochemical or functional properties of tissue. Implementation in clinical practice demands rapid visualization and augmentation of imaging data but is often limited by the difficulty in dynamic registration, slow image reconstruction, lack of real- time ability or the need for contrast agents. The goal of this proposal is to implement the recently released Microsoft HoloLens with fiber-based imaging techniques to dynamically augment tissue characteristics directly on the interrogated area in the surgeon’s field of view. The specific aims of this proposal are as follows: (1) To realize a prototype of the augmented reality visualization platform and to combine it with our fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIm) system, implement a user interface for a convenient interaction with the device. (2) To evaluate and optimize the scanning resolution and the registration precision using fluorescence phantoms and demonstrate the system in vivo for ten patients undergoing lumpectomy surgery. A current pilot study has demonstrated the potential of FLIm to localize tumor margins on excised breast specimen. The acquired in vivo data will help to systematically analyze differences between ex vivo and in vivo fluorescence decay signatures and provide initial data for a large-scale study that will be necessary to delineate tumor margins in vivo. The innovation of this proposal is that it will realize an augmented reality visualization platform for FLIm and other fiber based optical imaging modalities providing dynamic (continuous) augmentation of tissue properties directly on the interrogated area (surgeon’s field of view) in real-time without requiring the injection of contrast agents. The successful completion of this work has consequently the potential for significant impact in the field of surgical navigation. Project narrative This project seeks to realize an augmented and mixed reality visualization based on autofluorescence lifetime and any other fiber-based imaging technique for surgical navigation. The proposed research is consequently relevant to public health as it constitutes a critical part of surgical workflow to enable surgeon finding specific targets, avoiding areas of risk, and providing intraoperative orientation leading to higher resection precision and less interruptions in the surgical workflow.",Augmented reality visualization for intraoperative guidance based on fluorescence lifetime,9770855,R03EB026819,"['Achievement', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Augmented Reality', 'Biochemical', 'Breast', 'Calibration', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Communication', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Contrast Media', 'Data', 'Devices', 'Excision', 'Fiber', 'Fiber Optics', 'Fluorescence', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Image-Guided Surgery', 'Imagery', 'Imaging Techniques', 'In Situ', 'Infrastructure', 'Injections', 'Interruption', 'Intuition', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Mammary Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Medical Imaging', 'Modification', 'Near-infrared optical imaging', 'Operating Rooms', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Optics', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Pilot Projects', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Postoperative Procedures', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Scanning', 'Specimen', 'Stains', 'Structure', 'Surgeon', 'Surgical margins', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Work', 'base', 'breast lumpectomy', 'cancer therapy', 'clinical practice', 'design', 'design and construction', 'fluorescence lifetime imaging', 'human subject', 'image processing', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging modality', 'imaging system', 'improved outcome', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'mixed reality', 'optical imaging', 'prototype', 'real-time images', 'tumor']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,R03,2019,74276,-0.014841733824993179
"Noninvasive assessment of the cornea by diffusion OCT Keratoconus is a degenerative disease of the cornea that is a major cause of reduced vision-related quality of life in the United States, often leading to corneal transplantation. Ectasia after refractive surgery is a vision-threatening complication that can occur in apparently low-risk patients despite current screening technology. The biomechanical properties of the cornea play a central role in these diseases, but diagnostics are still rooted in shape measures because doctors lack direct measures of biomechanical change. While several methods have shown early promise for addressing this gap, most require contact with or perturbation of the cornea, cannot spatially resolve biomechanical properties, or involve expensive optical systems.  To address the need for direct biomechanical measurement of the cornea and the limitations of other approaches, we introduce phase-decorrelation OCT (phd-OCT). Phd-OCT makes use optical coherence tomography (OCT) to quantify random nanoscale mobility that is related to the strength and cohesion of the cornea. Preliminary results strongly support the rationale, feasibility and potential advantages of the approach. Our objectives are: (1) to refine our method to optimize detection sensitivity and speed, and (2) to determine if the technique is clinically useful. We will achieve these objectives through the following aims: 1. To develop and validate mobility-sensitive phd-OCT for corneal imaging. Spectral-domain OCT will be used for anterior segment phase-decorrelation imaging and the analysis algorithm will be optimized. The system will be validated using phantoms and torsional rheometry. 2. To investigate the potential influence of physiological factors (intraocular pressure (IOP), hydration, and temperature). Factorial design experiments in porcine and human donor globes will establish the sensitivity of phd-OCT measurements to potential confounders. 3. To develop and validate data acquisition and processing methods to enable clinical testing. GPU processing and machine learning will be configured to minimize processing time. Scan patterns will be optimized to minimize scan time and return clinically useful data. 4. To assess feasibility and preliminary diagnostic performance of clinical mobility-sensitive OCT imaging of the cornea. A first-in-human study will characterize repeatability and test the hypotheses that phd-OCT mobility measurements are increased in the region of a LASIK flap and decreased in CXL.  Expected Outcomes: The proposed studies will establish a new, non-contact method for imaging corneal biomechanical properties with the potential to address many shortcomings of current and emerging methods. Success could lead to earlier detection of of ectasia risk and allow more appropriate timing and customization of corneal treatments. Future integration of data into computational models has the potential to greatly impact the field by driving a shift from empirical planning and risk analysis to patient-specific strategies. The mechanical properties of the cornea, the transparent front of the eye, are important for diseases that affect vision as well as for corrective treatments like crosslinking therapy and LASIK. We have developed a new optical coherence tomography (OCT)-based method to detect and map corneal mechanical properties that has advantages that may make it readily translatable to clinical use. The objective of this proposal is to determine whether this technique is clinically feasible and useful by refining the technology, testing it in animal and human donor corneas, and performing studies in patients with corneal conditions of interest.",Noninvasive assessment of the cornea by diffusion OCT,9735326,R01EY028667,"['Achievement', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Anterior', 'Automobile Driving', 'Biomechanics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Complication', 'Computational Technique', 'Computer Simulation', 'Cornea', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Degenerative Disorder', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffusion', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Ensure', 'Exhibits', 'Eye', 'Family suidae', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Human', 'Hydration status', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Keratoconus', 'Keratoplasty', 'Laser In Situ Keratomileusis', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Optics', 'Outcome', 'Pathological Dilatation', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physiologic Intraocular Pressure', 'Physiological', 'Plant Roots', 'Play', 'Procedures', 'Property', 'Proxy', 'Quality of life', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Shapes', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'Surgical Flaps', 'Surgical incisions', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Temperature', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Torsion', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Vision', 'Visual impairment', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'cohesion', 'computerized data processing', 'crosslink', 'data acquisition', 'data integration', 'design', 'experimental study', 'first-in-human', 'human study', 'imaging modality', 'interest', 'mechanical properties', 'nanoscale', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'research clinical testing', 'screening', 'simulation', 'success', 'tool', 'treatment effect']",NEI,CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,396887,0.016940039139924527
"A robust platform for multiplexed, subcellular proteomic imaging in human tissue Project Summary Multiplexed Ion Beam Imaging by Time of Flight (MIBI-TOF) uses secondary ion mass spectrometry and metal conjugated primary antibodies to simultaneously visualize dozens of proteins at subcellular resolution in a single tissue section. This technology is back compatible with archival formalin fixed, paraffin embedded tissue (FFPE) and has been used in peer-reviewed work to simultaneously visualize and quantify 36 proteins in retrospective human tissue cohorts. In line with the stated goals of the HuBMAP consortium to develop both “High-sensitivity, high-resolution imaging techniques that can rapidly provide spectral data over large areas of tissue” and “Quantitative imaging analysis tools, including automated 3D image segmentation, feature extraction, and image annotation,” the work outlined here will create a standardized, high throughput, and user-friendly workflow for using MIBI-TOF in basic and translational research to gain insight into how single cell phenotype and tissue structure are functionally-linked in health and disease. To achieve this, we will validate 100 FFPE antibodies and optimize ready-to-use multiplexed staining panels in lyophilized format that will permit storage for at least two years. Protocols and reagents for multiplexed signal amplification of protein and mRNA targets will be further refined, while next generation instrumentation will increase sample throughput to permit full tissue section imaging of up to 40 proteins in 1 hour. Standardized reagents and more robust instrumentation will be accompanied by an automated computational pipeline that utilizes a standard set of segmentation markers and machine learning to accurately identify nuclei and cell borders in any non-neural human tissue. This data will be used to cluster single cell events into functionally distinct populations according to morphology, protein expression, and histological distribution. The reagents and computational pipeline proposed here synergize with existing HuBMAP-funded platforms and could be readily generalized to virtually any high dimensional imaging modality. Thus, this work will not only provide a practical, back compatible imaging platform for high throughput multiplexed imaging, but will also accelerate development of other complimentary imaging technologies as well. Project Narrative Multiplexed ion beam imaging by time of flight (MIBI-TOF) is a new technology for visualizing dozens of proteins in standard clinical tissue biopsies at high resolution.

"New instrument and methods for fast, diagnostic-quality histology of un-embedded bone marrow and lymph node specimens Project Summary Over 600,000 bone marrow biopsies are performed every year in the United States, while hundreds of thousands more lymph node biospies are performed. Histological evaluation of these biopsies is a critical component of care for hematologic diseases including leukemia, lymphoma, myelodysplastic syndrome, myeloproliferative disease and non-neoplastic conditions such as viral infections and autoimmune conditions.  We have developed a platform that we consider a paradigm shift in the histologic examination of tissues. It is based on a new chemical process, imaging, and image processing approach that we have dubbed Clearing Histology with MultiPhoton microscopy (CHiMP).The CHiMP technology enables visual analysis of entire intact, un-embedded and uncut specimens within a short time-frame and with a resolution that is amenable to primary diagnosis. The significant clinical benefits include: 1) potential for same-day diagnosis, 2) labor and cost savings, 3) access to 3D perspective, 4) increased visual data from same specimen, 5) complete tissue preservation for ancillary studies such as DNA analysis and 6) inherent benefits of digital data such as reduced risk of loss, ready remote review by experts, and amenability to machine learning tools. Hematopoietic tissue evaluation would similarly benefit from these advantages, but unfortunately the systems developed thus far lack the resolution typically needed for visual examination of hematopoietic tissues.  For this Phase I SBIR proposal, an objective is to develop customized optics to improve the resolution of our current microscopes and thereby enable use in the specialized field of hematology. Commercially available objective lenses that are compatible with our immersion medium are either limited to numerical apertures (NA) that are less than one, affecting resolution and image quality, or have insufficient working distances for imaging past the coverslip and surface roughness to obtain complete sections. We will design and test a custom objective lens with high NA and long working distance, suited for our proprietary reagents. Integrating such a lens into our microscope will also require the design of a custom scan lens, custom beam conditioning optics, and a custom polygon scanner.  An associated goal is to develop a novel approach to preparing bone marrow aspiration specimens that will make them amenable to imaging with CHiMP, potentially reducing the need for core biopsies by permitting unambiguous morphologic categorization of cell subtypes in their architectural context, without the routine need for immunohistochemistry, and while preserving nucleic acids for molecular/genetic evaluation. Project Narrative Applikate Technologies has developed a powerful platform for histological evaluation of tissue called Clearing Histology with MultiPhoton Microscopy, or CHiMP. This platform has many advantages over traditional approaches, including same-day turn-around, reduced labor costs, preservation of tissue for DNA analysis, and direct-to-digital imaging for ease of consultation with remote experts. This proposal seeks to develop custom optics to enable very-high-resolution imaging of bone marrow and lymph node samples that are critical for diagnosing diseases such as leukemia and lymphoma.","New instrument and methods for fast, diagnostic-quality histology of un-embedded bone marrow and lymph node specimens",9677952,R43CA235890,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Ancillary Study', 'Antigens', 'Architecture', 'Aspirate substance', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Autoimmune Process', 'Biopsy', 'Blinded', 'Bone Marrow', 'Bone Marrow Aspiration', 'Bone marrow biopsy', 'Caring', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Consultations', 'Consumption', 'Core Biopsy', 'Cost Savings', 'Custom', 'DNA', 'DNA analysis', 'Data', 'Decalcification', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Dysmyelopoietic Syndromes', 'Evaluation', 'Fibrosis', 'Goals', 'Hematological Disease', 'Hematology', 'Hematopathology', 'Histologic', 'Histology', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Immersion Investigative Technique', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Iron', 'Lateral', 'Lymph', 'Machine Learning', 'Marrow', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Microscope', 'Microscopy', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Morphology', 'Myeloproliferative disease', 'Nucleic Acids', 'Optics', 'Pan Genus', 'Pathologist', 'Pathology', 'Phase', 'Preparation', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'RNA', 'Reagent', 'Recovery', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Slice', 'Slide', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Specimen', 'Speed', 'Surface', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissue Preservation', 'Tissue Sample', 'Tissue Stains', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'United States', 'Virus Diseases', 'Visual', 'Waxes', 'Work', 'base', 'bone imaging', 'conditioning', 'cost', 'design', 'digital', 'digital imaging', 'disease diagnosis', 'hematopoietic tissue', 'high resolution imaging', 'image processing', 'improved', 'instrument', 'lens', 'leukemia/lymphoma', 'lymph nodes', 'medical specialties', 'multiphoton microscopy', 'nanoparticle', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'particle', 'pre-clinical', 'preservation', 'second harmonic', 'tool', 'whole slide imaging']",NCI,"APPLIKATE TECHNOLOGIES, LLC",R43,2019,224713,0.015994002231173275
"Computing, Optimizing, and Evaluating Quantitative Cancer Imaging Biomarkers ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Quantitative Imaging Network (QIN) is a consortium of centers developing quantitative image features, which are proving to be valuable biomarkers of the underlying cancer biology and that can be used for assessing response to treatment and predicting clinical outcome. It is now important to discover the best quantitative imaging features for detection of response to therapeutics, to identify subtypes of cancer, and to correlate with cancer genomics. However, progress is thwarted by the lack of shared software algorithms, architectures, and resources required to compute, compare, evaluate, and disseminate these quantitative imaging features within the QIN and the broader community. We propose to develop the Quantitative Imaging Feature Pipeline (QIFP), a cloud-based, open source platform that will give researchers free access to these capabilities and hasten the introduction of quantitative image biomarkers into single- and multi-center clinical trials. The QIFP will facilitate assessment of the incremental value of new vs. existing image feature sets. It will also allow researchers to add their own algorithms to compute novel quantitative image features in their own studies and to disseminate them to the greater research community. To accomplish this: (1) We will create an expandable library of quantitative imaging feature algorithms capable of comprehensive characterization of the imaging phenotype of cancer. It will support a broad set of imaging modalities and algorithms implemented in a variety of languages, including algorithms that provide volumetric and time-varying assessment of lesion size, shape, edge sharpness, and pixel statistics. (2) We will build a cloud-based software architecture for creating, executing, and comparing quantitative image feature-generating pipelines, including algorithms in the library and/or those supplied by QIN or other researchers as plug-ins. QIFP will also have (a) a machine learning engine that lets users specify a dependent variable (e.g., progression-free survival) that the quantitative image features can used to predict, and (b) an evaluation engine that compares the utility of particular features for predicting the dependent variable. (3) We will assess the QIFP in four ways: (a) by its ability to recapitulate the role of known biomarkers in a related clinical trial, (b) by comparing linear measurement, metabolic tumor burden and novel combinations of the features in our library for predicting one-year progression-free survival, (c) by merging imaging features with known host-, drug- and tumor-based follicular lymphoma biomarkers in order to develop the most robust and integrative predictive model for patient outcomes, and (d) by using the QIFP to combine and to evaluate image feature algorithms developed by another QIN team and our own NCI- funded team in the study of radiogenomics of non-small cell lung cancer. The QIFP will fill a substantial gap in the science currently being carried out in the QIN and in the community by providing the tools and infrastructure to assess the value of novel quantitative imaging features of cancer, and will thereby accelerate incorporating new imaging biomarkers into single and multi-center clinical trials and into oncology practice. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We propose to develop and evaluate a software platform that has major relevance for human health. Many investigators are pursuing image-based surrogates for response to therapy that could be used in clinical trials to predict their success/failure earlier and that are more accurate than existing surrogates. Our developments will facilitate sharing, assessing, and comparing combinations of image feature-generating software algorithms for predicting treatment response, survival, and tissue genomics, which will, in turn, greatly accelerate the development and acceptance of new and more relevant imaging surrogates for assessing cancer treatments.","Computing, Optimizing, and Evaluating Quantitative Cancer Imaging Biomarkers",9753130,U01CA187947,"['Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Cancer Biology', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communities', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine', 'Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group', 'Evaluation', 'Failure', 'Follicular Lymphoma', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression', 'Generations', 'Genomics', 'Health', 'Human', 'Image', 'Infrastructure', 'Investigation', 'Java', 'Language', 'Lesion', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Metabolic', 'Modality', 'Modernization', 'Molecular', 'Multi-Institutional Clinical Trial', 'Non-Small-Cell Lung Carcinoma', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Plug-in', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Privatization', 'Progression-Free Survivals', 'Pythons', 'RNA Sequences', 'Radiogenomics', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Science', 'Shapes', 'Specific qualifier value', 'System', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Tumor Burden', 'base', 'cancer biomarkers', 'cancer genomics', 'cancer imaging', 'cancer subtypes', 'cancer therapy', 'clinical predictors', 'cloud based', 'disorder subtype', 'feature detection', 'image archival system', 'image processing', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'interest', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'oncology', 'open source', 'predict clinical outcome', 'predictive modeling', 'public health relevance', 'quantitative imaging', 'repository', 'response', 'specific biomarkers', 'statistics', 'success', 'survival prediction', 'tool', 'treatment response', 'tumor', 'vector', 'web based interface']",NCI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,U01,2019,567509,9.905898273298657e-05
"Development and Validation of Radiation-Free Pediatric Renal Function Quantification Project Abstract Motivation: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) affects more than 500 million people. Children commonly develop CKD from urinary obstructive diseases and nephrotoxic therapies, and then suffer severe growth failure,  hypertension, cardiovascular risks, and neurocognitive deficits, and eventually end-stage kidney disease. Accurate renal function quantification will improve clinical management of hydronephrosis (1 in 100 babies) and  dosing/selection of chemotherapeutic regimens in oncology patients. Glomerular filtration rate (GFR), the biomarker of renal function, is derived from blood or urine tests. These tests only provide global GFR and are limited in accuracy, especially in children, and even more so in children with cancer. MRI offers superb anatomic delineation without ionizing radiation, and is thus ideal for pediatric kidney imaging. However, MRI has not been widely adopted for pediatric renal function evaluation due to lack of reliability and cumbersome workflow. These hurdles stem from the fact that the critical components required for global and regional GFR calculation, including high spatiotemporal resolution, plasma flow and arterial input function, are difficult to obtain, and that accurate image segmentation of kidneys (cortex and medulla) is labor intensive. Additionally, although the same contrast agent injection can be used for obstruction evaluation, certain areas of the kidney suffer from significant signal loss using standard MRI acquisition techniques due to high contrast agent concentrations. This project addresses these major challenges for automated comprehensive renal function evaluation in children. Approach: The project has three development aims, which are validated by clinical studies. Aim 1 will enable novel free-breathing time-resolved 3D dynamic contrast enhanced MRI that simultaneously provides accurate GFR calculation and renal plasma flow. This is achieved by incorporating self-navigated motion compensation, fast acquisition with parallel imaging and compressed sensing, and phase-contrast flow imaging. The second aim is to develop multiple new image analysis methods to extract GFR and renal plasma flow (RPF) that  leverage novel flow data of Aim 1, as well as automated new machine-learning image processing techniques for the segmentation of kidneys and ultimately global and regional GFR calculation. In Aim 3, we will develop and integrate ultrashort-echo-time techniques to address the MRI signal loss due to T2* effects from high contrast concentration for patients with obstruction, and further incorporate motion compensation and accelerated  imaging methods to enable time-resolved high-resolution dynamic MRI for contrast washout kinetics analysis in the same MR exam. Aim 4 will determine the performance of these methods in a clinical setting. Significance: This work will lead to robust, automated comprehensive pediatric renal MRI for safer and more accurate renal function evaluation in children. The techniques will facilitate widespread application in the com- munity setting and permit robust evaluation of renal function, for both children and adults. Project Narrative Kidney diseases in children often stem from blockages of the urinary tract or toxicity from medications, such as antibiotics or chemotherapies. Kidney function quantification is crucial for clinical management of these children. This work will develop accurate and automated pediatric MRI for quantification of kidney function and diagnosis of urinary tract obstruction.",Development and Validation of Radiation-Free Pediatric Renal Function Quantification,9677647,R01EB026136,"['3-Dimensional', '4D Imaging', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Anatomy', 'Antibiotics', 'Area', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood flow', 'Breathing', 'Cardiac Output', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Research', 'Cone', 'Consumption', 'Contrast Media', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Drug Kinetics', 'End stage renal failure', 'Evaluation', 'Evolution', 'Failure', 'Financial compensation', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Glomerular Filtration Rate', 'Gold', 'Growth', 'Hydronephrosis', 'Hypertension', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Injections', 'Ionizing radiation', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Kinetics', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Mainstreaming', 'Malignant Childhood Neoplasm', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Motion', 'Motivation', 'Neurocognitive Deficit', 'Obstruction', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Perfusion', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Plasma', 'Protocols documentation', 'Radiation', 'Reflux', 'Regimen', 'Renal Blood Flow', 'Renal Plasma Flow', 'Renal function', 'Reproducibility', 'Resolution', 'Signal Transduction', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Urinary tract', 'Urine', 'Validation', 'Venous', 'Work', 'antimicrobial drug', 'automated analysis', 'base', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'chemotherapeutic agent', 'chemotherapy', 'community setting', 'computerized data processing', 'contrast enhanced', 'data acquisition', 'experience', 'image processing', 'imaging Segmentation', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'kidney cortex', 'kidney imaging', 'loss of function', 'nephrotoxicity', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'oncology', 'pressure', 'reconstruction', 'recruit', 'spatiotemporal', 'stem', 'urinary', 'urinary tract obstruction', 'urologic']",NIBIB,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,665614,0.023985357757792387
"Functional Cardiovascular 4D MRI in Congenital Heart Disease SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Congenital heart disease (CHD) is the most common birth defect, affecting 1.2% of all live births. Imaging plays a major role in managing CHD but remains challenging for evaluating complex cardiac and vascular abnormalities across a wide range of age and habitus. To address these limitations, the PIs have developed cardiovascular 4D flow MRI which can measure complex 3D blood flow in-vivo, a task difficult or impossible to obtain with other imaging strategies. Recent efforts have focused on two forms of CHD: 1) bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) which is the most common form of CHD, and 2) single ventricle physiology (SVP), one of the most severe forms of CHD. Our 4D flow MRI studies have successfully identified new hemodynamic biomarkers to better characterize CHD. We were the first to establish a physiologic link between aberrant 3D blood flow, elevated wall shear stress (WSS), aortopathy phenotype, and aortic wall tissue degeneration on histopathology in patients with BAV. In patients with SVP, our findings demonstrated relationships between surgical correction strategies and flow distribution to the lungs, a known factor implicated in SVP outcome. We have achieved successful clinical translation at Northwestern, where 4D flow MRI is now used as a clinical tool in diagnostic MRI exams for patients with CHD and aortic disease. Over the past four years, the PIs have assembled one of the largest 4D MRI databases with over 2500 patient exams. For this renewal application, we identified a need to increase the dynamic range of 4D MRI flow sensitivity to account for data complexity (3D + time) and the wide age range in CHD by a combination of dual-venc flow encoding, compressed sensing, and SSFP imaging. Second, three is a need for longitudinal studies to identify predictors of BAV and SVP outcome. Third, making these unique but complex 4D MRI data sets and analysis tools more widely available to the greater research community is challenging. In addition, no automated methods currently exist for advanced processing such as atlas based analysis across large cohorts. Analysis is thus time consuming and requires manual interactions (e.g. 3D vessel segmentation) which limits reproducibility and translation. To address this need, an established Northwestern data archival and pipeline processing resource based on remote high-performance computing clusters (NUNDA) will be utilized for standardized data archival, sharing, and pipeline processing of 4D MRI data. This platform will provide the unique opportunity to utilize annotated data available in the 4D MRI database (>1300 BAV, SVP, and control 4D MRI data analyzed in the initial funding cycle) for application of machine learning concepts to establish (semi-)automated 4D MRI analysis workflows in NUNDA. Thus, the renewal application for this study aims to 1) develop a rapid (15 min) non-contrast 4D MRI for clinical translation, 2) leverage the existing large 4D MRI database to identify 4D MRI metrics predictive of long-term (> 5 years) CHD patient outcome, and 3) establish a remote NUNDA platform for 4D MRI data sharing and automated analysis across large cohorts. PROJECT NARRATIVE Our goal is to develop non-contrast 4D MRI, a new diagnostic test to achieve an improved assessment for the most common and one of the most severe forms of congenital heart disease: bicuspid aortic valve and single ventricle physiology. We will leverage an existing large 4D MRI database to allow for long-term 5-8-year follow-up to establish new measures for improved outcome prediction and therapy management for patients with bicuspid aortic valve and single ventricle physiology. A comprehensive data archive will be established to allow for the dissemination of the 4D MRI data, analysis tools, and study results to the greater research community.",Functional Cardiovascular 4D MRI in Congenital Heart Disease,9663985,R01HL115828,"['3-Dimensional', '4D MRI', 'Acceleration', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Anatomy', 'Aortic Diseases', 'Archives', 'Atlases', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood flow', 'Cardiac Output', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Common Ventricle', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Congenital Abnormality', 'Consumption', 'Contrast Media', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Dimensions', 'Disease Progression', 'Exposure to', 'Funding', 'General Anesthesia', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Heart Abnormalities', 'Heart Rate', 'High Performance Computing', 'Histopathology', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Infant', 'Link', 'Live Birth', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Study', 'Oxygen', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Play', 'Population', 'Process', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Secure', 'Sex Differences', 'Standardization', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translations', 'adverse outcome', 'analysis pipeline', 'aortic valve', 'automated analysis', 'base', 'bicuspid aortic valve', 'clinical translation', 'cluster computing', 'cohort', 'congenital heart disorder', 'data archive', 'data pipeline', 'data sharing', 'design', 'exercise capacity', 'flexibility', 'follow-up', 'hemodynamics', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'in vivo', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'outcome prediction', 'patient population', 'pediatric patients', 'prevent', 'shear stress', 'spatiotemporal', 'tissue degeneration', 'tool', 'vascular abnormality']",NHLBI,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R01,2019,740572,0.0039233121190212755
"ClearScope Combined in vivo and ex vivo three‐dimensional (3D) whole‐brain imaging of non‐transgenic and transgenic animal models holds the promise of novel insights into neural network connectivity patterns. With regard to ex vivo light microscopic imaging of 3D whole‐brain datasets, the best approach is brain clearing followed by whole‐brain light sheet microscopy (LSM) because of its unique combination of speed, 3D resolving power, and low phototoxicity compared to confocal and multiphoton microscopy. Unlike other methods, the combined brain clearing / LSM approach makes it possible to use intact tissue and retain all intracellular connections within the brain structure. However, LSM systems commercially available are not suitable for ex vivo light microscopic imaging of 3D whole‐brain datasets in advanced connectomics research. Recently, Dr. Raju Tomer (Dept. Biol. Sci., Columbia Univ., New York, NY) developed light sheet theta microscopy (LSTM), essentially a unique arrangement of two light sheets oblique to the specimen and one detection objective perpendicular to the specimen. This novel microscope is the basis for a number of capabilities in LSTM that are not all available with any other commercially available LSM systems. The LSTM technology has distinct advantages over confocal and other light sheet microscopes, including the unmatched ability to image thicker tissue specimens over a larger lateral area (XY) at higher optical resolutions, while maintaining fast imaging speed, high imaging quality, and low photo‐bleaching. This promising technology serves as the basis for this Lab to Marketplace proposal to develop the ClearScope™, which refines and improves Dr. Tomer's original LSTM system to create a successful commercial microscope for wide‐spread adoption. The key technical objectives for developing the ClearScope as a commercial product include creating and testing (i) a ClearScope prototype based on an optimized microscope hardware design; (ii) novel microscope hardware components for the ClearScope, comprising a novel chamber that contains the investigated specimen and the immersion medium, and a novel detection objective changer; (iii) novel control and image acquisition software for the ClearScope; and importantly, (iv) novel software that surpasses the existing state‐of‐the‐art technology to assemble acquired image stacks into large 3D image volumes exceeding 10TB without need to downsample the image information. The production version of the ClearScope will benefit the neuroscience research community, pharmacological and biotechnological R&D, and society in general by improving understanding of neural network connectivity patterns as well as the neuropathological underpinnings of the large‐scale connectional alterations associated with human neuropsychiatric and neurological conditions. In particular, this will result in an improved basis for developing novel treatment strategies for complex brain diseases. The proposed project will enable important new research, that is not currently feasible, into whole-brain neural network connectivity patterns by means of ex vivo light microscopic imaging of three-dimensional whole-brain datasets. To achieve this, the proposed project will create the ClearScope light sheet microscope featuring signficant capabilities to image thick specimens of unlimited lateral (XY) size with resolution that permits investigatons of subcellular structures to distinguish adjacent neuronal processes (axons, dendrites, varicosities and dendritic spines). Because these features are not all available with any commercially available light sheet microscopes, the benefit for the neuroscience research community, pharmacological and biotechnological R&D, and society in general will be the possibility to better understand neural network connectivity patterns as well as the neuropathological underpinnings of the large-scale connectional alterations associated with human neuropsychiatric and neurological conditions, ultimately resulting in an improved basis for developing novel treatment strategies for complex brain diseases.",ClearScope,9677046,R44MH116827,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Adoption', 'Animal Model', 'Area', 'Axon', 'Behavioral Research', 'Benchmarking', 'Biotechnology', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Brain imaging', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Confocal Microscopy', 'Data Set', 'Dendrites', 'Dendritic Spines', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Human', 'Image', 'Immersion Investigative Technique', 'Lateral', 'Legal patent', 'Light', 'Lighting', 'Literature', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Microscope', 'Microscopy', 'Mus', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurologic', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences Research', 'New York', 'Optics', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Pharmacology', 'Phase', 'Photobleaching', 'Phototoxicity', 'Preparation', 'Process', 'Production', 'Rattus', 'Refractive Indices', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Societies', 'Specimen', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'Subcellular structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Tissues', 'Transgenic Animals', 'Translations', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Varicosity', 'base', 'brain research', 'design', 'ex vivo imaging', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'insight', 'microscopic imaging', 'multiphoton microscopy', 'neural network', 'neuropsychiatry', 'new technology', 'nonhuman primate', 'novel', 'off-patent', 'prototype', 'research and development', 'tool', 'treatment strategy', 'usability', 'user-friendly']",NIMH,"MICROBRIGHTFIELD, LLC",R44,2019,699967,0.009987390943002446
"Array-Compressed Parallel Transmission for High Resolution Neuroimaging at 7T Project Summary The goal of this project is to develop a framework for high-performance parallel transmission (pTx) that is trans- ferable to a wide range of MRI scanners, and apply it to push the spatial encoding limits of echo planar imaging (EPI) at 7 Tesla. EPI is by far the most widely used pulse sequence for rapid functional, diffusion, and perfusion imaging, and has been the focus of considerable development in recent years to increase its speed and spatial resolution. Now there is a strong desire to push EPI's spatial resolution down to the micro scale. For functional MRI (fMRI), this would enable imaging of ﬁne structures (layers, columns, and nuclei) of cortical and subcortical architecture while better resolving the hemodynamic response. For diffusion MRI (dMRI), micro scale EPI would improve surface and laminar analysis of ﬁbers in the cortex, as well as brain parcelation using fractional anisotropy differences between gray matter regions, while broadly reducing partial volume effects. It would further enable EPI to be broadly applied to accelerate anatomic scans that are geometrically matched to fMRI and dMRI scans. However, increasing the resolution of single-shot EPI requires longer readouts which extend echo times and re- duce functional contrast in fMRI and signal-to-noise in dMRI at 7 Tesla, while increasing geometric distortions and blurring. Segmented or multishot EPI is a classic method to increase spatial resolution without increasing readout durations, but is underutilized, primarily due to its high sensitivity to motion and dynamic phase changes between shots which cause large image artifacts.  We propose to develop a new multishot EPI technique called shuttered EPI, which addresses the lim- itations of conventional multishot EPI by imaging a set of spatially disjoint shutters in each shot. The shutters are produced by a multidimensional excitation pulse and are spatially shifted between shots to cover an entire slice. However, with thin slices the length of the excitation pulses are impractical (20-100 ms). Many-coil pTx (> 8 coils) can shorten the length of these pulses to feasible durations, but current 7 Tesla scanners have only 8 transmit channels due to cost, footprint, cabling, and other constraints. In the ﬁrst project period we pioneered a technique called array-compressed pTx (acpTx) which overcomes this limitation. Using acpTx, 8 transmit chan- nels can control an arbitrarily large number of coils, where the channels and coils are connected via an array compression network that is optimized with RF pulses for speciﬁc excitations. In this project, we will develop and apply acpTx methods and hardware (a many-coil head transmit array and an 8 channel-to-many coil array com- pression network) to achieve feasible RF pulse durations when exciting the shutter patterns required for shuttered EPI. These developments will be implemented on two major 7T scanner platforms and evaluated in submillimeter (600 micron) fMRI and dMRI acquisitions. Overall, the project encompasses the synergistic design of RF pulses, hardware, acquisitions and reconstructions to achieve a major advance in spatial encoding. Project Narrative Diffusion and functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at 7 Tesla ﬁeld strength using echo planar imaging (EPI) has the potential to deliver clear images of brain structure and function at the level of layers, columns, and nuclei. However, when existing EPI scans are pushed to the spatial resolutions required to resolve these structures, they become highly sensitive to off resonance-induced geometric distortions, relaxation-induced blur- ring, physiological noise and motion. To address this problem, in this project we will develop many-coil array- compressed parallel transmission and apply it to enable shuttered multishot EPI scans that are robust to these effects.",Array-Compressed Parallel Transmission for High Resolution Neuroimaging at 7T,9669022,R01EB016695,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Anisotropy', 'Architecture', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Dimensions', 'Echo-Planar Imaging', 'Elements', 'Fiber', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Homebound Persons', 'Image', 'Image Enhancement', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Length', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Noise', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Physiological', 'Problem Formulations', 'Relaxation', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Scanning', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Slice', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Thinness', 'Time', 'base', 'blood oxygen level dependent', 'cost', 'design', 'gray matter', 'hemodynamics', 'image reconstruction', 'improved', 'magnetic field', 'motion sensitivity', 'neuroimaging', 'perfusion imaging', 'phase change', 'reconstruction', 'response', 'simulation', 'spectroscopic imaging', 'time use', 'transmission process', 'virtual']",NIBIB,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,569563,0.022932902711448183
"Expanding field-of-view with reduced tissue displacement in micro-endoscopic computational imaging PROJECT SUMMARY Optical imaging methods are well-established in neuroscience, but high-speed, high- resolution volumetric imaging of neural activity in deep tissue remains a challenge. A number of techniques address limited aspects of this goal, and most are applicable primarily to acute preparations. We propose to develop and test a novel approach to achieve three-dimensional “deep-tissue” imaging for high spatial and temporal resolution neural recording by combining aspects of embedded optical probes with computational imaging techniques. Rather than use a single micro-endoscopic probe, we propose to utilize an array of narrower probes, or optrodes, to reduce the volume of tissue displacement. Computational imaging through each probe can be performed to achieve a field of view (FOV) at a desired distance from the probe tip. Combining the fields of view from multiple probes arranged in an array then provides a composite image field that is much larger than achievable from a single micro-endoscope. In our approach, each ∼0.1 mm diameter probe of the array acts as an independent micro- endoscope. In order to achieve full-field imaging across the array, the individual fields must intersect, and the computational method must be scaled to accommodate, and stitch, multiple fields. In pursuit of these goals, we propose three Aims: Optimizing the FOV of a single micro-endoscope - The purpose of this Aim is to characterize the FOV for an individual probe at multiple depths, and optimize the FOV to about 0.3mm through control over the shape of the probe tip and light collection numerical aperture. Accelerating calibration and reconstruction - In this Aim, we will pursue efficient computational approaches for calibration based upon ray-tracing simulations and image reconstruction based on deep learning. Scaling the FOV with an endoscope array - The computational image reconstruction method will be scaled to accommodate small micro-endoscope arrays (e.g. 4 element) arranged in a hexagonal lattice with FOV of 0.6mm at a 1.5mm depth. NARRATIVE Imaging deep inside tissue, including the brain, is critical to understanding various biological processes. Doing so through a small probe is also of primary importance for minimizing tissue damage. In this proposal, we apply computational techniques to create fluorescent images using an array of microscopic glass needles to guide light in and out of a mouse brain. The simplicity and small footprint of our system have the potential for deep-brain imaging (depths > 1.5 mm) across a large (mm) field of view, which should enable a wide variety of biological and neuroscience studies in the future.",Expanding field-of-view with reduced tissue displacement in micro-endoscopic computational imaging,9829467,R21EY030717,"['3-Dimensional', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Caliber', 'Calibration', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Computational Technique', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Confocal Microscopy', 'Coupled', 'Devices', 'Dimensions', 'Elements', 'Endoscopes', 'Fluorescence Microscopy', 'Fluorescent Probes', 'Future', 'Glass', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Holography', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Individual', 'Light', 'Methods', 'Microscope', 'Microscopic', 'Microscopy', 'Miniaturization', 'Mus', 'Needles', 'Neurosciences', 'Optics', 'Penetration', 'Preparation', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Scanning', 'Shapes', 'Source', 'Speed', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissue imaging', 'Tissues', 'Work', 'absorption', 'adaptive optics', 'attenuation', 'base', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'fluorescence imaging', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'interest', 'lens', 'microendoscope', 'multi-photon', 'neural circuit', 'novel strategies', 'optical fiber', 'optical imaging', 'reconstruction', 'relating to nervous system', 'retinal rods', 'simulation', 'temporal measurement']",NEI,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,R21,2019,456800,0.022432337495982203
"Quantitative Renal Imaging for Kidney Diseases Contrast Enhanced Magnetic Resonance Angiography (CEMRA) with gadolinium (Gd) provides high resolution visualization of the vascular compartment, but is rarely used in patients with advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD) (estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) < 30 mL/min/1.73m2) due to the risk of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF). There is thus an unmet need to develop MRI techniques that can both replace Gd and provide new insights into the etiology and severity of CKD.  PI Sridhar and his team at Northeastern University (NEU) have developed a new technique, Quantitative Ultra-short Time-to-Echo Contrast-Enhanced (QUTE-CE) MRI, leads to quantifiable positive contrast images of the vasculature with unprecedented clarity and definition. QUTE-CE is particularly optimal using Ferumoxytol (Feraheme), an FDA approved iron-oxide nanopharmaceutical, that is already routinely used for iron-deficient anemia therapy in CKD patients. Under an ongoing clinical trial (NCT03266848) we have demonstrated QUTE- CE MRI for renal and cerebral imaging in humans at 3T.  This R21 project will develop the QUTE-CE MRI method for kidney imaging in patients with both normal kidney function as well as with CKD. We propose to scan 25 total patients (10 in Year 1 and 15 in Year 2) who are already scheduled to receive ferumoxytol infusion for iron-deficiency anemia therapy. The specific aims of this project are summarized below. Specific Aim 1: Renal Vascular Angiograms of CKD Patients. These studies will be conducted at NEU and Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) using Siemens Prisma MRI scanners. Three tasks will be pursued to develop the optimizing protocol. Task 1: Develop a robust QUTE-CE imaging protocol. Task 2: Implement a robust methodology for accounting for B1 inhomogeneity. Task 3: Develop a robust trajectory for improved image reconstruction including motion correction. We hypothesize that QUTE-CE MRI will lead to high resolution angiograms that will allow for the safe diagnosis of existing pathologies such as renal artery stenosis in addition to the novel identification of kidney micro-vascular disease. Specific Aim 2: Obtain quantitative renal blood volume (RBV) maps and develop machine learning algorithms (MLA) to better understand the severity of kidney disease. The renal angiograms will be analyzed to obtain renal blood volume (RBV) maps. The RBV maps will be analyzed in terms of Machine-Learning algorithms (MLA) to explore whether we can identify common etiologies of CKD as well as estimate the severity of kidney disease. The MLA will enable organ segmentation, automatized renal parenchyma volumetry, as well as automated extraction and labeling of lesions. The MLA results will be compared with radiological scoring, estimated GFR, and degree of albuminuria. We hypothesize that the absolute RBV maps will enable quantitative monitoring of blood volume in cortex and medulla, and that RBV could be a surrogate parameter for renal microvascular rarefaction, a central mechanism in CKD initiation and progression. PROJECT NARRATIVE TITLE: Quantitative Renal Imaging for Kidney Disease This project will develop a quantitative magnetic resonance imaging technique QUTE-CE MRI for studies of chronic kidney disease (CKD).

"Rapid Robust Pediatric MRI Project Abstract Motivation: This is a competing renewal of our successful project, Rapid Robust Pediatric MRI, R01 EB009690. MRI offers superb soft tissue contrast for children, without the ionizing radiation and cancer risk of CT. However, MRI use has been limited due to long exams, low spatial resolution, and motion-artifacts. Thus, MRI often requires prolonged anesthesia with breath-holds and attendant risk; hence, children often lack the beneﬁts of cross-sectional imaging altogether or are exposed to ionizing radiation. The previous project addressed these concerns by creating a dedicated pediatric imaging system. Highly par- allel, high-SNR 3T receive coil arrays were designed and constructed speciﬁcally for pediatric body imaging. The high SNR was used to accelerate scans reconstructed with a combination of parallel imaging, new mo- tion correction algorithms, compressed sensing (CS), and higher dimensional imaging. The resulting system is now being used extensively in clinical practice, signiﬁcantly reducing anesthesia depth and duration, and has markedly increased our MRI utilization. Key technologies have been or are now being commercialized with GE Healthcare, including the pediatric receive array, CS, 4D ﬂow, full-Fourier single-shot T2-weighted scanning, and coil compression. Siemens has licensed ﬁve of our patents, implemented them in work-in-progress packages, and productized our coil compression and our ESPIRiT coil sensitivity estimation. Philips has licensed three of our patents. This ensures broad impact. Approach: Despite signiﬁcant progress and reduced anesthesia depth and duration, patient cooperation re- mains the main limitation to eliminate anesthesia in all pediatric body MRI exams. Many children will cooperate for several minutes, but then ﬁdget and get out of the scanner. Others are content until acoustic noise agi- tates them. Therefore the major emphasis now is greater exam execution speed, comprehensive elimination of acoustic noise, and increased robustness, particularly to contrast agent injection. The project has three interrelated development aims, validated by clinical studies. Aim 1 will enable fast 2D imag- ing for quiet T2 and quiet low-distortion diffusion weighted imaging. A second aim is to develop free-breathing 3D contrast-enhanced and diffusion-weighted imaging that is silent and motion-robust. The third aim will enable au- tomated, smart scanning to speed the exam execution and adaptive protocols to increase the exam robustness. The impact of all of these developments in the clinic will then be assessed to assess the resulting reduction of anesthesia. Signiﬁcance: This work will lead to fast, robust, broadly-applicable pediatric MRI protocols with less anes- thesia, making MRI safer, cheaper, and more available to children. MRI will be transformed into a workhorse modality, reducing CT radiation burden. The techniques will facilitate wide application in the community setting and permit new MRI applications, for both pediatric and adult diseases. Project Narrative Pediatric MRI often requires anesthesia. After considerable progress reducing the depth and duration of anes- thesia, this work aims to reduce the frequency of anesthesia through a synergistic combination of fast, quiet, motion-robust, automated, and adaptive scanning. This will make MRI safer, cheaper, and more widely available to children, reducing the population risk of radiation from CT.",Rapid Robust Pediatric MRI,9754130,R01EB009690,"['3-Dimensional', 'Acoustics', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Anesthesia procedures', 'Body part', 'Bolus Infusion', 'Breathing', 'Child', 'Child Health', 'Childhood', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Computational Technique', 'Consumption', 'Contrast Media', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Quality', 'Development', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Ensure', 'Exposure to', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Image', 'Image Compression', 'Image Enhancement', 'Injections', 'Ionizing radiation', 'Legal patent', 'Letters', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Motivation', 'Noise', 'Patients', 'Pediatric Oncology', 'Pediatrics', 'Population', 'Protocols documentation', 'Radiation', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Running', 'Scanning', 'Speed', 'System', 'T2 weighted imaging', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Time', 'Transplantation', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'cancer risk', 'clinical practice', 'clinical translation', 'community setting', 'compliance behavior', 'contrast enhanced', 'design and construction', 'experience', 'high dimensionality', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging system', 'innovation', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'off-patent', 'patient tolerability', 'pediatric patients', 'programs', 'radiation risk', 'reconstruction', 'skills', 'soft tissue', 'volunteer']",NIBIB,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,683589,0.02731386948418208
"Development of Sodium Fluoride PET-MRI for Quantitative Assessment of Knee Osteoarthritis Project Summary Osteoarthritis (OA) is the leading cause of disability worldwide. The inability of non-invasive techniques to quantify disease progression has limited understanding of the pathogenesis of OA. While numerous magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) methods have been proposed for imaging OA, sensitivity to bone metabolism has been limited. We propose to develop advanced three-dimensional PET-MRI methods for bone and soft tissue metabolism to study the response of the tissues in the joint to changes in knee load. This work will lead to a new understanding of OA pathogenesis by revealing relationships between changes in cartilage and bone metabolism over time. This project aims to develop PET-MRI methods to sensitively track changes of OA in response to biomechanical loading. Our specific aims are to (1) Develop accurate, reproducible and dose-optimized kinetic models of dynamic 18F-NaF PET-MRI for quantitative bilateral whole joint imaging using deep learning and advanced MR coil technology, (2) Study the relationship between resting state bone metabolism and biomechanics using PET- MRI and (3) Perform a longitudinal study to assess the response of our new imaging methods to changes in joint biomechanics from gait retraining. The innovation of this work lies in the development of novel imaging techniques that simultaneously offer quantitative measures of tissue physiology in cartilage and bone using PET-MRI. The significance of this work is that we will be able to sensitively and quantitatively track changes in bone metabolism and soft tissue microstructure due to changes in biomechanical loading in the knee joint over time. This will provide new and more sensitive imaging tools to assess the responses of the joint to biomechanical interventions to treat OA such as gait retraining, bracing, or high tibial osteotomy. Narrative Osteoarthritis affects more than half of the population during their lives and is the leading cause of disability worldwide. Diagnostic imaging of osteoarthritis is often limited to x-ray, but more sensitive and specific imaging is a critical need for assessment of disease-modifying treatments such as bracing or gait modification. This work aims to develop novel 3D imaging approaches using positron-emission tomography (PET) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), to quantitatively assess joint health during mechanical treatment of osteoarthritis. !",Development of Sodium Fluoride PET-MRI for Quantitative Assessment of Knee Osteoarthritis,9817807,R01AR074492,"['Affect', 'Anatomy', 'Architecture', 'Arthralgia', 'Bilateral', 'Biochemical', 'Biomechanics', 'Bone Matrix', 'Bone Spur', 'Bone Tissue', 'Bone remodeling', 'Cartilage', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Degenerative polyarthritis', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Dose', 'Environment', 'Fluoride Ion', 'Future', 'Gait', 'Health', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Imaging Device', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Imaging technology', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Kinetics', 'Knee', 'Knee Osteoarthritis', 'Knee joint', 'Lateral', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Medial', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Morphology', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Needs Assessment', 'Orthopedics', 'Osteotomy', 'Pain', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Perfusion', 'Photons', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Process', 'Productivity', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quality of life', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Risk Factors', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Sclerosis', 'Severities', 'Shapes', 'Sodium Fluoride', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Tracer', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Work', 'analysis pipeline', 'attenuation', 'base', 'bone', 'bone metabolism', 'cartilage metabolism', 'clinical translation', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'disability', 'extracellular', 'flexibility', 'gait examination', 'gait retraining', 'imaging approach', 'imaging capabilities', 'imaging modality', 'imaging system', 'improved', 'innovation', 'joint loading', 'mechanical force', 'mechanical properties', 'mineralization', 'molecular marker', 'non-invasive imaging', 'novel', 'novel imaging technique', 'pharmacokinetic model', 'quantitative imaging', 'radiotracer', 'response', 'soft tissue', 'subchondral bone', 'tool', 'treatment strategy', 'uptake']",NIAMS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,561592,0.016813903531840983
"Genetic Modulators of Glaucoma Glaucoma is the leading cause of irreversible blindness in the world. While elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) is a major risk factor, damage and death of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) underlies visual field loss. However, a thorough understanding of this disease is a major challenge because its genetic basis is heterogeneous and it represents a family of age-related disorders resulting from intersecting gene-regulated pathophysiologic networks. We propose to continue to use the BXD (C57BL/6 x DBA/2J) family of recombinant inbred (RI) lines of mice as a genetic reference panel (GRP) and to combine our work with human genome wide association studies (GWAS), to uncover and clarify the genetic heterogeneity that underlies optic nerve (ON) damage. We have had recent success using this combined approach in the regulation of intraocular pressure (IOP). We are very well positioned to take the next step and apply this approach to define cellular targets of RGC damage and death. We propose to uncover phenotypic diversities of glaucoma-related ON damage and uncover common underlying mechanisms that are shared with IOP modulation. Our long-term research goal is to identify disease mechanisms and develop neuroprotective therapies to preserve retinal health in patients at risk for glaucoma. Our overall objective is to identify novel gene products and related mechanisms that lead to glaucomatous endophenotypes using multi-dimensional genetic analyses, cross-species comparisons (mouse, rat and human) and validation using novel murine glaucoma models. Our central hypothesis is that molecular processes leading to glaucoma associated-endophenotypes, such as elevated IOP and ON damage, are shared across species, and that species comparisons can uncover common underlying mechanisms, and efficient testing of targeted glaucoma therapeutics. In the current investigation, we perform a systematic analysis of ON damage, and an additional species—rat. We will mine the extensive databases of IOP and ON damage that we are generating for more than 70 BXD strains across five age cohorts with the goal of defining new models of glaucoma. An overall strength of this proposal is the combination of cutting-edge systems genetics methods, species comparisons of glaucoma phenotypes, and a strong interdisciplinary team that includes investigators with extensive experience in systems genetics, glaucoma, GWAS in human and rats, and advanced computational methods. To test our hypothesis, we will perform the following thress studies: 1) Identify the candidate gene on chromosome 12 that modulates ON damage; 2) Determine if modulation of IOP and/or ON damage is shared across rodent species; and 3) Identify novel spontaneous glaucoma models through a comprehensive analysis of our enlarged BXD GRP of 100 or more BXD strains. The outcomes of these studies will define novel genes and molecular networks that underlie glaucoma-associated phenotypes and also provide unique glaucoma models for future analysis. These results are expected to fundamentally advance the field of glaucoma disease mechanisms and enable targeted therapeutic development. Glaucoma is the leading cause of irreversible blindness in the world and a thorough understanding of this disease is a major challenge because its genetic basis is heterogeneous, and it likely represents a family of disorders resulting from intersecting gene-regulated pathophysiologic pathways.

"Multiband ASL for Neurodevelopment Study Project Summary/Abstract The developmental period between childhood to adolescence and young adulthood is marked by a mix of potential and vulnerability. A number of potentially life-long behavioral and emotional problems emerge during this critical period, including alcohol and illicit drug use, risky behaviors, and the first signs of emotional disorders. It is important to understand detailed patterns of typical development, so alterations can be identified and rectified as early as possible. As an entirely noninvasive and quantitative imaging method, arterial spin labeled (ASL) perfusion MRI is increasingly being recognized as an important biomarker for functional brain development in both healthy populations and neurodevelopmental disorders. However, there remain significant challenges for making ASL an impactful tool in studying neurodevelopment, including: 1) a coarse spatial resolution of ~4x4x4mm3, 2) susceptibility to head motion with segmented 3D acquisitions, and 3) potential confounding effects of age dependent variations in arterial transit time using a single post-labeling delay (PLD) scan. Simultaneous multi-slice (SMS) or multiband (MB) is a new accelerated imaging technology that simultaneously excites multiple slices and recovers each slice with parallel imaging techniques. Preliminary studies combining MB with ASL showed that MB can reduce T1 relaxation of the label, improve spatial coverage and/or resolution compared to those of standard 2D ASL. MB imaging may also overcome the limitation of 3D ASL acquisitions in terms of head motion and spatial blurring. However, the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of existing MB ASL is inferior to that of 3D ASL. This project builds on two recent innovations from our lab: 1) a constrained slice-dependent (CSD) background suppression (BS) technique that improves the SNR of 2D MB pCASL to be comparable to that of 3D pCASL; and 2) a single-shot 3D GRASE pCASL method with 2D CAIPIRINHA accelerations that improves the imaging speed of 3D pCASL. The goal of this R01 project is to develop and evaluate cutting-edge MB pCASL protocols that are able to offer a high spatial resolution of isotropic 2mm or higher, resistance to head motion and multi-delay capability for accurate perfusion quantification in pediatric populations. A convolutional neural network (CNN) based denoising algorithm for multi-delay MB pCASL will be further developed. The developed suite of MB pCASL protocol and post- processing algorithms will be evaluated in 40 typically developing children and adolescents. The successful completion of this R01 project will lead to a robust multi-delay MB pCASL protocol that is highly valuable as potential biomarker for both neurodevelopment research and pediatric clinical care. To maximize the scientific and clinical impact, we will continue disseminating the pulse sequence and associated post-processing software as we have been doing in the past decade. Relevance to Public Health A number of potentially life-long behavioral and emotional problems emerge during the developmental period between childhood to adolescence and young adulthood, including alcohol and illicit drug use, risky behaviors, and emotional disorders.

"3-D Imaging Flow Cytometry PROJECT SUMMARY This project aims to develop and test two innovative platforms and related software for 3-D imaging flow cytometry of fluorescent or absorbing (stained) samples. These systems will allow 3-D structural and functional imaging of many single cells at a subcellular resolution and at a scale that used to be available only in flow cytometry or recently in 2-D imaging. Thereby, the proposed methods have the potential to fundamentally change the ways cultured cells, patient-derived samples, and small experimental organisms are studied. Automated classification based on the 3-D features will enable the diagnosis of hematologic disorders at single-cell precision. Existing 3-D microscopy methods can provide the same information at higher resolution; however, by relying on a scanning mechanism they cannot be applied to suspending cells, especially in a flow configuration, which is essential for high-speed interrogation. Snapshot 3-D microscopy techniques have been developed to address this challenge, but they have insufficient spatial resolution for single-cell imaging and suffer from long data processing time. We overcome these limitations by combining two novel snapshot techniques developed by the PI with the most rigorous optical imaging theories and cutting-edge component technologies. We will use an array of lenslets, which simultaneously records many projection images corresponding with different viewing angles. The use of pupil phase masks, designed using wavefront coding and a theory of 3-D high-numerical-aperture optical imaging, will increase the resolution of each projection image to the theoretical limit given by the objective-lens numerical aperture. The target resolution is 0.5 µm, which is comparable to existing 2-D imaging flow cytometry systems. The target imaging throughputs based on current component technologies are 120 volumes/sec for fluorescence imaging and 700 volumes/sec for absorption imaging, which are higher than 100 volumes/sec of cutting-edge 3-D optical microscopy for stationary specimens. The vast amount of data acquired by these 3-D imaging systems imposes a serious challenge to data processing. The developed systems record true projection images, which obviate iterative deconvolution process, thereby allowing much faster tomographic reconstruction than in existing snapshot techniques. Using general-purpose graphics processing units and optical diffraction tomography, which includes the diffraction of light by subcellular organelles, our tomographic reconstruction algorithm will be faster yet more accurate than existing approaches. Further, we will explore the feasibility of applying a deep convolutional neural network to the images acquired by the developed systems for accurate single-cell classification based on 3-D features. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project aims to develop 3-D imaging flow cytometry platforms for fluorescent or absorbing (stained) cells at high resolution and high throughput in a flow configuration. The developed systems will be built upon two novel snapshot 3-D techniques developed by the PI in combination with most rigorous 3-D optical imaging theories and cutting-edge component technologies.

"A novel multi-modal, multi-scale imaging pipeline for the validation of diffusion MRI of the brain Project Summary  In this project, we propose to validate and characterize ﬁber orientation estimation from diffusion tensor imag- ing (DTI) through the optimization of a multi-modality, multi-scale imaging pipeline for whole mouse brains. DTI is a powerful tool used to noninvasively report 3D microstructural properties of nervous tissue on a macroscopic scale, and has played an important role in the understanding and diagnosis of a number of neurological disease processes. Modern acquisitions of DTI data can be processed to generate a 3D diffusion proﬁle known as an orientation diffusion function (ODF) at each voxel. The ODF is used to infer the orientation of local axon ﬁber pop- ulations. Previous efforts to validate these orientation estimates have primarily relied on serial optical histology as a ground truth dataset. Histology-based pipelines involve the labor intensive task of physically sectioning the tissue into thin slices, leading to physical destruction of the sample and anisotropic resolution. These limitations potentially confound the accuracy of 3D orientation estimation, complicate the process of spatially registering the ground-truth and DTI datasets, and limit quantitative comparisons to select regions of interest (ROI) across the brain sample.  In recent years, synchrotron x-ray microcomputed tomography (microCT) has emerged as a powerful tool for high-resolution tissue imaging. With a mosaic projection-stitching method, a whole mouse brain can be imaged at an isotropic, 3D resolution of 1.2 microns after prior imaging with DTI. To enhance microCT contrast, the tis- sue specimens are ﬁxed and stained with the same kind of metal-based stains used in electron microscopy (EM) prior to embedding in resin. We will optimize this microCT-EM validation pipeline to address the limitations of pre- vious histology-based studies, and characterize DTI algorithm performance across a whole mouse brain using micron- to nano-scale neurological information.  The speciﬁc aims of the proposal are: (1) model phase contrast to optimize microCT data acquisition, (2) vali- date DTI ODF reconstruction methods using ground-truth microCT (3) characterize DTI performance using under- lying tissue microstructure information from EM. Upon completion, aim 1 will generate a novel theoretical model and acquisition strategy to exploit microCT phase contrast in strongly absorbing biological samples. Aim 2 will generate a ground-truth dataset of ODFs across a whole mouse brain, which will be used to calculate algorithm- speciﬁc spatial maps of DTI performance. In Aim 3, around 20 ROI will be selected for nano-scale imaging with EM, and DTI performance will be characterized by quantitative features of the underlying neural architecture. These results will provide an unprecedented microstructure-driven understanding of the DTI signal, allowing fu- ture studies to develop more advanced DTI models and acquisition strategies to better leverage ﬁber orientation and connectivity information in the treatment of neurological disease. Project Narrative The goal of the proposed research is to use synchrotron x-ray microcomputed tomography and serial electron microscopy to validate diffusion MRI reconstruction methods. This unprecedented pipeline allows for imaging the same tissue across scales ranging from hundreds of microns to tens of nanometers. The high resolution modalities will provide insight into the true neurological microstructure driving the diffusion MRI signal, leading to better modeling and increased clinical and research utility.","A novel multi-modal, multi-scale imaging pipeline for the validation of diffusion MRI of the brain",9836456,F31NS113571,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Architecture', 'Automobile Driving', 'Axon', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical Research', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Electron Microscopy', 'Failure', 'Fiber', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Heavy Metals', 'Histologic', 'Histology', 'Image', 'Imaging Device', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Metals', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Morphology', 'Mosaicism', 'Mus', 'Nerve Tissue', 'Neurologic', 'Optics', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Plant Resins', 'Play', 'Population', 'Process', 'Property', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Scheme', 'Signal Transduction', 'Slice', 'Specificity', 'Specimen', 'Stains', 'Structure', 'Synchrotrons', 'Techniques', 'Theoretical model', 'Thick', 'Thinness', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Time', 'Tissue imaging', 'Tissues', 'Validation', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'absorption', 'base', 'contrast enhanced', 'data acquisition', 'electron tomography', 'follow-up', 'image reconstruction', 'insight', 'interest', 'multimodality', 'nanometer', 'nanoscale', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'reconstruction', 'relating to nervous system', 'success', 'tomography', 'tool', 'tractography', 'validation studies']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,F31,2019,39994,0.009486629307314772
"Aging eyes and aging brains in studying alzheimer's disease: Modern ophthalmic data collection in the adult changes in thought (ACT) study PROJECT SUMMARY ABSTRACT The overarching goals of this R01 proposal are to improve scientific understanding of potential mechanisms by which ophthalmic diseases lead to the risk of Alzheimer’s disease. The investigators will leverage modern ophthalmic data with state-of-the-art imaging and extensive archived clinical data from a well-characterized cohort of older adults. The investigators propose to examine the effect of structural and functional changes in retina and longitudinal severity of ophthalmic diseases on Alzheimer’s disease and related neuropathology. The proposal builds on the resources of the Adult Changes in Thought (ACT) study, a prospective longitudinal, population-based, dementia-free cohort of over 5,500 people to date established in 1994 which has detected >1,014 research quality diagnoses of Alzheimer’s disease and >1,254 dementia to date. ACT follows consenting participants to autopsy and has performed state-of-the arts autopsy on >781 decedents to date. In this extremely well-characterized cohort, the investigators found that several ophthalmic diseases (diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma, age-related macular degeneration) are significantly associated with the risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease. The investigators will use three advanced ophthalmic imaging modalities at both home and clinical research study visits: fundus photography, optical coherence tomography (OCT), and OCT angiography (OCTA), to obtain quantitative data relevant to these ophthalmic diseases. The study team will establish the distribution (Aim 1a) and 2- and 4-year evolution of ophthalmic imaging characteristics found in older adults in the community and determine associations with change in cognition (Aim 1 b, c). Additionally, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and MRI angiography (MRA) will be obtained in a subset of participants to investigate the contribution of small (retinal) and large (cerebral) vascular disease towards cognitive changes (Aim 1d). The study team will continue ACT study’s strong commitment for meaningful data sharing. In collaboration with the Laboratory of Neuro Imaging at University of Southern California, the study team will promulgate these ophthalmic data in addition to neuroimaging data to the research community (Aim 1e). In Aim 2, the investigators will use extensive clinical ophthalmology data captured over many decades and incorporate them in novel longitudinal models of eye disease severity. The investigators will analyze eye disease severity along with extensive neuropathology data from the ACT study, including both standard (Aim 2a) and novel quantitative (Aim 2b) neuropathology data, to further scientific understanding of neuropathological mechanisms underlying associations between eye conditions and Alzheimer’s disease risk. The brain is not amenable to direct observations during life. In contrast, the eye is an anterior extension of the central nervous system and may provide a valuable window to illuminate neurodegenerative processes in the aging brain. Proposed investigations will substantially enhance scientific understanding of the role of modern ophthalmic evaluations in delineating risk of Alzheimer's disease and other forms of neuropathology. PROJECT NARRATIVE Using a large, well-characterized, longitudinal, prospective, cohort study, the study team previously found that diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma, and age-related macular degeneration were significantly associated with Alzheimer’s disease risk. The team proposes to use three cutting edge ophthalmic imaging modalities to obtain quantitative data at both home and clinic research study visits in addition to MRI and MRA in a subset of participants to evaluate their associations with change in cognition over time (Aim 1). The team will leverage extensive ophthalmic clinical and neuropathological data already available for 781 study participants to date as well as new state-of-the-art quantitative measures of beta amyloid (A1-42) and phosphorylated tau to elucidate mechanisms underlying associations between ophthalmic conditions and Alzheimer’s disease (Aim 2).",Aging eyes and aging brains in studying alzheimer's disease: Modern ophthalmic data collection in the adult changes in thought (ACT) study,9816310,R01AG060942,"['Abbreviations', 'Adult', 'Age related macular degeneration', 'Age-associated memory impairment', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Amyloid beta-Protein', 'Angiography', 'Anterior', 'Archives', 'Autopsy', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Vessels', 'Brain', 'California', 'Cerebrovascular Disorders', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognition', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Consent', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Dementia', 'Diabetic Retinopathy', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Drusen', 'Elderly', 'Evaluation', 'Evolution', 'Eye', 'Eye diseases', 'Fundus', 'Fundus photography', 'Ganglion Cell Layer', 'Glaucoma', 'Goals', 'Home environment', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Investigation', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Magnetic Resonance Angiography', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Microvascular Dysfunction', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Nerve Fibers', 'Neuraxis', 'Occipital lobe', 'Ophthalmology', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Participant', 'Pathology', 'Perfusion', 'Persons', 'Predisposition', 'Process', 'Prospective cohort study', 'Provider', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Retina', 'Retinal', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Selection Bias', 'Series', 'Severities', 'Severity of illness', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Universities', 'Vascular Diseases', 'Visit', 'aging brain', 'area striata', 'base', 'cognitive change', 'cohort', 'data sharing', 'deep learning', 'diagnosis quality', 'epidemiology study', 'fiber cell', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropathology', 'novel', 'paired helical filament', 'population based', 'prospective', 'repository', 'research study', 'resilience', 'spelling', 'tau Proteins', 'tau-1', 'vascular contributions']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2019,3869686,-0.048629584263033904
"Advanced MR Imaging and Image Analytics as a Precision Medicine Tool to Manage ADPKD ABSTRACT The goal of this NIDDK Mentored Research Scientist Development Award is to provide an organized scientific and educational environment for Dr. Timothy Kline to begin his transition into an independent research career focused on developing novel imaging technologies and image analysis techniques for abdominal organ pathologies. This proposal outlines a five-year training plan at Mayo Clinic under the primary mentorship of Dr. Bradley Erickson and a Mentoring Team comprised of accomplished researchers in the fields of: biology, nephrology, genetics, radiology, informatics; medical physics, biostatistics, image processing, and physiology. The focus of this proposal is to improve both research studies and disease prognosis for autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) patients through biomedical imaging techniques. It is well understood that imaging is essential for ADPKD diagnosis, monitoring, and outcome prediction. Clinical studies utilize total kidney volume (TKV) (as measured by MRI as an image-based biomarker) to follow the progression of ADPKD, as larger TKVs have been shown to correlate with worse prognosis in both human and animal-model studies. However, there are challenges with using TKV as a marker of disease progression. For one, it is a simplification of the disease state and does not inform on microscopic disease processes that are involved with piecemeal destruction of healthy renal tissue. In addition, measurements of TKVs are time consuming, costly, and poorly standardized. The introduction of automated approaches for measuring TKV will: greatly improve measurement throughput, significantly reduce costs associated with performing research studies, allow accurate and reproducible measurements to be obtained both within and across institutions; facilitate the search for new imaging biomarkers. The specific aims of this project are to: (i) develop and validate automated tools to characterize renal structure, such as TKV and cystic burden; (ii) explore new imaging biomarkers by image texture feature analysis and pattern recognition techniques; and (iii) develop a new technique to measure renal blood flow. This research will be facilitated by Mayo Clinic's outstanding clinical and research environment dedicated to improving patient care, as well as the Mayo Clinic Translational PKD Center, which focuses on translating basic science research into improvements in the management and treatment of ADPKD patients. Dr. Kline's background in imaging technologies and image processing makes him particularly suited to perform this research. In addition to the above aims, Dr. Kline will: 1) develop a strong knowledge base in both nephrology and radiology by attending relevant rounds, seminars, and national conferences; 2) enhance his knowledge of medical imaging, biology, physiology, genetics, and programming through coursework and mentoring; 3) attend workshops focused on grant and publication writing; and 4) submit a highly competitive R01 application expanding upon the findings from this research proposal. This proposal will lead to vast improvements to current analysis workflows, as well as an improved understanding of the prognostic power of new imaging biomarkers of ADPKD. Obtaining this K Award will greatly facilitate Dr. Kline's transition into a prosperous independent research career. Narrative Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is one of the most common monogenic disorders and is a leading cause of end-stage renal disease. Total kidney volume (TKV) has become the main image-based biomarker for following ADPKD progression. However, there are challenges with using TKV as a marker of disease progression. For one, it is a simplification of the disease state and does not inform on microscopic disease processes that are involved with piecemeal destruction of healthy renal tissue. In addition, measurements of TKVs are time consuming and costly. This project will develop automated tools to increase measurement throughput, and explore new image-based biomarkers that will significantly add to the assessment of patient prognosis, and will have the ability to more quickly judge the effectiveness of interventions.",Advanced MR Imaging and Image Analytics as a Precision Medicine Tool to Manage ADPKD,9782929,K01DK110136,"['3-Dimensional', 'Abdomen', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Anatomy', 'Animals', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney', 'Basic Science', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Biometry', 'Blood Vessels', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Research', 'Consumption', 'Cyst', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Disease Marker', 'Disease Progression', 'Educational workshop', 'Effectiveness of Interventions', 'End stage renal failure', 'Environment', 'FarGo', 'Fibrosis', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Programming', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Grant', 'Hepatic Cyst', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Imaging technology', 'Informatics', 'Institution', 'Intervention', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Kidney', 'Knowledge', 'Liver', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Mendelian disorder', 'Mentored Research Scientist Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Microscopic', 'Monitor', 'National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases', 'Nephrology', 'Organ', 'Pathology', 'Patient Care', 'Patient imaging', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Performance', 'Perfusion', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physics', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Physiology', 'Polycystic Kidney Diseases', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publications', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Renal Blood Flow', 'Renal Tissue', 'Renal function', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Proposals', 'Resolution', 'Spin Labels', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Study models', 'Suggestion', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Treatment Effectiveness', 'Writing', 'base', 'bioimaging', 'career', 'clinical practice', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'disease diagnosis', 'educational atmosphere', 'functional decline', 'human model', 'image processing', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'insight', 'interest', 'kidney vascular structure', 'knowledge base', 'novel imaging technology', 'outcome forecast', 'outcome prediction', 'precision medicine', 'pressure', 'prognostic value', 'radiological imaging', 'renal artery', 'research study', 'shear stress', 'symposium', 'tool']",NIDDK,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,K01,2019,154915,0.0295009573866628
"Learning an Optimized Variational Network for Medical Image Reconstruction Project Summary We propose a novel way of reconstructing medical images rooted in deep learning and computer vision that models the process how human radiologists are using years of experience from reading thousands of cases to recognize anatomical structures, pathologies and image artifacts. Our approach is based on the novel idea of a variational network, which embeds a generalized compressed sensing concept within a deep learning framework. We propose to learn a complete reconstruction procedure, including filter kernels and penalty functions to separate between true image content and artifacts, all parameters that normally have to be tuned manually as well as the associated numerical algorithm described by this variational network. The training step is decoupled from the time critical image reconstruction step, which can then be performed in near-real-time without interruption of clinical workflow. Our preliminary patient data from accelerated magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) acquisitions suggest that our learning approach outperforms the state-of-the-art of currently existing image reconstruction methods and is robust with respect to the variations that arise in a daily clinical imaging situation. In our first aim, we will test the hypothesis that learning can be performed such that it is robust against changes in data acquisition. In the second aim, we will answer the question if it is possible to learn a single reconstruction procedure for multiple MR imaging applications. Finally, we will perform a clinical reader study for 300 patients undergoing imaging for internal derangement of the knee. We will compare our proposed approach to a clinical standard reconstruction. Our hypothesis is that our approach will lead to the same clinical diagnosis and patient management decisions when using a 5min exam. The immediate benefit of the project is to bring accelerated imaging to an application with wide public-health impact, thereby improving clinical outcomes and reducing health-care costs. Additionally, the insights gained from the developments in this project will answer the currently most important open questions in the emerging field of machine learning for medical image reconstruction. Finally, given the recent increase of activities in this field, there is a significant demand for a publicly available data repository for raw k-space data that can be used for training and validation. Since all data that will be acquired in this project will be made available to the research community, this project will be a first step to meet this demand. Project Narrative The overarching goal of the proposal is to develop a novel machine learning-based image reconstruction approach and validate it for accelerated magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The approach is able to learn the characteristic appearance of clinical imaging datasets, as well as suppression of artifacts that arise during data acquisition. We will test the hypotheses that learning can be performed such that it is robust against changes in data acquisition, answer the question if it is possible to learn a single reconstruction procedure for multiple MR imaging applications, and validate our approach in a clinical reader study for 300 patients undergoing imaging for internal derangement of the knee.",Learning an Optimized Variational Network for Medical Image Reconstruction,9521289,R01EB024532,"['Acceleration', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Appearance', 'Area', 'Blinded', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Protocols', 'Communities', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Evaluation Studies', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Interruption', 'Joints', 'Knee', 'Learning', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manuals', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Motivation', 'Musculoskeletal', 'Neurologic', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Plant Roots', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Reader', 'Reading', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Step training', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Touch sensation', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'base', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinical imaging', 'clinical translation', 'conditioning', 'cost', 'data acquisition', 'data space', 'data warehouse', 'deep learning', 'experience', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'indexing', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'novel', 'pathology imaging', 'patient population', 'performance tests', 'prospective', 'radiologist', 'reconstruction', 'research clinical testing']",NIBIB,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R01,2018,471965,0.010428297451690046
"MRI near Total Joint replacements Project Abstract Overview: The parent project for this supplement aims to provide routine MRI of subjects with total joint replacements by reducing the severe image artifacts near metal, while offering highly efficient patient-specific scans that can detect bone loss, infection, and temperature changes near the implant in clinically feasible scan times. The supplement aims to incorporate deep learning techniques to better meet the parent grant goals. Relevance: Total joint replacements are one of the most successful orthopedic procedures, used annually to reduce pain from joint diseases in about one million patients in the United States (a number projected to double by 2030). However, about 10% of joint replacements fail in 5-10 years due to bone loss (osteolysis), infection, or other complications, often leading to revision surgery. Accurate, early, non-invasive assessment of complications remains limited, but would offer earlier and less invasive treatments, reduce unnecessary surgery, or allow better surgical planning. Approach: Prior to, and during the parent grant period, we have developed novel “multi-spectral imaging” (MSI) MRI techniques that allow visualization of pathology adjacent to metallic implants, and together with other groups have successfully applied them to imaging of patients with devices including joint replacements and spinal fixation hardware. However these methods remain slow, have limited spatial resolution, and are challenging to use routinely. The recent growth of the machine learning field including convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and its application to medical imaging offers unique opportunities to substantially improve MRI near metal, and specifically the goals of the parent grant. We propose 3 small, independent aims in the supplement: (1) to bring fast, isotropic imaging near metal to clinical practice by using CNN-based methods to reduce reconstruction times to under 30 seconds, (2) to improve image quality away from metal by using a new reconstruction and CNN to avoid needing standard imaging in addition to MSI methods and (3) to reduce background-gradient induced artifacts near to metal using a CNN-based approach to enable better diagnosis of abnormalities adjacent to metal. Summary: We aim to supplement our parent grant with CNN-based approaches to speed up scanning and image reconstruction, and to improve image quality near to and way from metal. These techniques will allow routine, non-invasive evaluation for earlier and more accurate detection and treatment of complications in these patients, as well as numerous other applications of MRI near metal implants. Project Narrative There is a growing need for accurate diagnosis of complications surrounding joint arthroplasty, where MRI would provide excellent contrast if not for the fact that the presence of metal severely degrades images. Building on recent ideas in MRI and deep learning, we propose to develop practical methods for routine clinical imaging of patients with metal implants by increasing speed as well as offering image contrast that shows infection and other complications near the metal devices. Ultimately these methods will be tested and offered for widespread use to enable earlier and better treatment of complications resulting from arthroplasty, as well as for better understanding of the implications of different devices.",MRI near Total Joint replacements,9750463,R01EB017739,"['Address', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Direct Costs', 'Evaluation', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Gray unit of radiation dose', 'Growth', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Implant', 'Infection', 'Joint repair', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Medical Imaging', 'Metals', 'Methods', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Network-based', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Orthopedic Procedures', 'Osteolysis', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Protocols documentation', 'Replacement Arthroplasty', 'Residual state', 'Resolution', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Slice', 'Speed', 'Spinal', 'Stretching', 'Techniques', 'Temperature', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States', 'Unnecessary Surgery', 'Variant', 'Vendor', 'Work', 'accurate diagnosis', 'arthropathies', 'bone loss', 'clinical imaging', 'clinical practice', 'cluster computing', 'contrast imaging', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'field study', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging approach', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'metallicity', 'novel', 'pain reduction', 'parent grant', 'parent project', 'reconstruction', 'response', 'sample fixation', 'spectrograph']",NIBIB,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,156870,0.012693119218870192
"Machine Learning Methods for Detecting Disease-related Functional and Structural Change in Glaucoma PROJECT SUMMARY This project aims to apply novel machine learning techniques to recently developed optical imaging measurement to improve the accurate prediction and detection of glaucomatous progression. Complex functional and structural tests in daily use by eye care providers contain hidden information that is not fully used in current analyses, and advanced pattern recognition/machine learning-based analysis techniques can find and use that hidden information. We will use mathematically rigorous techniques to discover patterns of defects and to track their changes in longitudinal series of perimetric and optical imaging data from up to 1,800 patient and healthy eyes, available as the result of long-term NIH funding. We also will investigate deep learning and novel statistical techniques for this purpose. The required longitudinal measurements from several newly developed optical imaging techniques were not available to our previously funded NEI- supported work. The proposed work potentially can enhance significantly the medical and surgical treatment of glaucoma and reduce the cost of glaucoma care by informing clinical decision-making based on mathematically based, externally validated methods. Moreover, improved techniques for predicting and detecting glaucomatous progression can be used for refined subject recruitment and to define endpoints for clinical trials of intraocular pressure-lowering and neuroprotective drugs. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed project will improve machine learning techniques for predicting and detecting glaucomatous change in patient eyes tested longitudinally by visual field and optical imaging instruments and will make use of a very large amount of data, obtained using previously awarded NIH funds, to do so. This proposal addresses the current NEI Glaucoma and Optic Neuropathies Program objectives of developing improved diagnostic measures to characterize and detect optic nerve disease onset and characterize glaucomatous neuro- degeneration within the visual pathways at structural and functional levels. The development of a clinically useful novel, empirical system for predicting and detecting glaucomatous progression can have a significant impact on the future of clinical care and on the future of clinical trials designed to investigate IOP lowering and neuroprotective drugs.",Machine Learning Methods for Detecting Disease-related Functional and Structural Change in Glaucoma,9517942,R21EY027945,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Award', 'Caring', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Defect', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Eye', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gaussian model', 'Generations', 'Glaucoma', 'Goals', 'Health Personnel', 'Image', 'Imaging Device', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Instruction', 'Laboratories', 'Lasers', 'Machine Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Eye Institute', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neuroprotective Agents', 'Onset of illness', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Ophthalmoscopy', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Performance', 'Perimetry', 'Physiologic Intraocular Pressure', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Scanning', 'Science', 'Series', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Treatment Effectiveness', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'Vision research', 'Visual Fields', 'Visual Pathways', 'Work', 'base', 'care providers', 'clinical care', 'clinical decision-making', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'expectation', 'glaucoma test', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'independent component analysis', 'instrument', 'learning strategy', 'markov model', 'mathematical model', 'novel', 'optic nerve disorder', 'optical imaging', 'polarimetry', 'programs', 'recruit', 'retinal nerve fiber layer', 'tool']",NEI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R21,2018,193750,0.05768523858117626
"Functional and Structural Optical Coherence Tomography for Glaucoma PROJECT SUMMARY Glaucoma is a leading cause of blindness. Early diagnosis and close monitoring of glaucoma are important because the onset is insidious and the damage is irreversible. Advanced imaging modalities such as optical coherence tomography (OCT) have been used in the past 2 decades to improve the objective evaluation of glaucoma. OCT has higher axial spatial resolution than other posterior eye imaging modalities and can precisely measure neural structures. However, structural imaging alone has limited sensitivity for detecting early glaucoma and only moderate correlation with visual field (VF) loss. Using high-speed OCT systems, we have developed novel OCT angiography technologies to image vascular plexuses that supply the retinal nerve fibers and ganglion cells damaged by glaucoma. Our results showed that OCT angiographic parameters have better correlation with VF parameters. We have also found that measurement of focal and sectoral glaucoma damage using high-definition volumetric OCT angiographic and structural parameters improves diagnostic performance. The goal of the proposed project is to further improve the diagnosis and monitoring of glaucoma using ultrahigh-speed OCT and artificial intelligence machine learning techniques. The specific aims are: 1. Develop quantitative wide-field OCT angiography. We will develop a swept-source OCT prototype that  is 4 times faster than current commercial OCT systems. The higher speed will be used to fully sample the  neural structures and associated capillary plexuses damaged by glaucoma. 2. Simulate VF by combining structural and angiographic OCT. Preliminary results showed that both  structural and angiographic OCT parameters have high correlation with VF on a sector basis. It may be  possible to accurately simulate VF results by combining these parameters using an artificial neural  network. The simulated VF may be more precise and reliable than subjective VF testing. 3. Longitudinal clinical study in glaucoma diagnosis and monitoring. Our novel OCT structural and  angiographic parameters have high accuracy in diagnosing glaucoma. Neural network analysis of structural  and angiographic data from a larger clinical study could further improve diagnostic accuracy. Longitudinal  follow-up will assess if simulated VF could monitor disease progression as well as actual VF. 4. Clinical study to assess the effects of glaucoma treatments. Preliminary results suggest that OCT  angiography could detect the improvement in capillary density after glaucoma surgery and the effects of  drugs. These intriguing effects will be tested in before-and-after comparison studies. If successful, we will have an OCT diagnostic system that in minutes provides objective information on the location and severity of glaucoma damage. This approach could replace time-consuming and unreliable VF testing. Measuring the improvement in retinal circulation could be a quicker way to detect the benefit of glaucoma therapies that work through neuroprotection or regeneration, compared to monitoring VF. PROJECT NARRATIVE Optical coherence tomography is a high-resolution imaging technology that can non-invasively measure both the eye structures and small blood vessels that are damaged by glaucoma, a leading cause of blindness. The proposed research will further improve this technology so that it can provide detailed measurement over wider areas inside the eye, detect earlier stages of glaucoma, evaluate the location and severity of glaucoma damage, monitor disease progression, and provide more timely assessment of the effectiveness of therapy. A goal of this project is to determine if this objective imaging technology can provide information that is equivalent to or better than subjective visual field testing, which though time-consuming and poorly reliable, is the current gold standard for long-term monitoring and management of glaucoma.",Functional and Structural Optical Coherence Tomography for Glaucoma,9564111,R01EY023285,"['Abbreviations', 'Affect', 'Angiography', 'Applications Grants', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Blindness', 'Blood Circulation', 'Blood Vessels', 'Blood capillaries', 'Blood flow', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Effectiveness', 'Evaluation', 'Eye', 'Eyedrops', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Geography', 'Glaucoma', 'Glossary', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Grant', 'Image', 'Imaging technology', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Lasers', 'Location', 'Longitudinal observational study', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Natural regeneration', 'Nerve Fibers', 'Noise', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Optic Disk', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Outcome', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Perfusion', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiologic Intraocular Pressure', 'Postoperative Period', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Retina', 'Retinal', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Severities', 'Shunt Device', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Speed', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Trabeculectomy', 'Variant', 'Vision', 'Visit', 'Visual Fields', 'Work', 'analytical tool', 'artificial neural network', 'base', 'bulk motion', 'cell injury', 'clinical practice', 'cost', 'density', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'fiber cell', 'field study', 'follow-up', 'ganglion cell', 'glaucoma surgery', 'high resolution imaging', 'high risk', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'macula', 'neuroprotection', 'new technology', 'novel', 'prototype', 'quantitative imaging', 'relating to nervous system', 'screening', 'tool', 'treatment effect', 'vascular factor', 'visual performance']",NEI,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,564228,0.07747365751868607
"Deep Learning for Characterizing Knee Joint Degeneration Predicting Progression of Osteoarthritis and Total Knee Replacement ABSTRACT This proposal aims to develop deep learning methods to automate the extraction of morphological imaging features relevant to knee osteoarthritis (OA), and total knee replacement. While, quantitative evaluation Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) plays a central role in OA research in the clinical setting MR reports often tend to be subjective, qualitative, and the grading schemes utilized in epidemiological research are not used because they are extraordinarily time consuming and do not lend themselves to the demands of todays changing healthcare scenario. The “Big Data” challenge and opportunity facing us makes it necessary to build enabling tools (i) to automate the extraction of morphological OA imaging features, with the aim of evaluating disease progression prediction capabilities on larger sample sizes that have never been explored before; (ii) to discover latent patterns by uncovering unexplored data-driven imaging features by the application of state of the art deep learning approaches (1); (iii) combine multi-modality imaging with clinical, functional, activity, and other data to define the trajectory of joint degeneration in OA. Leveraging the power of these state of the art techniques, and with the extraordinary availability of a large datasets of annotated images; in this project, we propose to develop an automatic post-processing pipeline able to segment musculoskeletal tissues and identify morphological OA features in Magnetic Resonance Images (MRI), as defined by commonly used MRI grading systems. Automation of morphological grading of the tissues in the joint would be a significant breakthrough in both OA research and clinical practice. It would enable the analysis of large sample sizes, assist the radiologist/clinician in the grading of images, take a relatively short amount of time, reduce cost, and could potentially, improve classification models. The availability of automatic pipelines for the identification of morphological abnormities in MRI would drastically change clinical practice, and include semi-quantitative grades, rather than subjective impressions in radiology clinical reports. In this study, we also aim to develop a complete supervised deep learning approach to obtain data-driven representations as non-linear and semantic aggregation among elementary features able to exploit the latent information hidden in the complexity of a 3D MR images, eliminating the need for nominal grades of selected features. This second aim, while being at high risk has also a potential exceptional high impact; as it departs from the classical hypothesis driven studies, and builds a novel translational platform to revolutionize morphological grading of MR images in research studies, but also is paradigm-shifting in that it may provide a more quantitative feature driven basis for routine radiological clinical reports. The clinical impact of this proposal lies in the third aim (R33 phase), in which we propose to translate the solutions developed in the R61 phase on images in the UCSF clinical archives (PACS), and plan to include also demographic and clinical data in the electronic health records, to build the models defining total knee replacements. PROJECT NARRATIVE Deep learning is revolutionizing medical imaging by solving challenging problems in disease classification, progression and therapeutic response. In this project, we focus on using deep learning methodology on magnetic resonance images of the knee to study osteoarthritis prevalence, and progression. The usage of features derived from the imaging data, rather than established, and often subjective grading schemes, will have significant impact on clinical radiology, establishing quantitative physician assist tools with an ultimate goal of reducing the economic and healthcare burden of total knee replacement.!",Deep Learning for Characterizing Knee Joint Degeneration Predicting Progression of Osteoarthritis and Total Knee Replacement,9724174,R61AR073552,"['Algorithms', 'Archives', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Automation', 'Big Data', 'Bone Marrow', 'Cartilage', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical/Radiologic', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Data Reporting', 'Data Set', 'Degenerative polyarthritis', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Economics', 'Edema', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Epidemiology', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Image', 'Incidence', 'Joints', 'Knee', 'Knee Osteoarthritis', 'Knee joint', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Ligaments', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Medical Imaging', 'Meniscus structure of joint', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Musculoskeletal', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Physical activity', 'Physicians', 'Picture Archiving and Communication System', 'Play', 'Prevalence', 'Quantitative Evaluations', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Role', 'Sample Size', 'Scheme', 'Semantics', 'Subchondral Cyst', 'Supervision', 'Synovitis', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Visual', 'bone', 'clinical practice', 'clinical translation', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'disease classification', 'drug discovery', 'epidemiology study', 'high risk', 'impression', 'improved', 'joint destruction', 'knee replacement arthroplasty', 'learning strategy', 'musculoskeletal imaging', 'novel', 'parallel processing', 'patient population', 'radiologist', 'research study', 'speech recognition', 'tool', 'treatment response']",NIAMS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R61,2018,24598,0.024940026305794716

The usage of features derived from the imaging data, rather than established, and often subjective grading schemes, will have significant impact on clinical radiology, establishing quantitative physician assist tools with an ultimate goal of reducing the economic and healthcare burden of total knee replacement.!",Deep Learning for Characterizing Knee Joint Degeneration Predicting Progression of Osteoarthritis and Total Knee Replacement,9526090,R61AR073552,"['Algorithms', 'Archives', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Automation', 'Big Data', 'Bone Marrow', 'Cartilage', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical/Radiologic', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Data Reporting', 'Data Set', 'Degenerative polyarthritis', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Economics', 'Edema', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Epidemiology', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Image', 'Incidence', 'Joints', 'Knee', 'Knee Osteoarthritis', 'Knee joint', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Ligaments', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Medical Imaging', 'Meniscus structure of joint', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Musculoskeletal', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Physical activity', 'Physicians', 'Picture Archiving and Communication System', 'Play', 'Prevalence', 'Quantitative Evaluations', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Role', 'Sample Size', 'Scheme', 'Semantics', 'Subchondral Cyst', 'Supervision', 'Synovitis', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Visual', 'bone', 'clinical practice', 'clinical translation', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'disease classification', 'drug discovery', 'epidemiology study', 'high risk', 'impression', 'improved', 'joint destruction', 'knee replacement arthroplasty', 'learning strategy', 'musculoskeletal imaging', 'novel', 'parallel processing', 'patient population', 'radiologist', 'research study', 'speech recognition', 'tool', 'treatment response']",NIAMS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R61,2018,399482,0.024940026305794716
"30th Annual MR Angiography Meeting Project Summary The objective of the 30th Annual Workshop on Magnetic Resonance Angiography is to provide a forum for scientists and scientist-clinicians, clinical staff and industry interested in MR angiography techniques. The Workshop is the annual meeting of the Society for Magnetic Resonance Angiography (SMRA). At this meeting, emerging techniques and exciting new applications to visualize the vascular system, measure and display blood flow and improve patient outcomes will be presented. MR angiography is an important clinical tool that is applied to millions of patients annually and accounts for an estimated 10% of all MR procedures. Recent advances in time-resolved imaging, non-contrast imaging, post-processing techniques, flow measurements, and flow visualization, as well other innovations, continue to make MRA a dynamic, cutting-edge area of interest for scientific investigation. A major goal of this SMRA Workshop is to provide scientists, clinicians, and students with the opportunity to build connections, pool their knowledge, and educate each other in order to accelerate the refinement of MRA technology and critically how to apply it in clinical practice. Topics for the MRA Workshop will include: vascular disease mechanisms, vessel wall and plaque imaging, quantification of blood flow dynamics, machine learning including deep learning plus `Big Data', vessel lumen imaging, MRA of the brain, heart, abdomen, and extremities; contrast agents, cardiac MR, assessment of cardiac structure & function, clinical study design, new MRA techniques, interventional MRI, MRI of implanted devices, technology assessment, and comparing MRI with other medical imaging modalities. The 3-day workshop will be preceded by an informative one-day educational program that will include both fundamental and advanced lectures from international experts in the field. These topics and educational objectives of the 30th Annual Workshop on Magnetic Resonance Angiography are directly related to the NHLBI mission to provide global leadership for research, training, and education to promote the prevention and treatment of heart and blood diseases. The scientific presentations will include new discoveries about the causes of disease and as such contribute to the translation of basic discoveries into clinical practice. In addition, the proposed educational activities as well as discussion among participants will foster training and mentoring of emerging scientists and physicians. In this context, the workshop will support a collaborative research infrastructure, including participants from academic institutions and industry. Project Narrative This proposed “30th Annual Workshop on Magnetic Resonance Angiography” will provide a forum in which researchers and clinicians interested in MRA can build connections, pool their knowledge, and educate students and fellow scientists in order to further develop MRA technology and translate it into clinical practice.",30th Annual MR Angiography Meeting,9613125,R13HL144016,"['Abdomen', 'Angiography', 'Area', 'Award', 'Big Data', 'Biology', 'Blood flow', 'Brain', 'Cardiac', 'Catheters', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Contrast Media', 'Development', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Disease', 'Educational Activities', 'Educational workshop', 'Engineering', 'Female', 'Fertilization', 'Fostering', 'Funding', 'Genetic Medicine', 'Genetics and Medicine', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Heart', 'Heart Diseases', 'Hematological Disease', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Industry', 'Institution', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Ionizing radiation', 'Knowledge', 'Leadership', 'Limb structure', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Angiography', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Mathematics', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical Imaging', 'Mentors', 'Minority', 'Mission', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Oral', 'Organ', 'Participant', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Physics', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Prevention', 'Procedures', 'Protocols documentation', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Scientist', 'Scotland', 'Secure', 'Societies', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Students', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Technology Assessment', 'Time', 'Tissue Viability', 'Training', 'Training and Education', 'Translating', 'Translational Research', 'Translations', 'Travel', 'Vascular Diseases', 'Vascular System', 'Venous', 'Woman', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'career', 'clinical application', 'clinical practice', 'collaborative environment', 'computer science', 'deep learning', 'imaging modality', 'implantable device', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'lectures', 'meetings', 'minority trainee', 'posters', 'programs', 'research and development', 'student participation', 'success', 'tool']",NHLBI,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R13,2018,10000,0.005775075597365686
"Neuroimaging Analysis Center (NAC) Project Summary/Abstract The ability to access huge cohorts of patient medical records and radiology data, the emergence of ever-more detailed imaging modalities, and the availability of unprecedented computer processing power marks the pos- sibility for a new era in neuroimaging, disease understanding, and patient treatment. To unlock the full medical potential made possible by these new technologies, new algorithms and clinically-relevant techniques must be developed by close collaboration between computer scientists, physicians, and medical researchers. We are excited to propose a national resource center with the goal of finding new ways of extracting disease characteristics from advanced imaging and computation, and to make these methods available to the larger medical community through a proven methodology of world-class research, open-source software, and exten- sive collaboration. The overarching theme for this P41 renewal is the discovery and analysis of novel imaging phenotypes to characterize disease. We use the term imaging phenotypes to describe patterns or features of disease that can be detected through imaging (predominantly MRI) followed by machine learning, statistical analysis, feature detection, and correlation with other indicators of disease such as structured patient infor- mation. The three proposed Technology Research & Development (TR&D) projects address this common question us- ing a variety of complementary approaches and clinical testbeds. TR&D 1 addresses microstructure of tissue, including novel imaging methods to detect tumor microstructure. TR&D 2 investigates rich spatial patterns of disease extracted from clinical imaging with a focus on cerebrovascular and neurodegenerative conditions such as stroke. Finally, TR&D 3 proposes novel image and connectivity-based features that can be correlated with a variety of diseases, with a clinical emphasis on pediatric brain development. Technical innovation will be driven by intense collaboration between the TR&Ds and key collaborators in neurosurgery, neurology, and pe- diatrics. The TR&Ds will leverage recent important developments in the fields of image acquisition, machine learning, and data science to identify and exploit novel imaging phenotypes of disease. Building on our long history of developing clinically-relevant methods, each TR&D includes a translational and clinical validation aim to ensure our work is clinically relevant and effective at meeting the driving clinical goals.

"Molecular mapping of microbial communities at the host-pathogen interface by multi-modal 3-dimensional imaging mass spectrometry PROJECT SUMMARY  Cellular interactions with the environment form the basis of health and disease for all organisms. Exposure to nutrients, toxins, and neighboring cells trigger coordinated molecular responses that impact cell function and metabolism in a beneficial, adaptive, or detrimental manner. Although the benefits of multicellularity for the formation of complex tissue structures or the function of entire organ systems has been long appreciated, it has only recently been understood that microbial inhabitants of vertebrates also have a tremendous impact on host cell function and dysfunction. Despite this, an understanding of these interactions has not moved beyond simple associations, and there are virtually no molecular technologies available that adequately define how a complex microbial ecosystem impacts host cell function, or how the host response to microbial colonization affects the bacterial community. This gap in knowledge is striking when one considers the broad and significant impact that microbes have on human health. In this application, we propose to expressly fill this knowledge gap through development of a novel multimodal imaging pipeline that will provide 3-dimensional information on the molecular heterogeneity of microbial communities and the immune response at the host-pathogen interface.  This proposal combines our expertise in immunology, infection biology, mass spectrometry, small animal imaging, machine learning, and computer vision to develop an integrated multimodal visualization method for studying infectious disease. Our unique approach will computationally combine ultra-high speed (~50px/s) MALDI-TOF images, ultra-high mass resolution (>200,000 resolving power) MALDI FTICR IMS, metal imaging by LA-ICP-IMS, high-spatial resolution optical microscopy, and MR imaging using data-driven image fusion. This strategy will enable 3-D molecular images to be generated for thousands of elements, metabolites, lipids, and proteins with an unprecedented combination of chemical specificity and spatial fidelity more than 50x faster than is currently possible. We will use this next-generation imaging capability to (i) define the heterogeneous microbial subpopulations throughout the 3-D volume of a S. aureus community, (ii) uncover the host molecules that form the abscess and accumulate to restrict microbial growth in murine models, and (iii) elucidate molecular markers that differentiate in vivo biofilms at the host-pathogen interface, between abscesses at various stages of progression, and under distinct degrees of nutrient stress. These studies will uncover new targets for therapeutic intervention and the techniques developed as a result of this proposal will be broadly applicable to all physiologically relevant processes, profoundly impacting biomedical research. PROJECT NARRATIVE This proposal will enable detailed views of the molecular components of infectious disease with unprecedented resolution through the development of a multimodal, 3-dimensional imaging platform. The proposed technologies will improve throughput and molecular specificity, enable automated high-precision and high-accuracy image alignment, and allow for descriptions of molecular signals in 3-D through the fusion of multi-modal imaging data. These studies will uncover targets for therapeutic intervention and antibiotic development and the techniques developed as a result of this proposal will be broadly applicable to all physiologically relevant processes, profoundly impacting biomedical research.",Molecular mapping of microbial communities at the host-pathogen interface by multi-modal 3-dimensional imaging mass spectrometry,9659850,R01AI138581,"['3-Dimensional', 'Abscess', 'Affect', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Anterior nares', 'Antibiotics', 'Antibodies', 'Architecture', 'Awareness', 'Bacteria', 'Bacterial Infections', 'Bacterial Proteins', 'Behavior', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Research', 'Cell Differentiation process', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Cellular Metabolic Process', 'Chemicals', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Differentiation Antigens', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Ecosystem', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Exposure to', 'Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance', 'Functional disorder', 'Glean', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Health Promotion', 'Heterogeneity', 'Histology', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Imaging technology', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immunology', 'Imprisonment', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Infectious Diseases Research', 'Integration Host Factors', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Lesion', 'Lipids', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Metals', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Microbe', 'Microbial Biofilms', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Nutrient', 'Optics', 'Organism', 'Pathogenesis', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Reagent', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Source', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Specificity', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization', 'Speed', 'Staphylococcus aureus', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Three-dimensional analysis', 'Tissues', 'Toxin', 'Vertebrates', 'Work', 'animal imaging', 'bacterial community', 'base', 'body system', 'commensal bacteria', 'experimental study', 'host colonization', 'imaging capabilities', 'imaging detection', 'imaging modality', 'imaging platform', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'interest', 'microbial', 'microbial colonization', 'microbial community', 'microscopic imaging', 'molecular imaging', 'molecular marker', 'mouse model', 'multimodality', 'neutrophil', 'new therapeutic target', 'next generation', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'protein expression', 'response', 'targeted treatment', 'virtual']",NIAID,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2018,593526,-0.013867721461531094

"Deep Learning for Pulmonary Embolism Imaging Decision Support: A Multi-institutional Collaboration Project Summary Diagnostic imaging costs $100 billion annually. These healthcare costs are expected to increase in the coming decade as the national population ages and the pool of insured patients increases. The size and growth of these costs concern policy makers, payers, and society alike. The use of advanced imaging for PE has increased 27 fold in recent years, and this sharp escalation has the potential to expose patients to unnecessary procedures, tests, and risks due to incidental findings. Although radiologists do not order most radiology exams, these physicians are the target of criticism about the rising costs and possible overuse of radiology services. The healthcare industry has called upon radiologists to manage the potential overuse of advanced imaging and to take the lead on investigating best practices for the optimal use of advanced imaging. The ideal sources of information for imaging utilization guidelines are randomized, controlled imaging clinical trials. However, these trials are cost and time intensive, exceedingly difficult to conduct, and typically use narrow patient-inclusion criteria, making it challenging to generalize the results to broader clinical situations. Alternative sources of reliable evidence, such as observational or retrospective studies, have been lacking. The widespread adoption of electronic medical records (EMRs) and the increasing availability of computational methods to process vast amounts of unstructured information now make it possible to learn directly from practice-based evidence. We propose that “big data” clinical repositories, including radiology reports, can lend themselves to a treasure trove of point-of-care, relevant, actionable data that can be used in an innovative and cost-sensitive approach to evaluate the appropriate use of medical imaging. We aim to create a predictive model that leverages real-time EMR clinical data from top national medical centers to arrive at a patient-specific imaging outcome prediction. We recognize that clinicians have to make on-the-spot medical imaging-ordering decisions and they generally do not comply with existing clinical decision support rules. Our study aims to provide clinicians with a tool that can leverage aggregate patient data for medical imaging decision making at the point of care. The overarching approach of this study is to utilize scalable methodology that can be widely applied to leverage EMR data to predict the outcome of a several other high-cost, low-yield imaging tests. This proposal has the potential to better inform advanced imaging in the learning healthcare system of the future and reduce unnecessary imaging examinations and healthcare costs. Project Narrative Imaging costs make up a significant proportion of health care expenditures and cause concern among policy makers, insurers, and patients alike; the inappropriate use of imaging technology is in part a result of imperfect risk models for imaging clinical decision support tools. Current risk models are often irrelevant to patients and as such, clinicians do not always heed to these recommendations, which in turn leads to unnecessary treatments and increased costs. We propose to create a precision health predictive model that leverages real-time electronic medical record data to arrive at a patient-specific imaging prediction in order to enhance imaging decision making at the point of care and optimize advanced image utilization.",Deep Learning for Pulmonary Embolism Imaging Decision Support: A Multi-institutional Collaboration,9640372,R01LM012966,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Acute', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Big Data', 'Biometry', 'Caring', 'Cigarette', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Support Model', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Evidence based practice', 'Exposure to', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Gold', 'Growth', 'Guidelines', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Expenditures', 'Healthcare Industry', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Image', 'Image Enhancement', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Imaging technology', 'Immune System Diseases', 'Incidental Findings', 'Informatics', 'Institution', 'Insurance Carriers', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Medical center', 'Medicare', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Obesity', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Policy Maker', 'Population', 'Precision Health', 'Pregnancy', 'Principal Investigator', 'Process', 'Pulmonary Embolism', 'Radiation exposure', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Randomized', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Research Personnel', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Services', 'Societies', 'Source', 'Spottings', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Unnecessary Procedures', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'aged', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'chemotherapy', 'clinical data warehouse', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical imaging', 'cohort', 'comparative effectiveness', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'diagnosis standard', 'effectiveness research', 'flexibility', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'inclusion criteria', 'innovation', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'lung imaging', 'model building', 'mortality', 'new technology', 'outcome prediction', 'patient oriented', 'payment', 'personalized risk prediction', 'point of care', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'pressure', 'radiologist', 'support tools', 'tool', 'unnecessary treatment']",NLM,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,347584,0.011762962401556049
"Novel Platform for Quantitative Subcellular Resolution Imaging of Human Tissues Using Mass Spectrometry Novel Platform for Quantitative Subcellular Resolution Imaging of Human Tissues Using Mass Spectrometry Mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) is a powerful technique that enables label-free spatial mapping of different classes of biomolecules in biological systems. Because it does not require any special sample pretreatment, ambient MSI is particularly attractive for high throughput automated imaging applications. The throughput of ambient MSI experiments is typically limited by the inherently slow microprobe-type sampling from surfaces, which is a characteristic shortcoming of many chemical imaging modalities. This project will combine several highly innovative approaches to address challenges associated with the high-throughput high- resolution ambient MSI of lipids and metabolites using nanospray desorption electrospray ionization (nano-DESI). Nano-DESI is an ambient ionization technique, which relies on gentle localized liquid extraction of molecules from tissue sections into a flowing solvent confined between two glass capillaries. The extracted molecules are efficiently delivered to a mass spectrometer inlet and ionized by soft electrospray ionization. Nano-DESI MSI enables detection of hundreds of metabolites, lipids, and peptides in tissue sections with high sensitivity, high spatial resolution, and without special sample pretreatment. Furthermore, on-the-fly quantification of lipids and metabolites in tissue sections during nano-DESI imaging experiments is achieved by doping the working solvent with appropriate standards of known concentration. This project will extend these powerful capabilities of nano-DESI MSI to enable high-throughput imaging of large tissue sections of interest to the HubMAP Consortium. This will be achieved using a combination of a conceptually different nano-DESI probe design optimized for robustness, ease of fabrication, and spatial resolution and a suite of advanced machine learning and compressed sensing computational approaches. These developments will be applicable to different types of human tissues and will transform quantitative molecular imaging of multiple classes of biomolecules in tissue sections. Although the capabilities of the new imaging platform will be demonstrated using non-diseased tissue, these developments will be broadly applicable to scientific problems associated with understanding health and disease Project Narrative This research is focused on the development of a transformative technology for rapid, quantitative, and robust imaging of different classes of biomolecules in human tissues using mass spectrometry. This new technology will contribute to understanding complex processes in biological tissues that play a role in both health and disease.",Novel Platform for Quantitative Subcellular Resolution Imaging of Human Tissues Using Mass Spectrometry,9659552,UG3HL145593,"['Address', 'Automation', 'Biological', 'Blood capillaries', 'Characteristics', 'Chemicals', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Electrospray Ionization', 'Ensure', 'Glass', 'Health', 'Histology', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Ions', 'Label', 'Lipids', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measurement', 'Microfluidics', 'Microscope', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Oligosaccharides', 'Optics', 'Peptides', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Slide', 'Solvents', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Electrospray Ionization', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Tissue Sample', 'Tissues', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'biological systems', 'data acquisition', 'design', 'experimental study', 'human imaging', 'human tissue', 'imaging capabilities', 'imaging modality', 'imaging platform', 'innovation', 'interest', 'ionization technique', 'mass spectrometer', 'member', 'metabolomics', 'molecular imaging', 'nano', 'nanoprobe', 'new technology', 'novel', 'operation', 'quantitative imaging', 'reconstruction', 'scale up', 'tool']",NHLBI,PURDUE UNIVERSITY,UG3,2018,375000,0.03156148996275569
"New Approach to US Elasticity Imaging Project Summary To more fully exploit the basic science of mechanobiology as it pertains to breast cancer progression, the medical imaging field continues to search for fast, safe, and effective elasticity imaging methods. In this project we propose a fundamentally new approach to ultrasonic elasticity imaging in which the weak forces applied to patient tissues and the measured displacements that result are used to train a numerical model specifically for that patient. This constitutive model is developed using finite-element methods and neural networks assembled in a unique configuration called the AutoProgressive (AutoP) Method. AutoP “learns” complete stress and strain properties directly from sparse force and displacement measurements and without a mathematical model. Using quasi-static stimuli, AutoP exploits the fact that each force-displacement estimate contains information about mechanical properties at all locations in the contiguous tissue. From measurement information and conservation laws, AutoP generates an informational model without the need to make assumptions about tissue linearity, isotropy, or other material properties normally required when constructing images that display tissue mechanical properties. Once an accurate material-property model is formed by AutoP, we adopt a separate rheological model (e.g., Kelvin Voigt) to form viscoelastic parameters for image display. The AutoP method employs beamformed RF-echo acquisitions from which point displacements are estimated, applied compressional force sensed at the transducer surface, and tissue shape.  No other imaging method is capable of estimating all relevant stress fields, which gives AutoP unique capabilities. AutoP estimates the mechanical properties that one strives to obtain from an inverse problem approach, but AutoP is not a mathematical inverse technique and hence does not suffer from nonunique solutions. Without the need to assume material properties, AutoP can (in principle) model tissue properties in three dimensions and in time following large deformations in highly-nonlinear, anisotropic media. This R21 proposal focuses on establishing the feasibility of the AutoP methodology for subsequent clinical trials under future funding. At the completion of this two-year project, we will demonstrate a new tool for medical imaging capable of exploring the mechanical properties of tissues over a very broad range of deformations. We specifically target ultrasonic methods and quasi-static force stimuli in this project. However AutoP could eventually be coupled to other imaging modalities (e.g., MRE, OCE) or dynamic force-stimulus methods.  The scientific premise underlying AutoP is that we already record all of the information needed to generate a very broad range of elasticity images. The key to unlocking this information is to set aside mathematical models in favor of data-driven informational models built using the unique machine learning abilities of the AutoP method. If successful, AutoP will have a major influence on medical elasticity imaging methods. Project Narrative: A new type of machine-learning method is proposed for elasticity imaging of patient tissues that offers the potential to minimize many current limitations. If we are successful in this development, ultrasonic elasticity imaging would significantly improve in its ability to accurately represent mechanical properties of breast tissues, without any changes in current instrumentation and without increasing cost to the healthcare system or adding risk to patients.",New Approach to US Elasticity Imaging,9560761,R21EB023402,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Algorithms', 'Basic Science', 'Behavior', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Breast', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Elasticity', 'Elements', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Feedback', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Image', 'Inflammatory', 'Isotropy', 'Laws', 'Learning', 'Legal patent', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammary Gland Parenchyma', 'Maps', 'Mathematics', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modulus', 'Patients', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Property', 'Recording of previous events', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Shapes', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Speed', 'Stimulus', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Study Subject', 'Surface', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Tissue Model', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Transducers', 'Ultrasonic Transducer', 'Ultrasonics', 'Writing', 'aged', 'base', 'breast cancer progression', 'breast imaging', 'cost', 'experience', 'healthy volunteer', 'human subject', 'imaging modality', 'imaging properties', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'information model', 'insight', 'instrumentation', 'learning strategy', 'mathematical model', 'mechanical properties', 'model building', 'model development', 'novel strategies', 'object shape', 'processing speed', 'sensor technology', 'tool', 'viscoelasticity']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT URBANA-CHAMPAIGN,R21,2018,179876,0.011284546786112636
"2018 International Molecular and Functional Pulmonary Imaging Workshop SUMMARY This application requests funding to support the 2018 International Workshop on Pulmonary Imaging, a three- day meeting scheduled for December 6-8, 2018, which will be the sixth of its kind hosted by the University of Pennsylvania. The requested funds will primarily be used to cover travel and housing expenses for undergraduate, graduate and junior faculty speakers. Some may also be used to support live webcasting and publication of the workshop proceedings. As in the past, it is our intention to broadcast each session of the meeting online in real-time, enabling interested parties who cannot physically attend to access them free of charge. Pulmonary diseases constitute a significant and rising cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, and imaging is becoming an increasingly important source of innovative techniques for both diagnosing and treating these pathologies. The field of pulmonary imaging currently encompasses a wider range of techniques for the functional, structural and molecular assessment of lung disorders than ever before, which are being developed and refined by investigators across a diverse set of fields such as biology, physics, chemistry, medicine and engineering, computer science and machine learning. Given the rapidly-developing nature of the pulmonary imaging field, it is of the utmost importance that a regular forum exists for scientists and clinicians to communicate and debate their ideas with one another. In the absence of other meetings with a similar focus, our previous workshops have provided such a forum, bringing together the diverse components of the field into the kind of rigorous, focused exchange needed to advance the field. The specific aims of the proposed workshop are as follows: (1) keep the pulmonary imaging community informed about the latest developments in structural, functional and molecular lung imaging; (2) examine the use of pulmonary imaging to assess therapeutic response, including strategies for overcoming the challenges inherent in this objective; (3) explore the integration of machine learning with pulmonary imaging techniques to more accurately phenotype disease and predict injury progression; (4) broadcast the entire proceedings live over the web, allowing non-attendees to freely access the proceedings, and enabling the online audience to participate in workshop discussions in real-time. Based on feedback from participants that previous meetings tended to be overly dense and predominantly didactic in nature, we have also implemented a significant format change for proposed 2018 meeting. With the exception of a few keynote presentations, we plan to limit the percentage of formal lecture in each invited speaker’s talk to one-third of their allotted time, with the rest dedicated to a period of discussion that will be driven by a panel of moderators as well as audience questions. For each presentation, the moderators will prepare a list of questions focusing on three main points: 1) the translatability of the research being presented, 2) the scientific gap which this research aims to address, and 3) the necessity of identifying lung disorders that are suitable for longitudinal studies, as well as which imaging parameters are best suited to the longitudinal study of lung disease. In addition to this change in format, the 2018 workshop will continue efforts to strike a more even balance between functional, structural and molecular imaging approaches to pulmonary disease. Finally, we will also continue to foreground the important issue of using imaging techniques to assess treatment response, which was first introduced at the 2017 pulmonary imaging workshop. NARRATIVE This application requests funding to support the 2018 International Workshop on Pulmonary Imaging at the University of Pennsylvania. The proposed meeting will provide a valuable opportunity for researchers engaged in the development of functional, structural, and molecular imaging techniques for assessing lung diseases—such as COPD, ARDS, IPF and lung cancer—to meet and discuss their work with one another. The entirety of the workshop will be broadcast live online, giving interested individuals who are not able to attend in person the ability to both view and participate in its proceedings.",2018 International Molecular and Functional Pulmonary Imaging Workshop,9613494,R13HL144010,"['Address', 'Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Biology', 'Charge', 'Chemistry', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease Progression', 'Educational workshop', 'Engineering', 'Equilibrium', 'Faculty', 'Feedback', 'Fostering', 'Functional Imaging', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gases', 'Heart', 'Housing', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Intention', 'International', 'Internet', 'Learning', 'Location', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Medicine', 'Metabolic', 'Molecular', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Movement', 'Nature', 'Participant', 'Pathology', 'Pennsylvania', 'Persons', 'Phenotype', 'Physics', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Protons', 'Public Health', 'Publications', 'Pulmonology', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Request for Applications', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Schedule', 'Scientist', 'Source', 'Students', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Travel', 'Universities', 'Work', 'base', 'computer science', 'density', 'disease phenotype', 'imaging approach', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'lectures', 'lung imaging', 'meetings', 'molecular imaging', 'mortality', 'non-invasive imaging', 'novel', 'patient response', 'single photon emission computed tomography', 'treatment response', 'undergraduate student']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R13,2018,29805,-0.013475170669458409

Two of these meetings, Optical Tomography and Spectroscopy (OTS) and Microscopy, Histopathology and Analytics (Microscopy) provide broad exposure to a very active multidisciplinary field in biomedical imaging and bioengineering focused on illness treatment and health enhancement. The interdisciplinary nature of the co- located meetings will provide cross-fertilization of concepts and techniques between fields with the resulting synergies obtained from such interactions. This proposal is to provide registration and travel support for students and early career professionals presenting at one of these topical meetings.  OTS will focus on new developments in diffuse optics, spectroscopy and other non- invasive tomographic imaging approaches, including the fields of diffuse optical tomography (DOT), photoacoustic tomography (PAT), optical coherence tomography (OCT), wavefront engineering to overcome scattering, as well as new developments in spectroscopic technologies.  Microscopy will include topics central to the development of optical microscopy and in vitro optical sensing for the clinic. Areas such as novel optical approaches, including computational optics, new image processing and segmentation techniques, development of decision-assistance algorithms via machine-learning and other strategies, testing technologies in pre-clinical models, applications to clinical samples, and validation in the clinic will be discussed. Optically enabled microfluidics are included in this track as well. The goal of these efforts should be towards clinical translation.  The general purpose of these meetings is to create an inclusive, open forum for the presentation of high-quality scientific research through plenary and technical sessions, short courses, panels, networking and special events. This method of face-to-face information sharing allows researchers to learn what others in their field and related disciplines are doing and to efficiently learn about new research, tools, and techniques that might be relevant to their work. It allows conversations with colleagues from different institutions around the world and engenders far reaching scientific collaborations – both domestic and international.

"Augmented reality visualization for intraoperative guidance based on fluorescence lifetime Project summary/Abstract Optical imaging techniques have demonstrated potential to delineate tumor margins in vivo during surgery as they can rapidly characterize structural, biochemical or functional properties of tissue. Implementation in clinical practice demands rapid visualization and augmentation of imaging data but is often limited by the difficulty in dynamic registration, slow image reconstruction, lack of real- time ability or the need for contrast agents. The goal of this proposal is to implement the recently released Microsoft HoloLens with fiber-based imaging techniques to dynamically augment tissue characteristics directly on the interrogated area in the surgeon’s field of view. The specific aims of this proposal are as follows: (1) To realize a prototype of the augmented reality visualization platform and to combine it with our fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIm) system, implement a user interface for a convenient interaction with the device. (2) To evaluate and optimize the scanning resolution and the registration precision using fluorescence phantoms and demonstrate the system in vivo for ten patients undergoing lumpectomy surgery. A current pilot study has demonstrated the potential of FLIm to localize tumor margins on excised breast specimen. The acquired in vivo data will help to systematically analyze differences between ex vivo and in vivo fluorescence decay signatures and provide initial data for a large-scale study that will be necessary to delineate tumor margins in vivo. The innovation of this proposal is that it will realize an augmented reality visualization platform for FLIm and other fiber based optical imaging modalities providing dynamic (continuous) augmentation of tissue properties directly on the interrogated area (surgeon’s field of view) in real-time without requiring the injection of contrast agents. The successful completion of this work has consequently the potential for significant impact in the field of surgical navigation. Project narrative This project seeks to realize an augmented and mixed reality visualization based on autofluorescence lifetime and any other fiber-based imaging technique for surgical navigation. The proposed research is consequently relevant to public health as it constitutes a critical part of surgical workflow to enable surgeon finding specific targets, avoiding areas of risk, and providing intraoperative orientation leading to higher resection precision and less interruptions in the surgical workflow.",Augmented reality visualization for intraoperative guidance based on fluorescence lifetime,9585701,R03EB026819,"['Achievement', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Augmented Reality', 'Biochemical', 'Breast', 'Calibration', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Communication', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Contrast Media', 'Data', 'Devices', 'Excision', 'Fiber', 'Fiber Optics', 'Fluorescence', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Image-Guided Surgery', 'Imagery', 'Imaging Techniques', 'In Situ', 'Injections', 'Interruption', 'Intuition', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Mammary Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Medical Imaging', 'Modification', 'Near-infrared optical imaging', 'Operating Rooms', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Optics', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Pilot Projects', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Postoperative Period', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Scanning', 'Specimen', 'Stains', 'Surgeon', 'Surgical margins', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Work', 'base', 'breast lumpectomy', 'cancer therapy', 'clinical practice', 'design', 'design and construction', 'fluorescence lifetime imaging', 'human subject', 'image processing', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging modality', 'imaging system', 'improved outcome', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'optical imaging', 'prototype', 'tumor']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,R03,2018,62883,-0.014841733824993179
"Noninvasive assessment of the cornea by diffusion OCT Keratoconus is a degenerative disease of the cornea that is a major cause of reduced vision-related quality of life in the United States, often leading to corneal transplantation. Ectasia after refractive surgery is a vision-threatening complication that can occur in apparently low-risk patients despite current screening technology. The biomechanical properties of the cornea play a central role in these diseases, but diagnostics are still rooted in shape measures because doctors lack direct measures of biomechanical change. While several methods have shown early promise for addressing this gap, most require contact with or perturbation of the cornea, cannot spatially resolve biomechanical properties, or involve expensive optical systems.  To address the need for direct biomechanical measurement of the cornea and the limitations of other approaches, we introduce phase-decorrelation OCT (phd-OCT). Phd-OCT makes use optical coherence tomography (OCT) to quantify random nanoscale mobility that is related to the strength and cohesion of the cornea. Preliminary results strongly support the rationale, feasibility and potential advantages of the approach. Our objectives are: (1) to refine our method to optimize detection sensitivity and speed, and (2) to determine if the technique is clinically useful. We will achieve these objectives through the following aims: 1. To develop and validate mobility-sensitive phd-OCT for corneal imaging. Spectral-domain OCT will be used for anterior segment phase-decorrelation imaging and the analysis algorithm will be optimized. The system will be validated using phantoms and torsional rheometry. 2. To investigate the potential influence of physiological factors (intraocular pressure (IOP), hydration, and temperature). Factorial design experiments in porcine and human donor globes will establish the sensitivity of phd-OCT measurements to potential confounders. 3. To develop and validate data acquisition and processing methods to enable clinical testing. GPU processing and machine learning will be configured to minimize processing time. Scan patterns will be optimized to minimize scan time and return clinically useful data. 4. To assess feasibility and preliminary diagnostic performance of clinical mobility-sensitive OCT imaging of the cornea. A first-in-human study will characterize repeatability and test the hypotheses that phd-OCT mobility measurements are increased in the region of a LASIK flap and decreased in CXL.  Expected Outcomes: The proposed studies will establish a new, non-contact method for imaging corneal biomechanical properties with the potential to address many shortcomings of current and emerging methods. Success could lead to earlier detection of of ectasia risk and allow more appropriate timing and customization of corneal treatments. Future integration of data into computational models has the potential to greatly impact the field by driving a shift from empirical planning and risk analysis to patient-specific strategies. The mechanical properties of the cornea, the transparent front of the eye, are important for diseases that affect vision as well as for corrective treatments like crosslinking therapy and LASIK. We have developed a new optical coherence tomography (OCT)-based method to detect and map corneal mechanical properties that has advantages that may make it readily translatable to clinical use. The objective of this proposal is to determine whether this technique is clinically feasible and useful by refining the technology, testing it in animal and human donor corneas, and performing studies in patients with corneal conditions of interest.",Noninvasive assessment of the cornea by diffusion OCT,9427452,R01EY028667,"['Achievement', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Anterior', 'Automobile Driving', 'Biomechanics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Complication', 'Computational Technique', 'Computer Simulation', 'Cornea', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Degenerative Disorder', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffusion', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Ensure', 'Exhibits', 'Eye', 'Family suidae', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Human', 'Hydration status', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Keratoconus', 'Keratoplasty', 'Laser In Situ Keratomileusis', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Optics', 'Outcome', 'Pathological Dilatation', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physiologic Intraocular Pressure', 'Physiological', 'Plant Roots', 'Play', 'Procedures', 'Property', 'Proxy', 'Quality of life', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Shapes', 'Speed', 'Surgical Flaps', 'Surgical incisions', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Temperature', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Torsion', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Vision', 'Visual impairment', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'cohesion', 'computerized data processing', 'crosslink', 'data acquisition', 'data integration', 'design', 'experimental study', 'first-in-human', 'human study', 'imaging modality', 'interest', 'mechanical properties', 'nanoscale', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'research clinical testing', 'screening', 'simulation', 'success', 'tool', 'treatment effect']",NEI,CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,400000,0.016940039139924527
"2018 In Vivo Magnetic Resonance Gordon Research Conference & Gordon Research Seminar PROJECT SUMMARY  The field of magnetic resonance (MR) is in the midst of a revolution. Disruptive external forces, such as the advent of powerful new Artificial Intelligence methods, coupled with a recent creative ferment in method development within the field, is changing the way we think about the acquisition, the reconstruction, and the interpretation of MR data. Meanwhile, MR has long been an indispensable tool not only for basic discovery but also for medical diagnostics, but the value proposition of clinical MR imaging is also changing, against the backdrop of a shifting healthcare landscape.  There is a palpable need to explore the full scope of these changes, in a forum that enables deep dives and focused discussion, without losing the necessary breath of perspective. While large meetings such as the annual scientific meeting of the International Society for Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (ISMRM) have the necessary breath, the sheer size and pace of such meetings work against the requisite focus. On the other hand, short focused workshops are better suited to the evaluation of progress in well-defined subfields.  The goal of this grant application is to support a high-impact conference with a time-tested format which is ideally suited to assess recent changes in the field of in vivo MR. The tenth Gordon Research Conference (GRC) on In Vivo Magnetic Resonance will be held July 15 to 20, 2018, at Proctor Academy, in Andover, NH. Our GRC will also be associated with the first-ever trainee-organized and trainee-focused Gordon Research Seminar (GRS) on In Vivo Magnetic Resonance, which will take place on the weekend before the GRC (July 14-15, 2018). The trainee seminar meshes well with our goal of preparing young scientists for a changing field and a changing world. We request funding to support graduate students and postdoctoral fellows attending these meetings, which will focus explicitly on the shifting role of MR in a rapidly changing world.  The GRC, subtitled “Challenging assumptions about MR technology and applications in a changing world,” will be led by Chair Daniel K. Sodickson, MD, PhD, and Vice Chair Jeff F. Dunn, PhD, and will build upon a rich history of In Vivo MR GRCs. The GRS, subtitled “The Changing World of Magnetic Resonance: Old Physics, New Techniques,” will be led by Chair Scott Beeman, PhD, and Vice Chair Carson Hoffman, BSc, and will further enhance the experience of trainees with tailored opportunities for mentorship, networking, and scientific exchange.  Specific aims of our 2018 GRC and GRS on In Vivo MR are as follows:  1. Explore disruptive forces and marshal disruptive innovation in the field of in vivo MR  2. Foster connections between MR and surrounding disciplines  3. Prepare young scientists to make a difference in a rapidly changing world PROJECT NARRATIVE Support is requested for graduate students and postdoctoral fellows to attend the tenth Gordon Research Conference (GRC) on In Vivo Magnetic Resonance, scheduled for July 15-20, 2018, and the inaugural trainee- focused Gordon Research Seminar (GRS) to precede the conference on July 14-15, 2018. The GRC will be focused on “Challenging assumptions about MR technology and applications in a changing world,” with the goal of taking the measure of disruptive forces such as Artificial Intelligence, and marshaling disruptive innovations in the acquisition, reconstruction, and interpretation of MR data. The companion GRS will have a related focus on “The changing world of magnetic resonance: old physics, new techniques,” and will provide trainees (who will attend the GRC as well) with opportunities for presentation of their work to peers and thought leaders, discussion of emerging areas of MR, and focused networking and mentorship.",2018 In Vivo Magnetic Resonance Gordon Research Conference & Gordon Research Seminar,9608839,R13EB026933,"['Academy', 'Address', 'Anniversary', 'Applications Grants', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Awareness', 'Biological', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Books', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Companions', 'Complex', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Discipline', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Educational workshop', 'Evaluation', 'Fostering', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Human', 'Imaging technology', 'International', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Marshal', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modernization', 'Palpable', 'Physics', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Role', 'Schedule', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Signal Transduction', 'Societies', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Work', 'biophysical model', 'c new', 'commune', 'comparative', 'computer science', 'design', 'experience', 'graduate student', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'magnetic field', 'meetings', 'method development', 'peer', 'posters', 'programs', 'reconstruction', 'symposium', 'tool']",NIBIB,GORDON RESEARCH CONFERENCES,R13,2018,5000,0.02003639898334435
"Functional Cardiovascular 4D MRI in Congenital Heart Disease SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Congenital heart disease (CHD) is the most common birth defect, affecting 1.2% of all live births. Imaging plays a major role in managing CHD but remains challenging for evaluating complex cardiac and vascular abnormalities across a wide range of age and habitus. To address these limitations, the PIs have developed cardiovascular 4D flow MRI which can measure complex 3D blood flow in-vivo, a task difficult or impossible to obtain with other imaging strategies. Recent efforts have focused on two forms of CHD: 1) bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) which is the most common form of CHD, and 2) single ventricle physiology (SVP), one of the most severe forms of CHD. Our 4D flow MRI studies have successfully identified new hemodynamic biomarkers to better characterize CHD. We were the first to establish a physiologic link between aberrant 3D blood flow, elevated wall shear stress (WSS), aortopathy phenotype, and aortic wall tissue degeneration on histopathology in patients with BAV. In patients with SVP, our findings demonstrated relationships between surgical correction strategies and flow distribution to the lungs, a known factor implicated in SVP outcome. We have achieved successful clinical translation at Northwestern, where 4D flow MRI is now used as a clinical tool in diagnostic MRI exams for patients with CHD and aortic disease. Over the past four years, the PIs have assembled one of the largest 4D MRI databases with over 2500 patient exams. For this renewal application, we identified a need to increase the dynamic range of 4D MRI flow sensitivity to account for data complexity (3D + time) and the wide age range in CHD by a combination of dual-venc flow encoding, compressed sensing, and SSFP imaging. Second, three is a need for longitudinal studies to identify predictors of BAV and SVP outcome. Third, making these unique but complex 4D MRI data sets and analysis tools more widely available to the greater research community is challenging. In addition, no automated methods currently exist for advanced processing such as atlas based analysis across large cohorts. Analysis is thus time consuming and requires manual interactions (e.g. 3D vessel segmentation) which limits reproducibility and translation. To address this need, an established Northwestern data archival and pipeline processing resource based on remote high-performance computing clusters (NUNDA) will be utilized for standardized data archival, sharing, and pipeline processing of 4D MRI data. This platform will provide the unique opportunity to utilize annotated data available in the 4D MRI database (>1300 BAV, SVP, and control 4D MRI data analyzed in the initial funding cycle) for application of machine learning concepts to establish (semi-)automated 4D MRI analysis workflows in NUNDA. Thus, the renewal application for this study aims to 1) develop a rapid (15 min) non-contrast 4D MRI for clinical translation, 2) leverage the existing large 4D MRI database to identify 4D MRI metrics predictive of long-term (> 5 years) CHD patient outcome, and 3) establish a remote NUNDA platform for 4D MRI data sharing and automated analysis across large cohorts. PROJECT NARRATIVE Our goal is to develop non-contrast 4D MRI, a new diagnostic test to achieve an improved assessment for the most common and one of the most severe forms of congenital heart disease: bicuspid aortic valve and single ventricle physiology. We will leverage an existing large 4D MRI database to allow for long-term 5-8-year follow-up to establish new measures for improved outcome prediction and therapy management for patients with bicuspid aortic valve and single ventricle physiology. A comprehensive data archive will be established to allow for the dissemination of the 4D MRI data, analysis tools, and study results to the greater research community.",Functional Cardiovascular 4D MRI in Congenital Heart Disease,9515521,R01HL115828,"['4D MRI', 'Acceleration', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Anatomy', 'Aortic Diseases', 'Archives', 'Atlases', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood flow', 'Cardiac Output', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Common Ventricle', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Congenital Abnormality', 'Contrast Media', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Dimensions', 'Disease Progression', 'Exposure to', 'Funding', 'General Anesthesia', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Heart Abnormalities', 'Heart Rate', 'High Performance Computing', 'Histopathology', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Infant', 'Link', 'Live Birth', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Study', 'Oxygen', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Play', 'Population', 'Process', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Secure', 'Standardization', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translations', 'adverse outcome', 'aortic valve', 'base', 'bicuspid aortic valve', 'clinical translation', 'cluster computing', 'cohort', 'congenital heart disorder', 'data archive', 'data sharing', 'design', 'exercise capacity', 'flexibility', 'follow-up', 'hemodynamics', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'in vivo', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'outcome prediction', 'patient population', 'pediatric patients', 'prevent', 'sex', 'shear stress', 'spatiotemporal', 'tissue degeneration', 'tool', 'vascular abnormality']",NHLBI,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R01,2018,704597,0.0039233121190212755
"Computing, Optimizing, and Evaluating Quantitative Cancer Imaging Biomarkers ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Quantitative Imaging Network (QIN) is a consortium of centers developing quantitative image features, which are proving to be valuable biomarkers of the underlying cancer biology and that can be used for assessing response to treatment and predicting clinical outcome. It is now important to discover the best quantitative imaging features for detection of response to therapeutics, to identify subtypes of cancer, and to correlate with cancer genomics. However, progress is thwarted by the lack of shared software algorithms, architectures, and resources required to compute, compare, evaluate, and disseminate these quantitative imaging features within the QIN and the broader community. We propose to develop the Quantitative Imaging Feature Pipeline (QIFP), a cloud-based, open source platform that will give researchers free access to these capabilities and hasten the introduction of quantitative image biomarkers into single- and multi-center clinical trials. The QIFP will facilitate assessment of the incremental value of new vs. existing image feature sets. It will also allow researchers to add their own algorithms to compute novel quantitative image features in their own studies and to disseminate them to the greater research community. To accomplish this: (1) We will create an expandable library of quantitative imaging feature algorithms capable of comprehensive characterization of the imaging phenotype of cancer. It will support a broad set of imaging modalities and algorithms implemented in a variety of languages, including algorithms that provide volumetric and time-varying assessment of lesion size, shape, edge sharpness, and pixel statistics. (2) We will build a cloud-based software architecture for creating, executing, and comparing quantitative image feature-generating pipelines, including algorithms in the library and/or those supplied by QIN or other researchers as plug-ins. QIFP will also have (a) a machine learning engine that lets users specify a dependent variable (e.g., progression-free survival) that the quantitative image features can used to predict, and (b) an evaluation engine that compares the utility of particular features for predicting the dependent variable. (3) We will assess the QIFP in four ways: (a) by its ability to recapitulate the role of known biomarkers in a related clinical trial, (b) by comparing linear measurement, metabolic tumor burden and novel combinations of the features in our library for predicting one-year progression-free survival, (c) by merging imaging features with known host-, drug- and tumor-based follicular lymphoma biomarkers in order to develop the most robust and integrative predictive model for patient outcomes, and (d) by using the QIFP to combine and to evaluate image feature algorithms developed by another QIN team and our own NCI- funded team in the study of radiogenomics of non-small cell lung cancer. The QIFP will fill a substantial gap in the science currently being carried out in the QIN and in the community by providing the tools and infrastructure to assess the value of novel quantitative imaging features of cancer, and will thereby accelerate incorporating new imaging biomarkers into single and multi-center clinical trials and into oncology practice. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We propose to develop and evaluate a software platform that has major relevance for human health. Many investigators are pursuing image-based surrogates for response to therapy that could be used in clinical trials to predict their success/failure earlier and that are more accurate than existing surrogates. Our developments will facilitate sharing, assessing, and comparing combinations of image feature-generating software algorithms for predicting treatment response, survival, and tissue genomics, which will, in turn, greatly accelerate the development and acceptance of new and more relevant imaging surrogates for assessing cancer treatments.","Computing, Optimizing, and Evaluating Quantitative Cancer Imaging Biomarkers",9525301,U01CA187947,"['Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Cancer Biology', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communities', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer software', 'Computer-Assisted Image Analysis', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group', 'Evaluation', 'Failure', 'Follicular Lymphoma', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression', 'Generations', 'Genomics', 'Health', 'Human', 'Image', 'Investigation', 'Java', 'Language', 'Lesion', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Metabolic', 'Modality', 'Modernization', 'Molecular', 'Multi-Institutional Clinical Trial', 'Non-Small-Cell Lung Carcinoma', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Plug-in', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Privatization', 'Progression-Free Survivals', 'Pythons', 'RNA Sequences', 'Radiogenomics', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Science', 'Shapes', 'Specific qualifier value', 'System', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Tumor Burden', 'base', 'cancer biomarkers', 'cancer genomics', 'cancer imaging', 'cancer subtypes', 'cancer therapy', 'clinical predictors', 'cloud based', 'disorder subtype', 'image archival system', 'image processing', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'interest', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'oncology', 'open source', 'predict clinical outcome', 'predictive modeling', 'public health relevance', 'quantitative imaging', 'repository', 'response', 'specific biomarkers', 'statistics', 'success', 'survival prediction', 'tool', 'treatment response', 'tumor', 'vector', 'web based interface']",NCI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,U01,2018,593292,9.905898273298657e-05
"Development and Validation of Radiation-Free Pediatric Renal Function Quantification Project Abstract Motivation: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) affects more than 500 million people. Children commonly develop CKD from urinary obstructive diseases and nephrotoxic therapies, and then suffer severe growth failure, hyper- tension, cardiovascular risks, and neurocognitive deﬁcits, and eventually end-stage kidney disease. Accurate renal function quantiﬁcation will improve clinical management of hydronephrosis (1 in 100 babies) and dos- ing/selection of chemotherapeutic regimens in oncology patients. Glomerular ﬁltration rate (GFR), the biomarker of renal function, is derived from blood or urine tests. These tests only provide global GFR and are limited in accuracy, especially in children, and even more so in children with cancer. MRI offers superb anatomic delineation without ionizing radiation, and is thus ideal for pediatric kidney imaging. However, MRI has not been widely adopted for pediatric renal function evaluation due to lack of reliability and cumbersome workﬂow. These hurdles stem from the fact that the critical components required for global and regional GFR calculation, including high spatiotemporal resolution, plasma ﬂow and arterial input function, are difﬁcult to obtain, and that accurate image segmentation of kidneys (cortex and medulla) is labor intensive. Additionally, although the same contrast agent injection can be used for obstruction evaluation, certain areas of the kidney suffer from signiﬁcant signal loss using standard MRI acquisition techniques due to high contrast agent concentrations. This project addresses these major challenges for automated comprehensive renal function evaluation in children. Approach: The project has three development aims, which are validated by clinical studies. Aim 1 will enable novel free-breathing time-resolved 3D dynamic contrast enhanced MRI that simultaneously provides accurate GFR calculation and renal plasma ﬂow. This is achieved by incorporating self-navigated motion compensation, fast acquisition with parallel imaging and compressed sensing, and phase-contrast ﬂow imaging. The second aim is to develop multiple new image analysis methods to extract GFR and renal plasma ﬂow (RPF) that lever- age novel ﬂow data of Aim 1, as well as automated new machine-learning image processing techniques for the segmentation of kidneys and ultimately global and regional GFR calculation. In Aim 3, we will develop and integrate ultrashort-echo-time techniques to address the MRI signal loss due to T2* effects from high contrast concentration for patients with obstruction, and further incorporate motion compensation and accelerated imag- ing methods to enable time-resolved high-resolution dynamic MRI for contrast washout kinetics analysis in the same MR exam. Aim 4 will determine the performance of these methods in a clinical setting. Signiﬁcance: This work will lead to robust, automated comprehensive pediatric renal MRI for safer and more accurate renal function evaluation in children. The techniques will facilitate widespread application in the com- munity setting and permit robust evaluation of renal function, for both children and adults. Project Narrative Kidney diseases in children often stem from blockages of the urinary tract or toxicity from medications, such as antibiotics or chemotherapies. Kidney function quantiﬁcation is crucial for clinical management of these children. This work will develop accurate and automated pediatric MRI for quantiﬁcation of kidney function and diagnosis of urinary tract obstruction.",Development and Validation of Radiation-Free Pediatric Renal Function Quantification,9501621,R01EB026136,"['4D Imaging', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Anatomy', 'Antibiotics', 'Area', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood flow', 'Breathing', 'Cardiac Output', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Research', 'Cone', 'Contrast Media', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Drug Kinetics', 'End stage renal failure', 'Evaluation', 'Evolution', 'Failure', 'Financial compensation', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Furosemide', 'Gadolinium', 'Glomerular Filtration Rate', 'Gold', 'Growth', 'Hydronephrosis', 'Hypertension', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Injections', 'Ionizing radiation', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Kinetics', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Mainstreaming', 'Malignant Childhood Neoplasm', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Motion', 'Motivation', 'Neurocognitive Deficit', 'Obstruction', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Perfusion', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Plasma', 'Protocols documentation', 'Radiation', 'Regimen', 'Renal Blood Flow', 'Renal Plasma Flow', 'Renal function', 'Reproducibility', 'Resolution', 'Signal Transduction', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Urinary tract', 'Urine', 'Validation', 'Venous', 'Work', 'antimicrobial drug', 'base', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'chemotherapeutic agent', 'chemotherapy', 'community setting', 'computerized data processing', 'contrast enhanced', 'data acquisition', 'experience', 'image processing', 'imaging Segmentation', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'kidney cortex', 'kidney imaging', 'loss of function', 'nephrotoxicity', 'novel', 'oncology', 'pressure', 'reconstruction', 'recruit', 'spatiotemporal', 'stem', 'urinary', 'urinary tract obstruction', 'urologic']",NIBIB,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,683369,0.01862168139270839
"ClearScope Combined in vivo and ex vivo three‐dimensional (3D) whole‐brain imaging of non‐transgenic and transgenic animal models holds the promise of novel insights into neural network connectivity patterns. With regard to ex vivo light microscopic imaging of 3D whole‐brain datasets, the best approach is brain clearing followed by whole‐brain light sheet microscopy (LSM) because of its unique combination of speed, 3D resolving power, and low phototoxicity compared to confocal and multiphoton microscopy. Unlike other methods, the combined brain clearing / LSM approach makes it possible to use intact tissue and retain all intracellular connections within the brain structure. However, LSM systems commercially available are not suitable for ex vivo light microscopic imaging of 3D whole‐brain datasets in advanced connectomics research. Recently, Dr. Raju Tomer (Dept. Biol. Sci., Columbia Univ., New York, NY) developed light sheet theta microscopy (LSTM), essentially a unique arrangement of two light sheets oblique to the specimen and one detection objective perpendicular to the specimen. This novel microscope is the basis for a number of capabilities in LSTM that are not all available with any other commercially available LSM systems. The LSTM technology has distinct advantages over confocal and other light sheet microscopes, including the unmatched ability to image thicker tissue specimens over a larger lateral area (XY) at higher optical resolutions, while maintaining fast imaging speed, high imaging quality, and low photo‐bleaching. This promising technology serves as the basis for this Lab to Marketplace proposal to develop the ClearScope™, which refines and improves Dr. Tomer's original LSTM system to create a successful commercial microscope for wide‐spread adoption. The key technical objectives for developing the ClearScope as a commercial product include creating and testing (i) a ClearScope prototype based on an optimized microscope hardware design; (ii) novel microscope hardware components for the ClearScope, comprising a novel chamber that contains the investigated specimen and the immersion medium, and a novel detection objective changer; (iii) novel control and image acquisition software for the ClearScope; and importantly, (iv) novel software that surpasses the existing state‐of‐the‐art technology to assemble acquired image stacks into large 3D image volumes exceeding 10TB without need to downsample the image information. The production version of the ClearScope will benefit the neuroscience research community, pharmacological and biotechnological R&D, and society in general by improving understanding of neural network connectivity patterns as well as the neuropathological underpinnings of the large‐scale connectional alterations associated with human neuropsychiatric and neurological conditions. In particular, this will result in an improved basis for developing novel treatment strategies for complex brain diseases. The proposed project will enable important new research, that is not currently feasible, into whole-brain neural network connectivity patterns by means of ex vivo light microscopic imaging of three-dimensional whole-brain datasets. To achieve this, the proposed project will create the ClearScope light sheet microscope featuring signficant capabilities to image thick specimens of unlimited lateral (XY) size with resolution that permits investigatons of subcellular structures to distinguish adjacent neuronal processes (axons, dendrites, varicosities and dendritic spines). Because these features are not all available with any commercially available light sheet microscopes, the benefit for the neuroscience research community, pharmacological and biotechnological R&D, and society in general will be the possibility to better understand neural network connectivity patterns as well as the neuropathological underpinnings of the large-scale connectional alterations associated with human neuropsychiatric and neurological conditions, ultimately resulting in an improved basis for developing novel treatment strategies for complex brain diseases.",ClearScope,9559081,R44MH116827,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Animal Model', 'Area', 'Axon', 'Behavioral Research', 'Benchmarking', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Biotechnology', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Brain imaging', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data Set', 'Dendrites', 'Dendritic Spines', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Human', 'Image', 'Immersion Investigative Technique', 'Lateral', 'Legal patent', 'Light', 'Lighting', 'Literature', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Microscope', 'Microscopy', 'Mus', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurologic', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences Research', 'New York', 'Optics', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Pharmacology', 'Phase', 'Photobleaching', 'Phototoxicity', 'Preparation', 'Process', 'Production', 'Rattus', 'Refractive Indices', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Societies', 'Specimen', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'Subcellular structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Tissues', 'Transgenic Animals', 'Translations', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Varicosity', 'base', 'brain research', 'design', 'ex vivo imaging', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'insight', 'microscopic imaging', 'neuropsychiatry', 'new technology', 'nonhuman primate', 'novel', 'prototype', 'research and development', 'tool', 'treatment strategy', 'usability', 'user-friendly']",NIMH,"MICROBRIGHTFIELD, LLC",R44,2018,556615,0.009987390943002446
"Array-Compressed Parallel Transmission for High Resolution Neuroimaging at 7T Project Summary The goal of this project is to develop a framework for high-performance parallel transmission (pTx) that is trans- ferable to a wide range of MRI scanners, and apply it to push the spatial encoding limits of echo planar imaging (EPI) at 7 Tesla. EPI is by far the most widely used pulse sequence for rapid functional, diffusion, and perfusion imaging, and has been the focus of considerable development in recent years to increase its speed and spatial resolution. Now there is a strong desire to push EPI's spatial resolution down to the micro scale. For functional MRI (fMRI), this would enable imaging of ﬁne structures (layers, columns, and nuclei) of cortical and subcortical architecture while better resolving the hemodynamic response. For diffusion MRI (dMRI), micro scale EPI would improve surface and laminar analysis of ﬁbers in the cortex, as well as brain parcelation using fractional anisotropy differences between gray matter regions, while broadly reducing partial volume effects. It would further enable EPI to be broadly applied to accelerate anatomic scans that are geometrically matched to fMRI and dMRI scans. However, increasing the resolution of single-shot EPI requires longer readouts which extend echo times and re- duce functional contrast in fMRI and signal-to-noise in dMRI at 7 Tesla, while increasing geometric distortions and blurring. Segmented or multishot EPI is a classic method to increase spatial resolution without increasing readout durations, but is underutilized, primarily due to its high sensitivity to motion and dynamic phase changes between shots which cause large image artifacts.  We propose to develop a new multishot EPI technique called shuttered EPI, which addresses the lim- itations of conventional multishot EPI by imaging a set of spatially disjoint shutters in each shot. The shutters are produced by a multidimensional excitation pulse and are spatially shifted between shots to cover an entire slice. However, with thin slices the length of the excitation pulses are impractical (20-100 ms). Many-coil pTx (> 8 coils) can shorten the length of these pulses to feasible durations, but current 7 Tesla scanners have only 8 transmit channels due to cost, footprint, cabling, and other constraints. In the ﬁrst project period we pioneered a technique called array-compressed pTx (acpTx) which overcomes this limitation. Using acpTx, 8 transmit chan- nels can control an arbitrarily large number of coils, where the channels and coils are connected via an array compression network that is optimized with RF pulses for speciﬁc excitations. In this project, we will develop and apply acpTx methods and hardware (a many-coil head transmit array and an 8 channel-to-many coil array com- pression network) to achieve feasible RF pulse durations when exciting the shutter patterns required for shuttered EPI. These developments will be implemented on two major 7T scanner platforms and evaluated in submillimeter (600 micron) fMRI and dMRI acquisitions. Overall, the project encompasses the synergistic design of RF pulses, hardware, acquisitions and reconstructions to achieve a major advance in spatial encoding. Project Narrative Diffusion and functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at 7 Tesla ﬁeld strength using echo planar imaging (EPI) has the potential to deliver clear images of brain structure and function at the level of layers, columns, and nuclei. However, when existing EPI scans are pushed to the spatial resolutions required to resolve these structures, they become highly sensitive to off resonance-induced geometric distortions, relaxation-induced blur- ring, physiological noise and motion. To address this problem, in this project we will develop many-coil array- compressed parallel transmission and apply it to enable shuttered multishot EPI scans that are robust to these effects.",Array-Compressed Parallel Transmission for High Resolution Neuroimaging at 7T,9524416,R01EB016695,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Anisotropy', 'Architecture', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Dimensions', 'Echo-Planar Imaging', 'Elements', 'Fiber', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Homebound Persons', 'Image', 'Image Enhancement', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Length', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Noise', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Physiological', 'Problem Formulations', 'Relaxation', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Scanning', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Slice', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Thinness', 'Time', 'base', 'blood oxygen level dependent', 'cost', 'design', 'gray matter', 'hemodynamics', 'image reconstruction', 'improved', 'magnetic field', 'motion sensitivity', 'neuroimaging', 'perfusion imaging', 'phase change', 'reconstruction', 'response', 'simulation', 'spectroscopic imaging', 'time use', 'transmission process', 'virtual']",NIBIB,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,598063,0.022932902711448183
"Body Surface Tracking of Complex Motion with Obstructed Viewing in Hybrid Imaging ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): During medical imaging, patient motion is virtually unavoidable presenting a significant source of image degradation and artifacts, which in turn, can impact the quality of care received by many patients. One method used to address patient motion is to employ visual tracking systems (VTS), which involves placing a small number of reflective markers on the patient that can be located and tracked in 3D space using stereo cameras. The tracked markers can then be used as a surrogate to a structure of interest, such as the heart. The tracked surrogate provides a quantifiable measure that can be directly correlated with the motion of the target structure, which can then be used for prospective or retrospective motion correction. However, the markers add complexity to patient workflow, provide only a sparse sampling of the patient's surface, and the optimal number and placement of markers is unknown. This project addresses the shortcomings of marker-based VTS systems by proposing to develop and test a novel low-cost marker-less VTS system for tracking patient motion within a hybrid imaging system. The primary barrier for successfully tracking the patient's body surface using marker-less VTS is that clothing prevents an unobstructed view of the patient's body. The candidate, Dr. Lindsay, is proposing to incorporate a translational method using computational approaches to compensate for garments within the proposed marker-less VTS system. Dr. Lindsay has received training in computer science and computer vision and previously has focused on the computational aspects of capturing, modeling, and rendering of physical phenomena such as light and is proposing to extend this knowledge to the medical imaging field. Dr. Lindsay's goals for this proposal are to acquire the necessary training and skills that will allow him to translate his expertise and existing computational skills to an area f research with medical relevance: namely, detecting and tracking patient motion for the purpose of improving motion correction for hybrid- imaging. Dr. Lindsay's long-term career goal is to become an accomplished independent investigator focusing on solving significant problems in medical imaging by translating advances in Computer Science. The proposed work will take place the University of Massachusetts Medical Center (UMass) in Worcester, MA under the primary mentorship of Dr. Michael King, an internationally known expert in the area of medical imaging and medical physics in Nuclear Medicine. Drs. Gennert, Sullivan, Licho have expertise in computer vision, mechanical engineering and medical imaging, and radiology and Nuclear Medicine, respectively will also serve as co-mentors.  The specific aims of the proposed project are to: 1) develop a novel marker-less VTS, which we call PT- Cam, using low-cost using state-of-the-art camera technology, 2) model surface motion as a surrogate for internal motion of the heart, and 3) conduct tests of the PT-Cam system, in order to determine the acceptability and feasibility of clinical usage, on patients undergoing clinical MPI PET/CT imaging. Thus, the main objective of this program of research is to develop a clinically viable method for motion tracking patients undergoing hybrid-imaging studies by using a novel marker-less surface-tracking method that can compensate for clothing and provide modeling of interior motion of structures from surface tracking. If successful, not only will this project provide an innovative, marker-less VTS system for low-cost surface tracking for motion compensation during hybrid imaging but it will also give the candidate the necessary training needed to become an independent investigator in the medical field and potentially a leader in the field of medical imaging. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: It is estimated that 7.2 million people per year die world-wide from coronary artery disease (CAD), and myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) has become a critical tool for screening, diagnosis, prognosis, and monitoring treatment of CAD. During medical imaging such as MPI, patient motion is virtually unavoidable and presents a significant source of image degradation and it has been suggested that upwards of 40% of cardiac studies in PET are effected by some type of motion with similar findings for SPECT. The proposed project will directly address the shortcomings of previous methods for tracking patient motion by developing and testing a novel low-cost marker-less visual tracking system for patient motion within hybrid imaging.",Body Surface Tracking of Complex Motion with Obstructed Viewing in Hybrid Imaging,9517057,K25EB019032,"['Address', 'Area', 'Award', 'Body Surface', 'Cardiac', 'Clinical', 'Clothing', 'Complex', 'Computer Graphics', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Discipline of Nuclear Medicine', 'Elements', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Financial compensation', 'Goals', 'Heart', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Individual', 'International', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Lasers', 'Light', 'Lighting', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Massachusetts', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Medical center', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Myocardial perfusion', 'National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering', 'Optics', 'PET/CT scan', 'Patients', 'Physics', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Property', 'Quality of Care', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Respiration', 'Sampling', 'Screening procedure', 'Security', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Strategic Planning', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Universities', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'career', 'computer science', 'cost', 'follow-up', 'heart motion', 'imaging study', 'imaging system', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'new technology', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'outcome forecast', 'perfusion imaging', 'prevent', 'programs', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'research and development', 'respiratory', 'single photon emission computed tomography', 'skills', 'success', 'validation studies', 'virtual', 'visual tracking', 'volunteer']",NIBIB,UNIV OF MASSACHUSETTS MED SCH WORCESTER,K25,2018,169609,0.0019844236005930223
"Rapid Robust Pediatric MRI Project Abstract Motivation: This is a competing renewal of our successful project, Rapid Robust Pediatric MRI, R01 EB009690. MRI offers superb soft tissue contrast for children, without the ionizing radiation and cancer risk of CT. However, MRI use has been limited due to long exams, low spatial resolution, and motion-artifacts. Thus, MRI often requires prolonged anesthesia with breath-holds and attendant risk; hence, children often lack the beneﬁts of cross-sectional imaging altogether or are exposed to ionizing radiation. The previous project addressed these concerns by creating a dedicated pediatric imaging system. Highly par- allel, high-SNR 3T receive coil arrays were designed and constructed speciﬁcally for pediatric body imaging. The high SNR was used to accelerate scans reconstructed with a combination of parallel imaging, new mo- tion correction algorithms, compressed sensing (CS), and higher dimensional imaging. The resulting system is now being used extensively in clinical practice, signiﬁcantly reducing anesthesia depth and duration, and has markedly increased our MRI utilization. Key technologies have been or are now being commercialized with GE Healthcare, including the pediatric receive array, CS, 4D ﬂow, full-Fourier single-shot T2-weighted scanning, and coil compression. Siemens has licensed ﬁve of our patents, implemented them in work-in-progress packages, and productized our coil compression and our ESPIRiT coil sensitivity estimation. Philips has licensed three of our patents. This ensures broad impact. Approach: Despite signiﬁcant progress and reduced anesthesia depth and duration, patient cooperation re- mains the main limitation to eliminate anesthesia in all pediatric body MRI exams. Many children will cooperate for several minutes, but then ﬁdget and get out of the scanner. Others are content until acoustic noise agi- tates them. Therefore the major emphasis now is greater exam execution speed, comprehensive elimination of acoustic noise, and increased robustness, particularly to contrast agent injection. The project has three interrelated development aims, validated by clinical studies. Aim 1 will enable fast 2D imag- ing for quiet T2 and quiet low-distortion diffusion weighted imaging. A second aim is to develop free-breathing 3D contrast-enhanced and diffusion-weighted imaging that is silent and motion-robust. The third aim will enable au- tomated, smart scanning to speed the exam execution and adaptive protocols to increase the exam robustness. The impact of all of these developments in the clinic will then be assessed to assess the resulting reduction of anesthesia. Signiﬁcance: This work will lead to fast, robust, broadly-applicable pediatric MRI protocols with less anes- thesia, making MRI safer, cheaper, and more available to children. MRI will be transformed into a workhorse modality, reducing CT radiation burden. The techniques will facilitate wide application in the community setting and permit new MRI applications, for both pediatric and adult diseases. Project Narrative Pediatric MRI often requires anesthesia.

"Adaptive Large-Scale Framework for Automatic Biomedical Image Segmentation DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Multi-atlas label fusion (MALF) is a powerful new technology that can automatically detect and label anatomical structures in biomedical images. It is arguably the most successful general-purpose automatic image segmentation technique ever developed. Automatic segmentation is in high demand in clinical and research applications of medical imaging, since segmentation forms a crucial step towards extracting quantitative information from imaging data, and since manual and semi-automatic approaches are ill suited for today's increasingly large and complex imaging datasets. Despite a number of papers that demonstrated outstanding performance of MALF methods across a range of biomedical imaging applications, the broader biomedical imaging research community has been slow to adopt this technique. This can be explained by multiple factors, including the technique's high computational demands, lack of a turnkey software implementation, as well as scarcity of validation in clinical imaging datasets and in the presence of extensive pathology. The present application seeks to remove these barriers and to enable a broad range of clinicians and biomedical researchers to take advantage of MALF technology. It builds on our strong track record of innovation in the MALF field, including a novel redundancy-correcting MALF technique that led in segmentation grand challenges in the past two years. Aim 1 seeks to improve the computational performance of MALF by replacing dense deformable image registration, by far the most time consuming component of MALF, with faster and less constrained sparse registration strategies. We hypothesize that this will not only reduce the computational cost of MALF, but will also make it more robust to anatomical variability, in particular enabling its use for tumor and lesion segmentation. Aim 2 proposes algorithmic extensions to MALF that support automatic segmentation of dynamic and multi-modality imaging datasets, which have been largely overlooked in the MALF literature. Aim 3 will develop a turnkey open-source implementation of MALF methodology. Taking advantage of cloud computing technology, this software will allow users with minimal image processing expertise to take full advantage of MALF segmentation on their desktop. Aim 3 will also provide a set of publicly available atlases and the means for users to build new custom atlas sets from their own data. Aim 4 will perform extensive evaluation of the new methods and software in challenging real-world clinical imaging data, including brain and cardiac imaging. As part of this evaluation, we will quantify how well our MALF approach and competing techniques generalize to novel imaging datasets with heterogeneity in acquisition parameters and clinical phenotypes. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This research will make it possible for a wide community of researchers who collect and analyze medical imaging data to take advantage of a new class of computer algorithms that very accurately label and measure anatomical structures and pathological formations in medical images. By offering more accurate image-derived measurements, the project promises to improve the accuracy of diagnosis, reduce the costs of biomedical re- search studies and pharmaceutical trials, and accelerate scientific discovery.",Adaptive Large-Scale Framework for Automatic Biomedical Image Segmentation,9547416,R01EB017255,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Atlases', 'Biomedical Research', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Cardiac', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Cloud Computing', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Consensus', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dementia', 'Diagnostic', 'Evaluation', 'Gold', 'Heterogeneity', 'High Performance Computing', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Literature', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Medical Imaging', 'Medical Research', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Multiple Sclerosis Lesions', 'Myocardium', 'Paper', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Patient Care', 'Performance', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Public Domains', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'S-nitro-N-acetylpenicillamine', 'Scheme', 'Services', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Temporal Lobe Epilepsy', 'Time', 'Training', 'Ultrasonography', 'Uncertainty', 'Validation', 'Work', 'aortic valve', 'base', 'bioimaging', 'clinical application', 'clinical imaging', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinical practice', 'cloud based', 'cluster computing', 'cohort', 'cost', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'experience', 'heart imaging', 'image processing', 'image registration', 'imaging Segmentation', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'multi-atlas segmentation', 'multidisciplinary', 'new technology', 'novel', 'open source', 'outreach', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'success', 'targeted imaging', 'tool', 'tumor']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2018,597688,0.023712730538525673
"Advanced MR Imaging and Image Analytics as a Precision Medicine Tool to Manage ADPKD ABSTRACT The goal of this NIDDK Mentored Research Scientist Development Award is to provide an organized scientific and educational environment for Dr. Timothy Kline to begin his transition into an independent research career focused on developing novel imaging technologies and image analysis techniques for abdominal organ pathologies. This proposal outlines a five-year training plan at Mayo Clinic under the primary mentorship of Dr. Bradley Erickson and a Mentoring Team comprised of accomplished researchers in the fields of: biology, nephrology, genetics, radiology, informatics; medical physics, biostatistics, image processing, and physiology. The focus of this proposal is to improve both research studies and disease prognosis for autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) patients through biomedical imaging techniques. It is well understood that imaging is essential for ADPKD diagnosis, monitoring, and outcome prediction. Clinical studies utilize total kidney volume (TKV) (as measured by MRI as an image-based biomarker) to follow the progression of ADPKD, as larger TKVs have been shown to correlate with worse prognosis in both human and animal-model studies. However, there are challenges with using TKV as a marker of disease progression. For one, it is a simplification of the disease state and does not inform on microscopic disease processes that are involved with piecemeal destruction of healthy renal tissue. In addition, measurements of TKVs are time consuming, costly, and poorly standardized. The introduction of automated approaches for measuring TKV will: greatly improve measurement throughput, significantly reduce costs associated with performing research studies, allow accurate and reproducible measurements to be obtained both within and across institutions; facilitate the search for new imaging biomarkers. The specific aims of this project are to: (i) develop and validate automated tools to characterize renal structure, such as TKV and cystic burden; (ii) explore new imaging biomarkers by image texture feature analysis and pattern recognition techniques; and (iii) develop a new technique to measure renal blood flow. This research will be facilitated by Mayo Clinic's outstanding clinical and research environment dedicated to improving patient care, as well as the Mayo Clinic Translational PKD Center, which focuses on translating basic science research into improvements in the management and treatment of ADPKD patients. Dr. Kline's background in imaging technologies and image processing makes him particularly suited to perform this research. In addition to the above aims, Dr. Kline will: 1) develop a strong knowledge base in both nephrology and radiology by attending relevant rounds, seminars, and national conferences; 2) enhance his knowledge of medical imaging, biology, physiology, genetics, and programming through coursework and mentoring; 3) attend workshops focused on grant and publication writing; and 4) submit a highly competitive R01 application expanding upon the findings from this research proposal. This proposal will lead to vast improvements to current analysis workflows, as well as an improved understanding of the prognostic power of new imaging biomarkers of ADPKD. Obtaining this K Award will greatly facilitate Dr. Kline's transition into a prosperous independent research career. Narrative Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is one of the most common monogenic disorders and is a leading cause of end-stage renal disease. Total kidney volume (TKV) has become the main image-based biomarker for following ADPKD progression. However, there are challenges with using TKV as a marker of disease progression. For one, it is a simplification of the disease state and does not inform on microscopic disease processes that are involved with piecemeal destruction of healthy renal tissue. In addition, measurements of TKVs are time consuming and costly.

"Imaging Biomarkers of Severe Respiratory Infections in Premature Infants ABSTRACT  Prematurity is the largest single cause of death in children under five in the world and lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI) are the top cause of hospitalization and mortality in premature infants. Clinical tools to predict and prevent severe LRTI in premature pediatric patients are critically needed to allow early interventions to decrease the high morbidity and mortality in this patient group. Although imaging biomarkers of lung disease from computed tomography have been successfully used in adults, they entail heightened risks for children due to cumulative radiation and the need for sedation. Our goal is to address these gaps and improve clinical practice by developing an objective imaging biomarker framework to assess the risk of severe respiratory disease in premature babies using non-invasive low-radiation X-ray imaging.  Previous efforts lead by Dr. Linguraru (Principal Investigator) at Children's National Health System (CNHS) have focused on developing technical components to quantify lung structural data from chest X-ray (CXR) in children. The image processing pipeline developed at CNHS integrates three novel technical components: a) automatic lung segmentation, b) obtrusive object removal in CXR, and c) severity quantification of lung pathology. These innovations enabled the development of a quantitative imaging software technology to quantify Lung Air trapping and Irregular opacities Radiological analyzer (LungAIR).  This Phase I project builds on the methodology developed in preliminary work. We will analyze a large database (n=200) of retrospective CXR images from premature infants with known clinical outcomes, and further develop and validate lung imaging biomarkers. In Specific Aim 1 we will design and implement a prototype of the software technology (LungAIR) for the localization and quantification of heterogeneous aeration patterns in each lung quadrant through quantitative imaging algorithms. A graphical user interface will also be developed for the simple clinical use of the technology. In Specific Aim 2 we will perform clinical outcome analysis to correlate these biomarkers with the severity of lung disease. We will also combine our new imaging biomarkers with clinical parameters to design and evaluate a predictive model of LRTI risk in the first year of life to optimize the clinical management and improve the outcomes for premature babies.  In this project, CNHS partners with Kitware to translate our research into a clinical software application and lay the groundwork for further developments and clinical studies in Phase II. In summary, our approach will enable better clinical management of diseases of prematurity leading to novel diagnostic strategies to improve treatment and outcomes for the highly vulnerable population of premature infants.

"Machine Learning Methods for Detecting Disease-related Functional and Structural Change in Glaucoma PROJECT SUMMARY This project aims to apply novel machine learning techniques to recently developed optical imaging measurement to improve the accurate prediction and detection of glaucomatous progression. Complex functional and structural tests in daily use by eye care providers contain hidden information that is not fully used in current analyses, and advanced pattern recognition/machine learning-based analysis techniques can find and use that hidden information. We will use mathematically rigorous techniques to discover patterns of defects and to track their changes in longitudinal series of perimetric and optical imaging data from up to 1,800 patient and healthy eyes, available as the result of long-term NIH funding. We also will investigate deep learning and novel statistical techniques for this purpose. The required longitudinal measurements from several newly developed optical imaging techniques were not available to our previously funded NEI- supported work. The proposed work potentially can enhance significantly the medical and surgical treatment of glaucoma and reduce the cost of glaucoma care by informing clinical decision-making based on mathematically based, externally validated methods. Moreover, improved techniques for predicting and detecting glaucomatous progression can be used for refined subject recruitment and to define endpoints for clinical trials of intraocular pressure-lowering and neuroprotective drugs. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed project will improve machine learning techniques for predicting and detecting glaucomatous change in patient eyes tested longitudinally by visual field and optical imaging instruments and will make use of a very large amount of data, obtained using previously awarded NIH funds, to do so. This proposal addresses the current NEI Glaucoma and Optic Neuropathies Program objectives of developing improved diagnostic measures to characterize and detect optic nerve disease onset and characterize glaucomatous neuro- degeneration within the visual pathways at structural and functional levels. The development of a clinically useful novel, empirical system for predicting and detecting glaucomatous progression can have a significant impact on the future of clinical care and on the future of clinical trials designed to investigate IOP lowering and neuroprotective drugs.",Machine Learning Methods for Detecting Disease-related Functional and Structural Change in Glaucoma,9298423,R21EY027945,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Award', 'Caring', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Defect', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Eye', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gaussian model', 'Generations', 'Glaucoma', 'Goals', 'Health Personnel', 'Image', 'Imaging Device', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Instruction', 'Laboratories', 'Lasers', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Eye Institute', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neuroprotective Agents', 'Onset of illness', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Ophthalmoscopy', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Performance', 'Perimetry', 'Physiologic Intraocular Pressure', 'Provider', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Scanning', 'Science', 'Series', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Treatment Effectiveness', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'Vision research', 'Visual Fields', 'Visual Pathways', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical care', 'clinical decision-making', 'cost', 'expectation', 'glaucoma test', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'independent component analysis', 'instrument', 'learning strategy', 'markov model', 'mathematical model', 'novel', 'optic nerve disorder', 'optical imaging', 'polarimetry', 'programs', 'retinal nerve fiber layer', 'tool']",NEI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R21,2017,232500,0.05768523858117626
"Functional and Structural Optical Coherence Tomography for Glaucoma PROJECT SUMMARY Glaucoma is a leading cause of blindness. Early diagnosis and close monitoring of glaucoma are important because the onset is insidious and the damage is irreversible. Advanced imaging modalities such as optical coherence tomography (OCT) have been used in the past 2 decades to improve the objective evaluation of glaucoma. OCT has higher axial spatial resolution than other posterior eye imaging modalities and can precisely measure neural structures. However, structural imaging alone has limited sensitivity for detecting early glaucoma and only moderate correlation with visual field (VF) loss. Using high-speed OCT systems, we have developed novel OCT angiography technologies to image vascular plexuses that supply the retinal nerve fibers and ganglion cells damaged by glaucoma. Our results showed that OCT angiographic parameters have better correlation with VF parameters. We have also found that measurement of focal and sectoral glaucoma damage using high-definition volumetric OCT angiographic and structural parameters improves diagnostic performance. The goal of the proposed project is to further improve the diagnosis and monitoring of glaucoma using ultrahigh-speed OCT and artificial intelligence machine learning techniques. The specific aims are: 1. Develop quantitative wide-field OCT angiography. We will develop a swept-source OCT prototype that  is 4 times faster than current commercial OCT systems. The higher speed will be used to fully sample the  neural structures and associated capillary plexuses damaged by glaucoma. 2. Simulate VF by combining structural and angiographic OCT. Preliminary results showed that both  structural and angiographic OCT parameters have high correlation with VF on a sector basis. It may be  possible to accurately simulate VF results by combining these parameters using an artificial neural  network. The simulated VF may be more precise and reliable than subjective VF testing. 3. Longitudinal clinical study in glaucoma diagnosis and monitoring. Our novel OCT structural and  angiographic parameters have high accuracy in diagnosing glaucoma. Neural network analysis of structural  and angiographic data from a larger clinical study could further improve diagnostic accuracy. Longitudinal  follow-up will assess if simulated VF could monitor disease progression as well as actual VF. 4. Clinical study to assess the effects of glaucoma treatments. Preliminary results suggest that OCT  angiography could detect the improvement in capillary density after glaucoma surgery and the effects of  drugs. These intriguing effects will be tested in before-and-after comparison studies. If successful, we will have an OCT diagnostic system that in minutes provides objective information on the location and severity of glaucoma damage. This approach could replace time-consuming and unreliable VF testing. Measuring the improvement in retinal circulation could be a quicker way to detect the benefit of glaucoma therapies that work through neuroprotection or regeneration, compared to monitoring VF. PROJECT NARRATIVE Optical coherence tomography is a high-resolution imaging technology that can non-invasively measure both the eye structures and small blood vessels that are damaged by glaucoma, a leading cause of blindness. The proposed research will further improve this technology so that it can provide detailed measurement over wider areas inside the eye, detect earlier stages of glaucoma, evaluate the location and severity of glaucoma damage, monitor disease progression, and provide more timely assessment of the effectiveness of therapy. A goal of this project is to determine if this objective imaging technology can provide information that is equivalent to or better than subjective visual field testing, which though time-consuming and poorly reliable, is the current gold standard for long-term monitoring and management of glaucoma.",Functional and Structural Optical Coherence Tomography for Glaucoma,9390382,R01EY023285,"['Abbreviations', 'Affect', 'Angiography', 'Applications Grants', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Blindness', 'Blood Circulation', 'Blood Vessels', 'Blood capillaries', 'Blood flow', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Effectiveness', 'Evaluation', 'Eye', 'Eyedrops', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Geography', 'Glaucoma', 'Glossary', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Grant', 'Image', 'Imaging technology', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Lasers', 'Location', 'Longitudinal observational study', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Natural regeneration', 'Nerve Fibers', 'Noise', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Optic Disk', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Outcome', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Perfusion', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiologic Intraocular Pressure', 'Postoperative Period', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Retina', 'Retinal', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Severities', 'Shunt Device', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Speed', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Trabeculectomy', 'Variant', 'Vision', 'Visit', 'Visual Fields', 'Work', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'bulk motion', 'capillary', 'cell injury', 'clinical practice', 'cost', 'density', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'fiber cell', 'field study', 'follow-up', 'ganglion cell', 'glaucoma surgery', 'high resolution imaging', 'high risk', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'macula', 'neuroprotection', 'new technology', 'novel', 'prototype', 'quantitative imaging', 'relating to nervous system', 'screening', 'tool', 'treatment effect', 'vascular factor', 'visual performance']",NEI,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,R01,2017,559269,0.07747365751868607
"THE XNAT IMAGING INFORMATICS PLATFORM PROJECT SUMMARY This proposal aims to continue the development of XNAT. XNAT is an imaging informatics platform designed to facilitate common management and productivity tasks for imaging and associated data. We will develop the next generation of XNAT technology to support the ongoing evolution of imaging research. Development will focus on modernizing and expanding the current system. In Aim 1, we will implement new web application infrastructure that includes a new archive file management system, a new event bus to manage cross-service orchestration and a new Javascript library to simplify user interface development. We will also implement new core services, including a Docker Container service, a dynamic scripting engine, and a global XNAT federation. In Aim 2, we will implement two innovative new capabilities that build on the services developed in Aim 1. The XNAT Publisher framework will streamline the process of data sharing by automating the creation and curation of data releases following best practices for data publication and stewardship. The XNAT Machine Learning framework will streamline the development and use of machine learning applications by integrating XNAT with the TensorFlow machine learning environment and implementing provenance and other monitoring features to help avoid the pitfalls that often plague machine learning efforts. For both Aim 1 and 2, all capabilities will be developed and evaluated in the context of real world scientific programs that are actively using the XNAT platform. In Aim 3, we will provide extensive support to the XNAT community, including training workshops, online documentation, discussion forums, and . These activities will be targeted at both XNAT users and developers. RELEVANCE Medical imaging is one of the key methods used by biomedical researchers to study human biology in health and disease.

"New Approach to US Elasticity Imaging Project Summary To more fully exploit the basic science of mechanobiology as it pertains to breast cancer progression, the medical imaging field continues to search for fast, safe, and effective elasticity imaging methods. In this project we propose a fundamentally new approach to ultrasonic elasticity imaging in which the weak forces applied to patient tissues and the measured displacements that result are used to train a numerical model specifically for that patient. This constitutive model is developed using finite-element methods and neural networks assembled in a unique configuration called the AutoProgressive (AutoP) Method. AutoP “learns” complete stress and strain properties directly from sparse force and displacement measurements and without a mathematical model. Using quasi-static stimuli, AutoP exploits the fact that each force-displacement estimate contains information about mechanical properties at all locations in the contiguous tissue. From measurement information and conservation laws, AutoP generates an informational model without the need to make assumptions about tissue linearity, isotropy, or other material properties normally required when constructing images that display tissue mechanical properties. Once an accurate material-property model is formed by AutoP, we adopt a separate rheological model (e.g., Kelvin Voigt) to form viscoelastic parameters for image display. The AutoP method employs beamformed RF-echo acquisitions from which point displacements are estimated, applied compressional force sensed at the transducer surface, and tissue shape.  No other imaging method is capable of estimating all relevant stress fields, which gives AutoP unique capabilities. AutoP estimates the mechanical properties that one strives to obtain from an inverse problem approach, but AutoP is not a mathematical inverse technique and hence does not suffer from nonunique solutions. Without the need to assume material properties, AutoP can (in principle) model tissue properties in three dimensions and in time following large deformations in highly-nonlinear, anisotropic media. This R21 proposal focuses on establishing the feasibility of the AutoP methodology for subsequent clinical trials under future funding. At the completion of this two-year project, we will demonstrate a new tool for medical imaging capable of exploring the mechanical properties of tissues over a very broad range of deformations. We specifically target ultrasonic methods and quasi-static force stimuli in this project. However AutoP could eventually be coupled to other imaging modalities (e.g., MRE, OCE) or dynamic force-stimulus methods.  The scientific premise underlying AutoP is that we already record all of the information needed to generate a very broad range of elasticity images. The key to unlocking this information is to set aside mathematical models in favor of data-driven informational models built using the unique machine learning abilities of the AutoP method. If successful, AutoP will have a major influence on medical elasticity imaging methods. Project Narrative: A new type of machine-learning method is proposed for elasticity imaging of patient tissues that offers the potential to minimize many current limitations.

"Computing, Optimizing, and Evaluating Quantitative Cancer Imaging Biomarkers ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Quantitative Imaging Network (QIN) is a consortium of centers developing quantitative image features, which are proving to be valuable biomarkers of the underlying cancer biology and that can be used for assessing response to treatment and predicting clinical outcome. It is now important to discover the best quantitative imaging features for detection of response to therapeutics, to identify subtypes of cancer, and to correlate with cancer genomics. However, progress is thwarted by the lack of shared software algorithms, architectures, and resources required to compute, compare, evaluate, and disseminate these quantitative imaging features within the QIN and the broader community. We propose to develop the Quantitative Imaging Feature Pipeline (QIFP), a cloud-based, open source platform that will give researchers free access to these capabilities and hasten the introduction of quantitative image biomarkers into single- and multi-center clinical trials. The QIFP will facilitate assessment of the incremental value of new vs. existing image feature sets. It will also allow researchers to add their own algorithms to compute novel quantitative image features in their own studies and to disseminate them to the greater research community. To accomplish this: (1) We will create an expandable library of quantitative imaging feature algorithms capable of comprehensive characterization of the imaging phenotype of cancer. It will support a broad set of imaging modalities and algorithms implemented in a variety of languages, including algorithms that provide volumetric and time-varying assessment of lesion size, shape, edge sharpness, and pixel statistics. (2) We will build a cloud-based software architecture for creating, executing, and comparing quantitative image feature-generating pipelines, including algorithms in the library and/or those supplied by QIN or other researchers as plug-ins. QIFP will also have (a) a machine learning engine that lets users specify a dependent variable (e.g., progression-free survival) that the quantitative image features can used to predict, and (b) an evaluation engine that compares the utility of particular features for predicting the dependent variable. (3) We will assess the QIFP in four ways: (a) by its ability to recapitulate the role of known biomarkers in a related clinical trial, (b) by comparing linear measurement, metabolic tumor burden and novel combinations of the features in our library for predicting one-year progression-free survival, (c) by merging imaging features with known host-, drug- and tumor-based follicular lymphoma biomarkers in order to develop the most robust and integrative predictive model for patient outcomes, and (d) by using the QIFP to combine and to evaluate image feature algorithms developed by another QIN team and our own NCI- funded team in the study of radiogenomics of non-small cell lung cancer. The QIFP will fill a substantial gap in the science currently being carried out in the QIN and in the community by providing the tools and infrastructure to assess the value of novel quantitative imaging features of cancer, and will thereby accelerate incorporating new imaging biomarkers into single and multi-center clinical trials and into oncology practice. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We propose to develop and evaluate a software platform that has major relevance for human health. Many investigators are pursuing image-based surrogates for response to therapy that could be used in clinical trials to predict their success/failure earlier and that are more accurate than existing surrogates. Our developments will facilitate sharing, assessing, and comparing combinations of image feature-generating software algorithms for predicting treatment response, survival, and tissue genomics, which will, in turn, greatly accelerate the development and acceptance of new and more relevant imaging surrogates for assessing cancer treatments.","Computing, Optimizing, and Evaluating Quantitative Cancer Imaging Biomarkers",9324146,U01CA187947,"['Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Cancer Biology', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communities', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer software', 'Computer-Assisted Image Analysis', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group', 'Evaluation', 'Failure', 'Follicular Lymphoma', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression', 'Generations', 'Genomics', 'Health', 'Human', 'Image', 'Investigation', 'Java', 'Language', 'Lesion', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Metabolic', 'Modality', 'Modernization', 'Molecular', 'Multi-Institutional Clinical Trial', 'Non-Small-Cell Lung Carcinoma', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Plug-in', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Privatization', 'Progression-Free Survivals', 'Pythons', 'RNA Sequences', 'Radiogenomics', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Science', 'Shapes', 'Specific qualifier value', 'System', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Tumor Burden', 'base', 'cancer biomarkers', 'cancer genomics', 'cancer imaging', 'cancer subtypes', 'cancer therapy', 'clinical predictors', 'cloud based', 'disorder subtype', 'image archival system', 'image processing', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'interest', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'oncology', 'open source', 'predict clinical outcome', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive of treatment response', 'public health relevance', 'quantitative imaging', 'repository', 'response', 'specific biomarkers', 'statistics', 'success', 'survival prediction', 'tool', 'treatment response', 'tumor', 'vector', 'web based interface']",NCI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,U01,2017,487132,9.905898273298657e-05
"Body Surface Tracking of Complex Motion with Obstructed Viewing in Hybrid Imaging ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): During medical imaging, patient motion is virtually unavoidable presenting a significant source of image degradation and artifacts, which in turn, can impact the quality of care received by many patients. One method used to address patient motion is to employ visual tracking systems (VTS), which involves placing a small number of reflective markers on the patient that can be located and tracked in 3D space using stereo cameras. The tracked markers can then be used as a surrogate to a structure of interest, such as the heart. The tracked surrogate provides a quantifiable measure that can be directly correlated with the motion of the target structure, which can then be used for prospective or retrospective motion correction. However, the markers add complexity to patient workflow, provide only a sparse sampling of the patient's surface, and the optimal number and placement of markers is unknown. This project addresses the shortcomings of marker-based VTS systems by proposing to develop and test a novel low-cost marker-less VTS system for tracking patient motion within a hybrid imaging system. The primary barrier for successfully tracking the patient's body surface using marker-less VTS is that clothing prevents an unobstructed view of the patient's body. The candidate, Dr. Lindsay, is proposing to incorporate a translational method using computational approaches to compensate for garments within the proposed marker-less VTS system. Dr. Lindsay has received training in computer science and computer vision and previously has focused on the computational aspects of capturing, modeling, and rendering of physical phenomena such as light and is proposing to extend this knowledge to the medical imaging field. Dr. Lindsay's goals for this proposal are to acquire the necessary training and skills that will allow him to translate his expertise and existing computational skills to an area f research with medical relevance: namely, detecting and tracking patient motion for the purpose of improving motion correction for hybrid- imaging. Dr. Lindsay's long-term career goal is to become an accomplished independent investigator focusing on solving significant problems in medical imaging by translating advances in Computer Science. The proposed work will take place the University of Massachusetts Medical Center (UMass) in Worcester, MA under the primary mentorship of Dr. Michael King, an internationally known expert in the area of medical imaging and medical physics in Nuclear Medicine. Drs. Gennert, Sullivan, Licho have expertise in computer vision, mechanical engineering and medical imaging, and radiology and Nuclear Medicine, respectively will also serve as co-mentors.  The specific aims of the proposed project are to: 1) develop a novel marker-less VTS, which we call PT- Cam, using low-cost using state-of-the-art camera technology, 2) model surface motion as a surrogate for internal motion of the heart, and 3) conduct tests of the PT-Cam system, in order to determine the acceptability and feasibility of clinical usage, on patients undergoing clinical MPI PET/CT imaging. Thus, the main objective of this program of research is to develop a clinically viable method for motion tracking patients undergoing hybrid-imaging studies by using a novel marker-less surface-tracking method that can compensate for clothing and provide modeling of interior motion of structures from surface tracking. If successful, not only will this project provide an innovative, marker-less VTS system for low-cost surface tracking for motion compensation during hybrid imaging but it will also give the candidate the necessary training needed to become an independent investigator in the medical field and potentially a leader in the field of medical imaging. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: It is estimated that 7.2 million people per year die world-wide from coronary artery disease (CAD), and myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) has become a critical tool for screening, diagnosis, prognosis, and monitoring treatment of CAD. During medical imaging such as MPI, patient motion is virtually unavoidable and presents a significant source of image degradation and it has been suggested that upwards of 40% of cardiac studies in PET are effected by some type of motion with similar findings for SPECT. The proposed project will directly address the shortcomings of previous methods for tracking patient motion by developing and testing a novel low-cost marker-less visual tracking system for patient motion within hybrid imaging.",Body Surface Tracking of Complex Motion with Obstructed Viewing in Hybrid Imaging,9300962,K25EB019032,"['Address', 'Area', 'Award', 'Body Surface', 'Cardiac', 'Clinical', 'Clothing', 'Complex', 'Computer Graphics', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Discipline of Nuclear Medicine', 'Elements', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Financial compensation', 'Goals', 'Heart', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Individual', 'International', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Lasers', 'Light', 'Lighting', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Massachusetts', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Medical center', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Myocardial perfusion', 'National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering', 'Optics', 'PET/CT scan', 'Patients', 'Physics', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Property', 'Quality of Care', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Respiration', 'Sampling', 'Security', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Strategic Planning', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Universities', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'career', 'computer science', 'cost', 'follow-up', 'heart motion', 'imaging study', 'imaging system', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'new technology', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'outcome forecast', 'perfusion imaging', 'prevent', 'programs', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'research and development', 'respiratory', 'screening', 'single photon emission computed tomography', 'skills', 'success', 'tool', 'validation studies', 'virtual', 'visual tracking', 'volunteer']",NIBIB,UNIV OF MASSACHUSETTS MED SCH WORCESTER,K25,2017,169609,0.0019844236005930223
"Statistical methods for large and complex databases of ultra-high-dimensional DESCRIPTION: Medical imaging is a cornerstone of basic science and clinical practice. To discover new mechanisms and markers of disease and their crucial implications for clinical practice, large multi-center imaging studies are acquiring terabytes of complex multi-modality imaging data cross-sectionally and longitudinally over decades. The statistical analysis of data from such studies is challenging due to the complex structure of the imaging data acquired and the ultra-high dimensionality. Furthermore, the heterogeneity of anatomy, pathology, and imaging protocols causes instability and failure of many current state-of-the-art image analysis methods. This grant proposes statistical frameworks for studying populations through biomedical imaging, scalable and robust methods for the identification and accurate quantification of pathology, and analytic tools for the cross-sectional and longitudinal examination of etiology and disease progression. These techniques will be applied to address key goals of the motivating large and multi- center studies of multiple sclerosis and Alzheimer's disease conducted at Johns Hopkins Hospital, the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, and across the globe. The project will create methods for uncovering and quantifying brain lesion pathology, incidence, and trajectory. Methods developed under this grant will be targeted towards these neuroimaging goals, but will form the basis for statistical image analysis methods applicable broadly in the biomedical sciences. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project involves the development of statistical frameworks and methods for the analysis of complex ultra-high-dimensional biomedical imaging.

"Adaptive Large-Scale Framework for Automatic Biomedical Image Segmentation DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Multi-atlas label fusion (MALF) is a powerful new technology that can automatically detect and label anatomical structures in biomedical images. It is arguably the most successful general-purpose automatic image segmentation technique ever developed. Automatic segmentation is in high demand in clinical and research applications of medical imaging, since segmentation forms a crucial step towards extracting quantitative information from imaging data, and since manual and semi-automatic approaches are ill suited for today's increasingly large and complex imaging datasets. Despite a number of papers that demonstrated outstanding performance of MALF methods across a range of biomedical imaging applications, the broader biomedical imaging research community has been slow to adopt this technique. This can be explained by multiple factors, including the technique's high computational demands, lack of a turnkey software implementation, as well as scarcity of validation in clinical imaging datasets and in the presence of extensive pathology. The present application seeks to remove these barriers and to enable a broad range of clinicians and biomedical researchers to take advantage of MALF technology. It builds on our strong track record of innovation in the MALF field, including a novel redundancy-correcting MALF technique that led in segmentation grand challenges in the past two years. Aim 1 seeks to improve the computational performance of MALF by replacing dense deformable image registration, by far the most time consuming component of MALF, with faster and less constrained sparse registration strategies. We hypothesize that this will not only reduce the computational cost of MALF, but will also make it more robust to anatomical variability, in particular enabling its use for tumor and lesion segmentation. Aim 2 proposes algorithmic extensions to MALF that support automatic segmentation of dynamic and multi-modality imaging datasets, which have been largely overlooked in the MALF literature. Aim 3 will develop a turnkey open-source implementation of MALF methodology. Taking advantage of cloud computing technology, this software will allow users with minimal image processing expertise to take full advantage of MALF segmentation on their desktop. Aim 3 will also provide a set of publicly available atlases and the means for users to build new custom atlas sets from their own data. Aim 4 will perform extensive evaluation of the new methods and software in challenging real-world clinical imaging data, including brain and cardiac imaging. As part of this evaluation, we will quantify how well our MALF approach and competing techniques generalize to novel imaging datasets with heterogeneity in acquisition parameters and clinical phenotypes. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This research will make it possible for a wide community of researchers who collect and analyze medical imaging data to take advantage of a new class of computer algorithms that very accurately label and measure anatomical structures and pathological formations in medical images.

"Ultra-miniaturized single fiber probe for functional brain imaging in freely moving animals ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Microscope techniques to image inside brain tissue are generally limited by poor depth penetration. Micro-endoscopy, wherein a probe is physically inserted into the tissue, can overcome this limitation in depth penetration, but at the expense of invasiveness and tissue damage due to the size of the probe. Our goal here is to palliate these problems by developing an ultra-miniature microendoscope probe based on a single, lensless optical fiber.  The direct transmission of an image through an optical ﬁber is diﬃcult because spatial information becomes scrambled upon propagation. We have recently demonstrated an image transmission strategy where spatial information is ﬁrst converted to spectral information. Our strategy is based on a principle of spread-spectrum encoding, borrowed from wireless communications, wherein object pixels are converted into distinct spectral codes that span the full bandwidth of the object spectrum. Image recovery is performed by numerical inversion of the detected spectrum at the ﬁber output. We have provided a simple demonstration of spread-spectrum encoding using macroscopic Fabry-Perot etalons. Our technique enables the 2D imaging of luminous (i.e. fluorescent or bioluminescent) objects with high throughput independent of pixel number. Moreover, it is insensitive to ﬁber bending, contains no moving parts, and opens the attractive possibility of extreme miniaturization down to the size of a single optical fiber.  Our goal here is to develop, characterize, and establish the versatility of a new class of ultra-miniature fiber probes that can provide functional 2D brain imaging at arbitrary depths and with minimal tissue damage. Our strategy will involve probe development, machine-learning algorithm development, and the actual demonstration of microendoscopic imaging in freely moving behaving animals. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We have recently demonstrated a strategy to image through a single, lensless optical fiber.

"Kernel-based Nonlinear Learning for Fast Magnetic Resonance Imaging with Sub-Nyquist Sampling ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The quest for fast image acquisition speed has always been a perennial topic in the MRI community. To reduce the acquisition time for maximal spatial and temporal resolution, modern MRI protocols usually perform reduced acquisitions below the Nyquist rate. The reduced data is then used to reconstruct the image through advanced reconstruction techniques that leverage some prior information about the MRI system (e.g., parallel imaging) and/or MR signal (e.g., compressed sensing). Since such prior information is patient and system specific, recent techniques obtain the prior information using training data obtained through an empirical calibration procedure. All existing methods assume the prior models are linear. Since the intrinsic nonlinear relationship in the training data cannot be characterized in such simple models, the reconstruction is degraded by the inaccuracy of the prior information. Nonlinear learning from the training data have proven to be more powerful in machine learning because it is more general and includes the linear model as a special case. However, it is usually more challenging to learn the nonlinear models and even more challenging to incorporate the model in reconstruction due to the increased degree of freedom. We recently have introduced a novel concept of ""kernel"" in MR reconstruction to address the above challenges timely. Our preliminary results on parallel imaging and sparsity-constrained reconstruction demonstrate that the kernel-based algorithms improve the reconstruction quality over the original algorithms with linear prior models. Built upon our strong preliminary results, the objective of this application is to develop an innovative kernel-based framework for MR image reconstruction from undersampled data. This framework does not require explicit knowledge of nonlinear mapping (as in preliminary work) such that a broader family of nonlinear functions can be explored for different clinical applications. The proposed work is expected to advance the field of MR image reconstruction vertically. Specifically, the successful completion of the proposed project will result in a general framework leading to many new algorithms (including two developed in this project) for reconstruction from reduced acquisition. Therefore, virtually all of current clinical MRI could benefit from the improved resolution, image quality, and/or reduced acquisition times that the new framework will facilitate or the novel applications i may enable. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research is to develop a general framework and two specific new techniques to improve the spatial resolution and/or reduce the scan time in magnetic resonance imaging and evaluate the performance of the techniques for 3D parallel imaging and quantitative imaging in brain. The development of such novel fast imaging techniques may greatly enhance diagnosis of neurological disease. Therefore the project will potentially benefit numerous subjects and the healthcare system.",Kernel-based Nonlinear Learning for Fast Magnetic Resonance Imaging with Sub-Nyquist Sampling,9119020,R21EB020861,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Brain', 'Calibration', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dictionary', 'Family', 'Freedom', 'Health', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Industry', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Letters', 'Linear Models', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Non-linear Models', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physics', 'Polynomial Models', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Procedures', 'Protocols documentation', 'Qualifying', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Software Tools', 'Speed', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'Weight', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical application', 'image reconstruction', 'improved', 'innovation', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'quantitative imaging', 'reconstruction', 'temporal measurement']",NIBIB,STATE UNIVERSITY OF NEW YORK AT BUFFALO,R21,2016,222652,0.014884071627885243
"Large-Scale Reconstruction of Microvascular Networks and the Surrounding Cellular DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A career development plan is proposed for Dr. David Mayerich, a computer scientist who is committed to developing an interdisciplinary career in biomedical engineering, with a focus on the collection and analysis of large-scale data sets at sub-micrometer resolution. His graduate research was in the areas of computer visualization and optical imaging, where his work lead to the development of the prototype Knife-Edge Scanning Microscope (KESM). This is the first instrument capable of imaging three-dimensional macro-scale tissue volumes at sub-micrometer resolution while providing a data rate approaching the transfer speed of most modern computer systems.         Since receiving his Ph.D., Dr. Mayerich worked as a postdoctoral fellow at the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science and Technology at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, where he has worked with biologists and biomedical engineers to develop tools for the segmentation and classification of large data sets. This provided experience in addressing the needs and limitations of the computational tools available to the interdisciplinary community.        The goal of the mentored phase of this proposal is to provide Dr. Mayerich with the opportunity to work as a developer for the FARSIGHT Toolkit. The FARSIGHT Toolkit is an open-source segmentation toolkit that focuses on developing computer vision algorithms specifically tailored to deal with the unique structures found in microscopy data sets. This project is directed by Prof. Badrinath Roysam at the University of Houston, and was awarded first-place in the NIH-sponsored DIADEM Challenge in neuron segmentation. Dr. Mayerich will use his previous experience in biomedical segmentation, GPU-based computing, and efficient data structures to help make the FARSIGHT Toolkit scalable to the terabyte-scale data sets produced using next-generation high-throughput imaging techniques. Dr. Mayerich will receive mentoring in the algorithms and techniques used in the FARSIGHT Toolkit, as well as valuable experience working on a collaborative software development project.         The goal of the independent phase is to use recently developed imaging techniques, along with scalable segmentation algorithms, to construct complete microvascular models of mouse organs. Recent advances in KESM demonstrate that sub-micrometer images of 1cm3 tissue samples can be collected in less than 50 hours. These images have the resolution and quality necessary for (a) complete reconstruction of microvascular networks in whole organs, and (b) the geometric distribution of cell soma in relation to this network. Models describing cellular and microvascular relationships have implications in several diseases, including neurodegenerative disease and tumor growth, as well as clinical applications in tissue engineering and the quantitative analysis of angiogenic drugs and therapies. PROJECT NARRATIVE The goal of this work is to produce high-resolution microvascular models from mouse brain tissue, as well as create algorithms for querying, distributing, and building models from next-generation high-throughput microscopy data sets. These techniques will allow researchers to create large-scale blood flow simulations, simulate the extent of tissue damage due to stroke or aneurism, and explore the relationships between cells and microvessels on a tissue-wide scale. Clinical applications include the quantification of angiogenesis in tumors and tissue implants, and the quantification of neurovascular effects in neurodegenerative disease models.",Large-Scale Reconstruction of Microvascular Networks and the Surrounding Cellular,9117645,R00LM011390,"['Active Learning', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Atlases', 'Award', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Blood Vessels', 'Blood flow', 'Brain', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Classification', 'Clinical Research', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Systems', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Hour', 'Illinois', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Implant', 'Institutes', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Memory', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Microscope', 'Microscopy', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurons', 'Online Systems', 'Organ', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Process', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Speed', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Tissue Engineering', 'Tissue Sample', 'Tissue Stains', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Transgenic Organisms', 'Tumor Angiogenesis', 'Tumor Tissue', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'angiogenesis', 'base', 'brain tissue', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical application', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'experience', 'imaging Segmentation', 'improved', 'instrument', 'learning strategy', 'memory process', 'model building', 'mouse model', 'neuronal cell body', 'neurovascular', 'next generation', 'open source', 'optical imaging', 'programs', 'prototype', 'reconstruction', 'research study', 'simulation', 'software development', 'success', 'terabyte', 'tool', 'tumor growth']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF HOUSTON,R00,2016,244245,0.01400414084046362
"Computing, Optimizing, and Evaluating Quantitative Cancer Imaging Biomarkers ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Quantitative Imaging Network (QIN) is a consortium of centers developing quantitative image features, which are proving to be valuable biomarkers of the underlying cancer biology and that can be used for assessing response to treatment and predicting clinical outcome. It is now important to discover the best quantitative imaging features for detection of response to therapeutics, to identify subtypes of cancer, and to correlate with cancer genomics. However, progress is thwarted by the lack of shared software algorithms, architectures, and resources required to compute, compare, evaluate, and disseminate these quantitative imaging features within the QIN and the broader community. We propose to develop the Quantitative Imaging Feature Pipeline (QIFP), a cloud-based, open source platform that will give researchers free access to these capabilities and hasten the introduction of quantitative image biomarkers into single- and multi-center clinical trials. The QIFP will facilitate assessment of the incremental value of new vs. existing image feature sets. It will also allow researchers to add their own algorithms to compute novel quantitative image features in their own studies and to disseminate them to the greater research community. To accomplish this: (1) We will create an expandable library of quantitative imaging feature algorithms capable of comprehensive characterization of the imaging phenotype of cancer. It will support a broad set of imaging modalities and algorithms implemented in a variety of languages, including algorithms that provide volumetric and time-varying assessment of lesion size, shape, edge sharpness, and pixel statistics. (2) We will build a cloud-based software architecture for creating, executing, and comparing quantitative image feature-generating pipelines, including algorithms in the library and/or those supplied by QIN or other researchers as plug-ins. QIFP will also have (a) a machine learning engine that lets users specify a dependent variable (e.g., progression-free survival) that the quantitative image features can used to predict, and (b) an evaluation engine that compares the utility of particular features for predicting the dependent variable. (3) We will assess the QIFP in four ways: (a) by its ability to recapitulate the role of known biomarkers in a related clinical trial, (b) by comparing linear measurement, metabolic tumor burden and novel combinations of the features in our library for predicting one-year progression-free survival, (c) by merging imaging features with known host-, drug- and tumor-based follicular lymphoma biomarkers in order to develop the most robust and integrative predictive model for patient outcomes, and (d) by using the QIFP to combine and to evaluate image feature algorithms developed by another QIN team and our own NCI- funded team in the study of radiogenomics of non-small cell lung cancer. The QIFP will fill a substantial gap in the science currently being carried out in the QIN and in the community by providing the tools and infrastructure to assess the value of novel quantitative imaging features of cancer, and will thereby accelerate incorporating new imaging biomarkers into single and multi-center clinical trials and into oncology practice. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We propose to develop and evaluate a software platform that has major relevance for human health. Many investigators are pursuing image-based surrogates for response to therapy that could be used in clinical trials to predict their success/failure earlier and that are more accurate than existing surrogates. Our developments will facilitate sharing, assessing, and comparing combinations of image feature-generating software algorithms for predicting treatment response, survival, and tissue genomics, which will, in turn, greatly accelerate the development and acceptance of new and more relevant imaging surrogates for assessing cancer treatments.","Computing, Optimizing, and Evaluating Quantitative Cancer Imaging Biomarkers",9132190,U01CA187947,"['Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Cancer Biology', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Computer-Assisted Image Analysis', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group', 'Evaluation', 'Failure', 'Follicular Lymphoma', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression', 'Generations', 'Genomics', 'Health', 'Human', 'Image', 'Investigation', 'Java', 'Language', 'Lesion', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Metabolic', 'Modality', 'Molecular', 'Multi-Institutional Clinical Trial', 'Non-Small-Cell Lung Carcinoma', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Plug-in', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Progression-Free Survivals', 'Pythons', 'RNA Sequences', 'Radiogenomics', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Science', 'Shapes', 'Specific qualifier value', 'System', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissue Survival', 'Tissues', 'Tumor Burden', 'base', 'cancer genomics', 'cancer imaging', 'cancer subtypes', 'cancer therapy', 'cloud based', 'disorder subtype', 'image archival system', 'image processing', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'interest', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'oncology', 'open source', 'predict clinical outcome', 'predictive modeling', 'quantitative imaging', 'repository', 'response', 'statistics', 'success', 'survival prediction', 'tool', 'treatment response', 'tumor', 'vector', 'web based interface']",NCI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,U01,2016,626891,9.905898273298657e-05
"Body Surface Tracking of Complex Motion with Obstructed Viewing in Hybrid Imaging ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): During medical imaging, patient motion is virtually unavoidable presenting a significant source of image degradation and artifacts, which in turn, can impact the quality of care received by many patients. One method used to address patient motion is to employ visual tracking systems (VTS), which involves placing a small number of reflective markers on the patient that can be located and tracked in 3D space using stereo cameras. The tracked markers can then be used as a surrogate to a structure of interest, such as the heart. The tracked surrogate provides a quantifiable measure that can be directly correlated with the motion of the target structure, which can then be used for prospective or retrospective motion correction. However, the markers add complexity to patient workflow, provide only a sparse sampling of the patient's surface, and the optimal number and placement of markers is unknown. This project addresses the shortcomings of marker-based VTS systems by proposing to develop and test a novel low-cost marker-less VTS system for tracking patient motion within a hybrid imaging system. The primary barrier for successfully tracking the patient's body surface using marker-less VTS is that clothing prevents an unobstructed view of the patient's body. The candidate, Dr. Lindsay, is proposing to incorporate a translational method using computational approaches to compensate for garments within the proposed marker-less VTS system. Dr. Lindsay has received training in computer science and computer vision and previously has focused on the computational aspects of capturing, modeling, and rendering of physical phenomena such as light and is proposing to extend this knowledge to the medical imaging field. Dr. Lindsay's goals for this proposal are to acquire the necessary training and skills that will allow him to translate his expertise and existing computational skills to an area f research with medical relevance: namely, detecting and tracking patient motion for the purpose of improving motion correction for hybrid- imaging. Dr. Lindsay's long-term career goal is to become an accomplished independent investigator focusing on solving significant problems in medical imaging by translating advances in Computer Science. The proposed work will take place the University of Massachusetts Medical Center (UMass) in Worcester, MA under the primary mentorship of Dr. Michael King, an internationally known expert in the area of medical imaging and medical physics in Nuclear Medicine. Drs. Gennert, Sullivan, Licho have expertise in computer vision, mechanical engineering and medical imaging, and radiology and Nuclear Medicine, respectively will also serve as co-mentors.  The specific aims of the proposed project are to: 1) develop a novel marker-less VTS, which we call PT- Cam, using low-cost using state-of-the-art camera technology, 2) model surface motion as a surrogate for internal motion of the heart, and 3) conduct tests of the PT-Cam system, in order to determine the acceptability and feasibility of clinical usage, on patients undergoing clinical MPI PET/CT imaging. Thus, the main objective of this program of research is to develop a clinically viable method for motion tracking patients undergoing hybrid-imaging studies by using a novel marker-less surface-tracking method that can compensate for clothing and provide modeling of interior motion of structures from surface tracking. If successful, not only will this project provide an innovative, marker-less VTS system for low-cost surface tracking for motion compensation during hybrid imaging but it will also give the candidate the necessary training needed to become an independent investigator in the medical field and potentially a leader in the field of medical imaging. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: It is estimated that 7.2 million people per year die world-wide from coronary artery disease (CAD), and myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) has become a critical tool for screening, diagnosis, prognosis, and monitoring treatment of CAD. During medical imaging such as MPI, patient motion is virtually unavoidable and presents a significant source of image degradation and it has been suggested that upwards of 40% of cardiac studies in PET are effected by some type of motion with similar findings for SPECT. The proposed project will directly address the shortcomings of previous methods for tracking patient motion by developing and testing a novel low-cost marker-less visual tracking system for patient motion within hybrid imaging.",Body Surface Tracking of Complex Motion with Obstructed Viewing in Hybrid Imaging,9132242,K25EB019032,"['Address', 'Area', 'Award', 'Body Surface', 'Cardiac', 'Clinical', 'Clothing', 'Complex', 'Computer Graphics', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Discipline of Nuclear Medicine', 'Elements', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Financial compensation', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heart', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Individual', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Lasers', 'Light', 'Lighting', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Marketing', 'Massachusetts', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Medical center', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Myocardial perfusion', 'National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering', 'Optics', 'PET/CT scan', 'Patients', 'Physics', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Property', 'Quality of Care', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Respiration', 'Sampling', 'Security', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Staging', 'Statistical Methods', 'Strategic Planning', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Universities', 'Work', 'base', 'career', 'computer science', 'cost', 'follow-up', 'heart motion', 'imaging system', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'new technology', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'outcome forecast', 'prevent', 'programs', 'prospective', 'research and development', 'respiratory', 'screening', 'single photon emission computed tomography', 'skills', 'skills training', 'success', 'tool', 'validation studies', 'visual tracking', 'volunteer']",NIBIB,UNIV OF MASSACHUSETTS MED SCH WORCESTER,K25,2016,169609,0.0019844236005930223
"Statistical methods for large and complex databases of ultra-high-dimensional DESCRIPTION: Medical imaging is a cornerstone of basic science and clinical practice. To discover new mechanisms and markers of disease and their crucial implications for clinical practice, large multi-center imaging studies are acquiring terabytes of complex multi-modality imaging data cross-sectionally and longitudinally over decades. The statistical analysis of data from such studies is challenging due to the complex structure of the imaging data acquired and the ultra-high dimensionality. Furthermore, the heterogeneity of anatomy, pathology, and imaging protocols causes instability and failure of many current state-of-the-art image analysis methods. This grant proposes statistical frameworks for studying populations through biomedical imaging, scalable and robust methods for the identification and accurate quantification of pathology, and analytic tools for the cross-sectional and longitudinal examination of etiology and disease progression. These techniques will be applied to address key goals of the motivating large and multi- center studies of multiple sclerosis and Alzheimer's disease conducted at Johns Hopkins Hospital, the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, and across the globe. The project will create methods for uncovering and quantifying brain lesion pathology, incidence, and trajectory. Methods developed under this grant will be targeted towards these neuroimaging goals, but will form the basis for statistical image analysis methods applicable broadly in the biomedical sciences.

"New Techniques for Measuring Volumetric Structural Changes in Glaucoma ABSTRACT  This K99/R00 application supports additional research training in computational mathematics and computer vision which will enable Dr. Madhusudhanan Balasubramanian-the applicant, to become an independent multidisciplinary investigator in computational ophthalmology. Specifically, in the K99 training phase of this grant, Dr. Balasubramanian will train at UC San Diego under the direction of Linda Zangwill PhD, an established glaucoma clinical researcher in the Department of Ophthalmology, as well as a team of co- mentors, including, Dr. Michael Holst from the Department of Mathematics and co-director for the Center for Computational Mathematics, and co-director of the Comptutational Science, Mathematics and Engineering and Dr. David Kriegman from Computer Science and Engineering. Training will be conducted via formal coursework, hands-on lab training, mentored research, progress review by an advisory committee, visiting collaborating researchers and regular attendance at seminars and workshops. The subsequent R00 independent research phase involves applying Dr. Balasubramanian's newly acquired computational techniques to the difficult task of identifying glaucomatous change over time from optical images of the optic nerve head and retinal nerve fiber layer.  A documented presence of progressive optic neuropathy is the best gold standard currently available for glaucoma diagnosis. Confocal Scanning Laser Ophthalmoscope (CSLO) and Spectral Domain Optical Coherence Tomography (SD-OCT) are two of the optical imaging instruments available for monitoring the optic nerve head health in glaucoma diagnosis and management. Currently, several statistical and computational techniques are available for detecting localized glaucomatous changes from the CSLO exams. SD-OCT is a new generation ophthalmic imaging instrument based on the principle of optical interferometry. In contrast to the CSLO technology, SDOCT can resolve retinal layers from the internal limiting membrane (ILM) through the Bruch's membrane and can capture the 3-D architecture of the optic nerve head at a very high resolution. These high-resolution, high-dimensional volume scans introduce a new level of data complexity not seen in glaucoma progression analysis before and therefore, powerful (high-performance) computational techniques are required to fully utilize the high precision retinal measurements for glaucoma diagnosis. The central focus of this application in the K99 mentored phase of the application will be in 1) developing computational and statistical techniques for detecting structural glaucomatous changes in various retinal layers from the SDOCT scans, and 2) developing a new avenue of research in glaucoma management where in strain in retinal layers will be estimated non-invasively to characterize glaucomatous progression. In the R00 independent phase, the specific aims focus on developing 1) statistical and computational techniques for detecting volumetric glaucomatous change over time using 3-D SD-OCT volume scans and 2) a computational framework to estimate full-field 3-D volumetric strain from the standard SD-OCT scans. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Detecting the onset and progression of glaucomatous changes in the eye is central to glaucoma diagnosis and management. This multidisciplinary project focuses on developing powerful (high-performance) computational, mathematical, and statistical techniques for detecting volumetric glaucomatous changes from the Confocal Scanning Laser Ophthalmoscopy (CSLO) scans and volumetric Spectral Domain Optical Coherence Tomography (SD-OCT) scans of the optic nerve head. In addition, the Principal Investigator of this proposal will receive extensive training in the areas of computational mathematics and computer vision to augment and strengthen his multidisciplinary expertise essential to execute the proposed specific aims.",New Techniques for Measuring Volumetric Structural Changes in Glaucoma,8989994,R00EY020518,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Advisory Committees', 'Affect', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Biology', 'Blindness', 'Brain imaging', 'Bruch&apos', 's basal membrane structure', 'Cardiology', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Computational Technique', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Confocal Microscopy', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease Progression', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Educational workshop', 'Elements', 'Engineering', 'Eye', 'Functional disorder', 'Gastroenterology', 'Generations', 'Genetic screening method', 'Glaucoma', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Image', 'Imaging Device', 'Interferometry', 'Lasers', 'Lead', 'Left', 'Mathematics', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Membrane', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'National Eye Institute', 'National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering', 'Onset of illness', 'Ophthalmology', 'Ophthalmoscopes', 'Ophthalmoscopy', 'Optic Disk', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Optics', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Principal Investigator', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Resolution', 'Retinal', 'Scanning', 'Science', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Effectiveness', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Validation', 'Vision', 'Vision research', 'Visit', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'bioimaging', 'blood flow measurement', 'cancer imaging', 'computer framework', 'computer science', 'cost', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'improved', 'instrument', 'mathematical sciences', 'medical specialties', 'multidisciplinary', 'optic nerve disorder', 'optical imaging', 'prevent', 'programs', 'retinal nerve fiber layer', 'spectrograph', 'symposium', 'time use']",NEI,UNIVERSITY OF MEMPHIS,R00,2016,230028,0.053425399075291306
"Detection of Glaucoma Progression with Macular OCT Imaging DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application is a formal request for a career development award (K23) for an academic glaucoma specialist with a serious interest in the role of imaging in glaucoma using optical coherence tomography (OCT). This will allow the candidate to establish a clinical research program with the main goal of improving detection of glaucoma progression through macular imaging with spectral-domain OCT. By the time the proposed research is accomplished, the candidate will have preliminary data for continuing his research as an independent investigator and will have collected longitudinal structural and functional data in a group of advanced glaucoma patients that will serve as a platform for further improving detection of glaucoma progression with macular OCT imaging. The data will help the candidate provide preliminary results for a subsequent R01 that would potentially allow the PI to continue follow-up of the patients enrolled in the K23 award period.  I have a Master's of Science degree in Clinical Investigation under my belt and intend to deepen my skills in the field of imaging and biostatistics (to be used for enhancing and handling OCT images and for analyzing longitudinal data) by completing the proposed didactic program. By the end of the award period, I expect that I will have gained additional experience, knowledge, and mentorship required to prosper as an independent clinician-scientist in the field of glaucoma. My long-term goal is to carry out longitudinal studies of glaucoma patients where current and upcoming imaging and functional tests can be applied and their utility for detection of glaucoma progression can be investigated. I am confident that the combined skills and experience of my mentors will lead to a successful outcome for the proposed K award. I also envisage myself mentoring candidates like myself in future so that our collective knowledge and wisdom can be passed along to the next generation of aspiring clinician-scientists.  My objectives during the award period are as follows: 1) To develop an individual research program in glaucoma diagnostic imaging; 2) to successfully complete credited coursework in biomathematics, advanced biostatistics, computer vision (image processing), epidemiology, and ethical issues in research.  The main goal of the research component of this proposal is to better delineate the role of macular SD- OCT imaging for detection of glaucoma progression in advanced glaucoma. The specific aims through which this goal will be accomplished are as follows:  (1) To compare the performance of various global and regional macular measures to detect glaucoma.  The potential factors influencing the performance of various macular outcome measures will be explored. Such covariates include age, race, axial length, disc size, central corneal thickness,  OCT signal strength, and outer retinal thickness among others. I hypothesize that the thickness  of the outer retina (outer nuclear layer to retinal pigment epithelium-Bruch's membrane  complex) may be the most important factor explaining the measurement variability of the inner  retinal layer thickness (GCC or ganglion cell/inner plexiform layers).  (2) To determine and compare the utility of the candidate macular measures, detected through the first  aim, for detection of glaucoma progression in moderately advanced to severe glaucoma.  Moderately advanced to severe glaucoma will be defined as eyes with visual field mean  deviation worse than -6 dB or eyes with involvement of the central 10 degrees on the 24-2  visual field. It is widely accepted that measurement of the optic nerve head or RNFL parameters  in advanced glaucoma does not provide clinicians with much useful information. In contrast, the  central macular ganglion cells are the last to die in glaucoma. Macular imaging in advanced  glaucoma is directed towards this area where detection of change may still be possible. I  hypothesize that macular OCT parameters are valid structural outcome measures (biomarkers)  that can be used to follow the course of the disease in advanced glaucoma and that such  measures are significantly correlated with changes in the central visual field. Changes in the  macular measures over time will be first correlated with the corresponding visual field change  (functional progression) over time in eyes with moderately advanced to severe glaucoma. The  utility of the best candidate macular measures for predicting subsequent glaucoma progression  will also be explored and compared. I hypothesize that there may be a lag period between  progressive loss of macular ganglion cells and subsequent visual field progression in advanced  glaucoma, and therefore, detection of worsening in one or more macular outcome measures  can be used as a proxy for subsequent visual field progression.  Collectively, these studies will provide a solid foundation for better understanding and integration of macular OCT imaging in the care of glaucoma patients. Timely detection of glaucoma progression in the later stages can significantly reduce visual disability and blindness through earlier aggressive treatment and will potentially reduce glaucoma's financial burden to society. Detection of glaucoma progression remains a challenging task in eyes demonstrating significant damage. Even small amounts of progression in advanced glaucoma can have important consequences with regard to patient's visual function and quality of life. The results of the proposed study will potentially lead to more effective and earlier detection of glaucoma progression and will allow ophthalmologists to step up treatment in a timely manner. This will in turn result in less visual morbidity and reduced blindness from glaucoma, which is projected to cause more than 10 million cases of legal blindness around the world in 2020.",Detection of Glaucoma Progression with Macular OCT Imaging,9084580,K23EY022659,"['Age', 'Area', 'Award', 'Biological Markers', 'Biometry', 'Blindness', 'Bruch&apos', 's basal membrane structure', 'Caring', 'Clinical Research', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Cornea', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Enrollment', 'Epidemiology', 'Ethical Issues', 'Evaluation', 'Eye', 'Foundations', 'Functional Imaging', 'Future', 'Glaucoma', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Inner Plexiform Layer', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Legal Blindness', 'Length', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Master of Science', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Nerve Fibers', 'Noise', 'Ophthalmologist', 'Optic Disk', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Process', 'Proxy', 'Quality of life', 'Race', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Retinal', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Signal Transduction', 'Societies', 'Solid', 'Specialist', 'Staging', 'Structure of retinal pigment epithelium', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'Visual Fields', 'advanced disease', 'biomathematics', 'central visual field', 'clinical investigation', 'disability', 'experience', 'field study', 'follow-up', 'ganglion cell', 'image processing', 'improved', 'interest', 'macula', 'next generation', 'programs', 'retina outer nuclear layer', 'retinal nerve fiber layer', 'skills']",NEI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,K23,2016,229139,0.07601702758201351
"Adaptive Large-Scale Framework for Automatic Biomedical Image Segmentation DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Multi-atlas label fusion (MALF) is a powerful new technology that can automatically detect and label anatomical structures in biomedical images. It is arguably the most successful general-purpose automatic image segmentation technique ever developed. Automatic segmentation is in high demand in clinical and research applications of medical imaging, since segmentation forms a crucial step towards extracting quantitative information from imaging data, and since manual and semi-automatic approaches are ill suited for today's increasingly large and complex imaging datasets. Despite a number of papers that demonstrated outstanding performance of MALF methods across a range of biomedical imaging applications, the broader biomedical imaging research community has been slow to adopt this technique. This can be explained by multiple factors, including the technique's high computational demands, lack of a turnkey software implementation, as well as scarcity of validation in clinical imaging datasets and in the presence of extensive pathology. The present application seeks to remove these barriers and to enable a broad range of clinicians and biomedical researchers to take advantage of MALF technology. It builds on our strong track record of innovation in the MALF field, including a novel redundancy-correcting MALF technique that led in segmentation grand challenges in the past two years. Aim 1 seeks to improve the computational performance of MALF by replacing dense deformable image registration, by far the most time consuming component of MALF, with faster and less constrained sparse registration strategies. We hypothesize that this will not only reduce the computational cost of MALF, but will also make it more robust to anatomical variability, in particular enabling its use for tumor and lesion segmentation. Aim 2 proposes algorithmic extensions to MALF that support automatic segmentation of dynamic and multi-modality imaging datasets, which have been largely overlooked in the MALF literature. Aim 3 will develop a turnkey open-source implementation of MALF methodology. Taking advantage of cloud computing technology, this software will allow users with minimal image processing expertise to take full advantage of MALF segmentation on their desktop. Aim 3 will also provide a set of publicly available atlases and the means for users to build new custom atlas sets from their own data. Aim 4 will perform extensive evaluation of the new methods and software in challenging real-world clinical imaging data, including brain and cardiac imaging. As part of this evaluation, we will quantify how well our MALF approach and competing techniques generalize to novel imaging datasets with heterogeneity in acquisition parameters and clinical phenotypes. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This research will make it possible for a wide community of researchers who collect and analyze medical imaging data to take advantage of a new class of computer algorithms that very accurately label and measure anatomical structures and pathological formations in medical images. By offering more accurate image-derived measurements, the project promises to improve the accuracy of diagnosis, reduce the costs of biomedical re- search studies and pharmaceutical trials, and accelerate scientific discovery.",Adaptive Large-Scale Framework for Automatic Biomedical Image Segmentation,9119513,R01EB017255,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Atlases', 'Biomedical Research', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Cardiac', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Cloud Computing', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Consensus', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dementia', 'Diagnostic', 'Evaluation', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'High Performance Computing', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'International', 'Intervention Studies', 'Joints', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Literature', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Medical Imaging', 'Medical Research', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Multiple Sclerosis Lesions', 'Myocardium', 'Paper', 'Pathology', 'Patient Care', 'Performance', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Public Domains', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'S-nitro-N-acetylpenicillamine', 'Scheme', 'Services', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Temporal Lobe Epilepsy', 'Time', 'Training', 'Ultrasonography', 'Uncertainty', 'Validation', 'Work', 'aortic valve', 'base', 'bioimaging', 'cardiovascular visualization', 'clinical application', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinical practice', 'cloud based', 'cohort', 'cost', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'experience', 'image processing', 'image registration', 'imaging Segmentation', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'multi-atlas segmentation', 'new technology', 'novel', 'open source', 'outreach', 'research study', 'success', 'targeted imaging', 'tool', 'tumor']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2016,597688,0.023712730538525673
"Ultra-miniaturized single fiber probe for functional brain imaging in freely moving animals ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Microscope techniques to image inside brain tissue are generally limited by poor depth penetration. Micro-endoscopy, wherein a probe is physically inserted into the tissue, can overcome this limitation in depth penetration, but at the expense of invasiveness and tissue damage due to the size of the probe. Our goal here is to palliate these problems by developing an ultra-miniature microendoscope probe based on a single, lensless optical fiber.  The direct transmission of an image through an optical ﬁber is diﬃcult because spatial information becomes scrambled upon propagation. We have recently demonstrated an image transmission strategy where spatial information is ﬁrst converted to spectral information. Our strategy is based on a principle of spread-spectrum encoding, borrowed from wireless communications, wherein object pixels are converted into distinct spectral codes that span the full bandwidth of the object spectrum. Image recovery is performed by numerical inversion of the detected spectrum at the ﬁber output. We have provided a simple demonstration of spread-spectrum encoding using macroscopic Fabry-Perot etalons. Our technique enables the 2D imaging of luminous (i.e. fluorescent or bioluminescent) objects with high throughput independent of pixel number. Moreover, it is insensitive to ﬁber bending, contains no moving parts, and opens the attractive possibility of extreme miniaturization down to the size of a single optical fiber.  Our goal here is to develop, characterize, and establish the versatility of a new class of ultra-miniature fiber probes that can provide functional 2D brain imaging at arbitrary depths and with minimal tissue damage. Our strategy will involve probe development, machine-learning algorithm development, and the actual demonstration of microendoscopic imaging in freely moving behaving animals.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We have recently demonstrated a strategy to image through a single, lensless optical fiber.

"Kernel-based Nonlinear Learning for Fast Magnetic Resonance Imaging with Sub-Nyquist Sampling ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The quest for fast image acquisition speed has always been a perennial topic in the MRI community. To reduce the acquisition time for maximal spatial and temporal resolution, modern MRI protocols usually perform reduced acquisitions below the Nyquist rate. The reduced data is then used to reconstruct the image through advanced reconstruction techniques that leverage some prior information about the MRI system (e.g., parallel imaging) and/or MR signal (e.g., compressed sensing). Since such prior information is patient and system specific, recent techniques obtain the prior information using training data obtained through an empirical calibration procedure. All existing methods assume the prior models are linear. Since the intrinsic nonlinear relationship in the training data cannot be characterized in such simple models, the reconstruction is degraded by the inaccuracy of the prior information. Nonlinear learning from the training data have proven to be more powerful in machine learning because it is more general and includes the linear model as a special case. However, it is usually more challenging to learn the nonlinear models and even more challenging to incorporate the model in reconstruction due to the increased degree of freedom. We recently have introduced a novel concept of ""kernel"" in MR reconstruction to address the above challenges timely. Our preliminary results on parallel imaging and sparsity-constrained reconstruction demonstrate that the kernel-based algorithms improve the reconstruction quality over the original algorithms with linear prior models. Built upon our strong preliminary results, the objective of this application is to develop an innovative kernel-based framework for MR image reconstruction from undersampled data. This framework does not require explicit knowledge of nonlinear mapping (as in preliminary work) such that a broader family of nonlinear functions can be explored for different clinical applications. The proposed work is expected to advance the field of MR image reconstruction vertically. Specifically, the successful completion of the proposed project will result in a general framework leading to many new algorithms (including two developed in this project) for reconstruction from reduced acquisition. Therefore, virtually all of current clinical MRI could benefit from the improved resolution, image quality, and/or reduced acquisition times that the new framework will facilitate or the novel applications i may enable.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research is to develop a general framework and two specific new techniques to improve the spatial resolution and/or reduce the scan time in magnetic resonance imaging and evaluate the performance of the techniques for 3D parallel imaging and quantitative imaging in brain. The development of such novel fast imaging techniques may greatly enhance diagnosis of neurological disease. Therefore the project will potentially benefit numerous subjects and the healthcare system.            ",Kernel-based Nonlinear Learning for Fast Magnetic Resonance Imaging with Sub-Nyquist Sampling,8953102,R21EB020861,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Brain', 'Calibration', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dictionary', 'Family', 'Freedom', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Industry', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Letters', 'Linear Models', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Non-linear Models', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physics', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Procedures', 'Protocols documentation', 'Qualifying', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Software Tools', 'Speed', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'Weight', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical application', 'image reconstruction', 'improved', 'innovation', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'quantitative imaging', 'reconstruction', 'temporal measurement']",NIBIB,STATE UNIVERSITY OF NEW YORK AT BUFFALO,R21,2015,180330,0.014884071627885243
"Large-Scale Reconstruction of Microvascular Networks and the Surrounding Cellular DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A career development plan is proposed for Dr. David Mayerich, a computer scientist who is committed to developing an interdisciplinary career in biomedical engineering, with a focus on the collection and analysis of large-scale data sets at sub-micrometer resolution. His graduate research was in the areas of computer visualization and optical imaging, where his work lead to the development of the prototype Knife-Edge Scanning Microscope (KESM). This is the first instrument capable of imaging three-dimensional macro-scale tissue volumes at sub-micrometer resolution while providing a data rate approaching the transfer speed of most modern computer systems.         Since receiving his Ph.D., Dr. Mayerich worked as a postdoctoral fellow at the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science and Technology at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, where he has worked with biologists and biomedical engineers to develop tools for the segmentation and classification of large data sets. This provided experience in addressing the needs and limitations of the computational tools available to the interdisciplinary community.        The goal of the mentored phase of this proposal is to provide Dr. Mayerich with the opportunity to work as a developer for the FARSIGHT Toolkit. The FARSIGHT Toolkit is an open-source segmentation toolkit that focuses on developing computer vision algorithms specifically tailored to deal with the unique structures found in microscopy data sets. This project is directed by Prof. Badrinath Roysam at the University of Houston, and was awarded first-place in the NIH-sponsored DIADEM Challenge in neuron segmentation. Dr. Mayerich will use his previous experience in biomedical segmentation, GPU-based computing, and efficient data structures to help make the FARSIGHT Toolkit scalable to the terabyte-scale data sets produced using next-generation high-throughput imaging techniques. Dr. Mayerich will receive mentoring in the algorithms and techniques used in the FARSIGHT Toolkit, as well as valuable experience working on a collaborative software development project.         The goal of the independent phase is to use recently developed imaging techniques, along with scalable segmentation algorithms, to construct complete microvascular models of mouse organs. Recent advances in KESM demonstrate that sub-micrometer images of 1cm3 tissue samples can be collected in less than 50 hours. These images have the resolution and quality necessary for (a) complete reconstruction of microvascular networks in whole organs, and (b) the geometric distribution of cell soma in relation to this network. Models describing cellular and microvascular relationships have implications in several diseases, including neurodegenerative disease and tumor growth, as well as clinical applications in tissue engineering and the quantitative analysis of angiogenic drugs and therapies. PROJECT NARRATIVE The goal of this work is to produce high-resolution microvascular models from mouse brain tissue, as well as create algorithms for querying, distributing, and building models from next-generation high-throughput microscopy data sets. These techniques will allow researchers to create large-scale blood flow simulations, simulate the extent of tissue damage due to stroke or aneurism, and explore the relationships between cells and microvessels on a tissue-wide scale. Clinical applications include the quantification of angiogenesis in tumors and tissue implants, and the quantification of neurovascular effects in neurodegenerative disease models.",Large-Scale Reconstruction of Microvascular Networks and the Surrounding Cellular,8920669,R00LM011390,"['Active Learning', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Atlases', 'Award', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Blood Vessels', 'Blood flow', 'Brain', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Classification', 'Clinical Research', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Systems', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Hour', 'Illinois', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Implant', 'Institutes', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Memory', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Microscope', 'Microscopy', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurons', 'Online Systems', 'Organ', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Process', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Speed', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Tissue Engineering', 'Tissue Sample', 'Tissue Stains', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Transgenic Organisms', 'Tumor Angiogenesis', 'Tumor Tissue', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'angiogenesis', 'base', 'brain tissue', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical application', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'experience', 'imaging Segmentation', 'improved', 'instrument', 'memory process', 'model building', 'mouse model', 'neuronal cell body', 'next generation', 'open source', 'optical imaging', 'programs', 'prototype', 'reconstruction', 'research study', 'simulation', 'software development', 'success', 'tool', 'tumor growth']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF HOUSTON,R00,2015,239130,0.01400414084046362
"Bioinformatics Strategies for Multidimensional Brain Imaging Genetics DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Today's generation of multi-modal imaging systems produces massive high dimensional data sets, which when coupled with high throughput genotyping data such as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), provide exciting opportunities to enhance our understanding of phenotypic characteristics and the genetic architecture of human diseases. However, the unprecedented scale and complexity of these data sets have presented critical computational bottlenecks requiring new concepts and enabling tools. To address these challenges, using the study of Alzheimer's disease (AD) as a test bed, this project will develop and validate novel bioinformatics strategies for multidimensional brain imaging genetics. Aim 1 is to develop a novel bi- multivariate analysis strategy, S3K-CCA, for studying imaging genetic associations. Existing imaging genetics methods are typically designed to discover single-SNP-single-QT, single-SNP-multi-QT or multi-SNP-single- QT associations, and have limited power in revealing complex relationships between interlinked genetic markers and correlated brain phenotypes. To overcome this limitation, S3K-CCA is designed to be a sparse bi- multivariate learning model that simultaneously uses multiple response variables with multiple predictors for analyzing large-scale multi-modal neurogenomic data. Aim 2 is to develop HD-BIG, a visualization and systems biology framework for integrative analysis of High-Dimensional Brain Imaging Genetics data. Machine learning strategies to seamlessly incorporate valuable domain knowledge to produce biologically meaningful results is still an under-explored area in imaging genetics. In this aim, we will develop a user-friendly heat map interface to visualize high-dimensional results, adjust learning parameters and strategies, interact with existing bioinformatics resources and tools, and facilitate visual exploratory and systems biology analysis. A novel imaging genetic enrichment analysis (IGEA) method will be developed to identify relevant genetic pathways and associated brain circuits, and to reveal complex relationships among them. Aim 3 is to evaluate the proposed S3K-CCA and IGEA methods and the HD-BIG framework using both simulated and real imaging genetics data. This project is expected to produce novel bioinformatics algorithms and tools for comprehensive joint analysis of large scale heterogeneous imaging genetics data. The availability of these powerful methods is critical to the success of many imaging genetics initiatives. In addition, they can also help enable new computational applications in other areas of biomedical research where systematic and integrative analysis of large-scale multi-modal data is critical. Using AD as an exemplar, the proposed methods will demonstrate the potential for enhancing mechanistic understanding of complex disorders, which can benefit public health outcomes by facilitating diagnostic and therapeutic progress. Public Health Relevance (Narrative) Recent advances in multi-modal imaging and high throughput genotyping techniques provide exciting opportunities to enhance our understanding of phenotypic characteristics and underlying genetic mechanisms associated with human diseases. This proposal seeks to develop new bi-multivariate machine learning models and novel enrichment analysis methods, coupled with a visualization and systems biology framework, for integrative analysis of high-dimensional brain imaging genetics data. The methods and tools are developed and evaluated in an imaging genetic study of Alzheimer's disease, and can also be applied to many other disorders to improve public health outcomes by facilitating diagnostic and therapeutic progress.",Bioinformatics Strategies for Multidimensional Brain Imaging Genetics,8913771,R01LM011360,"['Address', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Atlases', 'Beds', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Markers', 'Biomedical Research', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Epidemiology', 'Evaluation', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Markers', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genetic study', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Heart', 'Heating', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Investigation', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Ontology', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phenotype', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Structure', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Visual', 'base', 'cohort', 'density', 'design', 'genetic association', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'human disease', 'imaging system', 'improved', 'interest', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropsychological', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'public health relevance', 'public-private partnership', 'response', 'simulation', 'success', 'tool', 'trait', 'user-friendly']",NLM,INDIANA UNIV-PURDUE UNIV AT INDIANAPOLIS,R01,2015,330386,-0.0023047713524264445
"Computing, Optimizing, and Evaluating Quantitative Cancer Imaging Biomarkers ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Quantitative Imaging Network (QIN) is a consortium of centers developing quantitative image features, which are proving to be valuable biomarkers of the underlying cancer biology and that can be used for assessing response to treatment and predicting clinical outcome. It is now important to discover the best quantitative imaging features for detection of response to therapeutics, to identify subtypes of cancer, and to correlate with cancer genomics. However, progress is thwarted by the lack of shared software algorithms, architectures, and resources required to compute, compare, evaluate, and disseminate these quantitative imaging features within the QIN and the broader community. We propose to develop the Quantitative Imaging Feature Pipeline (QIFP), a cloud-based, open source platform that will give researchers free access to these capabilities and hasten the introduction of quantitative image biomarkers into single- and multi-center clinical trials. The QIFP will facilitate assessment of the incremental value of new vs. existing image feature sets. It will also allow researchers to add their own algorithms to compute novel quantitative image features in their own studies and to disseminate them to the greater research community. To accomplish this: (1) We will create an expandable library of quantitative imaging feature algorithms capable of comprehensive characterization of the imaging phenotype of cancer. It will support a broad set of imaging modalities and algorithms implemented in a variety of languages, including algorithms that provide volumetric and time-varying assessment of lesion size, shape, edge sharpness, and pixel statistics. (2) We will build a cloud-based software architecture for creating, executing, and comparing quantitative image feature-generating pipelines, including algorithms in the library and/or those supplied by QIN or other researchers as plug-ins. QIFP will also have (a) a machine learning engine that lets users specify a dependent variable (e.g., progression-free survival) that the quantitative image features can used to predict, and (b) an evaluation engine that compares the utility of particular features for predicting the dependent variable. (3) We will assess the QIFP in four ways: (a) by its ability to recapitulate the role of known biomarkers in a related clinical trial, (b) by comparing linear measurement, metabolic tumor burden and novel combinations of the features in our library for predicting one-year progression-free survival, (c) by merging imaging features with known host-, drug- and tumor-based follicular lymphoma biomarkers in order to develop the most robust and integrative predictive model for patient outcomes, and (d) by using the QIFP to combine and to evaluate image feature algorithms developed by another QIN team and our own NCI- funded team in the study of radiogenomics of non-small cell lung cancer. The QIFP will fill a substantial gap in the science currently being carried out in the QIN and in the community by providing the tools and infrastructure to assess the value of novel quantitative imaging features of cancer, and will thereby accelerate incorporating new imaging biomarkers into single and multi-center clinical trials and into oncology practice.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We propose to develop and evaluate a software platform that has major relevance for human health. Many investigators are pursuing image-based surrogates for response to therapy that could be used in clinical trials to predict their success/failure earlier and that are more accurate than existing surrogates. Our developments will facilitate sharing, assessing, and comparing combinations of image feature-generating software algorithms for predicting treatment response, survival, and tissue genomics, which will, in turn, greatly accelerate the development and acceptance of new and more relevant imaging surrogates for assessing cancer treatments.                ","Computing, Optimizing, and Evaluating Quantitative Cancer Imaging Biomarkers",8960049,U01CA187947,"['Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Cancer Biology', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Computer-Assisted Image Analysis', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group', 'Evaluation', 'Failure', 'Follicular Lymphoma', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression', 'Generations', 'Genomics', 'Health', 'Human', 'Image', 'Investigation', 'Java', 'Language', 'Lesion', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Metabolic', 'Modality', 'Molecular', 'Multi-Institutional Clinical Trial', 'Non-Small-Cell Lung Carcinoma', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Plug-in', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Progression-Free Survivals', 'Pythons', 'RNA Sequences', 'Radiogenomics', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Science', 'Shapes', 'Specific qualifier value', 'System', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissue Survival', 'Tissues', 'Tumor Burden', 'base', 'cancer genomics', 'cancer imaging', 'cancer therapy', 'cloud based', 'disorder subtype', 'image archival system', 'image processing', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'interest', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'oncology', 'open source', 'predictive modeling', 'public health relevance', 'quantitative imaging', 'repository', 'response', 'statistics', 'success', 'tool', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'treatment response', 'tumor', 'vector', 'web based interface']",NCI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,U01,2015,652612,9.905898273298657e-05
"Body Surface Tracking of Complex Motion with Obstructed Viewing in Hybrid Imaging ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): During medical imaging, patient motion is virtually unavoidable presenting a significant source of image degradation and artifacts, which in turn, can impact the quality of care received by many patients. One method used to address patient motion is to employ visual tracking systems (VTS), which involves placing a small number of reflective markers on the patient that can be located and tracked in 3D space using stereo cameras. The tracked markers can then be used as a surrogate to a structure of interest, such as the heart. The tracked surrogate provides a quantifiable measure that can be directly correlated with the motion of the target structure, which can then be used for prospective or retrospective motion correction. However, the markers add complexity to patient workflow, provide only a sparse sampling of the patient's surface, and the optimal number and placement of markers is unknown. This project addresses the shortcomings of marker-based VTS systems by proposing to develop and test a novel low-cost marker-less VTS system for tracking patient motion within a hybrid imaging system. The primary barrier for successfully tracking the patient's body surface using marker-less VTS is that clothing prevents an unobstructed view of the patient's body. The candidate, Dr. Lindsay, is proposing to incorporate a translational method using computational approaches to compensate for garments within the proposed marker-less VTS system. Dr. Lindsay has received training in computer science and computer vision and previously has focused on the computational aspects of capturing, modeling, and rendering of physical phenomena such as light and is proposing to extend this knowledge to the medical imaging field. Dr. Lindsay's goals for this proposal are to acquire the necessary training and skills that will allow him to translate his expertise and existing computational skills to an area f research with medical relevance: namely, detecting and tracking patient motion for the purpose of improving motion correction for hybrid- imaging. Dr. Lindsay's long-term career goal is to become an accomplished independent investigator focusing on solving significant problems in medical imaging by translating advances in Computer Science. The proposed work will take place the University of Massachusetts Medical Center (UMass) in Worcester, MA under the primary mentorship of Dr. Michael King, an internationally known expert in the area of medical imaging and medical physics in Nuclear Medicine. Drs. Gennert, Sullivan, Licho have expertise in computer vision, mechanical engineering and medical imaging, and radiology and Nuclear Medicine, respectively will also serve as co-mentors.  The specific aims of the proposed project are to: 1) develop a novel marker-less VTS, which we call PT- Cam, using low-cost using state-of-the-art camera technology, 2) model surface motion as a surrogate for internal motion of the heart, and 3) conduct tests of the PT-Cam system, in order to determine the acceptability and feasibility of clinical usage, on patients undergoing clinical MPI PET/CT imaging. Thus, the main objective of this program of research is to develop a clinically viable method for motion tracking patients undergoing hybrid-imaging studies by using a novel marker-less surface-tracking method that can compensate for clothing and provide modeling of interior motion of structures from surface tracking. If successful, not only will this project provide an innovative, marker-less VTS system for low-cost surface tracking for motion compensation during hybrid imaging but it will also give the candidate the necessary training needed to become an independent investigator in the medical field and potentially a leader in the field of medical imaging.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: It is estimated that 7.2 million people per year die world-wide from coronary artery disease (CAD), and myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) has become a critical tool for screening, diagnosis, prognosis, and monitoring treatment of CAD. During medical imaging such as MPI, patient motion is virtually unavoidable and presents a significant source of image degradation and it has been suggested that upwards of 40% of cardiac studies in PET are effected by some type of motion with similar findings for SPECT. The proposed project will directly address the shortcomings of previous methods for tracking patient motion by developing and testing a novel low-cost marker-less visual tracking system for patient motion within hybrid imaging.                ",Body Surface Tracking of Complex Motion with Obstructed Viewing in Hybrid Imaging,8968015,K25EB019032,"['Address', 'Area', 'Award', 'Body Surface', 'Cardiac', 'Clinical', 'Clothing', 'Complex', 'Computer Graphics', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Discipline of Nuclear Medicine', 'Elements', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Financial compensation', 'Goals', 'Heart', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Individual', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Lasers', 'Light', 'Lighting', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Marketing', 'Massachusetts', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Medical center', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Myocardial perfusion', 'National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering', 'Optics', 'PET/CT scan', 'Patients', 'Physics', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Property', 'Quality of Care', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Respiration', 'Sampling', 'Security', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Staging', 'Statistical Methods', 'Strategic Planning', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Universities', 'Work', 'base', 'career', 'computer science', 'cost', 'follow-up', 'heart motion', 'imaging system', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'new technology', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'outcome forecast', 'prevent', 'programs', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'research and development', 'respiratory', 'screening', 'single photon emission computed tomography', 'skills', 'skills training', 'success', 'tool', 'validation studies', 'visual tracking', 'volunteer']",NIBIB,UNIV OF MASSACHUSETTS MED SCH WORCESTER,K25,2015,169609,0.0019844236005930223
"Predicting and Detecting Glaucomatous Progression Using Pattern Recognition DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project aims to improve glaucoma management by applying novel pattern recognition techniques to improve the accurate prediction and detection of glaucomatous progression. The premise is that complex functional and structural tests in daily use by eye care providers contain hidden information that is not fully used in current analyses, and that advanced pattern recognition techniques can find and use that hidden information. The primary goals involve the use of mathematically rigorous techniques to discover patterns of defects and to track their changes in longitudinal series of perimetric and optical imaging data from up to 1800 glaucomatous and healthy eyes, available as the result of long-term NIH funding. With the interdisciplinary team of glaucoma and pattern recognition experts we have assembled, with our extensive NIH-supported database of eyes, and with the knowledge we have acquired in the optimal use of pattern recognition methods from previous NIH support, we believe the proposed work can enhance significantly the medical and surgical treatment of glaucoma and reduce the cost of glaucoma care. Moreover, improved techniques for predicting and detecting glaucomatous progression can be used for refined subject recruitment and to define endpoints for clinical trials of intraocular pressure-lowering and neuroprotective drugs. The proposed project will develop and demonstrate the usefulness of pattern recognition techniques for predicting and detecting patterns of glaucomatous change in patient eyes tested longitudinally by visual field and optical imaging instruments. This proposal addresses the current NEI Glaucoma and Optic Neuropathies Program objectives of developing improved diagnostic measures to characterize and detect optic nerve disease onset and characterize glaucomatous neurodegeneration within the visual pathways at structural and functional levels.

"Prostate Cancer Assessment Via Integrated 3D ARFI Elasticity Imaging and Multi-Parametric MRI ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Prostate cancer (PCA) is the most common non-skin cancer and the second leading cause of cancer death in American men, with over 186,000 new cases diagnosed and over 28,000 PCA deaths annually in the United States. Ultrasound-guided biopsy is the standard of care for confirming cancer, typically following elevated PSA levels; however, it has been estimated that up to 20% of men require three or more biopsy sessions for diagnosis, and biopsies have a high risk of hemorrhage and infection. Furthermore, biopsies are not sufficient for tumor delineation or characterization because they sparsely sample the entire organ. Regretfully, the deficiencies of biopsy have lead to over-treatment of indolent disease with radical prostatectomies, a drastic treatment that has significant risks of infection, hemorrhage, urinary incontinence, and impotence.  We are the inventors of Acoustic Radiation Force Impulse (ARFI) imaging and the inventors of Shear Wave Elasticity Imaging (SWEI) methods. We have now combined those methods into ARFI-SWEI imaging sequences that define a new and novel multi-parametric ultrasonic elasticity imaging system. This multi-parametric elasticity imaging approach provides an absolute, quantitative measure of tissue stiffness, at high resolution, in 3D, using ultrasound.  We hypothesize that synergistic diagnostic information from B-mode, ARFI-SWEI and multi-parametric MRI (mpMRI, e.g., diffusion weighted imaging and MR spectroscopy imaging) enable (a) the sensitive and specific diagnosis of PCA and (b) the accurate delineation of PCA margins.

"Statistical methods for large and complex databases of ultra-high-dimensional DESCRIPTION: Medical imaging is a cornerstone of basic science and clinical practice. To discover new mechanisms and markers of disease and their crucial implications for clinical practice, large multi-center imaging studies are acquiring terabytes of complex multi-modality imaging data cross-sectionally and longitudinally over decades. The statistical analysis of data from such studies is challenging due to the complex structure of the imaging data acquired and the ultra-high dimensionality. Furthermore, the heterogeneity of anatomy, pathology, and imaging protocols causes instability and failure of many current state-of-the-art image analysis methods. This grant proposes statistical frameworks for studying populations through biomedical imaging, scalable and robust methods for the identification and accurate quantification of pathology, and analytic tools for the cross-sectional and longitudinal examination of etiology and disease progression. These techniques will be applied to address key goals of the motivating large and multi- center studies of multiple sclerosis and Alzheimer's disease conducted at Johns Hopkins Hospital, the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, and across the globe. The project will create methods for uncovering and quantifying brain lesion pathology, incidence, and trajectory. Methods developed under this grant will be targeted towards these neuroimaging goals, but will form the basis for statistical image analysis methods applicable broadly in the biomedical sciences. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project involves the development of statistical frameworks and methods for the analysis of complex ultra-high-dimensional biomedical imaging.

"New Techniques for Measuring Volumetric Structural Changes in Glaucoma ABSTRACT  This K99/R00 application supports additional research training in computational mathematics and computer vision which will enable Dr. Madhusudhanan Balasubramanian-the applicant, to become an independent multidisciplinary investigator in computational ophthalmology. Specifically, in the K99 training phase of this grant, Dr. Balasubramanian will train at UC San Diego under the direction of Linda Zangwill PhD, an established glaucoma clinical researcher in the Department of Ophthalmology, as well as a team of co- mentors, including, Dr. Michael Holst from the Department of Mathematics and co-director for the Center for Computational Mathematics, and co-director of the Comptutational Science, Mathematics and Engineering and Dr. David Kriegman from Computer Science and Engineering. Training will be conducted via formal coursework, hands-on lab training, mentored research, progress review by an advisory committee, visiting collaborating researchers and regular attendance at seminars and workshops. The subsequent R00 independent research phase involves applying Dr. Balasubramanian's newly acquired computational techniques to the difficult task of identifying glaucomatous change over time from optical images of the optic nerve head and retinal nerve fiber layer.  A documented presence of progressive optic neuropathy is the best gold standard currently available for glaucoma diagnosis. Confocal Scanning Laser Ophthalmoscope (CSLO) and Spectral Domain Optical Coherence Tomography (SD-OCT) are two of the optical imaging instruments available for monitoring the optic nerve head health in glaucoma diagnosis and management. Currently, several statistical and computational techniques are available for detecting localized glaucomatous changes from the CSLO exams. SD-OCT is a new generation ophthalmic imaging instrument based on the principle of optical interferometry. In contrast to the CSLO technology, SDOCT can resolve retinal layers from the internal limiting membrane (ILM) through the Bruch's membrane and can capture the 3-D architecture of the optic nerve head at a very high resolution. These high-resolution, high-dimensional volume scans introduce a new level of data complexity not seen in glaucoma progression analysis before and therefore, powerful (high-performance) computational techniques are required to fully utilize the high precision retinal measurements for glaucoma diagnosis. The central focus of this application in the K99 mentored phase of the application will be in 1) developing computational and statistical techniques for detecting structural glaucomatous changes in various retinal layers from the SDOCT scans, and 2) developing a new avenue of research in glaucoma management where in strain in retinal layers will be estimated non-invasively to characterize glaucomatous progression. In the R00 independent phase, the specific aims focus on developing 1) statistical and computational techniques for detecting volumetric glaucomatous change over time using 3-D SD-OCT volume scans and 2) a computational framework to estimate full-field 3-D volumetric strain from the standard SD-OCT scans. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Detecting the onset and progression of glaucomatous changes in the eye is central to glaucoma diagnosis and management. This multidisciplinary project focuses on developing powerful (high-performance) computational, mathematical, and statistical techniques for detecting volumetric glaucomatous changes from the Confocal Scanning Laser Ophthalmoscopy (CSLO) scans and volumetric Spectral Domain Optical Coherence Tomography (SD-OCT) scans of the optic nerve head. In addition, the Principal Investigator of this proposal will receive extensive training in the areas of computational mathematics and computer vision to augment and strengthen his multidisciplinary expertise essential to execute the proposed specific aims.",New Techniques for Measuring Volumetric Structural Changes in Glaucoma,8798661,R00EY020518,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Advisory Committees', 'Affect', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Biology', 'Blindness', 'Brain imaging', 'Bruch&apos', 's basal membrane structure', 'Cardiology', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Computational Technique', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Confocal Microscopy', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease Progression', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Educational workshop', 'Elements', 'Engineering', 'Eye', 'Functional disorder', 'Gastroenterology', 'Generations', 'Genetic screening method', 'Glaucoma', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Image', 'Interferometry', 'Lasers', 'Lead', 'Left', 'Mathematics', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Membrane', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'National Eye Institute', 'National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering', 'Onset of illness', 'Ophthalmology', 'Ophthalmoscopes', 'Ophthalmoscopy', 'Optic Disk', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Optics', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Principal Investigator', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Resolution', 'Retinal', 'Scanning', 'Science', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Effectiveness', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Validation', 'Vision', 'Vision research', 'Visit', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'bioimaging', 'blood flow measurement', 'cancer imaging', 'computer framework', 'computer science', 'cost', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'improved', 'instrument', 'mathematical sciences', 'medical specialties', 'multidisciplinary', 'optic nerve disorder', 'optical imaging', 'prevent', 'programs', 'retinal nerve fiber layer', 'spectrograph', 'symposium', 'time use']",NEI,UNIVERSITY OF MEMPHIS,R00,2015,228148,0.053425399075291306
"Detection of Glaucoma Progression with Macular OCT Imaging DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application is a formal request for a career development award (K23) for an academic glaucoma specialist with a serious interest in the role of imaging in glaucoma using optical coherence tomography (OCT). This will allow the candidate to establish a clinical research program with the main goal of improving detection of glaucoma progression through macular imaging with spectral-domain OCT. By the time the proposed research is accomplished, the candidate will have preliminary data for continuing his research as an independent investigator and will have collected longitudinal structural and functional data in a group of advanced glaucoma patients that will serve as a platform for further improving detection of glaucoma progression with macular OCT imaging. The data will help the candidate provide preliminary results for a subsequent R01 that would potentially allow the PI to continue follow-up of the patients enrolled in the K23 award period.  I have a Master's of Science degree in Clinical Investigation under my belt and intend to deepen my skills in the field of imaging and biostatistics (to be used for enhancing and handling OCT images and for analyzing longitudinal data) by completing the proposed didactic program. By the end of the award period, I expect that I will have gained additional experience, knowledge, and mentorship required to prosper as an independent clinician-scientist in the field of glaucoma. My long-term goal is to carry out longitudinal studies of glaucoma patients where current and upcoming imaging and functional tests can be applied and their utility for detection of glaucoma progression can be investigated. I am confident that the combined skills and experience of my mentors will lead to a successful outcome for the proposed K award. I also envisage myself mentoring candidates like myself in future so that our collective knowledge and wisdom can be passed along to the next generation of aspiring clinician-scientists.  My objectives during the award period are as follows: 1) To develop an individual research program in glaucoma diagnostic imaging; 2) to successfully complete credited coursework in biomathematics, advanced biostatistics, computer vision (image processing), epidemiology, and ethical issues in research.  The main goal of the research component of this proposal is to better delineate the role of macular SD- OCT imaging for detection of glaucoma progression in advanced glaucoma. The specific aims through which this goal will be accomplished are as follows:  (1) To compare the performance of various global and regional macular measures to detect glaucoma.  The potential factors influencing the performance of various macular outcome measures will be explored. Such covariates include age, race, axial length, disc size, central corneal thickness,  OCT signal strength, and outer retinal thickness among others. I hypothesize that the thickness  of the outer retina (outer nuclear layer to retinal pigment epithelium-Bruch's membrane  complex) may be the most important factor explaining the measurement variability of the inner  retinal layer thickness (GCC or ganglion cell/inner plexiform layers).  (2) To determine and compare the utility of the candidate macular measures, detected through the first  aim, for detection of glaucoma progression in moderately advanced to severe glaucoma.  Moderately advanced to severe glaucoma will be defined as eyes with visual field mean  deviation worse than -6 dB or eyes with involvement of the central 10 degrees on the 24-2  visual field. It is widely accepted that measurement of the optic nerve head or RNFL parameters  in advanced glaucoma does not provide clinicians with much useful information. In contrast, the  central macular ganglion cells are the last to die in glaucoma. Macular imaging in advanced  glaucoma is directed towards this area where detection of change may still be possible. I  hypothesize that macular OCT parameters are valid structural outcome measures (biomarkers)  that can be used to follow the course of the disease in advanced glaucoma and that such  measures are significantly correlated with changes in the central visual field. Changes in the  macular measures over time will be first correlated with the corresponding visual field change  (functional progression) over time in eyes with moderately advanced to severe glaucoma. The  utility of the best candidate macular measures for predicting subsequent glaucoma progression  will also be explored and compared. I hypothesize that there may be a lag period between  progressive loss of macular ganglion cells and subsequent visual field progression in advanced  glaucoma, and therefore, detection of worsening in one or more macular outcome measures  can be used as a proxy for subsequent visual field progression.  Collectively, these studies will provide a solid foundation for better understanding and integration of macular OCT imaging in the care of glaucoma patients. Timely detection of glaucoma progression in the later stages can significantly reduce visual disability and blindness through earlier aggressive treatment and will potentially reduce glaucoma's financial burden to society. Detection of glaucoma progression remains a challenging task in eyes demonstrating significant damage. Even small amounts of progression in advanced glaucoma can have important consequences with regard to patient's visual function and quality of life. The results of the proposed study will potentially lead to more effective and earlier detection of glaucoma progression and will allow ophthalmologists to step up treatment in a timely manner. This will in turn result in less visual morbidity and reduced blindness from glaucoma, which is projected to cause more than 10 million cases of legal blindness around the world in 2020.",Detection of Glaucoma Progression with Macular OCT Imaging,8866409,K23EY022659,"['Age', 'Area', 'Award', 'Biological Markers', 'Biometry', 'Blindness', 'Bruch&apos', 's basal membrane structure', 'Caring', 'Clinical Research', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Cornea', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Enrollment', 'Epidemiology', 'Ethical Issues', 'Evaluation', 'Eye', 'Foundations', 'Functional Imaging', 'Future', 'Glaucoma', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Inner Plexiform Layer', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Legal Blindness', 'Length', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Master of Science', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Nerve Fibers', 'Noise', 'Ophthalmologist', 'Optic Disk', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Process', 'Proxy', 'Quality of life', 'Race', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Retinal', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Signal Transduction', 'Societies', 'Solid', 'Specialist', 'Staging', 'Structure of retinal pigment epithelium', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'Visual Fields', 'advanced disease', 'biomathematics', 'central visual field', 'clinical investigation', 'disability', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'ganglion cell', 'image processing', 'improved', 'interest', 'macula', 'next generation', 'programs', 'retina outer nuclear layer', 'retinal nerve fiber layer', 'skills']",NEI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,K23,2015,229139,0.07601702758201351
"Quantitative Image Analysis Techniques for Optic Nerve Disease DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Disorders of the optic nerve (ON) account for a significant percentage of the 20 most impactful ophthalmological conditions. Collectively, diseases of the ON are the number one cause of irreversible blindness worldwide, and present serious public health concerns in the U.S. Consider, for example, that glaucoma impacts more than three million Americans and costs the U.S. economy almost $3 billion per year. Optic neuritis (i.e., inflammatory demyelination of the ON) is the initial symptom in ~25% of all multipl sclerosis (MS) cases (which impacts over 400 thousand Americans and introduces societal health care costs of nearly $30 billion per year). Nearly two thirds of MS patients will experience episodes of optic neuritis in their lifetimes, and 40-60% of patients have visual defects localized to the ON. These disorders irreversibly damage the ON. Even so, damage to axons in the ON is progressive, defined by a window of opportunity for treatment between loss of function and actual degeneration. The potential for recovery exists because there are treatments that can help prevent progression if administered during this window of opportunity. Yet, we do not have effective means to assess who is in the window and who will benefit from treatment. We propose to translate computational imaging methods from the neuroimaging community to provide robust, quantitative tools for assessing the optic nerve (ON) on clinical and research imaging sequences. These efforts will improve prognostic accuracy, lead to better understanding of patient responses, and enhance targeted interventions. The technical hypothesis of this work is that quantitative image processing can robustly and accurately segment, register, and fuse ON data from modern MRI and CT clinical sequences. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that qualitative ON phenotypes on longitudinal clinical imaging will differentiate individuals who respond to treatment versus those who do not.  The overall goal of this research is to provide a foundation for image analysis of the ON and its relationships with pathological disorders. We will build upon recent advances in robust medical image computing to segment the ON in clinical CT and MRI acquisitions, develop registration procedures to establish intra- and inter-subject correspondence, and bring together information from the multi-modal battery of imaging studies that are typically used in clinical care (aim 1). With these new methods, we will address the exploratory hypothesis that quantitative use of clinical imaging data can increase prognostic accuracy (aim 2). We note that aim 2 is particularly exploratory and in line with the high- risk/high-reward aspect of this mechanism; many studies have shown that baseline imaging does not conclusively predict long term outcome or treatment response. We hypothesize that this may be because early findings are related to edema and inflammation rather than cellular damage per se. Once this exploratory phase is complete, we will pursue promising prognostic biomarkers using more detailed condition staging criteria and including more than two longitudinal time points in the analysis. Ultimately, these efforts will improve assessment ON disease and, in turn, patient care.

"Adaptive Large-Scale Framework for Automatic Biomedical Image Segmentation DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Multi-atlas label fusion (MALF) is a powerful new technology that can automatically detect and label anatomical structures in biomedical images. It is arguably the most successful general-purpose automatic image segmentation technique ever developed. Automatic segmentation is in high demand in clinical and research applications of medical imaging, since segmentation forms a crucial step towards extracting quantitative information from imaging data, and since manual and semi-automatic approaches are ill suited for today's increasingly large and complex imaging datasets. Despite a number of papers that demonstrated outstanding performance of MALF methods across a range of biomedical imaging applications, the broader biomedical imaging research community has been slow to adopt this technique. This can be explained by multiple factors, including the technique's high computational demands, lack of a turnkey software implementation, as well as scarcity of validation in clinical imaging datasets and in the presence of extensive pathology. The present application seeks to remove these barriers and to enable a broad range of clinicians and biomedical researchers to take advantage of MALF technology. It builds on our strong track record of innovation in the MALF field, including a novel redundancy-correcting MALF technique that led in segmentation grand challenges in the past two years. Aim 1 seeks to improve the computational performance of MALF by replacing dense deformable image registration, by far the most time consuming component of MALF, with faster and less constrained sparse registration strategies. We hypothesize that this will not only reduce the computational cost of MALF, but will also make it more robust to anatomical variability, in particular enabling its use for tumor and lesion segmentation. Aim 2 proposes algorithmic extensions to MALF that support automatic segmentation of dynamic and multi-modality imaging datasets, which have been largely overlooked in the MALF literature. Aim 3 will develop a turnkey open-source implementation of MALF methodology. Taking advantage of cloud computing technology, this software will allow users with minimal image processing expertise to take full advantage of MALF segmentation on their desktop. Aim 3 will also provide a set of publicly available atlases and the means for users to build new custom atlas sets from their own data. Aim 4 will perform extensive evaluation of the new methods and software in challenging real-world clinical imaging data, including brain and cardiac imaging. As part of this evaluation, we will quantify how well our MALF approach and competing techniques generalize to novel imaging datasets with heterogeneity in acquisition parameters and clinical phenotypes. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This research will make it possible for a wide community of researchers who collect and analyze medical imaging data to take advantage of a new class of computer algorithms that very accurately label and measure anatomical structures and pathological formations in medical images. By offering more accurate image-derived measurements, the project promises to improve the accuracy of diagnosis, reduce the costs of biomedical re- search studies and pharmaceutical trials, and accelerate scientific discovery.",Adaptive Large-Scale Framework for Automatic Biomedical Image Segmentation,8887334,R01EB017255,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Atlases', 'Biomedical Research', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Cardiac', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Cloud Computing', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Consensus', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dementia', 'Diagnostic', 'Evaluation', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'High Performance Computing', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'International', 'Joints', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Literature', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Medical Imaging', 'Medical Research', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Multiple Sclerosis Lesions', 'Myocardium', 'Paper', 'Pathology', 'Patient Care', 'Performance', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Public Domains', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'S-nitro-N-acetylpenicillamine', 'Scheme', 'Services', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Temporal Lobe Epilepsy', 'Time', 'Training', 'Ultrasonography', 'Uncertainty', 'Validation', 'Work', 'aortic valve', 'base', 'bioimaging', 'cardiovascular visualization', 'clinical application', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinical practice', 'cloud based', 'cohort', 'cost', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'experience', 'image processing', 'image registration', 'imaging Segmentation', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'new technology', 'novel', 'open source', 'outreach', 'research study', 'success', 'targeted imaging', 'tool', 'tumor']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2015,591379,0.023712730538525673
"Large-Scale Reconstruction of Microvascular Networks and the Surrounding Cellular DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A career development plan is proposed for Dr. David Mayerich, a computer scientist who is committed to developing an interdisciplinary career in biomedical engineering, with a focus on the collection and analysis of large-scale data sets at sub-micrometer resolution. His graduate research was in the areas of computer visualization and optical imaging, where his work lead to the development of the prototype Knife-Edge Scanning Microscope (KESM). This is the first instrument capable of imaging three-dimensional macro-scale tissue volumes at sub-micrometer resolution while providing a data rate approaching the transfer speed of most modern computer systems.         Since receiving his Ph.D., Dr. Mayerich worked as a postdoctoral fellow at the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science and Technology at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, where he has worked with biologists and biomedical engineers to develop tools for the segmentation and classification of large data sets. This provided experience in addressing the needs and limitations of the computational tools available to the interdisciplinary community.        The goal of the mentored phase of this proposal is to provide Dr. Mayerich with the opportunity to work as a developer for the FARSIGHT Toolkit. The FARSIGHT Toolkit is an open-source segmentation toolkit that focuses on developing computer vision algorithms specifically tailored to deal with the unique structures found in microscopy data sets. This project is directed by Prof. Badrinath Roysam at the University of Houston, and was awarded first-place in the NIH-sponsored DIADEM Challenge in neuron segmentation. Dr. Mayerich will use his previous experience in biomedical segmentation, GPU-based computing, and efficient data structures to help make the FARSIGHT Toolkit scalable to the terabyte-scale data sets produced using next-generation high-throughput imaging techniques. Dr. Mayerich will receive mentoring in the algorithms and techniques used in the FARSIGHT Toolkit, as well as valuable experience working on a collaborative software development project.         The goal of the independent phase is to use recently developed imaging techniques, along with scalable segmentation algorithms, to construct complete microvascular models of mouse organs. Recent advances in KESM demonstrate that sub-micrometer images of 1cm3 tissue samples can be collected in less than 50 hours. These images have the resolution and quality necessary for (a) complete reconstruction of microvascular networks in whole organs, and (b) the geometric distribution of cell soma in relation to this network. Models describing cellular and microvascular relationships have implications in several diseases, including neurodegenerative disease and tumor growth, as well as clinical applications in tissue engineering and the quantitative analysis of angiogenic drugs and therapies. PROJECT NARRATIVE The goal of this work is to produce high-resolution microvascular models from mouse brain tissue, as well as create algorithms for querying, distributing, and building models from next-generation high-throughput microscopy data sets. These techniques will allow researchers to create large-scale blood flow simulations, simulate the extent of tissue damage due to stroke or aneurism, and explore the relationships between cells and microvessels on a tissue-wide scale.

"SLASH: SCALABLE LARGE ANALYTIC SEGMENTATION HYBRID DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Advanced instrumentation and cellular imaging techniques using high-throughput 3D electron microscopy are driving a new revolution in the exploration of complex biological systems by providing near seamless views across multiple scales of resolution. These datasets provide the necessary breadth and depth to analyze multicellular, cellular, and subcelluar structure across large swathes of neural tissue. While these new imaging procedures are generating extremely large datasets of enormous value, the quantities are such that no single user or even laboratory team can possibly analyze the full content of their own imaging activities through traditional means. To address this challenge, we propose to further develop and refine a prototype hybrid system for high-throughput segmentation of large neuropil datasets that: 1) advances automatic algorithms for segmentation of cellular and sub-cellular structures using machine learning techniques; 2) couples these techniques to a scalable and flexible process or tool suite allowing multiple users to simultaneously review, edit and curate the results of these automatic approaches; and, 3) builds a knowledge base of training data guiding and improving automated processing. This system will allow project scientists to select areas of interest, execute automatic segmentation algorithms, and distribute workload, curate data, and deposit final results into the Cell Centered Database (Martone et al. 2008) via accessible web-interfaces. Emerging techniques in cellular and subcellular 3D imaging are generating datasets of enormous value to the study of disease processes and to the pursuit of greater insight into the structure and function of the nervous system. To unlock the potential of these data, new solutions are needed to improve the capability to segment and label the individual molecular, subcellular and cellular components within very large volumetric expanses. To address this challenge, we propose a hybrid system for high-throughput segmentation of large neuropil datasets that advances machine learning algorithms for automatic segmentation and couples these techniques to a scalable tool suite for multiple users to simultaneously review, edit and curate results.",SLASH: SCALABLE LARGE ANALYTIC SEGMENTATION HYBRID,8653848,R01NS075314,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Automobile Driving', 'Biological', 'Cell membrane', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Cellular Structures', 'Classification', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Computers and Advanced Instrumentation', 'Couples', 'Cytoskeleton', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Deposition', 'Devices', 'Disease', 'Electron Microscopy', 'Electrons', 'Face', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Internet', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Methods', 'Microscopic', 'Mitochondria', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Target', 'Names', 'Nervous System Physiology', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurofibrillary Tangles', 'Neurons', 'Neuropil', 'Online Systems', 'Organelles', 'Participant', 'Process', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Scanning Electron Microscopy', 'Scientist', 'Services', 'Solutions', 'Staining method', 'Stains', 'Structure', 'Subcellular structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Utah', 'Validation', 'Work', 'Workload', 'biological systems', 'cellular imaging', 'complex biological systems', 'data mining', 'digital imaging', 'electron optics', 'flexibility', 'image processing', 'improved', 'insight', 'interest', 'knowledge base', 'novel', 'prototype', 'relating to nervous system', 'scientific computing', 'tomography', 'tool', 'web interface']",NINDS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2014,436094,0.016206854998710055
"Bioinformatics Strategies for Multidimensional Brain Imaging Genetics     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Today's generation of multi-modal imaging systems produces massive high dimensional data sets, which when coupled with high throughput genotyping data such as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), provide exciting opportunities to enhance our understanding of phenotypic characteristics and the genetic architecture of human diseases. However, the unprecedented scale and complexity of these data sets have presented critical computational bottlenecks requiring new concepts and enabling tools. To address these challenges, using the study of Alzheimer's disease (AD) as a test bed, this project will develop and validate novel bioinformatics strategies for multidimensional brain imaging genetics. Aim 1 is to develop a novel bi- multivariate analysis strategy, S3K-CCA, for studying imaging genetic associations. Existing imaging genetics methods are typically designed to discover single-SNP-single-QT, single-SNP-multi-QT or multi-SNP-single- QT associations, and have limited power in revealing complex relationships between interlinked genetic markers and correlated brain phenotypes. To overcome this limitation, S3K-CCA is designed to be a sparse bi- multivariate learning model that simultaneously uses multiple response variables with multiple predictors for analyzing large-scale multi-modal neurogenomic data. Aim 2 is to develop HD-BIG, a visualization and systems biology framework for integrative analysis of High-Dimensional Brain Imaging Genetics data. Machine learning strategies to seamlessly incorporate valuable domain knowledge to produce biologically meaningful results is still an under-explored area in imaging genetics. In this aim, we will develop a user-friendly heat map interface to visualize high-dimensional results, adjust learning parameters and strategies, interact with existing bioinformatics resources and tools, and facilitate visual exploratory and systems biology analysis. A novel imaging genetic enrichment analysis (IGEA) method will be developed to identify relevant genetic pathways and associated brain circuits, and to reveal complex relationships among them. Aim 3 is to evaluate the proposed S3K-CCA and IGEA methods and the HD-BIG framework using both simulated and real imaging genetics data. This project is expected to produce novel bioinformatics algorithms and tools for comprehensive joint analysis of large scale heterogeneous imaging genetics data. The availability of these powerful methods is critical to the success of many imaging genetics initiatives. In addition, they can also help enable new computational applications in other areas of biomedical research where systematic and integrative analysis of large-scale multi-modal data is critical. Using AD as an exemplar, the proposed methods will demonstrate the potential for enhancing mechanistic understanding of complex disorders, which can benefit public health outcomes by facilitating diagnostic and therapeutic progress.             Public Health Relevance (Narrative) Recent advances in multi-modal imaging and high throughput genotyping techniques provide exciting opportunities to enhance our understanding of phenotypic characteristics and underlying genetic mechanisms associated with human diseases. This proposal seeks to develop new bi-multivariate machine learning models and novel enrichment analysis methods, coupled with a visualization and systems biology framework, for integrative analysis of high-dimensional brain imaging genetics data.

"Predicting and Detecting Glaucomatous Progression Using Pattern Recognition    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project aims to improve glaucoma management by applying novel pattern recognition techniques to improve the accurate prediction and detection of glaucomatous progression. The premise is that complex functional and structural tests in daily use by eye care providers contain hidden information that is not fully used in current analyses, and that advanced pattern recognition techniques can find and use that hidden information. The primary goals involve the use of mathematically rigorous techniques to discover patterns of defects and to track their changes in longitudinal series of perimetric and optical imaging data from up to 1800 glaucomatous and healthy eyes, available as the result of long-term NIH funding. With the interdisciplinary team of glaucoma and pattern recognition experts we have assembled, with our extensive NIH-supported database of eyes, and with the knowledge we have acquired in the optimal use of pattern recognition methods from previous NIH support, we believe the proposed work can enhance significantly the medical and surgical treatment of glaucoma and reduce the cost of glaucoma care. Moreover, improved techniques for predicting and detecting glaucomatous progression can be used for refined subject recruitment and to define endpoints for clinical trials of intraocular pressure-lowering and neuroprotective drugs.        The proposed project will develop and demonstrate the usefulness of pattern recognition techniques for predicting and detecting patterns of glaucomatous change in patient eyes tested longitudinally by visual field and optical imaging instruments. This proposal addresses the current NEI Glaucoma and Optic Neuropathies Program objectives of developing improved diagnostic measures to characterize and detect optic nerve disease onset and characterize glaucomatous neurodegeneration within the visual pathways at structural and functional levels. The development/use of novel, empirical techniques for predicting and detecting glaucomatous progression can have a significant impact on the future of clinical care and the future of clinical trials designed to investigate IOP lowering and neuroprotective drugs.

"Statistical methods for large and complex databases of ultra-high-dimensional     DESCRIPTION: Medical imaging is a cornerstone of basic science and clinical practice. To discover new mechanisms and markers of disease and their crucial implications for clinical practice, large multi-center imaging studies are acquiring terabytes of complex multi-modality imaging data cross-sectionally and longitudinally over decades. The statistical analysis of data from such studies is challenging due to the complex structure of the imaging data acquired and the ultra-high dimensionality. Furthermore, the heterogeneity of anatomy, pathology, and imaging protocols causes instability and failure of many current state-of-the-art image analysis methods. This grant proposes statistical frameworks for studying populations through biomedical imaging, scalable and robust methods for the identification and accurate quantification of pathology, and analytic tools for the cross-sectional and longitudinal examination of etiology and disease progression. These techniques will be applied to address key goals of the motivating large and multi- center studies of multiple sclerosis and Alzheimer's disease conducted at Johns Hopkins Hospital, the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, and across the globe. The project will create methods for uncovering and quantifying brain lesion pathology, incidence, and trajectory. Methods developed under this grant will be targeted towards these neuroimaging goals, but will form the basis for statistical image analysis methods applicable broadly in the biomedical sciences.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project involves the development of statistical frameworks and methods for the analysis of complex ultra-high-dimensional biomedical imaging.

"New Techniques for Measuring Volumetric Structural Changes in Glaucoma ABSTRACT  This K99/R00 application supports additional research training in computational mathematics and computer vision which will enable Dr. Madhusudhanan Balasubramanian-the applicant, to become an independent multidisciplinary investigator in computational ophthalmology. Specifically, in the K99 training phase of this grant, Dr. Balasubramanian will train at UC San Diego under the direction of Linda Zangwill PhD, an established glaucoma clinical researcher in the Department of Ophthalmology, as well as a team of co- mentors, including, Dr. Michael Holst from the Department of Mathematics and co-director for the Center for Computational Mathematics, and co-director of the Comptutational Science, Mathematics and Engineering and Dr. David Kriegman from Computer Science and Engineering. Training will be conducted via formal coursework, hands-on lab training, mentored research, progress review by an advisory committee, visiting collaborating researchers and regular attendance at seminars and workshops. The subsequent R00 independent research phase involves applying Dr. Balasubramanian's newly acquired computational techniques to the difficult task of identifying glaucomatous change over time from optical images of the optic nerve head and retinal nerve fiber layer.  A documented presence of progressive optic neuropathy is the best gold standard currently available for glaucoma diagnosis. Confocal Scanning Laser Ophthalmoscope (CSLO) and Spectral Domain Optical Coherence Tomography (SD-OCT) are two of the optical imaging instruments available for monitoring the optic nerve head health in glaucoma diagnosis and management. Currently, several statistical and computational techniques are available for detecting localized glaucomatous changes from the CSLO exams. SD-OCT is a new generation ophthalmic imaging instrument based on the principle of optical interferometry. In contrast to the CSLO technology, SDOCT can resolve retinal layers from the internal limiting membrane (ILM) through the Bruch's membrane and can capture the 3-D architecture of the optic nerve head at a very high resolution. These high-resolution, high-dimensional volume scans introduce a new level of data complexity not seen in glaucoma progression analysis before and therefore, powerful (high-performance) computational techniques are required to fully utilize the high precision retinal measurements for glaucoma diagnosis. The central focus of this application in the K99 mentored phase of the application will be in 1) developing computational and statistical techniques for detecting structural glaucomatous changes in various retinal layers from the SDOCT scans, and 2) developing a new avenue of research in glaucoma management where in strain in retinal layers will be estimated non-invasively to characterize glaucomatous progression. In the R00 independent phase, the specific aims focus on developing 1) statistical and computational techniques for detecting volumetric glaucomatous change over time using 3-D SD-OCT volume scans and 2) a computational framework to estimate full-field 3-D volumetric strain from the standard SD-OCT scans. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Detecting the onset and progression of glaucomatous changes in the eye is central to glaucoma diagnosis and management. This multidisciplinary project focuses on developing powerful (high-performance) computational, mathematical, and statistical techniques for detecting volumetric glaucomatous changes from the Confocal Scanning Laser Ophthalmoscopy (CSLO) scans and volumetric Spectral Domain Optical Coherence Tomography (SD-OCT) scans of the optic nerve head. In addition, the Principal Investigator of this proposal will receive extensive training in the areas of computational mathematics and computer vision to augment and strengthen his multidisciplinary expertise essential to execute the proposed specific aims.",New Techniques for Measuring Volumetric Structural Changes in Glaucoma,8786916,R00EY020518,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Advisory Committees', 'Affect', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Biology', 'Blindness', 'Brain imaging', 'Bruch&apos', 's basal membrane structure', 'Cardiology', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Computational Technique', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Confocal Microscopy', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease Progression', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Educational workshop', 'Elements', 'Engineering', 'Eye', 'Functional disorder', 'Gastroenterology', 'Generations', 'Genetic screening method', 'Glaucoma', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Image', 'Interferometry', 'Lasers', 'Lead', 'Left', 'Mathematics', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Membrane', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'National Eye Institute', 'National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering', 'Onset of illness', 'Ophthalmology', 'Ophthalmoscopes', 'Ophthalmoscopy', 'Optic Disk', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Optics', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Principal Investigator', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Resolution', 'Retinal', 'Scanning', 'Science', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Effectiveness', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Validation', 'Vision', 'Vision research', 'Visit', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'bioimaging', 'blood flow measurement', 'cancer imaging', 'computer framework', 'computer science', 'cost', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'improved', 'instrument', 'mathematical sciences', 'medical specialties', 'multidisciplinary', 'optic nerve disorder', 'optical imaging', 'prevent', 'programs', 'retinal nerve fiber layer', 'symposium', 'time use']",NEI,UNIVERSITY OF MEMPHIS,R00,2014,248999,0.053425399075291306
"Detection of Glaucoma Progression with Macular OCT Imaging     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application is a formal request for a career development award (K23) for an academic glaucoma specialist with a serious interest in the role of imaging in glaucoma using optical coherence tomography (OCT). This will allow the candidate to establish a clinical research program with the main goal of improving detection of glaucoma progression through macular imaging with spectral-domain OCT. By the time the proposed research is accomplished, the candidate will have preliminary data for continuing his research as an independent investigator and will have collected longitudinal structural and functional data in a group of advanced glaucoma patients that will serve as a platform for further improving detection of glaucoma progression with macular OCT imaging. The data will help the candidate provide preliminary results for a subsequent R01 that would potentially allow the PI to continue follow-up of the patients enrolled in the K23 award period.  I have a Master's of Science degree in Clinical Investigation under my belt and intend to deepen my skills in the field of imaging and biostatistics (to be used for enhancing and handling OCT images and for analyzing longitudinal data) by completing the proposed didactic program. By the end of the award period, I expect that I will have gained additional experience, knowledge, and mentorship required to prosper as an independent clinician-scientist in the field of glaucoma. My long-term goal is to carry out longitudinal studies of glaucoma patients where current and upcoming imaging and functional tests can be applied and their utility for detection of glaucoma progression can be investigated. I am confident that the combined skills and experience of my mentors will lead to a successful outcome for the proposed K award. I also envisage myself mentoring candidates like myself in future so that our collective knowledge and wisdom can be passed along to the next generation of aspiring clinician-scientists.  My objectives during the award period are as follows: 1) To develop an individual research program in glaucoma diagnostic imaging; 2) to successfully complete credited coursework in biomathematics, advanced biostatistics, computer vision (image processing), epidemiology, and ethical issues in research.  The main goal of the research component of this proposal is to better delineate the role of macular SD- OCT imaging for detection of glaucoma progression in advanced glaucoma. The specific aims through which this goal will be accomplished are as follows:  (1) To compare the performance of various global and regional macular measures to detect glaucoma.  The potential factors influencing the performance of various macular outcome measures will be explored. Such covariates include age, race, axial length, disc size, central corneal thickness,  OCT signal strength, and outer retinal thickness among others. I hypothesize that the thickness  of the outer retina (outer nuclear layer to retinal pigment epithelium-Bruch's membrane  complex) may be the most important factor explaining the measurement variability of the inner  retinal layer thickness (GCC or ganglion cell/inner plexiform layers).  (2) To determine and compare the utility of the candidate macular measures, detected through the first  aim, for detection of glaucoma progression in moderately advanced to severe glaucoma.  Moderately advanced to severe glaucoma will be defined as eyes with visual field mean  deviation worse than -6 dB or eyes with involvement of the central 10 degrees on the 24-2  visual field. It is widely accepted that measurement of the optic nerve head or RNFL parameters  in advanced glaucoma does not provide clinicians with much useful information. In contrast, the  central macular ganglion cells are the last to die in glaucoma. Macular imaging in advanced  glaucoma is directed towards this area where detection of change may still be possible. I  hypothesize that macular OCT parameters are valid structural outcome measures (biomarkers)  that can be used to follow the course of the disease in advanced glaucoma and that such  measures are significantly correlated with changes in the central visual field. Changes in the  macular measures over time will be first correlated with the corresponding visual field change  (functional progression) over time in eyes with moderately advanced to severe glaucoma. The  utility of the best candidate macular measures for predicting subsequent glaucoma progression  will also be explored and compared. I hypothesize that there may be a lag period between  progressive loss of macular ganglion cells and subsequent visual field progression in advanced  glaucoma, and therefore, detection of worsening in one or more macular outcome measures  can be used as a proxy for subsequent visual field progression.  Collectively, these studies will provide a solid foundation for better understanding and integration of macular OCT imaging in the care of glaucoma patients. Timely detection of glaucoma progression in the later stages can significantly reduce visual disability and blindness through earlier aggressive treatment and will potentially reduce glaucoma's financial burden to society.          Detection of glaucoma progression remains a challenging task in eyes demonstrating significant damage. Even small amounts of progression in advanced glaucoma can have important consequences with regard to patient's visual function and quality of life. The results of the proposed study will potentially lead to more effective and earlier detection of glaucoma progression and will allow ophthalmologists to step up treatment in a timely manner. This will in turn result in less visual morbidity and reduced blindness from glaucoma, which is projected to cause more than 10 million cases of legal blindness around the world in 2020.

"Quantitative Image Analysis Techniques for Optic Nerve Disease  PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Disorders of the optic nerve (ON) account for a significant percentage of the 20 most impactful ophthalmological conditions. Collectively, diseases of the ON are the number one cause of irreversible blindness worldwide, and present serious public health concerns in the U.S. Consider, for example, that glaucoma impacts more than three million Ameri- cans and costs the U.S. economy almost $3 billion per year. Optic neuritis (i.e., inflammatory demyelination of the ON) is the initial symptom in ~25% of all multiple sclerosis (MS) cases (which impacts over 400 thousand Americans and intro- duces societal health care costs of nearly $30 billion per year). Nearly two thirds of MS patients will experience episodes of optic neuritis in their lifetimes, and 40-60% of patients have visual defects localized to the ON. These disorders irre- versibly damage the ON. Even so, damage to axons in the ON is progressive, defined by a window of opportunity for treatment between loss of function and actual degeneration. The potential for recovery exists because there are treatments that can help prevent progression if administered during this window of opportunity. Yet, we do not have effective means to assess who is in the window and who will benefit from treatment.  We propose to translate computational imaging methods from the neuroimaging community to provide ro- bust, quantitative tools for assessing the optic nerve (ON) on clinical and research imaging sequences. These efforts will improve prognostic accuracy, lead to better understanding of patient responses, and enhance targeted interven- tions. The technical hypothesis of this work is that quantitative image processing can robustly and accurately segment, register, and fuse ON data from modern MRI and CT clinical sequences. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that qualitative ON phenotypes on longitudinal clinical imaging will differentiate individuals who respond to treatment versus those who do not.  The overall goal of this research is to provide a foundation for image analysis of the ON and its relationships with pathological disorders. We will build upon recent advances in robust medical image computing to segment the ON in clinical CT and MRI acquisitions, develop registration procedures to establish intra- and inter-subject correspondence, and bring together information from the multi-modal battery of imaging studies that are typically used in clinical care (aim 1). With these new methods, we will address the exploratory hypothesis that quantitative use of clinical imaging data can increase prognostic accuracy (aim 2). We note that aim 2 is particularly exploratory and in line with the high- risk/high-reward aspect of this mechanism; many studies have shown that baseline imaging does not conclusively pre- dict long term outcome or treatment response. We hypothesize that this may be because early findings are related to edema and inflammation rather than cellular damage per se. Once this exploratory phase is complete, we will pursue promising prognostic biomarkers using more detailed condition staging criteria and including more than two longitudinal time points in the analysis. Ultimately, these efforts will improve assessment ON disease and, in turn, patient care.

"Prostate-cancer Imaging by Combined Ultrasound and Magnetic-resonance Parameters    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Riverside Research Institute, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Rutgers University, and the General Electric Corporation propose to undertake an Academic-Industrial Partnership study to improve prostate- cancer (PCA) imaging markedly and thereby improve prostate-biopsy guidance to detect PCa; enhance monitoring, surveillance, and treatment of PCa; and enable planning and execution of focal PCa therapy. The project is highly significant because it addresses a major health problem in the United States and other developed countries. The project will overcome the current inability of established clinical-imaging method to image PCa reliably by combining the capabilities of advanced ultrasound (US) and magnetic-resonance (MR) techniques in a clinically effective manner. The proposed approach will exploit the sensitivity of US to mechanical properties of tissue on a microscopic scale with the sensitivity of MR to chemical constituents of tissue and its ability to sense blood distribution. Each of these modalities senses different and independent properties of tissue and has shown encouraging potential for improved imaging of PCa when used alone; combining parameters derived from each modality can provide far superior sensitivity and specificity for PCa. We will combine US and MR parameters using advanced classifiers such as artificial neural networks and support-vector machines. These classifiers already have produced ROC-curve areas of 0.91 for advanced US methods, and the MR methods have demonstrated equivalent ROC-curve areas in many studies. We will embody the combined capabilities in specifications for a prototype imaging system that can generate prostate tissue-typing images (TTIs) in real-time for targeting biopsies or planning treatment in the operating room or in an off-line setting. The latest Logiq E9 instrument currently being produced by GE already has a capability for fusing previously obtained MR images with US images in real time, which provides an existing framework for combining US and MR parameters and generating real-time TTIs. Successfully generating reliable prostate TTIs based on combined US and MR parameters will represent a quantum advance in PCa management by enabling significant improvements in the diagnosis and treatment of PCa.        Riverside Research Institute, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Rutgers University, and the General Electric Corporation propose to undertake an Academic-Industrial Partnership study to improve prostate- cancer (PCA) imaging markedly and thereby improve prostate-biopsy guidance; enhance monitoring, surveillance, and treatment of PCa; and enable planning and execution of focal PCa therapy. The project will combine attributes of advanced ultrasound and magnetic-resonance techniques and embody them in a prototype imaging system capable of generating novel tissue-type images that reliably depict PCa in real-time.

"Adaptive Large-Scale Framework for Automatic Biomedical Image Segmentation DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Multi-atlas label fusion (MALF) is a powerful new technology that can automatically detect and label anatomical structures in biomedical images. It is arguably the most successful general-purpose automatic image segmentation technique ever developed. Automatic segmentation is in high demand in clinical and research applications of medical imaging, since segmentation forms a crucial step towards extracting quantitative information from imaging data, and since manual and semi-automatic approaches are ill suited for today's increasingly large and complex imaging datasets. Despite a number of papers that demonstrated outstanding performance of MALF methods across a range of biomedical imaging applications, the broader biomedical imaging research community has been slow to adopt this technique. This can be explained by multiple factors, including the technique's high computational demands, lack of a turnkey software implementation, as well as scarcity of validation in clinical imaging datasets and in the presence of extensive pathology. The present application seeks to remove these barriers and to enable a broad range of clinicians and biomedical researchers to take advantage of MALF technology. It builds on our strong track record of innovation in the MALF field, including a novel redundancy-correcting MALF technique that led in segmentation grand challenges in the past two years. Aim 1 seeks to improve the computational performance of MALF by replacing dense deformable image registration, by far the most time consuming component of MALF, with faster and less constrained sparse registration strategies. We hypothesize that this will not only reduce the computational cost of MALF, but will also make it more robust to anatomical variability, in particular enabling its use for tumor and lesion segmentation. Aim 2 proposes algorithmic extensions to MALF that support automatic segmentation of dynamic and multi-modality imaging datasets, which have been largely overlooked in the MALF literature. Aim 3 will develop a turnkey open-source implementation of MALF methodology. Taking advantage of cloud computing technology, this software will allow users with minimal image processing expertise to take full advantage of MALF segmentation on their desktop. Aim 3 will also provide a set of publicly available atlases and the means for users to build new custom atlas sets from their own data. Aim 4 will perform extensive evaluation of the new methods and software in challenging real-world clinical imaging data, including brain and cardiac imaging. As part of this evaluation, we will quantify how well our MALF approach and competing techniques generalize to novel imaging datasets with heterogeneity in acquisition parameters and clinical phenotypes. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This research will make it possible for a wide community of researchers who collect and analyze medical imaging data to take advantage of a new class of computer algorithms that very accurately label and measure anatomical structures and pathological formations in medical images. By offering more accurate image-derived measurements, the project promises to improve the accuracy of diagnosis, reduce the costs of biomedical re- search studies and pharmaceutical trials, and accelerate scientific discovery.",Adaptive Large-Scale Framework for Automatic Biomedical Image Segmentation,8761531,R01EB017255,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Atlases', 'Biomedical Research', 'Brain', 'Build-it', 'Cardiac', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Cloud Computing', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Consensus', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dementia', 'Diagnostic', 'Evaluation', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'High Performance Computing', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'International', 'Joints', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Literature', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Medical Imaging', 'Medical Research', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Multiple Sclerosis Lesions', 'Myocardium', 'Paper', 'Pathology', 'Patient Care', 'Performance', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Public Domains', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'S-nitro-N-acetylpenicillamine', 'Scheme', 'Services', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Temporal Lobe Epilepsy', 'Time', 'Training', 'Ultrasonography', 'Uncertainty', 'Validation', 'Work', 'aortic valve', 'base', 'bioimaging', 'clinical application', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinical practice', 'cloud based', 'cohort', 'cost', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'experience', 'image processing', 'image registration', 'imaging Segmentation', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'new technology', 'novel', 'open source', 'outreach', 'research study', 'success', 'tool', 'tumor']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2014,611476,0.023712730538525673
"Large-Scale Reconstruction of Microvascular Networks and the Surrounding Cellular     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A career development plan is proposed for Dr. David Mayerich, a computer scientist who is committed to developing an interdisciplinary career in biomedical engineering, with a focus on the collection and analysis of large-scale data sets at sub-micrometer resolution. His graduate research was in the areas of computer visualization and optical imaging, where his work lead to the development of the prototype Knife-Edge Scanning Microscope (KESM). This is the first instrument capable of imaging three-dimensional macro-scale tissue volumes at sub-micrometer resolution while providing a data rate approaching the transfer speed of most modern computer systems.         Since receiving his Ph.D., Dr. Mayerich worked as a postdoctoral fellow at the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science and Technology at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, where he has worked with biologists and biomedical engineers to develop tools for the segmentation and classification of large data sets. This provided experience in addressing the needs and limitations of the computational tools available to the interdisciplinary community.        The goal of the mentored phase of this proposal is to provide Dr. Mayerich with the opportunity to work as a developer for the FARSIGHT Toolkit. The FARSIGHT Toolkit is an open-source segmentation toolkit that focuses on developing computer vision algorithms specifically tailored to deal with the unique structures found in microscopy data sets. This project is directed by Prof. Badrinath Roysam at the University of Houston, and was awarded first-place in the NIH-sponsored DIADEM Challenge in neuron segmentation. Dr. Mayerich will use his previous experience in biomedical segmentation, GPU-based computing, and efficient data structures to help make the FARSIGHT Toolkit scalable to the terabyte-scale data sets produced using next-generation high-throughput imaging techniques. Dr. Mayerich will receive mentoring in the algorithms and techniques used in the FARSIGHT Toolkit, as well as valuable experience working on a collaborative software development project.         The goal of the independent phase is to use recently developed imaging techniques, along with scalable segmentation algorithms, to construct complete microvascular models of mouse organs. Recent advances in KESM demonstrate that sub-micrometer images of 1cm3 tissue samples can be collected in less than 50 hours. These images have the resolution and quality necessary for (a) complete reconstruction of microvascular networks in whole organs, and (b) the geometric distribution of cell soma in relation to this network. Models describing cellular and microvascular relationships have implications in several diseases, including neurodegenerative disease and tumor growth, as well as clinical applications in tissue engineering and the quantitative analysis of angiogenic drugs and therapies.                  PROJECT NARRATIVE The goal of this work is to produce high-resolution microvascular models from mouse brain tissue, as well as create algorithms for querying, distributing, and building models from next-generation high-throughput microscopy data sets. These techniques will allow researchers to create large-scale blood flow simulations, simulate the extent of tissue damage due to stroke or aneurism, and explore the relationships between cells and microvessels on a tissue-wide scale.

"SLASH: SCALABLE LARGE ANALYTIC SEGMENTATION HYBRID DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Advanced instrumentation and cellular imaging techniques using high-throughput 3D electron microscopy are driving a new revolution in the exploration of complex biological systems by providing near seamless views across multiple scales of resolution. These datasets provide the necessary breadth and depth to analyze multicellular, cellular, and subcelluar structure across large swathes of neural tissue. While these new imaging procedures are generating extremely large datasets of enormous value, the quantities are such that no single user or even laboratory team can possibly analyze the full content of their own imaging activities through traditional means. To address this challenge, we propose to further develop and refine a prototype hybrid system for high-throughput segmentation of large neuropil datasets that: 1) advances automatic algorithms for segmentation of cellular and sub-cellular structures using machine learning techniques; 2) couples these techniques to a scalable and flexible process or tool suite allowing multiple users to simultaneously review, edit and curate the results of these automatic approaches; and, 3) builds a knowledge base of training data guiding and improving automated processing. This system will allow project scientists to select areas of interest, execute automatic segmentation algorithms, and distribute workload, curate data, and deposit final results into the Cell Centered Database (Martone et al. 2008) via accessible web-interfaces. Emerging techniques in cellular and subcellular 3D imaging are generating datasets of enormous value to the study of disease processes and to the pursuit of greater insight into the structure and function of the nervous system. To unlock the potential of these data, new solutions are needed to improve the capability to segment and label the individual molecular, subcellular and cellular components within very large volumetric expanses. To address this challenge, we propose a hybrid system for high-throughput segmentation of large neuropil datasets that advances machine learning algorithms for automatic segmentation and couples these techniques to a scalable tool suite for multiple users to simultaneously review, edit and curate results.",SLASH: SCALABLE LARGE ANALYTIC SEGMENTATION HYBRID,8461069,R01NS075314,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Automobile Driving', 'Biological', 'Cell membrane', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Cellular Structures', 'Classification', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Computers and Advanced Instrumentation', 'Couples', 'Cytoskeleton', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Deposition', 'Devices', 'Disease', 'Electron Microscopy', 'Electrons', 'Face', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Internet', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Methods', 'Microscopic', 'Mitochondria', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Target', 'Names', 'Nervous System Physiology', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurofibrillary Tangles', 'Neurons', 'Neuropil', 'Online Systems', 'Organelles', 'Participant', 'Process', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Scanning Electron Microscopy', 'Scientist', 'Services', 'Solutions', 'Staining method', 'Stains', 'Structure', 'Subcellular structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Utah', 'Validation', 'Work', 'Workload', 'biological systems', 'cellular imaging', 'complex biological systems', 'data mining', 'digital imaging', 'electron optics', 'flexibility', 'image processing', 'improved', 'insight', 'interest', 'knowledge base', 'novel', 'prototype', 'relating to nervous system', 'scientific computing', 'tomography', 'tool', 'web interface']",NINDS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2013,425454,0.016206854998710055
"Bioinformatics Strategies for Multidimensional Brain Imaging Genetics     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Today's generation of multi-modal imaging systems produces massive high dimensional data sets, which when coupled with high throughput genotyping data such as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), provide exciting opportunities to enhance our understanding of phenotypic characteristics and the genetic architecture of human diseases. However, the unprecedented scale and complexity of these data sets have presented critical computational bottlenecks requiring new concepts and enabling tools. To address these challenges, using the study of Alzheimer's disease (AD) as a test bed, this project will develop and validate novel bioinformatics strategies for multidimensional brain imaging genetics. Aim 1 is to develop a novel bi- multivariate analysis strategy, S3K-CCA, for studying imaging genetic associations. Existing imaging genetics methods are typically designed to discover single-SNP-single-QT, single-SNP-multi-QT or multi-SNP-single- QT associations, and have limited power in revealing complex relationships between interlinked genetic markers and correlated brain phenotypes. To overcome this limitation, S3K-CCA is designed to be a sparse bi- multivariate learning model that simultaneously uses multiple response variables with multiple predictors for analyzing large-scale multi-modal neurogenomic data. Aim 2 is to develop HD-BIG, a visualization and systems biology framework for integrative analysis of High-Dimensional Brain Imaging Genetics data. Machine learning strategies to seamlessly incorporate valuable domain knowledge to produce biologically meaningful results is still an under-explored area in imaging genetics. In this aim, we will develop a user-friendly heat map interface to visualize high-dimensional results, adjust learning parameters and strategies, interact with existing bioinformatics resources and tools, and facilitate visual exploratory and systems biology analysis. A novel imaging genetic enrichment analysis (IGEA) method will be developed to identify relevant genetic pathways and associated brain circuits, and to reveal complex relationships among them. Aim 3 is to evaluate the proposed S3K-CCA and IGEA methods and the HD-BIG framework using both simulated and real imaging genetics data. This project is expected to produce novel bioinformatics algorithms and tools for comprehensive joint analysis of large scale heterogeneous imaging genetics data. The availability of these powerful methods is critical to the success of many imaging genetics initiatives. In addition, they can also help enable new computational applications in other areas of biomedical research where systematic and integrative analysis of large-scale multi-modal data is critical. Using AD as an exemplar, the proposed methods will demonstrate the potential for enhancing mechanistic understanding of complex disorders, which can benefit public health outcomes by facilitating diagnostic and therapeutic progress.              Public Health Relevance (Narrative) Recent advances in multi-modal imaging and high throughput genotyping techniques provide exciting opportunities to enhance our understanding of phenotypic characteristics and underlying genetic mechanisms associated with human diseases. This proposal seeks to develop new bi-multivariate machine learning models and novel enrichment analysis methods, coupled with a visualization and systems biology framework, for integrative analysis of high-dimensional brain imaging genetics data.

"Predicting and Detecting Glaucomatous Progression Using Pattern Recognition    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project aims to improve glaucoma management by applying novel pattern recognition techniques to improve the accurate prediction and detection of glaucomatous progression. The premise is that complex functional and structural tests in daily use by eye care providers contain hidden information that is not fully used in current analyses, and that advanced pattern recognition techniques can find and use that hidden information. The primary goals involve the use of mathematically rigorous techniques to discover patterns of defects and to track their changes in longitudinal series of perimetric and optical imaging data from up to 1800 glaucomatous and healthy eyes, available as the result of long-term NIH funding. With the interdisciplinary team of glaucoma and pattern recognition experts we have assembled, with our extensive NIH-supported database of eyes, and with the knowledge we have acquired in the optimal use of pattern recognition methods from previous NIH support, we believe the proposed work can enhance significantly the medical and surgical treatment of glaucoma and reduce the cost of glaucoma care. Moreover, improved techniques for predicting and detecting glaucomatous progression can be used for refined subject recruitment and to define endpoints for clinical trials of intraocular pressure-lowering and neuroprotective drugs.        The proposed project will develop and demonstrate the usefulness of pattern recognition techniques for predicting and detecting patterns of glaucomatous change in patient eyes tested longitudinally by visual field and optical imaging instruments. This proposal addresses the current NEI Glaucoma and Optic Neuropathies Program objectives of developing improved diagnostic measures to characterize and detect optic nerve disease onset and characterize glaucomatous neurodegeneration within the visual pathways at structural and functional levels. The development/use of novel, empirical techniques for predicting and detecting glaucomatous progression can have a significant impact on the future of clinical care and the future of clinical trials designed to investigate IOP lowering and neuroprotective drugs.

"Statistical methods for large and complex databases of ultra-high-dimensional  Abstract Medical imaging is a cornerstone of basic science and clinical practice. To discover new mechanisms and markers of disease and their crucial implications for clinical practice, large multi-center imaging studies are acquiring terabytes of complex multi-modality imaging data cross-sectionally and longitudinally over decades. The statistical analysis of data from such studies is challenging due to the complex structure of the imaging data acquired and the ultra-high dimensionality. Furthermore, the heterogeneity of anatomy, pathology, and imaging protocols causes instability and failure of many current state-of-the-art image analysis methods. This grant proposes statistical frameworks for studying populations through biomedical imaging, scalable and robust methods for the identification and accurate quantification of pathology, and analytic tools for the cross-sectional and longitudinal examination of etiology and disease progression. These techniques will be applied to address key goals of the motivating large and multi- center studies of multiple sclerosis and Alzheimer's disease conducted at Johns Hopkins Hospital, the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, and across the globe. The project will create methods for uncovering and quantifying brain lesion pathology, incidence, and trajectory. Methods developed under this grant will be targeted towards these neuroimaging goals, but will form the basis for statistical image analysis methods applicable broadly in the biomedical sciences.

"Real-Time MRI Motion Correction System    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  MOTIVATION - Motion remains one of the most frequent contributors to image artifacts in MR studies.  The motion susceptibility of MRI is well-known and has spawned a number of elegant navigation techniques.  These methods, however, are tailored to specific MR acquisitions that require modified k-space trajectories or the acquisition of additional MR data, and most are unable to correct certain types of motion, for example, through-plane motion.  Moreover, motion correction has been focused on specific families of sequences, but no generally applicable approach currently exists.  Certain patient populations, such as pediatric or geriatric patients, are more likely to move than others.  In pediatric imaging, anesthesia is used to control motion, adding substantially to exam costs and patient risks.  A sequence-independent, autonomous and prospective motion correction system could greatly improve image quality for a wide spectrum of MR examinations.  For pediatric imaging, in particular, we anticipate reduced reliance on anesthesia to control patient motion.  AIMS - We will be focusing on three independent specific aims (carried out in parallel and completed within 4 years), with corresponding subaims that we believe are important for establishing the technical/scientific merit and to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed R&D efforts for our real-time adaptive motion correction approach.  Specifically, these aims are:  (1) to develop and evaluate a coil-mounted MR-compatible tracking device for routine clinical use; (2) to integrate pose tracking into real-time MRI; and (3) to validate our real-time motion correction system in volunteers and patients.  METHODS -In Aim 1 we will improve the methods for computer-vision-based pose estimation inside an MR scanner and build an MR-compatible coil-mounted pose tracker that can be used in clinical routine examinations.  In Aim 2 we will focus on reducing the latency between pose changes happening and the MR scanner reacting to these pose changes, and on building a software library for the MR pulse sequence development that allows one to implement real-time motion correction into all MR pulse sequences.  In Aim 3 we will perform a thorough evaluation of our system on 60 volunteers (30 adults and 30 children) and 120 patients (80 adults and 40 children).  SIGNIFICANCE - The impact of our technology has several facets.  First, it will improve patient care by reducing the number of MR images with compromised quality because of motion artifacts.  Especially because of the increasing reliance on MR Images as a primary means of diagnosis, this will reduce the number of misdiagnoses.  Secondly, this technology will help to lower the high national spending on imaging by dramatically improving the efficiency of MRI scanners.  Finally, it will improve patient comfort by reducing the need for repeat sequences, as well as reduce the necessity of sedation aimed at keeping the patient still.  Overall, this technology will have a significant impact on MRI both in clinical practice and basic science research.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Synopsis Patient motion during an MRI exam can result in major degradation of image quality and decreased efficiency in a large portion of the 40 million MRI procedures performed annually.  This is not only of increasing concern due to the aging population and its associated diseases, but also in children and patients who are simply too sick to remain still during an exam.  This proposal aims to build an optical tracking system and methods to adapt MRI pulse sequences to changes in patient pose in real time.  The project leverages on previous work from an R21 project in which a prototype system was successfully built.  Specifically, the aims are to (i) introduce innovative improvements to the existing prototype, making the system suitable for use in clinical routine, (ii) modify the optical tracking system to be compatible with multiple MR sequences, and (iii) perform clinical evaluation.  Our real-time technique is a unique and innovative solution that will improve MRI image quality and thus patient care, and will address the escalating burden of imaging costs on the health care system.

"Detection of Glaucoma Progression with Macular OCT Imaging     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application is a formal request for a career development award (K23) for an academic glaucoma specialist with a serious interest in the role of imaging in glaucoma using optical coherence tomography (OCT). This will allow the candidate to establish a clinical research program with the main goal of improving detection of glaucoma progression through macular imaging with spectral-domain OCT. By the time the proposed research is accomplished, the candidate will have preliminary data for continuing his research as an independent investigator and will have collected longitudinal structural and functional data in a group of advanced glaucoma patients that will serve as a platform for further improving detection of glaucoma progression with macular OCT imaging. The data will help the candidate provide preliminary results for a subsequent R01 that would potentially allow the PI to continue follow-up of the patients enrolled in the K23 award period.  I have a Master's of Science degree in Clinical Investigation under my belt and intend to deepen my skills in the field of imaging and biostatistics (to be used for enhancing and handling OCT images and for analyzing longitudinal data) by completing the proposed didactic program. By the end of the award period, I expect that I will have gained additional experience, knowledge, and mentorship required to prosper as an independent clinician-scientist in the field of glaucoma. My long-term goal is to carry out longitudinal studies of glaucoma patients where current and upcoming imaging and functional tests can be applied and their utility for detection of glaucoma progression can be investigated. I am confident that the combined skills and experience of my mentors will lead to a successful outcome for the proposed K award. I also envisage myself mentoring candidates like myself in future so that our collective knowledge and wisdom can be passed along to the next generation of aspiring clinician-scientists.  My objectives during the award period are as follows: 1) To develop an individual research program in glaucoma diagnostic imaging; 2) to successfully complete credited coursework in biomathematics, advanced biostatistics, computer vision (image processing), epidemiology, and ethical issues in research.  The main goal of the research component of this proposal is to better delineate the role of macular SD- OCT imaging for detection of glaucoma progression in advanced glaucoma. The specific aims through which this goal will be accomplished are as follows:  (1) To compare the performance of various global and regional macular measures to detect glaucoma.  The potential factors influencing the performance of various macular outcome measures will be explored. Such covariates include age, race, axial length, disc size, central corneal thickness,  OCT signal strength, and outer retinal thickness among others. I hypothesize that the thickness  of the outer retina (outer nuclear layer to retinal pigment epithelium-Bruch's membrane  complex) may be the most important factor explaining the measurement variability of the inner  retinal layer thickness (GCC or ganglion cell/inner plexiform layers).  (2) To determine and compare the utility of the candidate macular measures, detected through the first  aim, for detection of glaucoma progression in moderately advanced to severe glaucoma.  Moderately advanced to severe glaucoma will be defined as eyes with visual field mean  deviation worse than -6 dB or eyes with involvement of the central 10 degrees on the 24-2  visual field. It is widely accepted that measurement of the optic nerve head or RNFL parameters  in advanced glaucoma does not provide clinicians with much useful information. In contrast, the  central macular ganglion cells are the last to die in glaucoma. Macular imaging in advanced  glaucoma is directed towards this area where detection of change may still be possible. I  hypothesize that macular OCT parameters are valid structural outcome measures (biomarkers)  that can be used to follow the course of the disease in advanced glaucoma and that such  measures are significantly correlated with changes in the central visual field. Changes in the  macular measures over time will be first correlated with the corresponding visual field change  (functional progression) over time in eyes with moderately advanced to severe glaucoma. The  utility of the best candidate macular measures for predicting subsequent glaucoma progression  will also be explored and compared. I hypothesize that there may be a lag period between  progressive loss of macular ganglion cells and subsequent visual field progression in advanced  glaucoma, and therefore, detection of worsening in one or more macular outcome measures  can be used as a proxy for subsequent visual field progression.  Collectively, these studies will provide a solid foundation for better understanding and integration of macular OCT imaging in the care of glaucoma patients. Timely detection of glaucoma progression in the later stages can significantly reduce visual disability and blindness through earlier aggressive treatment and will potentially reduce glaucoma's financial burden to society.          Detection of glaucoma progression remains a challenging task in eyes demonstrating significant damage. Even small amounts of progression in advanced glaucoma can have important consequences with regard to patient's visual function and quality of life. The results of the proposed study will potentially lead to more effective and earlier detection of glaucoma progression and will allow ophthalmologists to step up treatment in a timely manner. This will in turn result in less visual morbidity and reduced blindness from glaucoma, which is projected to cause more than 10 million cases of legal blindness around the world in 2020.

"Prostate-cancer Imaging by Combined Ultrasound and Magnetic-resonance Parameters    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Riverside Research Institute, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Rutgers University, and the General Electric Corporation propose to undertake an Academic-Industrial Partnership study to improve prostate- cancer (PCA) imaging markedly and thereby improve prostate-biopsy guidance to detect PCa; enhance monitoring, surveillance, and treatment of PCa; and enable planning and execution of focal PCa therapy. The project is highly significant because it addresses a major health problem in the United States and other developed countries. The project will overcome the current inability of established clinical-imaging method to image PCa reliably by combining the capabilities of advanced ultrasound (US) and magnetic-resonance (MR) techniques in a clinically effective manner. The proposed approach will exploit the sensitivity of US to mechanical properties of tissue on a microscopic scale with the sensitivity of MR to chemical constituents of tissue and its ability to sense blood distribution. Each of these modalities senses different and independent properties of tissue and has shown encouraging potential for improved imaging of PCa when used alone; combining parameters derived from each modality can provide far superior sensitivity and specificity for PCa. We will combine US and MR parameters using advanced classifiers such as artificial neural networks and support-vector machines. These classifiers already have produced ROC-curve areas of 0.91 for advanced US methods, and the MR methods have demonstrated equivalent ROC-curve areas in many studies. We will embody the combined capabilities in specifications for a prototype imaging system that can generate prostate tissue-typing images (TTIs) in real-time for targeting biopsies or planning treatment in the operating room or in an off-line setting. The latest Logiq E9 instrument currently being produced by GE already has a capability for fusing previously obtained MR images with US images in real time, which provides an existing framework for combining US and MR parameters and generating real-time TTIs. Successfully generating reliable prostate TTIs based on combined US and MR parameters will represent a quantum advance in PCa management by enabling significant improvements in the diagnosis and treatment of PCa.

"SLASH: SCALABLE LARGE ANALYTIC SEGMENTATION HYBRID DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Advanced instrumentation and cellular imaging techniques using high-throughput 3D electron microscopy are driving a new revolution in the exploration of complex biological systems by providing near seamless views across multiple scales of resolution. These datasets provide the necessary breadth and depth to analyze multicellular, cellular, and subcelluar structure across large swathes of neural tissue. While these new imaging procedures are generating extremely large datasets of enormous value, the quantities are such that no single user or even laboratory team can possibly analyze the full content of their own imaging activities through traditional means. To address this challenge, we propose to further develop and refine a prototype hybrid system for high-throughput segmentation of large neuropil datasets that: 1) advances automatic algorithms for segmentation of cellular and sub-cellular structures using machine learning techniques; 2) couples these techniques to a scalable and flexible process or tool suite allowing multiple users to simultaneously review, edit and curate the results of these automatic approaches; and, 3) builds a knowledge base of training data guiding and improving automated processing. This system will allow project scientists to select areas of interest, execute automatic segmentation algorithms, and distribute workload, curate data, and deposit final results into the Cell Centered Database (Martone et al. 2008) via accessible web-interfaces. Emerging techniques in cellular and subcellular 3D imaging are generating datasets of enormous value to the study of disease processes and to the pursuit of greater insight into the structure and function of the nervous system. To unlock the potential of these data, new solutions are needed to improve the capability to segment and label the individual molecular, subcellular and cellular components within very large volumetric expanses.

"Bioinformatics Strategies for Multidimensional Brain Imaging Genetics     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Today's generation of multi-modal imaging systems produces massive high dimensional data sets, which when coupled with high throughput genotyping data such as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), provide exciting opportunities to enhance our understanding of phenotypic characteristics and the genetic architecture of human diseases. However, the unprecedented scale and complexity of these data sets have presented critical computational bottlenecks requiring new concepts and enabling tools. To address these challenges, using the study of Alzheimer's disease (AD) as a test bed, this project will develop and validate novel bioinformatics strategies for multidimensional brain imaging genetics. Aim 1 is to develop a novel bi- multivariate analysis strategy, S3K-CCA, for studying imaging genetic associations. Existing imaging genetics methods are typically designed to discover single-SNP-single-QT, single-SNP-multi-QT or multi-SNP-single- QT associations, and have limited power in revealing complex relationships between interlinked genetic markers and correlated brain phenotypes. To overcome this limitation, S3K-CCA is designed to be a sparse bi- multivariate learning model that simultaneously uses multiple response variables with multiple predictors for analyzing large-scale multi-modal neurogenomic data. Aim 2 is to develop HD-BIG, a visualization and systems biology framework for integrative analysis of High-Dimensional Brain Imaging Genetics data. Machine learning strategies to seamlessly incorporate valuable domain knowledge to produce biologically meaningful results is still an under-explored area in imaging genetics. In this aim, we will develop a user-friendly heat map interface to visualize high-dimensional results, adjust learning parameters and strategies, interact with existing bioinformatics resources and tools, and facilitate visual exploratory and systems biology analysis. A novel imaging genetic enrichment analysis (IGEA) method will be developed to identify relevant genetic pathways and associated brain circuits, and to reveal complex relationships among them. Aim 3 is to evaluate the proposed S3K-CCA and IGEA methods and the HD-BIG framework using both simulated and real imaging genetics data. This project is expected to produce novel bioinformatics algorithms and tools for comprehensive joint analysis of large scale heterogeneous imaging genetics data. The availability of these powerful methods is critical to the success of many imaging genetics initiatives. In addition, they can also help enable new computational applications in other areas of biomedical research where systematic and integrative analysis of large-scale multi-modal data is critical. Using AD as an exemplar, the proposed methods will demonstrate the potential for enhancing mechanistic understanding of complex disorders, which can benefit public health outcomes by facilitating diagnostic and therapeutic progress.              Public Health Relevance (Narrative) Recent advances in multi-modal imaging and high throughput genotyping techniques provide exciting opportunities to enhance our understanding of phenotypic characteristics and underlying genetic mechanisms associated with human diseases. This proposal seeks to develop new bi-multivariate machine learning models and novel enrichment analysis methods, coupled with a visualization and systems biology framework, for integrative analysis of high-dimensional brain imaging genetics data.

"Identifying Mechanisms of Dementia:  Role for MRI in the Era of Molecular Imaging DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Dementia represents a major public health problem which will grow significantly with the aging of our society. Recently, multiple pieces of converging clinical and neuropathological data indicate that dementia is typically a multi-factorial process. This evolution in thinking about the biology of dementia comes at a time when the most significant recent development in dementia imaging has been the introduction of amyloid plaque labeling compounds; the most widely studied at this point is Pittsburgh Compound - B (PiB). A central principle underlying this renewal is this. Amyloid imaging is unquestionably a major advance. However, since the biology of dementia is more complex than brain amyloidosis alone, imaging of dementia is more complex than brain amyloid imaging alone. Our primary goal in this renewal is to use various imaging modalities to identify different mechanisms underlying dementia. This is the first resubmission of a competitive renewal of AG11378. We have revised the grant in accordance with each point raised in the critique and we believe this has resulted in a much stronger application. Each of the five aims is cast to answer variations on the questions: What is the contribution of specific imaging-based proxies of pathology to clinical/cognitive decline? When in the course of the disease do these relationships hold true? For whom is this true? Where in the brain are the relevant pathologies expressed? Principle outcome measures will be clinical and psychometric decline over time which we will use as indicators of disease progression. Our predictor variables will include various imaging modalities which will serve as proxies for specific pathologic mechanisms underlying dementia. PiB will serve as a measure of plaque burden and we will use various Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) modalities to assess cerebro- vascular disease, tissue loss, tissue perfusion, diffusion, neuronal integrity, and inflammation. Features that distinguish this renewal from past cycles of AG11378 include a mechanistic focus, multi- modality imaging including multiple MRI modalities as well as PET amyloid imaging, MR imaging now at 3T, inclusion of both amnestic and non-amnestic MCI, and voxel-based analytic methods including an exciting new computational approach which employs a support vector machine algorithm to provide diagnosis in individual subjects. In addition, subjects will now be recruited from a new population-based study of aging and dementia, which differentiates this renewal from past cycles as well as from most dementia imaging studies which recruit from referral practices and thus risk sampling bias. Previous cycles of this grant have contributed significantly to recognition of the utility of imaging in dementia. An active debate is currently underway about revising clinical criteria for AD, specifically whether imaging and fluid biomarker information should be included among the criteria. Results from this renewal grant will inform this debate about multiple time dependent mechanisms leading to dementia that are accessible in living subjects through imaging. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Identifying Mechanisms of Dementia: Role for MRI in the Era of Molecular Imaging (AG11378) Dementia is a leading public health problem now and will have an increasingly serious impact on public health as the number of elderly individuals increase. Dementia has many possible underlying causes and several different causes are at work in most elderly demented subjects.

"Predicting and Detecting Glaucomatous Progression Using Pattern Recognition    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project aims to improve glaucoma management by applying novel pattern recognition techniques to improve the accurate prediction and detection of glaucomatous progression. The premise is that complex functional and structural tests in daily use by eye care providers contain hidden information that is not fully used in current analyses, and that advanced pattern recognition techniques can find and use that hidden information. The primary goals involve the use of mathematically rigorous techniques to discover patterns of defects and to track their changes in longitudinal series of perimetric and optical imaging data from up to 1800 glaucomatous and healthy eyes, available as the result of long-term NIH funding. With the interdisciplinary team of glaucoma and pattern recognition experts we have assembled, with our extensive NIH-supported database of eyes, and with the knowledge we have acquired in the optimal use of pattern recognition methods from previous NIH support, we believe the proposed work can enhance significantly the medical and surgical treatment of glaucoma and reduce the cost of glaucoma care. Moreover, improved techniques for predicting and detecting glaucomatous progression can be used for refined subject recruitment and to define endpoints for clinical trials of intraocular pressure-lowering and neuroprotective drugs.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed project will develop and demonstrate the usefulness of pattern recognition techniques for predicting and detecting patterns of glaucomatous change in patient eyes tested longitudinally by visual field and optical imaging instruments.

"New Techniques for Measuring Volumetric Structural Changes in Glaucoma  ABSTRACT  This K99/R00 application supports additional research training in computational mathematics and computer vision which will enable Dr. Madhusudhanan Balasubramanian-the applicant, to become an independent multidisciplinary investigator in computational ophthalmology. Specifically, in the K99 training phase of this grant, Dr. Balasubramanian will train at UC San Diego under the direction of Linda Zangwill PhD, an established glaucoma clinical researcher in the Department of Ophthalmology, as well as a team of co- mentors, including, Dr. Michael Holst from the Department of Mathematics and co-director for the Center for Computational Mathematics, and co-director of the Comptutational Science, Mathematics and Engineering and Dr. David Kriegman from Computer Science and Engineering. Training will be conducted via formal coursework, hands-on lab training, mentored research, progress review by an advisory committee, visiting collaborating researchers and regular attendance at seminars and workshops. The subsequent R00 independent research phase involves applying Dr. Balasubramanian's newly acquired computational techniques to the difficult task of identifying glaucomatous change over time from optical images of the optic nerve head and retinal nerve fiber layer.  A documented presence of progressive optic neuropathy is the best gold standard currently available for glaucoma diagnosis. Confocal Scanning Laser Ophthalmoscope (CSLO) and Spectral Domain Optical Coherence Tomography (SD-OCT) are two of the optical imaging instruments available for monitoring the optic nerve head health in glaucoma diagnosis and management. Currently, several statistical and computational techniques are available for detecting localized glaucomatous changes from the CSLO exams. SD-OCT is a new generation ophthalmic imaging instrument based on the principle of optical interferometry. In contrast to the CSLO technology, SDOCT can resolve retinal layers from the internal limiting membrane (ILM) through the Bruch's membrane and can capture the 3-D architecture of the optic nerve head at a very high resolution. These high-resolution, high-dimensional volume scans introduce a new level of data complexity not seen in glaucoma progression analysis before and therefore, powerful (high-performance) computational techniques are required to fully utilize the high precision retinal measurements for glaucoma diagnosis. The central focus of this application in the K99 mentored phase of the application will be in 1) developing computational and statistical techniques for detecting structural glaucomatous changes in various retinal layers from the SDOCT scans, and 2) developing a new avenue of research in glaucoma management where in strain in retinal layers will be estimated non-invasively to characterize glaucomatous progression. In the R00 independent phase, the specific aims focus on developing 1) statistical and computational techniques for detecting volumetric glaucomatous change over time using 3-D SD-OCT volume scans and 2) a computational framework to estimate full-field 3-D volumetric strain from the standard SD-OCT scans.  PROJECT NARRATIVE  Detecting the onset and progression of glaucomatous changes in the eye is central to glaucoma diagnosis and management. This multidisciplinary project focuses on developing powerful (high-performance) computational, mathematical, and statistical techniques for detecting volumetric glaucomatous changes from the Confocal Scanning Laser Ophthalmoscopy (CSLO) scans and volumetric Spectral Domain Optical Coherence Tomography (SD-OCT) scans of the optic nerve head. In addition, the Principal Investigator of this proposal will receive extensive training in the areas of computational mathematics and computer vision to augment and strengthen his multidisciplinary expertise essential to execute the proposed specific aims.",New Techniques for Measuring Volumetric Structural Changes in Glaucoma,8209138,K99EY020518,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Advisory Committees', 'Affect', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Biology', 'Blindness', 'Brain imaging', 'Bruch&apos', 's basal membrane structure', 'Cardiology', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Computational Technique', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Confocal Microscopy', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease Progression', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Educational workshop', 'Elements', 'Engineering', 'Eye', 'Functional disorder', 'Gastroenterology', 'Generations', 'Genetic screening method', 'Glaucoma', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Image', 'Interferometry', 'Lasers', 'Lead', 'Left', 'Mathematics', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Membrane', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'National Eye Institute', 'National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering', 'Onset of illness', 'Ophthalmology', 'Ophthalmoscopes', 'Ophthalmoscopy', 'Optic Disk', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Optics', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Principal Investigator', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Resolution', 'Retinal', 'Scanning', 'Science', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Effectiveness', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Validation', 'Vision', 'Vision research', 'Visit', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'bioimaging', 'blood flow measurement', 'cancer imaging', 'computer framework', 'computer science', 'cost', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'improved', 'instrument', 'medical specialties', 'multidisciplinary', 'optic nerve disorder', 'optical imaging', 'prevent', 'programs', 'retinal nerve fiber layer', 'symposium', 'time use']",NEI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",K99,2012,89325,0.053425399075291306
"Real-Time MRI Motion Correction System    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  MOTIVATION - Motion remains one of the most frequent contributors to image artifacts in MR studies.  The motion susceptibility of MRI is well-known and has spawned a number of elegant navigation techniques.  These methods, however, are tailored to specific MR acquisitions that require modified k-space trajectories or the acquisition of additional MR data, and most are unable to correct certain types of motion, for example, through-plane motion.  Moreover, motion correction has been focused on specific families of sequences, but no generally applicable approach currently exists.  Certain patient populations, such as pediatric or geriatric patients, are more likely to move than others.  In pediatric imaging, anesthesia is used to control motion, adding substantially to exam costs and patient risks.  A sequence-independent, autonomous and prospective motion correction system could greatly improve image quality for a wide spectrum of MR examinations.  For pediatric imaging, in particular, we anticipate reduced reliance on anesthesia to control patient motion.  AIMS - We will be focusing on three independent specific aims (carried out in parallel and completed within 4 years), with corresponding subaims that we believe are important for establishing the technical/scientific merit and to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed R&D efforts for our real-time adaptive motion correction approach.  Specifically, these aims are:  (1) to develop and evaluate a coil-mounted MR-compatible tracking device for routine clinical use; (2) to integrate pose tracking into real-time MRI; and (3) to validate our real-time motion correction system in volunteers and patients.  METHODS -In Aim 1 we will improve the methods for computer-vision-based pose estimation inside an MR scanner and build an MR-compatible coil-mounted pose tracker that can be used in clinical routine examinations.  In Aim 2 we will focus on reducing the latency between pose changes happening and the MR scanner reacting to these pose changes, and on building a software library for the MR pulse sequence development that allows one to implement real-time motion correction into all MR pulse sequences.  In Aim 3 we will perform a thorough evaluation of our system on 60 volunteers (30 adults and 30 children) and 120 patients (80 adults and 40 children).  SIGNIFICANCE - The impact of our technology has several facets.  First, it will improve patient care by reducing the number of MR images with compromised quality because of motion artifacts.  Especially because of the increasing reliance on MR Images as a primary means of diagnosis, this will reduce the number of misdiagnoses.  Secondly, this technology will help to lower the high national spending on imaging by dramatically improving the efficiency of MRI scanners.  Finally, it will improve patient comfort by reducing the need for repeat sequences, as well as reduce the necessity of sedation aimed at keeping the patient still.  Overall, this technology will have a significant impact on MRI both in clinical practice and basic science research.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Synopsis Patient motion during an MRI exam can result in major degradation of image quality and decreased efficiency in a large portion of the 40 million MRI procedures performed annually.  This is not only of increasing concern due to the aging population and its associated diseases, but also in children and patients who are simply too sick to remain still during an exam.  This proposal aims to build an optical tracking system and methods to adapt MRI pulse sequences to changes in patient pose in real time.  The project leverages on previous work from an R21 project in which a prototype system was successfully built.  Specifically, the aims are to (i) introduce innovative improvements to the existing prototype, making the system suitable for use in clinical routine, (ii) modify the optical tracking system to be compatible with multiple MR sequences, and (iii) perform clinical evaluation.  Our real-time technique is a unique and innovative solution that will improve MRI image quality and thus patient care, and will address the escalating burden of imaging costs on the health care system.

"Detection of Glaucoma Progression with Macular OCT Imaging     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application is a formal request for a career development award (K23) for an academic glaucoma specialist with a serious interest in the role of imaging in glaucoma using optical coherence tomography (OCT). This will allow the candidate to establish a clinical research program with the main goal of improving detection of glaucoma progression through macular imaging with spectral-domain OCT. By the time the proposed research is accomplished, the candidate will have preliminary data for continuing his research as an independent investigator and will have collected longitudinal structural and functional data in a group of advanced glaucoma patients that will serve as a platform for further improving detection of glaucoma progression with macular OCT imaging. The data will help the candidate provide preliminary results for a subsequent R01 that would potentially allow the PI to continue follow-up of the patients enrolled in the K23 award period.  I have a Master's of Science degree in Clinical Investigation under my belt and intend to deepen my skills in the field of imaging and biostatistics (to be used for enhancing and handling OCT images and for analyzing longitudinal data) by completing the proposed didactic program. By the end of the award period, I expect that I will have gained additional experience, knowledge, and mentorship required to prosper as an independent clinician-scientist in the field of glaucoma. My long-term goal is to carry out longitudinal studies of glaucoma patients where current and upcoming imaging and functional tests can be applied and their utility for detection of glaucoma progression can be investigated. I am confident that the combined skills and experience of my mentors will lead to a successful outcome for the proposed K award. I also envisage myself mentoring candidates like myself in future so that our collective knowledge and wisdom can be passed along to the next generation of aspiring clinician-scientists.  My objectives during the award period are as follows: 1) To develop an individual research program in glaucoma diagnostic imaging; 2) to successfully complete credited coursework in biomathematics, advanced biostatistics, computer vision (image processing), epidemiology, and ethical issues in research.  The main goal of the research component of this proposal is to better delineate the role of macular SD- OCT imaging for detection of glaucoma progression in advanced glaucoma. The specific aims through which this goal will be accomplished are as follows:  (1) To compare the performance of various global and regional macular measures to detect glaucoma.  The potential factors influencing the performance of various macular outcome measures will be explored. Such covariates include age, race, axial length, disc size, central corneal thickness,  OCT signal strength, and outer retinal thickness among others. I hypothesize that the thickness  of the outer retina (outer nuclear layer to retinal pigment epithelium-Bruch's membrane  complex) may be the most important factor explaining the measurement variability of the inner  retinal layer thickness (GCC or ganglion cell/inner plexiform layers).  (2) To determine and compare the utility of the candidate macular measures, detected through the first  aim, for detection of glaucoma progression in moderately advanced to severe glaucoma.  Moderately advanced to severe glaucoma will be defined as eyes with visual field mean  deviation worse than -6 dB or eyes with involvement of the central 10 degrees on the 24-2  visual field. It is widely accepted that measurement of the optic nerve head or RNFL parameters  in advanced glaucoma does not provide clinicians with much useful information. In contrast, the  central macular ganglion cells are the last to die in glaucoma. Macular imaging in advanced  glaucoma is directed towards this area where detection of change may still be possible. I  hypothesize that macular OCT parameters are valid structural outcome measures (biomarkers)  that can be used to follow the course of the disease in advanced glaucoma and that such  measures are significantly correlated with changes in the central visual field. Changes in the  macular measures over time will be first correlated with the corresponding visual field change  (functional progression) over time in eyes with moderately advanced to severe glaucoma. The  utility of the best candidate macular measures for predicting subsequent glaucoma progression  will also be explored and compared. I hypothesize that there may be a lag period between  progressive loss of macular ganglion cells and subsequent visual field progression in advanced  glaucoma, and therefore, detection of worsening in one or more macular outcome measures  can be used as a proxy for subsequent visual field progression.  Collectively, these studies will provide a solid foundation for better understanding and integration of macular OCT imaging in the care of glaucoma patients. Timely detection of glaucoma progression in the later stages can significantly reduce visual disability and blindness through earlier aggressive treatment and will potentially reduce glaucoma's financial burden to society.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Detection of glaucoma progression remains a challenging task in eyes demonstrating significant damage. Even small amounts of progression in advanced glaucoma can have important consequences with regard to patient's visual function and quality of life. The results of the proposed study will potentially lead to more effective and earlier detection of glaucoma progression and will allow ophthalmologists to step up treatment in a timely manner. This will in turn result in less visual morbidity and reduced blindness from glaucoma, which is projected to cause more than 10 million cases of legal blindness around the world in 2020.              Detection of glaucoma progression remains a challenging task in eyes demonstrating significant damage.

"Prostate-cancer Imaging by Combined Ultrasound and Magnetic-resonance Parameters    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Riverside Research Institute, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Rutgers University, and the General Electric Corporation propose to undertake an Academic-Industrial Partnership study to improve prostate- cancer (PCA) imaging markedly and thereby improve prostate-biopsy guidance to detect PCa; enhance monitoring, surveillance, and treatment of PCa; and enable planning and execution of focal PCa therapy. The project is highly significant because it addresses a major health problem in the United States and other developed countries. The project will overcome the current inability of established clinical-imaging method to image PCa reliably by combining the capabilities of advanced ultrasound (US) and magnetic-resonance (MR) techniques in a clinically effective manner. The proposed approach will exploit the sensitivity of US to mechanical properties of tissue on a microscopic scale with the sensitivity of MR to chemical constituents of tissue and its ability to sense blood distribution. Each of these modalities senses different and independent properties of tissue and has shown encouraging potential for improved imaging of PCa when used alone; combining parameters derived from each modality can provide far superior sensitivity and specificity for PCa. We will combine US and MR parameters using advanced classifiers such as artificial neural networks and support-vector machines. These classifiers already have produced ROC-curve areas of 0.91 for advanced US methods, and the MR methods have demonstrated equivalent ROC-curve areas in many studies. We will embody the combined capabilities in specifications for a prototype imaging system that can generate prostate tissue-typing images (TTIs) in real-time for targeting biopsies or planning treatment in the operating room or in an off-line setting. The latest Logiq E9 instrument currently being produced by GE already has a capability for fusing previously obtained MR images with US images in real time, which provides an existing framework for combining US and MR parameters and generating real-time TTIs. Successfully generating reliable prostate TTIs based on combined US and MR parameters will represent a quantum advance in PCa management by enabling significant improvements in the diagnosis and treatment of PCa.

"SLASH: SCALABLE LARGE ANALYTIC SEGMENTATION HYBRID DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Advanced instrumentation and cellular imaging techniques using high-throughput 3D electron microscopy are driving a new revolution in the exploration of complex biological systems by providing near seamless views across multiple scales of resolution. These datasets provide the necessary breadth and depth to analyze multicellular, cellular, and subcelluar structure across large swathes of neural tissue. While these new imaging procedures are generating extremely large datasets of enormous value, the quantities are such that no single user or even laboratory team can possibly analyze the full content of their own imaging activities through traditional means. To address this challenge, we propose to further develop and refine a prototype hybrid system for high-throughput segmentation of large neuropil datasets that: 1) advances automatic algorithms for segmentation of cellular and sub-cellular structures using machine learning techniques; 2) couples these techniques to a scalable and flexible process or tool suite allowing multiple users to simultaneously review, edit and curate the results of these automatic approaches; and, 3) builds a knowledge base of training data guiding and improving automated processing. This system will allow project scientists to select areas of interest, execute automatic segmentation algorithms, and distribute workload, curate data, and deposit final results into the Cell Centered Database (Martone et al. 2008) via accessible web-interfaces. Emerging techniques in cellular and subcellular 3D imaging are generating datasets of enormous value to the study of disease processes and to the pursuit of greater insight into the structure and function of the nervous system. To unlock the potential of these data, new solutions are needed to improve the capability to segment and label the individual molecular, subcellular and cellular components within very large volumetric expanses. To address this challenge, we propose a hybrid system for high-throughput segmentation of large neuropil datasets that advances machine learning algorithms for automatic segmentation and couples these techniques to a scalable tool suite for multiple users to simultaneously review, edit and curate results.",SLASH: SCALABLE LARGE ANALYTIC SEGMENTATION HYBRID,8163481,R01NS075314,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Automobile Driving', 'Biological', 'Cell membrane', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Cellular Structures', 'Classification', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Computers and Advanced Instrumentation', 'Couples', 'Cytoskeleton', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Deposition', 'Devices', 'Disease', 'Electron Microscopy', 'Electrons', 'Face', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Internet', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Methods', 'Microscopic', 'Mitochondria', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Target', 'Names', 'Nervous System Physiology', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurofibrillary Tangles', 'Neurons', 'Neuropil', 'Online Systems', 'Organelles', 'Participant', 'Process', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Scanning Electron Microscopy', 'Scientist', 'Services', 'Solutions', 'Staining method', 'Stains', 'Structure', 'Subcellular structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Utah', 'Validation', 'Work', 'Workload', 'biological systems', 'cellular imaging', 'complex biological systems', 'data mining', 'digital imaging', 'electron optics', 'flexibility', 'image processing', 'improved', 'insight', 'interest', 'knowledge base', 'novel', 'prototype', 'relating to nervous system', 'scientific computing', 'tomography', 'tool', 'web interface']",NINDS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2011,459174,0.016206854998710055
"Identifying Mechanisms of Dementia:  Role for MRI in the Era of Molecular Imaging Dementia represents a major public health problem which will grow significantly with the aging of our society. Recently, multiple pieces of converging clinical and neuropathological data indicate that dementia is typically a multi-factorial process. This evolution in thinking about the biology of dementia comes at a time when the most significant recent development in dementia imaging has been the introduction of amyloid plaque labeling compounds; the most widely studied at this point is Pittsburgh Compound - B (PiB). A central principle underlying this renewal is this. Amyloid imaging is unquestionably a major advance. However, since the biology of dementia is more complex than brain amyloidosis alone, imaging of dementia is more complex than brain amyloid imaging alone. Our primary goal in this renewal is to use various imaging modalities to identify different mechanisms underlying dementia. This is the first resubmission of a competitive renewal of AG11378. We have revised the grant in accordance with each point raised in the critique and we believe this has resulted in a much stronger application. Each of the five aims is cast to answer variations on the questions: What is the contribution of specific imaging-based proxies of pathology to clinical/cognitive decline? When in the course of the disease do these relationships hold true? For whom is this true? Where in the brain are the relevant pathologies expressed? Principle outcome measures will be clinical and psychometric decline over time which we will use as indicators of disease progression. Our predictor variables will include various imaging modalities which will serve as proxies for specific pathologic mechanisms underlying dementia. PiB will serve as a measure of plaque burden and we will use various Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) modalities to assess cerebro- vascular disease, tissue loss, tissue perfusion, diffusion, neuronal integrity, and inflammation. Features that distinguish this renewal from past cycles of AG11378 include a mechanistic focus, multi- modality imaging including multiple MRI modalities as well as PET amyloid imaging, MR imaging now at 3T, inclusion of both amnestic and non-amnestic MCI, and voxel-based analytic methods including an exciting new computational approach which employs a support vector machine algorithm to provide diagnosis in individual subjects. In addition, subjects will now be recruited from a new population-based study of aging and dementia, which differentiates this renewal from past cycles as well as from most dementia imaging studies which recruit from referral practices and thus risk sampling bias. Previous cycles of this grant have contributed significantly to recognition of the utility of imaging in dementia. An active debate is currently underway about revising clinical criteria for AD, specifically whether imaging and fluid biomarker information should be included among the criteria. Results from this renewal grant will inform this debate about multiple time dependent mechanisms leading to dementia that are accessible in living subjects through imaging. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Identifying Mechanisms of Dementia: Role for MRI in the Era of Molecular Imaging (AG11378) Dementia is a leading public health problem now and will have an increasingly serious impact on public health as the number of elderly individuals increase. Dementia has many possible underlying causes and several different causes are at work in most elderly demented subjects.

"New Techniques for Measuring Volumetric Structural Changes in Glaucoma    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant) This K99/R00 application supports additional research training in computational mathematics and computer vision which will enable Dr. Madhusudhanan Balasubramanian-the applicant, to become an independent multidisciplinary investigator in computational ophthalmology. Specifically, in the K99 training phase of this grant, Dr. Balasubramanian will train at UC San Diego under the direction of Linda Zangwill PhD, an established glaucoma clinical researcher in the Department of Ophthalmology, as well as a team of co- mentors, including, Dr. Michael Holst from the Department of Mathematics and co-director for the Center for Computational Mathematics, and co-director of the Computational Science, Mathematics and Engineering and Dr. David Kriegman from Computer Science and Engineering. Training will be conducted via formal coursework, hands-on lab training, mentored research, and progress review by an advisory committee, visiting collaborating researchers and regular attendance at seminars and workshops. The subsequent R00 independent research phase involves applying Dr. Balasubramanian's newly acquired computational techniques to the difficult task of identifying glaucomatous change over time from optical images of the optic nerve head and retinal nerve fiber layer.  A documented presence of progressive optic neuropathy is the best gold standard currently available for glaucoma diagnosis. Confocal Scanning Laser Ophthalmoscope (CSLO) and Spectral Domain Optical Coherence Tomography (SD-OCT) are two of the optical imaging instruments available for monitoring the optic nerve head health in glaucoma diagnosis and management. Currently, several statistical and computational techniques are available for detecting localized glaucomatous changes from the CSLO exams. SD-OCT is a new generation ophthalmic imaging instrument based on the principle of optical interferometry. In contrast to the CSLO technology, SDOCT can resolve retinal layers from the internal limiting membrane (ILM) through the Bruch's membrane and can capture the 3-D architecture of the optic nerve head at a very high resolution. These high-resolution, high-dimensional volume scans introduce a new level of data complexity not seen in glaucoma progression analysis before and therefore, powerful (high-performance) computational techniques are required to fully utilize the high precision retinal measurements for glaucoma diagnosis. The central focus of this application in the K99 mentored phase of the application will be in 1) developing computational and statistical techniques for detecting structural glaucomatous changes in various retinal layers from the SDOCT scans, and 2) developing a new avenue of research in glaucoma management where in strain in retinal layers will be estimated non-invasively to characterize glaucomatous progression. In the R00 independent phase, the specific aims focus on developing 1) statistical and computational techniques for detecting volumetric glaucomatous change over time using 3-D SD-OCT volume scans and 2) a computational framework to estimate full-field 3-D volumetric strain from the standard SD-OCT scans.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Detecting the onset and progression of glaucomatous changes in the eye is central to glaucoma diagnosis and management.

"Real-Time MRI Motion Correction System    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  MOTIVATION - Motion remains one of the most frequent contributors to image artifacts in MR studies.  The motion susceptibility of MRI is well-known and has spawned a number of elegant navigation techniques.  These methods, however, are tailored to specific MR acquisitions that require modified k-space trajectories or the acquisition of additional MR data, and most are unable to correct certain types of motion, for example, through-plane motion.  Moreover, motion correction has been focused on specific families of sequences, but no generally applicable approach currently exists.

"A New Paradigm for Integrated Analysis of Multiscale Genomic Imaging Datasets    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       A decade ago when microarray was first invented, it was hailed as ""an array of hope"" in Nature Genetics and has received a considerable amount of attention in biomedicine. Subsequently it has been called ""an array of problems"" in Nature Review. An inherent problem with microarray gene expression is that structural information is missing, which limits its ability in biological discovery. To overcome the poor reproducibility and accuracy of microarray imaging, there needs to be a shift in fundamental paradigms to those able to incorporate complementary and multiscale structural imaging information into microarray imaging. Fortunately, the latest progress in high resolution biomolecular imaging probe development coupled with advanced image analysis makes integrative and systematic studies of cellular systems possible. A cell can be labeled using multiscale and multimodality imaging, providing both structural and functional information. With multiscale imaging spreadsheets now available, there is an overwhelming need within the life sciences community to manage this information effectively, to analyze it comprehensively, and to apply the resulting knowledge in the understanding of the genetic system of a cell. However, the management and mining of this large-scale imaging information is limited by today's computational approaches and knowledge-sharing infrastructure. These problems represent a major impediment to progress in the emerging area of bio-molecular image informatics. Therefore, the goal of this project is to develop a unique genomic image management and mining system that can allow geneticists to search, correlate and integrate this multiscale and multi-modality imaging information in an easily operable fashion and further enable new biological discovery. In particular, this system will fill a void left in the current image database systems such as Open Microscope Environment (OME), e.g., the lack of analytic tools for integrative data analysis. To realize this goal, we are bringing together a strong interdisciplinary team consisting of imaging engineers, geneticists and industrial imaging scientists. Building on our diverse and complementary expertise, we are able to provide innovative and interdisciplinary approaches that combine the latest progress in image processing, imaging database design and machine learning with the development of high resolution and high throughput molecular imaging probes in genomics. More specifically, we will accomplish the following specific aims. First, we will develop a suite of algorithms for content extraction and information retrieval from high resolution fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) images. This visual system will effectively manage imaging phenotype information, facilitating knowledge discovery such as identifying visually similar subtypes. Second, we will correlate quantitative traits extracted from FISH imaging with genomic structural rearrangements and gene expression patterns. Finally, we will develop a data integration approach to fuse disparate information from multi-modality imaging databases for improved characterization of biological systems.               Public Health Relevance Statement The anticipated outcome of the project will include a publicly accessible imaging database analysis system to facilitate multiscale genomic image information integration and knowledge mining. The proposed approach challenges the current paradigm by the integration of high resolution structural imaging with functional information, which promises to overcome the poor accuracy and reproducibility problems plagued with microarray imaging. Given the ubiquitous use of microarray imaging in biomedicine, the project is thus expected to be of great impact on the biomedical community.",A New Paradigm for Integrated Analysis of Multiscale Genomic Imaging Datasets,7845601,R21LM010042,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Models', 'Biological Sciences', 'Biology', 'Blast Cell', 'Cells', 'Chromosome abnormality', 'Comb animal structure', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational Biology', 'Coupled', 'DNA Sequence', 'DNA Sequence Rearrangement', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Exhibits', 'Fluorescent in Situ Hybridization', 'Functional Imaging', 'Gene Expression', 'Genetic', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Human Genome', 'Hybridization Array', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Informatics', 'Information Retrieval', 'Karyotype', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Left', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medicine', 'Microscope', 'Mining', 'Modality', 'Molecular', 'Nature', 'Organ', 'Organism', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Plague', 'Prevention', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Resolution', 'Retrieval', 'Scientist', 'Specimen', 'Staging', 'System', 'Systems Analysis', 'Systems Biology', 'Tissues', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'Visual', 'Visual system structure', 'Work', 'base', 'bioimaging', 'biological systems', 'complex biological systems', 'data integration', 'database design', 'disease diagnosis', 'disorder prevention', 'gene function', 'genome sequencing', 'image processing', 'imaging informatics', 'imaging modality', 'imaging probe', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'knowledge of results', 'molecular imaging', 'multimodality', 'mutant', 'public health relevance', 'structural genomics', 'tool', 'trait', 'visual map']",NLM,TULANE UNIVERSITY OF LOUISIANA,R21,2010,186306,0.03459202684205997
"Identifying Mechanisms of Dementia:  Role for MRI in the Era of Molecular Imaging Dementia represents a major public health problem which will grow significantly with the aging of our society. Recently, multiple pieces of converging clinical and neuropathological data indicate that dementia is typically a multi-factorial process. This evolution in thinking about the biology of dementia comes at a time when the most significant recent development in dementia imaging has been the introduction of amyloid plaque labeling compounds; the most widely studied at this point is Pittsburgh Compound - B (PiB). A central principle underlying this renewal is this. Amyloid imaging is unquestionably a major advance. However, since the biology of dementia is more complex than brain amyloidosis alone, imaging of dementia is more complex than brain amyloid imaging alone. Our primary goal in this renewal is to use various imaging modalities to identify different mechanisms underlying dementia. This is the first resubmission of a competitive renewal of AG11378. We have revised the grant in accordance with each point raised in the critique and we believe this has resulted in a much stronger application. Each of the five aims is cast to answer variations on the questions: What is the contribution of specific imaging-based proxies of pathology to clinical/cognitive decline? When in the course of the disease do these relationships hold true? For whom is this true? Where in the brain are the relevant pathologies expressed? Principle outcome measures will be clinical and psychometric decline over time which we will use as indicators of disease progression. Our predictor variables will include various imaging modalities which will serve as proxies for specific pathologic mechanisms underlying dementia. PiB will serve as a measure of plaque burden and we will use various Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) modalities to assess cerebro- vascular disease, tissue loss, tissue perfusion, diffusion, neuronal integrity, and inflammation. Features that distinguish this renewal from past cycles of AG11378 include a mechanistic focus, multi- modality imaging including multiple MRI modalities as well as PET amyloid imaging, MR imaging now at 3T, inclusion of both amnestic and non-amnestic MCI, and voxel-based analytic methods including an exciting new computational approach which employs a support vector machine algorithm to provide diagnosis in individual subjects. In addition, subjects will now be recruited from a new population-based study of aging and dementia, which differentiates this renewal from past cycles as well as from most dementia imaging studies which recruit from referral practices and thus risk sampling bias. Previous cycles of this grant have contributed significantly to recognition of the utility of imaging in dementia. An active debate is currently underway about revising clinical criteria for AD, specifically whether imaging and fluid biomarker information should be included among the criteria. Results from this renewal grant will inform this debate about multiple time dependent mechanisms leading to dementia that are accessible in living subjects through imaging. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Identifying Mechanisms of Dementia: Role for MRI in the Era of Molecular Imaging (AG11378) Dementia is a leading public health problem now and will have an increasingly serious impact on public health as the number of elderly individuals increase. Dementia has many possible underlying causes and several different causes are at work in most elderly demented subjects. In this grant, we will use modern brain imaging to identify specific mechanisms underlying progression to dementia. n/a",Identifying Mechanisms of Dementia:  Role for MRI in the Era of Molecular Imaging,7894558,R01AG011378,"['6-hydroxybenzothiazole', 'Abbreviations', 'Address', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease Pathway', 'Amyloid deposition', 'Amyloidosis', 'Anatomy', 'Anisotropy', 'Applications Grants', 'Attenuated', 'Autopsy', 'Base of the Brain', 'Binding', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Biostatistical Methods', 'Brain', 'Brain Mapping', 'Brain imaging', 'Cerebrovascular Circulation', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Pathology', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Correlation Studies', 'Critiques', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Elderly', 'Enrollment', 'Epidemiologic Studies', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Inositol', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Life', 'Liquid substance', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Metric', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'N-acetylaspartate', 'Neurofibrillary Tangles', 'Neurons', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Perfusion', 'Pittsburgh Compound-B', 'Population', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Process', 'Proxy', 'Psychometrics', 'Public Health', 'Recovery', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Relative (related person)', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Biases', 'Scheme', 'Senile Plaques', 'Severity of illness', 'Societies', 'Spin Labels', 'Staging', 'Study Subject', 'Symptoms', 'Synapses', 'Syndrome', 'Text', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Variant', 'Vascular Diseases', 'Work', 'amyloid imaging', 'base', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'cohort', 'imaging modality', 'in vivo', 'interest', 'mild neurocognitive impairment', 'molecular imaging', 'morphometry', 'neuroimaging', 'population based', 'primary outcome', 'public health relevance', 'tool']",NIA,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,R01,2010,1034999,0.0032470255043188546
"High Resolution In-Utero Mapping of Fetal Brain Development from Combined MRI    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Understanding normal and abnormal patterns of brain development in fetuses and neonates is a key factor in early detection of developmental disorders. This project proposal seeks to develop and refine novel magnetic resonance image reconstruction and analysis methodology to allow, for the first time, the mapping of in-utero fetal brain development. One of the most common abnormalities detected by clinical imaging of the developing fetal brain is ventriculomegaly, which, despite the absence of other clinical or imaging findings, is associated with neurodevelopmental disabilities in infancy and childhood in up to 50% of cases. Although ultrasound allows diagnosis of the condition, it has not been able to distinguish those fetus that will have poor neurological outcome from those with normal outcome. Recent developments in fast magnetic resonance imaging have permitted the use of MRI to study the fetal anatomy and this technique is now being routinely used at a small number of sites around the world including UCSF. However, MR imaging of the fetal brain is still challenging because of imaging distortions caused by motion of the fetus within the mother and by artifacts caused by the surrounding maternal anatomy. Higher resolution or 3D acquisitions are not possible because of motion of the fetus during the acquisition time^ required. The current clinical 2D slice data individually provide limited resolution and contrast and, most importantly, often contain severe motion corruption between slices. This project is motivated by the observation that it is possible to apply computer vision and image processing techniques to correct relative motion between the multiple stacks of low resolution fetal slices, and create a single volumetric image with high isotropic 3D resolution and consistent geometry. Such higher resolution images provide structure that may be analyzed using computational morphometric techniques that can detect subtle focal differences in the pattern of tissue volume, location and surface folding. This project will combine such powerful techniques with extensive fetal and neonatal imaging experience at UCSF, allowing direct clinical application of the methodology to study morphologic aberrations associated with ventriculomegaly and to correlate these with clinical outcome. The ability to apply these computational techniques to in-utero data will provide an entirely new view of the developing brain, which promises to shed new light on early developmental problems both in fetuses and premature neonates.           n/a",High Resolution In-Utero Mapping of Fetal Brain Development from Combined MRI,7904306,R01NS055064,"['Anatomy', 'Automobile Driving', 'Brain', 'Brain Mapping', 'Childhood', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Computational Technique', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Deformity', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Evolution', 'Fetus', 'Gestational Age', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Infant', 'Infant Development', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lesion', 'Light', 'Link', 'Location', 'MRI Scans', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Mothers', 'Motion', 'Neonatal', 'Neurodevelopmental Disability', 'Neurological outcome', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Premature Infant', 'Prematurity of fetus', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Site', 'Slice', 'Staging', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'Techniques', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Ultrasonography', 'Work', 'brain tissue', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinical application', 'developmental disease', 'experience', 'fetal', 'follow-up', 'gray matter', 'image processing', 'image reconstruction', 'improved', 'in utero', 'infancy', 'insight', 'neonate', 'novel', 'premature', 'programs', 'reconstruction', 'tool', 'two-dimensional']",NINDS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2010,48929,0.033464098693956716
"Real-Time MRI Motion Correction System    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  MOTIVATION - Motion remains one of the most frequent contributors to image artifacts in MR studies.  The motion susceptibility of MRI is well-known and has spawned a number of elegant navigation techniques.  These methods, however, are tailored to specific MR acquisitions that require modified k-space trajectories or the acquisition of additional MR data, and most are unable to correct certain types of motion, for example, through-plane motion.  Moreover, motion correction has been focused on specific families of sequences, but no generally applicable approach currently exists.  Certain patient populations, such as pediatric or geriatric patients, are more likely to move than others.  In pediatric imaging, anesthesia is used to control motion, adding substantially to exam costs and patient risks.  A sequence-independent, autonomous and prospective motion correction system could greatly improve image quality for a wide spectrum of MR examinations.

"High Resolution In-Utero Mapping of Fetal Brain Development from Combined MRI    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Understanding normal and abnormal patterns of brain development in fetuses and neonates is a key factor in early detection of developmental disorders. This project proposal seeks to develop and refine novel magnetic resonance image reconstruction and analysis methodology to allow, for the first time, the mapping of in-utero fetal brain development. One of the most common abnormalities detected by clinical imaging of the developing fetal brain is ventriculomegaly, which, despite the absence of other clinical or imaging findings, is associated with neurodevelopmental disabilities in infancy and childhood in up to 50% of cases. Although ultrasound allows diagnosis of the condition, it has not been able to distinguish those fetus that will have poor neurological outcome from those with normal outcome. Recent developments in fast magnetic resonance imaging have permitted the use of MRI to study the fetal anatomy and this technique is now being routinely used at a small number of sites around the world including UCSF. However, MR imaging of the fetal brain is still challenging because of imaging distortions caused by motion of the fetus within the mother and by artifacts caused by the surrounding maternal anatomy. Higher resolution or 3D acquisitions are not possible because of motion of the fetus during the acquisition time^ required. The current clinical 2D slice data individually provide limited resolution and contrast and, most importantly, often contain severe motion corruption between slices. This project is motivated by the observation that it is possible to apply computer vision and image processing techniques to correct relative motion between the multiple stacks of low resolution fetal slices, and create a single volumetric image with high isotropic 3D resolution and consistent geometry. Such higher resolution images provide structure that may be analyzed using computational morphometric techniques that can detect subtle focal differences in the pattern of tissue volume, location and surface folding. This project will combine such powerful techniques with extensive fetal and neonatal imaging experience at UCSF, allowing direct clinical application of the methodology to study morphologic aberrations associated with ventriculomegaly and to correlate these with clinical outcome. The ability to apply these computational techniques to in-utero data will provide an entirely new view of the developing brain, which promises to shed new light on early developmental problems both in fetuses and premature neonates.           n/a",High Resolution In-Utero Mapping of Fetal Brain Development from Combined MRI,8287830,R01NS055064,[' '],NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2010,223596,0.033464098693956716
"A New Paradigm for Integrated Analysis of Multiscale Genomic Imaging Datasets    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       A decade ago when microarray was first invented, it was hailed as ""an array of hope"" in Nature Genetics and has received a considerable amount of attention in biomedicine. Subsequently it has been called ""an array of problems"" in Nature Review. An inherent problem with microarray gene expression is that structural information is missing, which limits its ability in biological discovery. To overcome the poor reproducibility and accuracy of microarray imaging, there needs to be a shift in fundamental paradigms to those able to incorporate complementary and multiscale structural imaging information into microarray imaging. Fortunately, the latest progress in high resolution biomolecular imaging probe development coupled with advanced image analysis makes integrative and systematic studies of cellular systems possible. A cell can be labeled using multiscale and multimodality imaging, providing both structural and functional information. With multiscale imaging spreadsheets now available, there is an overwhelming need within the life sciences community to manage this information effectively, to analyze it comprehensively, and to apply the resulting knowledge in the understanding of the genetic system of a cell. However, the management and mining of this large-scale imaging information is limited by today's computational approaches and knowledge-sharing infrastructure. These problems represent a major impediment to progress in the emerging area of bio-molecular image informatics. Therefore, the goal of this project is to develop a unique genomic image management and mining system that can allow geneticists to search, correlate and integrate this multiscale and multi-modality imaging information in an easily operable fashion and further enable new biological discovery. In particular, this system will fill a void left in the current image database systems such as Open Microscope Environment (OME), e.g., the lack of analytic tools for integrative data analysis. To realize this goal, we are bringing together a strong interdisciplinary team consisting of imaging engineers, geneticists and industrial imaging scientists. Building on our diverse and complementary expertise, we are able to provide innovative and interdisciplinary approaches that combine the latest progress in image processing, imaging database design and machine learning with the development of high resolution and high throughput molecular imaging probes in genomics. More specifically, we will accomplish the following specific aims. First, we will develop a suite of algorithms for content extraction and information retrieval from high resolution fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) images. This visual system will effectively manage imaging phenotype information, facilitating knowledge discovery such as identifying visually similar subtypes. Second, we will correlate quantitative traits extracted from FISH imaging with genomic structural rearrangements and gene expression patterns. Finally, we will develop a data integration approach to fuse disparate information from multi-modality imaging databases for improved characterization of biological systems.               Public Health Relevance Statement The anticipated outcome of the project will include a publicly accessible imaging database analysis system to facilitate multiscale genomic image information integration and knowledge mining. The proposed approach challenges the current paradigm by the integration of high resolution structural imaging with functional information, which promises to overcome the poor accuracy and reproducibility problems plagued with microarray imaging. Given the ubiquitous use of microarray imaging in biomedicine, the project is thus expected to be of great impact on the biomedical community.",A New Paradigm for Integrated Analysis of Multiscale Genomic Imaging Datasets,7641582,R21LM010042,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Models', 'Biological Sciences', 'Biology', 'Blast Cell', 'Cells', 'Chromosome abnormality', 'Classification', 'Comb animal structure', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational Biology', 'Coupled', 'DNA Sequence', 'DNA Sequence Rearrangement', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Exhibits', 'Fluorescent in Situ Hybridization', 'Functional Imaging', 'Gene Expression', 'Genetic', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Human Genome', 'Hybridization Array', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Informatics', 'Information Retrieval', 'Karyotype', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Left', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medicine', 'Microscope', 'Mining', 'Modality', 'Molecular', 'Nature', 'Organ', 'Organism', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Plague', 'Prevention', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Resolution', 'Retrieval', 'Scientist', 'Specimen', 'Staging', 'System', 'Systems Analysis', 'Systems Biology', 'Tissues', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'Visual', 'Visual system structure', 'Work', 'base', 'bioimaging', 'biological systems', 'complex biological systems', 'data integration', 'database design', 'disease diagnosis', 'disorder prevention', 'gene function', 'genome sequencing', 'image processing', 'imaging informatics', 'imaging modality', 'imaging probe', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'knowledge of results', 'molecular imaging', 'multimodality', 'mutant', 'public health relevance', 'structural genomics', 'tool', 'trait', 'visual map']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI KANSAS CITY,R21,2009,219972,0.03459202684205997
"Identifying Mechanisms of Dementia:  Role for MRI in the Era of Molecular Imaging    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Dementia represents a major public health problem which will grow significantly with the aging of our society. Recently, multiple pieces of converging clinical and neuropathological data indicate that dementia is typically a multi-factorial process. This evolution in thinking about the biology of dementia comes at a time when the most significant recent development in dementia imaging has been the introduction of amyloid plaque labeling compounds; the most widely studied at this point is Pittsburgh Compound - B (PiB). A central principle underlying this renewal is this. Amyloid imaging is unquestionably a major advance. However, since the biology of dementia is more complex than brain amyloidosis alone, imaging of dementia is more complex than brain amyloid imaging alone. Our primary goal in this renewal is to use various imaging modalities to identify different mechanisms underlying dementia. This is the first resubmission of a competitive renewal of AG11378. We have revised the grant in accordance with each point raised in the critique and we believe this has resulted in a much stronger application. Each of the five aims is cast to answer variations on the questions: What is the contribution of specific imaging-based proxies of pathology to clinical/cognitive decline? When in the course of the disease do these relationships hold true? For whom is this true? Where in the brain are the relevant pathologies expressed? Principle outcome measures will be clinical and psychometric decline over time which we will use as indicators of disease progression. Our predictor variables will include various imaging modalities which will serve as proxies for specific pathologic mechanisms underlying dementia. PiB will serve as a measure of plaque burden and we will use various Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) modalities to assess cerebro- vascular disease, tissue loss, tissue perfusion, diffusion, neuronal integrity, and inflammation. Features that distinguish this renewal from past cycles of AG11378 include a mechanistic focus, multi- modality imaging including multiple MRI modalities as well as PET amyloid imaging, MR imaging now at 3T, inclusion of both amnestic and non-amnestic MCI, and voxel-based analytic methods including an exciting new computational approach which employs a support vector machine algorithm to provide diagnosis in individual subjects. In addition, subjects will now be recruited from a new population-based study of aging and dementia, which differentiates this renewal from past cycles as well as from most dementia imaging studies which recruit from referral practices and thus risk sampling bias. Previous cycles of this grant have contributed significantly to recognition of the utility of imaging in dementia. An active debate is currently underway about revising clinical criteria for AD, specifically whether imaging and fluid biomarker information should be included among the criteria. Results from this renewal grant will inform this debate about multiple time dependent mechanisms leading to dementia that are accessible in living subjects through imaging.

"Accurate detection of chromosomal abnormalities with multi-color image processing    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The combination of high resolution assays in genomics with microscopic imaging has been used for the detection of complex chromosomal rearrangements, a significant but difficult problem in prenatal and postnatal diagnosis, birth defect detection and cancer research. As a recently developed molecular cytogenetic technique, multiplex fluorescence in situ hybridization (M-FISH) imaging has provided rapid and high resolution detection of chromosomal abnormalities associated with cancer and genetic disorders. However, the technique is currently limited to research use and only serves as an adjunct tool to the G-banding based monochromatic chromosomal karyotyping in a clinical laboratory. A primary barrier of the technique is the lower classification accuracy when classifying chromosomes from multi-color microscopic imaging data. Therefore, the goal of this R15 project is to develop innovative multi-spectral image processing and machine learning techniques for M-FISH image analysis so that chromosomal rearrangement detection can be made more reproducible, robust, and faster, thereby significantly increasing the ability and efficacy of this newly developed cellular imaging technique. Our proposed approaches such as multiscale feature extraction, nonlinear manifold analysis and adaptive fuzzy clustering are able to target specific features of multi-spectral imaging data, promising a significant improvement over the current techniques. In order to validate the technique and bring it into clinical use, we will partner with a clinical geneticist, Dr. Merlin Butler, and a cytogeneticist, Dr. Diane Persons both at Kansas University Medical Center. In addition, we will collaborate with an industrial scientist, Dr. Kenneth Castleman, who is the pioneer in developing and commercializing cytogenetic imaging products. Through our interdisciplinary research and collaboration, we will accomplish the following specific aims: 1) develop image normalization approaches to improve the acquisition of multi-color FISH images; 2) develop multiscale dimension analysis to extract features from multi-color images; 3) design adaptive fuzzy clustering and incorporate contextual information to improve the pixel-wise classification of chromosomes; and 4) validate computational approaches with clinical testing in collaboration with medical and industrial partners. This research project will also enhance our research infrastructure in biomedical image informatics and provide undergraduate and graduate students opportunities to touch the frontier of molecular and cellular imaging by participating in the proposed research activities. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Unraveling complex rearrangements using cytogenetic approaches such as M-FISH imaging has been extremely useful in prenatal, postnatal and cancer diagnoses. Our proposed approaches have the potential to significantly improve the reliability of the newly developed M-FISH imaging technique, making it feasible for clinical use. This will in turn benefit the health of human beings. Furthermore, the developed computational techniques can be applicable to a wide range of multi-color bio-imaging problems, thereby having a broad impact on the biomedical community.           Project Narrative Unraveling complex rearrangements using cytogenetic approaches such as M-FISH imaging has been extremely useful in prenatal, postnatal and cancer diagnoses.

"Validation and Evaluation of a Portable Body Scanner for Determination of Obesity    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Obesity has reached epidemic levels in the U.S., with 66% of adults overweight and 32% of adults obese. The research uses the new technique of three-dimensional  (3 D) photonic scanning to create and validate an instrument that  rapidly  assesses  obesity  in  clinical  and  field  settings.  The  first  aim  is  to develop a portable computer vision system of body imaging for 3 D surface imaging of the human body. The hardware system is designed from off-the- shelf components such as digital cameras, projectors, and personal computer. Algorithms for the 3D data are being developed and refined for calculation and system calibration for a small instrument. The second aim is to develop algorithms for surface reconstruction from 3D data in order to define a proper surface representation and to reconstruct a 3D model of the human body from incomplete and noisy data. The third aim begins the human measurement testing in 120 adults. Aim 3 is to estimate the size and shape of the reconstructed human body by a portable body imager and compare to current methods that assess obesity. Anthropometric parameters will be computed by a 3 second body scan via imaging and then compared to other methods of obesity assessment including BMI, waist circumference, sagittal abdominal diameter, bioimpedence, hydrodensitometry, dual energy X-ray absorptiometry, and air displacement plethysmography. The final aim is to validate body imaging as an indicator of central obesity (fat in the abdominal region, as opposed to subcutaneous depots) in a subset of 60 subjects because it is the abdominal fat that is most associated with health risks such as diabetes. Abdominal fat tissue as detected by magnetic resonance imaging scans will be compared to that calculated from 3 D body imaging.

"High Resolution In-Utero Mapping of Fetal Brain Development from Combined MRI    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Understanding normal and abnormal patterns of brain development in fetuses and neonates is a key factor in early detection of developmental disorders. This project proposal seeks to develop and refine novel magnetic resonance image reconstruction and analysis methodology to allow, for the first time, the mapping of in-utero fetal brain development. One of the most common abnormalities detected by clinical imaging of the developing fetal brain is ventriculomegaly, which, despite the absence of other clinical or imaging findings, is associated with neurodevelopmental disabilities in infancy and childhood in up to 50% of cases. Although ultrasound allows diagnosis of the condition, it has not been able to distinguish those fetus that will have poor neurological outcome from those with normal outcome. Recent developments in fast magnetic resonance imaging have permitted the use of MRI to study the fetal anatomy and this technique is now being routinely used at a small number of sites around the world including UCSF. However, MR imaging of the fetal brain is still challenging because of imaging distortions caused by motion of the fetus within the mother and by artifacts caused by the surrounding maternal anatomy. Higher resolution or 3D acquisitions are not possible because of motion of the fetus during the acquisition time^ required. The current clinical 2D slice data individually provide limited resolution and contrast and, most importantly, often contain severe motion corruption between slices. This project is motivated by the observation that it is possible to apply computer vision and image processing techniques to correct relative motion between the multiple stacks of low resolution fetal slices, and create a single volumetric image with high isotropic 3D resolution and consistent geometry. Such higher resolution images provide structure that may be analyzed using computational morphometric techniques that can detect subtle focal differences in the pattern of tissue volume, location and surface folding. This project will combine such powerful techniques with extensive fetal and neonatal imaging experience at UCSF, allowing direct clinical application of the methodology to study morphologic aberrations associated with ventriculomegaly and to correlate these with clinical outcome. The ability to apply these computational techniques to in-utero data will provide an entirely new view of the developing brain, which promises to shed new light on early developmental problems both in fetuses and premature neonates.           n/a",High Resolution In-Utero Mapping of Fetal Brain Development from Combined MRI,7668441,R01NS055064,"['Anatomy', 'Automobile Driving', 'Brain', 'Brain Mapping', 'Childhood', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Computational Technique', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Deformity', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Evolution', 'Fetus', 'Gestational Age', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Infant', 'Infant Development', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lesion', 'Light', 'Link', 'Location', 'MRI Scans', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Mothers', 'Motion', 'Neonatal', 'Neurodevelopmental Disability', 'Neurological outcome', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Premature Infant', 'Prematurity of fetus', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Site', 'Slice', 'Staging', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'Techniques', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Ultrasonography', 'Work', 'brain tissue', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinical application', 'developmental disease', 'experience', 'fetal', 'follow-up', 'gray matter', 'image processing', 'image reconstruction', 'improved', 'in utero', 'infancy', 'insight', 'neonate', 'novel', 'premature', 'programs', 'reconstruction', 'tool', 'two-dimensional']",NINDS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2009,275279,0.033464098693956716
"Bayesian Parallel Imaging For Arbitrarily Sampled MR Data Using Edge-Preserving S    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Magnetic Resonance imaging (MRI) is a powerful imaging tool but many important clinical applications are limited by long scan times and/or poor SNR. This proposal aims to improve the speed of MRI without losing SNR, through a Bayesian inference approach. Improvement in scan speed can enable new time-critical clinical and diagnostic MR applications, like cardiac imaging, time-resolved 4D coronary angiography, high-resolution volumetric brain imaging, dynamic contrast enhanced imaging, etc. A Bayesian framework for the reconstruction of raw MR data from multiple coils in parallel will be developed. This framework makes it possible to reduce the time taken during scanning multiple times by reducing the sampling rate of raw MR data. Our method will be generally applicable to most MR imaging modalities, targets and sampling schemes. Our method will then be validated and tested on the specific clinical application of volumetric structural brain imaging, which is an important procedure for the detection and diagnosis of neurodegenerative diseases, tumors, white matter lesions, measuring brain atrophy and hippocampal subfields, etc. The main goal of this project is to create a set of computational tools to perform the reconstruction of accelerated MRI data on arbitrary imaging targets, modalities and acquisition schemes, including random sampling schemes. Design of models to capture prior spatial information about images will be undertaken. Finally, the method will be validated on structural brain data in terms of metrics like SNR, partial voluming, test- retest repeatability, and the performance of subsequent processing steps like image segmentation. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project has the potential to make clinical MR imaging much faster than currently possible. This will make many time-critical clinical applications of MRI more feasible, for instance real-time MRI of the heart. The resolving power of MRI to image finer, clinically interesting anatomical features will also increase, making more reliable diagnosis possible.          n/a",Bayesian Parallel Imaging For Arbitrarily Sampled MR Data Using Edge-Preserving S,7688029,R21EB008138,"['Acceleration', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Brain imaging', 'Breathing', 'Cardiac', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Computational Technique', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Coronary Angiography', 'Data', 'Data Quality', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Drug Formulations', 'Future', 'Generic Drugs', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Heart', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Image', 'Imaging Device', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Lesion', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Metric', 'Modality', 'Modification', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Noise', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Problem Solving', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Scheme', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Validation', 'Weight', 'Work', 'base', 'cerebral atrophy', 'clinical application', 'combinatorial', 'computerized data processing', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'expectation', 'heart motion', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging Segmentation', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'interest', 'model design', 'nervous system disorder', 'public health relevance', 'reconstruction', 'simulation', 'tumor', 'white matter']",NIBIB,WEILL MEDICAL COLL OF CORNELL UNIV,R21,2009,211250,0.03370136079269549
"Diagnostic Innovations in Glaucoma: Clinical Electrophysiology    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application proposes to investigate the diagnostic precision for detecting glaucoma of clinical electrophysiological measurement (pattern electroretinogram, PERG; and multifocal visual evoked potentials, mfVEP), a technique identified as an important recent glaucoma- related development in eye research by the 2004 National Eye Institute (NEI) National Plan. Aim 1: Electrophysiological responses will be characterized in glaucoma, suspect and healthy eyes and the diagnostic accuracy of these commercially available techniques will be compared to current reference standards (evaluation of stereoscopic photographs of the optic disc and standard automated perimetry) and to recently developed diagnostic techniques including optical imaging of the optic disc and retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) (confocal scanning laser ophthalmoscopy, optical coherence tomography, and scanning laser polarimetry) and visual function-specific perimetry (short-wavelength automated perimetry and frequency doubling technology perimetry). Aim 2: Novel use of machine learning classifier techniques (e.g. relevance vector machines, support vector machines, mixture of Gaussian techniques, independent components analysis) will be applied to electrophysiological data to improve its diagnostic accuracy and data from different diagnostic techniques (named above) will be combined to improve overall diagnostic accuracy. Aim 3: Electrophysiological measurements will be validated as functional indicators of optic nerve damage by examining the relationship between electrophysiological abnormality and optic disc and RNFL damage in glaucoma and glaucoma suspect patients. 210 patients (105 glaucoma's, 105 glaucoma suspects) and 105 healthy participants will be enrolled and studied cross-sectionally. The specific aims of this proposal address the current NEI Glaucoma and Optic Neuropathies Program objectives of developing improved diagnostic measures to characterize and detect optic nerve disease onset, determining functional correlates of optic nerve damage, and characterizing glaucomatous neurodegeneration within the visual pathways at structural and functional levels. Information about the relative usefulness of electrophysiological measurement, optical imaging techniques, and ganglion cell-specific perimetry for glaucoma detection is important to the clinical community for determining future evidence-based changes in standard of care for glaucoma diagnosis and monitoring. These studies will demonstrate the relative usefulness of electrophysiological measurement (pattern electroretinogram, PERG; multi-focal visual evoked potential, mfVEP) compared to optical imaging techniques (confocal scanning ophthalmoscopy, optical coherence tomography, scanning laser polarimetry) and ganglion cell-specific perimetry (short wavelength and frequency doubling perimetry) for glaucoma detection.

"Identifying Mechanisms of Dementia:  Role for MRI in the Era of Molecular Imaging    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Dementia represents a major public health problem which will grow significantly with the aging of our society. Recently, multiple pieces of converging clinical and neuropathological data indicate that dementia is typically a multi-factorial process. This evolution in thinking about the biology of dementia comes at a time when the most significant recent development in dementia imaging has been the introduction of amyloid plaque labeling compounds; the most widely studied at this point is Pittsburgh Compound - B (PiB). A central principle underlying this renewal is this. Amyloid imaging is unquestionably a major advance. However, since the biology of dementia is more complex than brain amyloidosis alone, imaging of dementia is more complex than brain amyloid imaging alone. Our primary goal in this renewal is to use various imaging modalities to identify different mechanisms underlying dementia. This is the first resubmission of a competitive renewal of AG11378. We have revised the grant in accordance with each point raised in the critique and we believe this has resulted in a much stronger application. Each of the five aims is cast to answer variations on the questions: What is the contribution of specific imaging-based proxies of pathology to clinical/cognitive decline? When in the course of the disease do these relationships hold true? For whom is this true? Where in the brain are the relevant pathologies expressed? Principle outcome measures will be clinical and psychometric decline over time which we will use as indicators of disease progression. Our predictor variables will include various imaging modalities which will serve as proxies for specific pathologic mechanisms underlying dementia. PiB will serve as a measure of plaque burden and we will use various Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) modalities to assess cerebro- vascular disease, tissue loss, tissue perfusion, diffusion, neuronal integrity, and inflammation. Features that distinguish this renewal from past cycles of AG11378 include a mechanistic focus, multi- modality imaging including multiple MRI modalities as well as PET amyloid imaging, MR imaging now at 3T, inclusion of both amnestic and non-amnestic MCI, and voxel-based analytic methods including an exciting new computational approach which employs a support vector machine algorithm to provide diagnosis in individual subjects. In addition, subjects will now be recruited from a new population-based study of aging and dementia, which differentiates this renewal from past cycles as well as from most dementia imaging studies which recruit from referral practices and thus risk sampling bias. Previous cycles of this grant have contributed significantly to recognition of the utility of imaging in dementia. An active debate is currently underway about revising clinical criteria for AD, specifically whether imaging and fluid biomarker information should be included among the criteria. Results from this renewal grant will inform this debate about multiple time dependent mechanisms leading to dementia that are accessible in living subjects through imaging. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Identifying Mechanisms of Dementia: Role for MRI in the Era of Molecular Imaging (AG11378) Dementia is a leading public health problem now and will have an increasingly serious impact on public health as the number of elderly individuals increase. Dementia has many possible underlying causes and several different causes are at work in most elderly demented subjects. In this grant, we will use modern brain imaging to identify specific mechanisms underlying progression to dementia.          n/a",Identifying Mechanisms of Dementia:  Role for MRI in the Era of Molecular Imaging,7522303,R01AG011378,"['6-hydroxybenzothiazole', 'Abbreviations', 'Address', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease Pathway', 'Amyloid deposition', 'Amyloidosis', 'Anatomy', 'Anisotropy', 'Appendix', 'Applications Grants', 'Attenuated', 'Autopsy', 'Base of the Brain', 'Binding', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Biostatistical Methods', 'Brain', 'Brain Mapping', 'Brain imaging', 'Cerebrovascular Circulation', 'Chromosome Pairing', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Pathology', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Correlation Studies', 'Critiques', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Elderly', 'Enrollment', 'Epidemiologic Studies', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Inositol', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Life', 'Liquid substance', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Metric', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'N-acetylaspartate', 'Neurofibrillary Tangles', 'Neurons', 'Numbers', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Perfusion', 'Pittsburgh Compound-B', 'Population', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Process', 'Proxy', 'Psychometrics', 'Public Health', 'Purpose', 'Recovery', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Relative (related person)', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Biases', 'Scheme', 'Senile Plaques', 'Severity of illness', 'Societies', 'Spin Labels', 'Staging', 'Study Subject', 'Symptoms', 'Synapses', 'Syndrome', 'Text', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Variant', 'Vascular Diseases', 'Work', 'amyloid imaging', 'base', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'cohort', 'in vivo', 'interest', 'mild neurocognitive impairment', 'molecular imaging', 'morphometry', 'neuroimaging', 'tool']",NIA,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,R01,2008,868308,0.003750113324000855
"Validation and Evaluation of a Portable Body Scanner for Determination of Obesity    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Obesity has reached epidemic levels in the U.S., with 66% of adults overweight and 32% of adults obese. The research uses the new technique of three-dimensional  (3 D) photonic scanning to create and validate an instrument that  rapidly  assesses  obesity  in  clinical  and  field  settings.  The  first  aim  is  to develop a portable computer vision system of body imaging for 3 D surface imaging of the human body. The hardware system is designed from off-the- shelf components such as digital cameras, projectors, and personal computer. Algorithms for the 3D data are being developed and refined for calculation and system calibration for a small instrument. The second aim is to develop algorithms for surface reconstruction from 3D data in order to define a proper surface representation and to reconstruct a 3D model of the human body from incomplete and noisy data. The third aim begins the human measurement testing in 120 adults. Aim 3 is to estimate the size and shape of the reconstructed human body by a portable body imager and compare to current methods that assess obesity. Anthropometric parameters will be computed by a 3 second body scan via imaging and then compared to other methods of obesity assessment including BMI, waist circumference, sagittal abdominal diameter, bioimpedence, hydrodensitometry, dual energy X-ray absorptiometry, and air displacement plethysmography. The final aim is to validate body imaging as an indicator of central obesity (fat in the abdominal region, as opposed to subcutaneous depots) in a subset of 60 subjects because it is the abdominal fat that is most associated with health risks such as diabetes. Abdominal fat tissue as detected by magnetic resonance imaging scans will be compared to that calculated from 3 D body imaging. In sum, the non-contact, noninvasive nature of this new portable body scanner will produce a quick, inexpensive and objective measure of body size and type of obesity.             n/a",Validation and Evaluation of a Portable Body Scanner for Determination of Obesity,7495057,R21DK081206,"['3-Dimensional', 'Abdomen', 'Adult', 'Air', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Body Image', 'Body Size', 'Body fat', 'Body measure procedure', 'Caliber', 'Calibration', 'Central obesity', 'Clinical', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Data', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Dual-Energy X-Ray Absorptiometry', 'Epidemic', 'Evaluation', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Height', 'Human', 'Human body', 'Image', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Obesity', 'Overweight', 'Personal Computers', 'Plethysmography', 'Population Study', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Scanning', 'Shapes', 'Skeletal system', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Sum', 'Surface', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Tissues', 'Use of New Techniques', 'Validation', 'abdominal fat', 'design', 'digital', 'indexing', 'instrument', 'photonics', 'reconstruction', 'size', 'subcutaneous', 'three-dimensional modeling', 'waist circumference']",NIDDK,"UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS, AUSTIN",R21,2008,15000,0.02241907878981502

"In-vivo optical molecular imaging with Dynamic Contrast Enhancement (DyCE)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Fluorescence-based molecular Imaging in small animals is having a major impact on drug development and disease research. However, a significant challenge to imaging targeted fluorescent markers in vivo remains: unless the labeled regions are located superficially; localization, quantitation and host organ identification are impeded by the effects of light scattering and absorption. Orthotopic tumor and disease models are increasingly preferred over less biologically relevant subcutaneous xenografts. In such studies, substantial difficulties are encountered in longitudinal studies where animals are growing and are positioned differently for each measurement. We believe that a single imaging advance could address many of these issues, and advance the utility of in-vivo molecular imaging: an exact anatomical co-registration technique that does not rely on multimodal techniques. This proposal describes dynamic molecular imaging (DMI), an approach that can provide co-registered anatomical information by exploiting in-vivo pharmacokinetics of dyes in small animals in a simple and inexpensive way. We demonstrate that by acquiring a time-series of optical images during injection of an inert dye, we can repeatably and accurately delineate the major internal organs of mice using optical imaging alone. This is possible because each major organ is ""illuminated"" by the kinetics of dye passing through it in such a manner as to make it distinguishable from other structures. Spatiotemporal analysis can exploit these characteristic time courses to allow the body-surface representation of each organ to be visualized. These in- vivo anatomical maps can be overlaid onto simultaneously acquired images of a targeted molecular probe (detected and distinguished from the mapping dye via multispectral imaging techniques, if necessary) to significantly aid in identification of the probe's anatomical and physical location. Using CRi's existing and prototype 2D, ""2.5D"" and true 3D multispectral mouse imaging systems, we propose to test and refine a DMI approach. Based on our findings to date, we will examine and exploit in-vivo pharmacokinetics of the near-infrared dye, indocyanine green, to generate delineated surface projections of individual organs. Co-registering this surface map with surface projections of detected targeted labels will allow the targeted probe's 3D spatial location to be inferred. This information can further be used to improve quantitative accuracy in longitudinal molecular imaging studies of deep targets.           n/a",In-vivo optical molecular imaging with Dynamic Contrast Enhancement (DyCE),7485551,R43EB008627,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Animals', 'Automatic Data Processing', 'Back', 'Basic Science', 'Body Surface', 'Bolus Infusion', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Contrast Media', 'Data', 'Data Display', 'Depth', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Drug Kinetics', 'Dyes', 'Fluorescence', 'General Hospitals', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imagery', 'Imaging Device', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Individual', 'Indocyanine Green', 'Injection of therapeutic agent', 'Kinetics', 'Label', 'Legal patent', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Maps', 'Massachusetts', 'Measurement', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Probes', 'Mus', 'Nature', 'Optics', 'Organ', 'Paper', 'Performance', 'Physiological', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Protocols documentation', 'Purpose', 'Range', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Retrieval', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Small Animal Imaging Systems', 'Software Tools', 'Solutions', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Time Series Analysis', 'Tissues', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Virginia', 'Visualization software', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'Xenograft procedure', 'absorption', 'base', 'blind', 'data acquisition', 'drug development', 'drug discovery', 'experience', 'hemodynamics', 'image reconstruction', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'instrumentation', 'light scattering', 'longitudinal animal study', 'millimeter', 'molecular imaging', 'novel strategies', 'optical imaging', 'photonics', 'prototype', 'response', 'spatiotemporal', 'subcutaneous', 'tumor']",NIBIB,CAMBRIDGE RESEARCH AND INSTRUMENTATION,R43,2008,167462,0.019614925715384247

"Morphometry Biomedical Informatics Research Network    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Technological advances in imaging have revolutionized the biomedical investigation of illness. The tremendous potential that this methodology brings to advancing diagnostic and prognostic capabilities and in treatment of illnesses has as yet remained largely an unfulfilled promise. This potential has been limited by a number of technological impediments that could be in large part overcome by the availability of a federated imaging database and the attendant infrastructure. Specifically, the ability to conduct clinical imaging studies across multiple sites, to analyze imaging data with the most powerful software regardless of development site, and to test new hypotheses on large collections of subjects with well characterized image and clinical data would have a demonstrable and positive impact on progress in this field. The Morphometry BIRN (mBIRN), established in October 2001, has made substantial progress in the development of this national infrastructure to develop a data and computational network based on a federated data acquisition and database across seven sites in the service of facilitating multi-site neuroanatomic analysis. Standardized structural MRI image acquisition protocols have been developed and implemented that demonstrably reduce initial sources of inter-site variance. Data structure, transmission, storage and querying aspects of the federated database have been implemented. In this continuation of the mBIRN efforts, we propose three broad areas of work:   1) continuing structural MRI acquisition optimization, calibration and validation to include T2 and DTI; 2) translation of site specific state-of-the-art image analysis, visualization and machine learning technologies to work in the federated, multi-site BIRN environment; and 3) extension of data management and database query capabilities to include additional imaging modalities, clinical disorders and individualized human genetic covariates. These broad areas of work will come together in through key collaborations that will ensure utilization promotion by facilitating data entry into the federated database and creation of database incentive functionality. Our participating sites include MGH (PI), BWH, UCI, Duke, UCLA, UCSD, John Hopkins, and newly added Washington University and MIT. We have made a concerted effort to bridge the gap that can exist between biomedical and computational sciences by recruiting to our group leaders in both of these domains. Our efforts will be coordinated with those of the entire BIRN consortium in order to insure that acquisition and database functionality, and application-based disorder queries are interoperable across sites and designed to advance the capabilities to further knowledge and understanding of health and disease.         n/a",Morphometry Biomedical Informatics Research Network,7467385,U24RR021382,[' '],NCRR,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,U24,2008,5140823,0.014209054961624968
"Bayesian Parallel Imaging For Arbitrarily Sampled MR Data Using Edge-Preserving S    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Magnetic Resonance imaging (MRI) is a powerful imaging tool but many important clinical applications are limited by long scan times and/or poor SNR. This proposal aims to improve the speed of MRI without losing SNR, through a Bayesian inference approach. Improvement in scan speed can enable new time-critical clinical and diagnostic MR applications, like cardiac imaging, time-resolved 4D coronary angiography, high-resolution volumetric brain imaging, dynamic contrast enhanced imaging, etc. A Bayesian framework for the reconstruction of raw MR data from multiple coils in parallel will be developed. This framework makes it possible to reduce the time taken during scanning multiple times by reducing the sampling rate of raw MR data. Our method will be generally applicable to most MR imaging modalities, targets and sampling schemes. Our method will then be validated and tested on the specific clinical application of volumetric structural brain imaging, which is an important procedure for the detection and diagnosis of neurodegenerative diseases, tumors, white matter lesions, measuring brain atrophy and hippocampal subfields, etc. The main goal of this project is to create a set of computational tools to perform the reconstruction of accelerated MRI data on arbitrary imaging targets, modalities and acquisition schemes, including random sampling schemes. Design of models to capture prior spatial information about images will be undertaken. Finally, the method will be validated on structural brain data in terms of metrics like SNR, partial voluming, test- retest repeatability, and the performance of subsequent processing steps like image segmentation. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project has the potential to make clinical MR imaging much faster than currently possible. This will make many time-critical clinical applications of MRI more feasible, for instance real-time MRI of the heart. The resolving power of MRI to image finer, clinically interesting anatomical features will also increase, making more reliable diagnosis possible.          n/a",Bayesian Parallel Imaging For Arbitrarily Sampled MR Data Using Edge-Preserving S,7528771,R21EB008138,"['Acceleration', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Blur', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Brain imaging', 'Breathing', 'Cardiac', 'Class', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Computational Technique', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Condition', 'Coronary Angiography', 'Data', 'Data Quality', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Drug Formulations', 'Future', 'Generic Drugs', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Heart', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Image', 'Imaging Device', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Lesion', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Metric', 'Modality', 'Modification', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Noise', 'Numbers', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Problem Solving', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Pulse taking', 'Purpose', 'Range', 'Rate', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Scheme', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Validation', 'Weight', 'Work', 'base', 'cerebral atrophy', 'clinical application', 'combinatorial', 'computerized data processing', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'expectation', 'heart motion', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging Segmentation', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'interest', 'model design', 'nervous system disorder', 'reconstruction', 'simulation', 'tumor', 'white matter']",NIBIB,WEILL MEDICAL COLL OF CORNELL UNIV,R21,2008,252375,0.03370136079269549
"Spectral imaging for automated malignant blast counting    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    We propose to extend our successful development of an agile spectral light source for light microscopy, funded through the NCI-IMAT initiative, into FDA trials. The SpectraLamp(tm) device enables the automated and quantitative analysis of double-immunostained samples in brightfield (non-fluorescence-based) microscopy, with particular utility for hematopathology applications. A clinically compelling area is the enumeration of malignant blasts in bone marrow biopsy specimens of patients with acute leukemias, myelodysplastic syndromes and chronic myleloproliferative diseases for the purpose of staging and evaluating therapeutic responses. Current methods are inadequate due to poor sampling (typical of bone marrow aspirates) or difficulty in identifying true blasts (bone marrow biopsies and single-color immunohistochemical phenotyping). Double-immunophenotyping permits largely unambiguous detection, but such labeling strategies are not supported by standard (non-multispectral) color imaging systems. To overcome this limitation, we will combine our multispectral imaging system with a high-speed slide-scanning platform that can scan an entire bone-marrow biopsy at high resolution in under 3 minutes. Machine-learning software tools and spectral imaging will identify blasts, combining morphology parameters and double or even triple immunophenotyping to ensure accuracy and precision. After blasts are identified, flow-cytometrylike software will present the data in histograms and other modalities, allowing the user to ""gate"" on particular cellular populations and pull up panels of cell images for confirmation.      Time-line: Final equipment-related tasks will be accomplished in the first year and preliminary testing of the instrumentation and software features will occur in the second year, as will development of qualified panels of immunoreagents and staining protocols (by DAKOCytomation).

"Diagnostic Innovations in Glaucoma: Clinical Electrophysiology    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application proposes to investigate the diagnostic precision for detecting glaucoma of clinical electrophysiological measurement (pattern electroretinogram, PERG; and multifocal visual evoked potentials, mfVEP), a technique identified as an important recent glaucoma- related development in eye research by the 2004 National Eye Institute (NEI) National Plan. Aim 1: Electrophysiological responses will be characterized in glaucoma, suspect and healthy eyes and the diagnostic accuracy of these commercially available techniques will be compared to current reference standards (evaluation of stereoscopic photographs of the optic disc and standard automated perimetry) and to recently developed diagnostic techniques including optical imaging of the optic disc and retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) (confocal scanning laser ophthalmoscopy, optical coherence tomography, and scanning laser polarimetry) and visual function-specific perimetry (short-wavelength automated perimetry and frequency doubling technology perimetry). Aim 2: Novel use of machine learning classifier techniques (e.g. relevance vector machines, support vector machines, mixture of Gaussian techniques, independent components analysis) will be applied to electrophysiological data to improve its diagnostic accuracy and data from different diagnostic techniques (named above) will be combined to improve overall diagnostic accuracy. Aim 3: Electrophysiological measurements will be validated as functional indicators of optic nerve damage by examining the relationship between electrophysiological abnormality and optic disc and RNFL damage in glaucoma and glaucoma suspect patients. 210 patients (105 glaucoma's, 105 glaucoma suspects) and 105 healthy participants will be enrolled and studied cross-sectionally. The specific aims of this proposal address the current NEI Glaucoma and Optic Neuropathies Program objectives of developing improved diagnostic measures to characterize and detect optic nerve disease onset, determining functional correlates of optic nerve damage, and characterizing glaucomatous neurodegeneration within the visual pathways at structural and functional levels. Information about the relative usefulness of electrophysiological measurement, optical imaging techniques, and ganglion cell-specific perimetry for glaucoma detection is important to the clinical community for determining future evidence-based changes in standard of care for glaucoma diagnosis and monitoring.

"A Context-Sensitive Teleconsultation Infrastructure DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Consultation with appropriate specialists improves the quality of healthcare, particularly in patients with complicated cases or chronic illnesses. And for the majority of such patients, specialists use imaging studies (e.g., MR, CT) to objectively document the disease process (e.g., a cancer patient on chemotherapy). However, specialists are generally not available in all communities, tending to be concentrated in academic/specialty centers. Thus, to facilitate the routine use of teleconsultations for patients when specialists are not locally present: 1) the images captured to document the patient's condition must be incorporated into the medical record to enable proper review; and 2) the remote consultant should only receive pertinent parts of the medical record to streamline the consultation process. This proposal is focused on developing and testing a ""context-sensitive"" telehealth infrastructure based on: 1) automated incorporation of clinical context (patient presentation and referring physician hypothesis) to focus the consultation process; 2) a knowledge-base derived from data mining of natural language processing (NLP) results, mapping patient presentation to select an appropriate imaging study based on anatomical region and imaging parameters; and 3) automated selection of key anatomical structures in the acquired imaging study through the use of a contrast-customizable atlas and rigid body/deformable registration algorithms. Collectively, these technologies will allow context-sensitive, automated summarization of medical records for telehealth in a real-world environment. The proposed technologies will be implemented for neurological and musculoskeletal domains, two areas that are MR imaging intensive.      Technical evaluation will be performed with experts serving as the reference standard and will focus on measuring: 1) the accuracy of the corpus based, NLP-guided knowledge-base in selecting relevant anatomical structures; and 2) the accuracy of anatomical structure delineation using the customizable atlas registration methods. Clinical evaluation will be conducted in a real-world teleconsultation environment in a before/after study design using two performance metrics: 1) the time required for consultations; and 2) the effect on the quality of the consultations. n/a",A Context-Sensitive Teleconsultation Infrastructure,7272822,R01EB002247,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Atlases', 'Body of uterus', 'Cancer Patient', 'Caregivers', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Condition', 'Consultations', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Documentation', 'Eating', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Health Personnel', 'Healthcare', 'Image', 'Label', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Medical Records', 'Methods', 'Metric', 'Modeling', 'Musculoskeletal', 'Musculoskeletal Pain', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neurologic', 'Oncologist', 'Optics', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Primary Care Physician', 'Primary Health Care', 'Process', 'Quality of Care', 'Reference Standards', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Slice', 'Specialist', 'Structure', 'Surgeon', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Teleconsultations', 'Telemedicine', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Upper arm', 'Work', 'base', 'chemotherapy', 'data mining', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'health care quality', 'image registration', 'improved', 'interest', 'knowledge base', 'medical specialties', 'novel', 'research clinical testing', 'size', 'telehealth']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2007,394864,0.023672191272927672
"Validation and Evaluation of a Portable Body Scanner for Determination of Obesity    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Obesity has reached epidemic levels in the U.S., with 66% of adults overweight and 32% of adults obese. The research uses the new technique of three-dimensional  (3 D) photonic scanning to create and validate an instrument that  rapidly  assesses  obesity  in  clinical  and  field  settings.  The  first  aim  is  to develop a portable computer vision system of body imaging for 3 D surface imaging of the human body. The hardware system is designed from off-the- shelf components such as digital cameras, projectors, and personal computer. Algorithms for the 3D data are being developed and refined for calculation and system calibration for a small instrument. The second aim is to develop algorithms for surface reconstruction from 3D data in order to define a proper surface representation and to reconstruct a 3D model of the human body from incomplete and noisy data. The third aim begins the human measurement testing in 120 adults. Aim 3 is to estimate the size and shape of the reconstructed human body by a portable body imager and compare to current methods that assess obesity. Anthropometric parameters will be computed by a 3 second body scan via imaging and then compared to other methods of obesity assessment including BMI, waist circumference, sagittal abdominal diameter, bioimpedence, hydrodensitometry, dual energy X-ray absorptiometry, and air displacement plethysmography. The final aim is to validate body imaging as an indicator of central obesity (fat in the abdominal region, as opposed to subcutaneous depots) in a subset of 60 subjects because it is the abdominal fat that is most associated with health risks such as diabetes. Abdominal fat tissue as detected by magnetic resonance imaging scans will be compared to that calculated from 3 D body imaging.

"High Resolution In-Utero Mapping of Fetal Brain Development from Combined MRI    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Understanding normal and abnormal patterns of brain development in fetuses and neonates is a key factor in early detection of developmental disorders. This project proposal seeks to develop and refine novel magnetic resonance image reconstruction and analysis methodology to allow, for the first time, the mapping of in-utero fetal brain development. One of the most common abnormalities detected by clinical imaging of the developing fetal brain is ventriculomegaly, which, despite the absence of other clinical or imaging findings, is associated with neurodevelopmental disabilities in infancy and childhood in up to 50% of cases. Although ultrasound allows diagnosis of the condition, it has not been able to distinguish those fetus that will have poor neurological outcome from those with normal outcome. Recent developments in fast magnetic resonance imaging have permitted the use of MRI to study the fetal anatomy and this technique is now being routinely used at a small number of sites around the world including UCSF. However, MR imaging of the fetal brain is still challenging because of imaging distortions caused by motion of the fetus within the mother and by artifacts caused by the surrounding maternal anatomy. Higher resolution or 3D acquisitions are not possible because of motion of the fetus during the acquisition time^ required. The current clinical 2D slice data individually provide limited resolution and contrast and, most importantly, often contain severe motion corruption between slices. This project is motivated by the observation that it is possible to apply computer vision and image processing techniques to correct relative motion between the multiple stacks of low resolution fetal slices, and create a single volumetric image with high isotropic 3D resolution and consistent geometry. Such higher resolution images provide structure that may be analyzed using computational morphometric techniques that can detect subtle focal differences in the pattern of tissue volume, location and surface folding. This project will combine such powerful techniques with extensive fetal and neonatal imaging experience at UCSF, allowing direct clinical application of the methodology to study morphologic aberrations associated with ventriculomegaly and to correlate these with clinical outcome. The ability to apply these computational techniques to in-utero data will provide an entirely new view of the developing brain, which promises to shed new light on early developmental problems both in fetuses and premature neonates.           n/a",High Resolution In-Utero Mapping of Fetal Brain Development from Combined MRI,7241562,R01NS055064,"['Anatomy', 'Automobile Driving', 'Brain', 'Brain Mapping', 'Childhood', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Computational Technique', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Condition', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Deformity', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Evolution', 'Fetus', 'Gestational Age', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Infant Development', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lesion', 'Light', 'Link', 'Location', 'MRI Scans', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Mothers', 'Motion', 'Neonatal', 'Neurodevelopmental Disability', 'Neurological outcome', 'Numbers', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Premature Infant', 'Range', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Site', 'Slice', 'Staging', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'Techniques', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Ultrasonography', 'Work', 'brain tissue', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinical application', 'developmental disease', 'experience', 'fetal', 'follow-up', 'gray matter', 'image processing', 'image reconstruction', 'improved', 'in utero', 'infancy', 'insight', 'neonate', 'novel', 'programs', 'reconstruction', 'tool', 'two-dimensional']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SAN FRANCISCO,R01,2007,275279,0.033464098693956716

"Morphometry Biomedical Informatics Research Network    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Technological advances in imaging have revolutionized the biomedical investigation of illness. The tremendous potential that this methodology brings to advancing diagnostic and prognostic capabilities and in treatment of illnesses has as yet remained largely an unfulfilled promise. This potential has been limited by a number of technological impediments that could be in large part overcome by the availability of a federated imaging database and the attendant infrastructure. Specifically, the ability to conduct clinical imaging studies across multiple sites, to analyze imaging data with the most powerful software regardless of development site, and to test new hypotheses on large collections of subjects with well characterized image and clinical data would have a demonstrable and positive impact on progress in this field. The Morphometry BIRN (mBIRN), established in October 2001, has made substantial progress in the development of this national infrastructure to develop a data and computational network based on a federated data acquisition and database across seven sites in the service of facilitating multi-site neuroanatomic analysis. Standardized structural MRI image acquisition protocols have been developed and implemented that demonstrably reduce initial sources of inter-site variance. Data structure, transmission, storage and querying aspects of the federated database have been implemented. In this continuation of the mBIRN efforts, we propose three broad areas of work:   1) continuing structural MRI acquisition optimization, calibration and validation to include T2 and DTI; 2) translation of site specific state-of-the-art image analysis, visualization and machine learning technologies to work in the federated, multi-site BIRN environment; and 3) extension of data management and database query capabilities to include additional imaging modalities, clinical disorders and individualized human genetic covariates. These broad areas of work will come together in through key collaborations that will ensure utilization promotion by facilitating data entry into the federated database and creation of database incentive functionality. Our participating sites include MGH (PI), BWH, UCI, Duke, UCLA, UCSD, John Hopkins, and newly added Washington University and MIT. We have made a concerted effort to bridge the gap that can exist between biomedical and computational sciences by recruiting to our group leaders in both of these domains.

"Spatial Modeling in Glaucoma DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This career training proposal is to train Michael D. Twa, OD, MS as an independent clinician-scientist. A five year training program is proposed, consisting of formal coursework in vision science, specific training in computer science and image processing, and mentoring in the application of these skills to clinical outcomes research in glaucoma. In September 2003, NIH announced a new ""Roadmap"" to accelerate advances in biomedical research for the 21st century. Three areas listed in this Roadmap are relevant to this research proposal: (1) Interdisciplinary research training. (2) Clinical research informatics. (3) Development of enabling technologies for improved assessment of clinical outcomes. The Roadmap emphasizes coordinated strategies to develop both technological and human resources to take full advantage of multidisciplinary and translational research opportunities. This proposal addresses the stated training objectives at an individual level.  Glaucoma is a leading cause of blindness. Visual field assessment and optic nerve head imaging (confocal scanning laser tomography) are commonly used to diagnose the disease and monitor its progression, yet there is considerable controversy about how to interpret and make best use of this information. Currently, raw data from these observations are reduced to statistical indices that are meant to summarize clinically meaningful features and provide a basis for classifying test results as normal or not. Unfortunately, these indices may sacrifice other relevant features in the data for interpretability.  We will use mathematical modeling methods (polynomial modeling, spline fitting and wavelet analysis) to quantify patterns in visual field data and topographic images of the optic nerve head. We will use features derived from these modeling methods to apply novel pattern recognition techniques from computer and information sciences-decision trees and non-linear regression analysis-and then compare these techniques to current methods to identify glaucoma. By improving current methods of analysis we can provide a more quantitative basis for clinical decisions, and offer greater consistency and objectivity on data interpretation.

"A Context-Sensitive Teleconsultation Infrastructure DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Consultation with appropriate specialists improves the quality of healthcare, particularly in patients with complicated cases or chronic illnesses. And for the majority of such patients, specialists use imaging studies (e.g., MR, CT) to objectively document the disease process (e.g., a cancer patient on chemotherapy). However, specialists are generally not available in all communities, tending to be concentrated in academic/specialty centers. Thus, to facilitate the routine use of teleconsultations for patients when specialists are not locally present: 1) the images captured to document the patient's condition must be incorporated into the medical record to enable proper review; and 2) the remote consultant should only receive pertinent parts of the medical record to streamline the consultation process. This proposal is focused on developing and testing a ""context-sensitive"" telehealth infrastructure based on: 1) automated incorporation of clinical context (patient presentation and referring physician hypothesis) to focus the consultation process; 2) a knowledge-base derived from data mining of natural language processing (NLP) results, mapping patient presentation to select an appropriate imaging study based on anatomical region and imaging parameters; and 3) automated selection of key anatomical structures in the acquired imaging study through the use of a contrast-customizable atlas and rigid body/deformable registration algorithms. Collectively, these technologies will allow context-sensitive, automated summarization of medical records for telehealth in a real-world environment. The proposed technologies will be implemented for neurological and musculoskeletal domains, two areas that are MR imaging intensive.      Technical evaluation will be performed with experts serving as the reference standard and will focus on measuring: 1) the accuracy of the corpus based, NLP-guided knowledge-base in selecting relevant anatomical structures; and 2) the accuracy of anatomical structure delineation using the customizable atlas registration methods. Clinical evaluation will be conducted in a real-world teleconsultation environment in a before/after study design using two performance metrics: 1) the time required for consultations; and 2) the effect on the quality of the consultations. n/a",A Context-Sensitive Teleconsultation Infrastructure,7115855,R01EB002247,"['anatomy', 'clinical research', 'computer assisted diagnosis', 'computer assisted medical decision making', 'computer assisted patient care', 'computer data analysis', 'computer graphics /printing', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'diagnosis quality /standard', 'health care quality', 'health care referral /consultation', 'human data', 'image enhancement', 'image processing', 'magnetic resonance imaging', 'musculoskeletal disorder', 'nervous system disorder', 'statistics /biometry', 'telemedicine']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2006,396341,0.023672191272927672
"Spectral imaging for automated malignant blast counting    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    We propose to extend our successful development of an agile spectral light source for light microscopy, funded through the NCI-IMAT initiative, into FDA trials. The SpectraLamp(tm) device enables the automated and quantitative analysis of double-immunostained samples in brightfield (non-fluorescence-based) microscopy, with particular utility for hematopathology applications. A clinically compelling area is the enumeration of malignant blasts in bone marrow biopsy specimens of patients with acute leukemias, myelodysplastic syndromes and chronic myleloproliferative diseases for the purpose of staging and evaluating therapeutic responses. Current methods are inadequate due to poor sampling (typical of bone marrow aspirates) or difficulty in identifying true blasts (bone marrow biopsies and single-color immunohistochemical phenotyping). Double-immunophenotyping permits largely unambiguous detection, but such labeling strategies are not supported by standard (non-multispectral) color imaging systems. To overcome this limitation, we will combine our multispectral imaging system with a high-speed slide-scanning platform that can scan an entire bone-marrow biopsy at high resolution in under 3 minutes. Machine-learning software tools and spectral imaging will identify blasts, combining morphology parameters and double or even triple immunophenotyping to ensure accuracy and precision. After blasts are identified, flow-cytometrylike software will present the data in histograms and other modalities, allowing the user to ""gate"" on particular cellular populations and pull up panels of cell images for confirmation.      Time-line: Final equipment-related tasks will be accomplished in the first year and preliminary testing of the instrumentation and software features will occur in the second year, as will development of qualified panels of immunoreagents and staining protocols (by DAKOCytomation).

"High Resolution In-Utero Mapping of Fetal Brain Development from Combined MRI    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Understanding normal and abnormal patterns of brain development in fetuses and neonates is a key factor in early detection of developmental disorders. This project proposal seeks to develop and refine novel magnetic resonance image reconstruction and analysis methodology to allow, for the first time, the mapping of in-utero fetal brain development. One of the most common abnormalities detected by clinical imaging of the developing fetal brain is ventriculomegaly, which, despite the absence of other clinical or imaging findings, is associated with neurodevelopmental disabilities in infancy and childhood in up to 50% of cases. Although ultrasound allows diagnosis of the condition, it has not been able to distinguish those fetus that will have poor neurological outcome from those with normal outcome. Recent developments in fast magnetic resonance imaging have permitted the use of MRI to study the fetal anatomy and this technique is now being routinely used at a small number of sites around the world including UCSF. However, MR imaging of the fetal brain is still challenging because of imaging distortions caused by motion of the fetus within the mother and by artifacts caused by the surrounding maternal anatomy. Higher resolution or 3D acquisitions are not possible because of motion of the fetus during the acquisition time^ required. The current clinical 2D slice data individually provide limited resolution and contrast and, most importantly, often contain severe motion corruption between slices. This project is motivated by the observation that it is possible to apply computer vision and image processing techniques to correct relative motion between the multiple stacks of low resolution fetal slices, and create a single volumetric image with high isotropic 3D resolution and consistent geometry. Such higher resolution images provide structure that may be analyzed using computational morphometric techniques that can detect subtle focal differences in the pattern of tissue volume, location and surface folding. This project will combine such powerful techniques with extensive fetal and neonatal imaging experience at UCSF, allowing direct clinical application of the methodology to study morphologic aberrations associated with ventriculomegaly and to correlate these with clinical outcome. The ability to apply these computational techniques to in-utero data will provide an entirely new view of the developing brain, which promises to shed new light on early developmental problems both in fetuses and premature neonates.           n/a",High Resolution In-Utero Mapping of Fetal Brain Development from Combined MRI,7148587,R01NS055064,"['brain', 'clinical research', 'embryo /fetus']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SAN FRANCISCO,R01,2006,274794,0.033464098693956716

This workshop brings together 60-80           members of academia, industry, and other federal agencies, with a particular         history of involvement with the broader intelligence community in image              processing and analysis.  The workshop format for the last decade has                generally involved three days of high-quality presentations and investigator         interaction, both formally and informally at evening meeting receptions held         at the Cosmos Club.  The 30th meeting will be held from October 10-12, 2001,         and focus on Time-Varying Imagery.  This has particular relevance to medical         imaging, as it is increasingly being used to describe intrinsically-varying          physiologic phenomena (e.g., blood flow, intra-operative conditions).  The           goals of the meeting are the following: to provide technology transfer among         the three groups and to demonstrate the complementary capabilities of the            groups.  This is especially important in the area of validation of algorithms,       and the consequent need for databases that permit that validation.  Among the        specific topics to be covered at this meeting are: Real-time event                   understanding,  Extraction of information from video, video compression and          decompression, and hand and body gesture recognition.

"Automated Plaque Detection and Classification using MRI DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Acute thrombus formation on disrupted/eroded human atherosclerotic lesions plays a critical role on the onset of acute coronary syndromes and progression of atherosclerosis. Pathological evidence has clearly established that it is plaque composition rather than stenotic severity that modulates plaque vulnerability and thrombogenicity. Therefore, the possibility of detecting and characterizing atherosclerotic lesions would have significant clinical implications. Among the different imaging modalities, MRI seems to be the most promising in terms of discrimination and due to its non-invasive nature. We propose to develop an automated MRI image analysis system for detecting, measuring, and classifying atherosclerotic plaques. The proposed project will be conducted by a highly experienced team of experts in signal processing, pattern recognition, statistics, and product development in close collaboration with key cardiovascular researchers, with specific expertise in MRI imaging and atherosclerosis. Automation would establish a fast, objective (observer-independent), and standard diagnostic measure of plaque burden, allowing for comparison of results between laboratories, throughout longitudinal studies, and across different imaging equipment. In a clinical setting, this system would greatly reduce the diagnostic costs involved in measuring the degree of stenosis and detecting thrombosis-prone plaques. n/a",Automated Plaque Detection and Classification using MRI,6951380,R44HL071470,"['artificial intelligence', 'atherosclerotic plaque', 'bioengineering /biomedical engineering', 'bioimaging /biomedical imaging', 'biomedical automation', 'cardiovascular disorder diagnosis', 'clinical research', 'diagnosis design /evaluation', 'human data', 'image processing', 'informatics', 'magnetic resonance imaging']",NHLBI,ISCHEM CORPORATION,R44,2005,374972,0.01930457374483864
"Reconstruction Hardware for Real-Time Moving Tabel MRI    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    The overall goal of this project is to design and integrate instrumentation allowing the next generation of real-time image formation in MRI. The motivation comes from an existing project for forming MR images during continuous motion of the patient table. When applied to peripheral MR angiography the target is the formation of a moving table angiogram in which the table motion is precisely matched to the transit of the contrast bolus through the patient. However, implementation of this requires that a number of mathematical processes be done at high speed, including: (i) time-resolved 3D MRI of an extended field of view (FOV); (ii) determination of localized time-dependent parameters such as bolus arrival time and bolus velocity; (iii) variable ordering of phase encodings over the course of an MRI scan, allowing optimized local resolution; (iv) gradient warping correction for MR acquisition done using a moving patient table; (v) multi-coil reconstruction using the SENSE technique, allowing improved lateral resolution for a given acquisition time; (vi) MR acquisition done using a variable table velocity When implemented, these methods will allow the formation of peripheral MR angiograms with optimized, patient-specific table motion, maximum efficiency, and high spatial resolution. Specific aims are: 1. Construction of the Next Generation Real-Time Image MR Reconstruction System. The funding will allow the construction of a system enabling the real-time performance of the mathematical algorithms which perform the above processes. System design will allow the data acquisition and reconstruction to be modified in real time. 2. Incorporation of the New System into the Project of Moving Table MRA. Once the hardware is integrated into a useable system it will be interfaced to a clinical MRI scanner at Mayo and used in the formation of peripheral contrast-enhanced MR angiograms using continuous motion of the patient table through the scanner gantry.         n/a",Reconstruction Hardware for Real-Time Moving Tabel MRI,6890990,R33EB004281,"['angiography', 'artificial intelligence', 'bioengineering /biomedical engineering', 'bioimaging /biomedical imaging', 'biomedical equipment development', 'clinical research', 'computer program /software', 'human subject', 'image processing', 'magnetic resonance imaging', 'mathematics', 'physics', 'technology /technique development', 'time resolved data']",NIBIB,MAYO CLINIC,R33,2005,330397,0.012505840322912775

"Medical Advice from Glaucoma Informatics (MAGI)  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The project, Medical Advice from Glaucoma Informatics (MAGI), seeks to improve glaucoma diagnosis and management with state-of-the-art machine learning classifiers. These classifiers will automate the interpretation of standard automated perimetry (SAP), newer visual field tests, and structural tests for glaucoma in the general population and in stratified glaucoma populations. Phase 1 will complete the feasibility testing already underway. Phase 2 will apply the refined methods to a wider set of glaucoma testing problems.The management of glaucoma depends on a series of classifications. The glaucoma provider classifies tests as normal or indicative of glaucoma. The clinician then determines whether an eye has glaucoma or has had progression. Assembling these classifications, the provider makes decisions about management. Automated test interpreters, either as part of the testing machine or as a computer-based resource, can aid glaucoma providers with real-time interpretations. The research we propose takes advantage of our extensive data sets and builds on the ongoing research in our laboratories.Statistical classifiers, Bayesian nets, machine learning classifiers, and expert systems represent different types of classifiers with diverse properties. Machine learning classifiers can perform exceptionally well at identifying classes, even when the data are complex and have dependencies. We will test and select the optimal machine learning classifier for diagnosis. We will further improve classifier performance and determine feature utility by optimizing the feature set visual field tests are time consuming and stressful. We will streamline the tests by removing unimportant test points.Even with decades of experience, there is uncertainty with regard to the evaluation of the SAP. There is less accumulated knowledge about non-standard tests, such as short-wavelength automated perimetry, nerve fiber layer thickness, or optic nerve head topography. Machine classifiers may learn how to interpret nonstandard tests better. We will go beyond STATPAC's capabilities with classifiers that have learned to interpret SAP, nonstandard visual field tests, structural glaucoma tests, and STATPAC plots in the general population and in patients stratified by race, family history, and other information available at the time of the test.Conversion of suspects to glaucoma and progression of glaucoma cannot yet be predicted from tests. We will develop classifiers for these predictions. Classifiers will be designed to diagnose early glaucoma, detect early progression, and identify glaucomatous eyes at risk of progression.Unsupervised learning provides cluster analysis that can determine distinct groups with members in some way similar from the test data. In an effort to discover new and use useful information with unsupervised learning, we will mine our data in visual function and structural tests for glaucoma  and in specific combinations of population groups. n/a",Medical Advice from Glaucoma Informatics (MAGI),6937074,R33EY013928,"['clinical research', 'diagnosis design /evaluation', 'diagnosis quality /standard', 'early diagnosis', 'eye disorder diagnosis', 'glaucoma', 'glaucoma test', 'human subject', 'neural information processing', 'neuropathology', 'visual fields']",NEI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SAN DIEGO,R33,2005,606534,0.05583498489703746
"A Context-Sensitive Teleconsultation Infrastructure DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Consultation with appropriate specialists improves the quality of healthcare, particularly in patients with complicated cases or chronic illnesses. And for the majority of such patients, specialists use imaging studies (e.g., MR, CT) to objectively document the disease process (e.g., a cancer patient on chemotherapy). However, specialists are generally not available in all communities, tending to be concentrated in academic/specialty centers. Thus, to facilitate the routine use of teleconsultations for patients when specialists are not locally present: 1) the images captured to document the patient's condition must be incorporated into the medical record to enable proper review; and 2) the remote consultant should only receive pertinent parts of the medical record to streamline the consultation process. This proposal is focused on developing and testing a ""context-sensitive"" telehealth infrastructure based on: 1) automated incorporation of clinical context (patient presentation and referring physician hypothesis) to focus the consultation process; 2) a knowledge-base derived from data mining of natural language processing (NLP) results, mapping patient presentation to select an appropriate imaging study based on anatomical region and imaging parameters; and 3) automated selection of key anatomical structures in the acquired imaging study through the use of a contrast-customizable atlas and rigid body/deformable registration algorithms. Collectively, these technologies will allow context-sensitive, automated summarization of medical records for telehealth in a real-world environment. The proposed technologies will be implemented for neurological and musculoskeletal domains, two areas that are MR imaging intensive.      Technical evaluation will be performed with experts serving as the reference standard and will focus on measuring: 1) the accuracy of the corpus based, NLP-guided knowledge-base in selecting relevant anatomical structures; and 2) the accuracy of anatomical structure delineation using the customizable atlas registration methods. Clinical evaluation will be conducted in a real-world teleconsultation environment in a before/after study design using two performance metrics: 1) the time required for consultations; and 2) the effect on the quality of the consultations. n/a",A Context-Sensitive Teleconsultation Infrastructure,6948251,R01EB002247,"['anatomy', 'clinical research', 'computer assisted diagnosis', 'computer assisted medical decision making', 'computer assisted patient care', 'computer data analysis', 'computer graphics /printing', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'diagnosis quality /standard', 'health care quality', 'health care referral /consultation', 'human data', 'image enhancement', 'image processing', 'magnetic resonance imaging', 'musculoskeletal disorder', 'nervous system disorder', 'statistics /biometry', 'telemedicine']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2005,399327,0.023672191272927672
"Spectral imaging for automated malignant blast counting    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    We propose to extend our successful development of an agile spectral light source for light microscopy, funded through the NCI-IMAT initiative, into FDA trials. The SpectraLamp(tm) device enables the automated and quantitative analysis of double-immunostained samples in brightfield (non-fluorescence-based) microscopy, with particular utility for hematopathology applications. A clinically compelling area is the enumeration of malignant blasts in bone marrow biopsy specimens of patients with acute leukemias, myelodysplastic syndromes and chronic myleloproliferative diseases for the purpose of staging and evaluating therapeutic responses. Current methods are inadequate due to poor sampling (typical of bone marrow aspirates) or difficulty in identifying true blasts (bone marrow biopsies and single-color immunohistochemical phenotyping). Double-immunophenotyping permits largely unambiguous detection, but such labeling strategies are not supported by standard (non-multispectral) color imaging systems. To overcome this limitation, we will combine our multispectral imaging system with a high-speed slide-scanning platform that can scan an entire bone-marrow biopsy at high resolution in under 3 minutes. Machine-learning software tools and spectral imaging will identify blasts, combining morphology parameters and double or even triple immunophenotyping to ensure accuracy and precision. After blasts are identified, flow-cytometrylike software will present the data in histograms and other modalities, allowing the user to ""gate"" on particular cellular populations and pull up panels of cell images for confirmation.      Time-line: Final equipment-related tasks will be accomplished in the first year and preliminary testing of the instrumentation and software features will occur in the second year, as will development of qualified panels of immunoreagents and staining protocols (by DAKOCytomation).

"Morphometry Biomedical Informatics Research Network    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Technological advances in imaging have revolutionized the biomedical investigation of illness. The tremendous potential that this methodology brings to advancing diagnostic and prognostic capabilities and in treatment of illnesses has as yet remained largely an unfulfilled promise. This potential has been limited by a number of technological impediments that could be in large part overcome by the availability of a federated imaging database and the attendant infrastructure. Specifically, the ability to conduct clinical imaging studies across multiple sites, to analyze imaging data with the most powerful software regardless of development site, and to test new hypotheses on large collections of subjects with well characterized image and clinical data would have a demonstrable and positive impact on progress in this field. The Morphometry BIRN (mBIRN), established in October 2001, has made substantial progress in the development of this national infrastructure to develop a data and computational network based on a federated data acquisition and database across seven sites in the service of facilitating multi-site neuroanatomic analysis. Standardized structural MRI image acquisition protocols have been developed and implemented that demonstrably reduce initial sources of inter-site variance. Data structure, transmission, storage and querying aspects of the federated database have been implemented. In this continuation of the mBIRN efforts, we propose three broad areas of work:   1) continuing structural MRI acquisition optimization, calibration and validation to include T2 and DTI; 2) translation of site specific state-of-the-art image analysis, visualization and machine learning technologies to work in the federated, multi-site BIRN environment; and 3) extension of data management and database query capabilities to include additional imaging modalities, clinical disorders and individualized human genetic covariates. These broad areas of work will come together in through key collaborations that will ensure utilization promotion by facilitating data entry into the federated database and creation of database incentive functionality. Our participating sites include MGH (PI), BWH, UCI, Duke, UCLA, UCSD, John Hopkins, and newly added Washington University and MIT. We have made a concerted effort to bridge the gap that can exist between biomedical and computational sciences by recruiting to our group leaders in both of these domains. Our efforts will be coordinated with those of the entire BIRN consortium in order to insure that acquisition and database functionality, and application-based disorder queries are interoperable across sites and designed to advance the capabilities to further knowledge and understanding of health and disease.         n/a",Morphometry Biomedical Informatics Research Network,6952714,U24RR021382,"['bioimaging /biomedical imaging', 'bioinformatics', 'clinical research', 'computational biology', 'computer data analysis', 'computer program /software', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'cooperative study', 'data management', 'human subject', 'imaging /visualization /scanning', 'information systems', 'magnetic resonance imaging', 'method development', 'molecular biology information system', 'morphometry', 'neurogenetics', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropsychology']",NCRR,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,U24,2005,5013536,0.014209054961624968
"Applied Imagery Pattern Recognition Workshop   DESCRIPTION (Provided by Applicant):                                                 The Applied Imagery, Pattern Recognition (AIPR) Workshop is held annually in         Washington, D.C., at the Cosmos Club.  This workshop brings together 60-80           members of academia, industry, and other federal agencies, with a particular         history of involvement with the broader intelligence community in image              processing and analysis.  The workshop format for the last decade has                generally involved three days of high-quality presentations and investigator         interaction, both formally and informally at evening meeting receptions held         at the Cosmos Club.  The 30th meeting will be held from October 10-12, 2001,         and focus on Time-Varying Imagery.  This has particular relevance to medical         imaging, as it is increasingly being used to describe intrinsically-varying          physiologic phenomena (e.g., blood flow, intra-operative conditions).  The           goals of the meeting are the following: to provide technology transfer among         the three groups and to demonstrate the complementary capabilities of the            groups.  This is especially important in the area of validation of algorithms,       and the consequent need for databases that permit that validation.  Among the        specific topics to be covered at this meeting are: Real-time event                   understanding,  Extraction of information from video, video compression and          decompression, and hand and body gesture recognition.  A five-year period of         support is requested, to enable the meeting to grow in participation and             breadth of disciplines attracted.                                                                                                                                                                                                                              n/a",Applied Imagery Pattern Recognition Workshop,6793307,R13CA093819,"['artificial intelligence', 'computer human interaction', 'videotape /videodisc', 'workshop']",NCI,GEORGE WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R13,2004,5000,0.014119568759523396
"Automated Plaque Detection and Classification using MRI DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Acute thrombus formation on disrupted/eroded human atherosclerotic lesions plays a critical role on the onset of acute coronary syndromes and progression of atherosclerosis. Pathological evidence has clearly established that it is plaque composition rather than stenotic severity that modulates plaque vulnerability and thrombogenicity. Therefore, the possibility of detecting and characterizing atherosclerotic lesions would have significant clinical implications. Among the different imaging modalities, MRI seems to be the most promising in terms of discrimination and due to its non-invasive nature. We propose to develop an automated MRI image analysis system for detecting, measuring, and classifying atherosclerotic plaques. The proposed project will be conducted by a highly experienced team of experts in signal processing, pattern recognition, statistics, and product development in close collaboration with key cardiovascular researchers, with specific expertise in MRI imaging and atherosclerosis. Automation would establish a fast, objective (observer-independent), and standard diagnostic measure of plaque burden, allowing for comparison of results between laboratories, throughout longitudinal studies, and across different imaging equipment. In a clinical setting, this system would greatly reduce the diagnostic costs involved in measuring the degree of stenosis and detecting thrombosis-prone plaques. n/a",Automated Plaque Detection and Classification using MRI,6833334,R44HL071470,"['artificial intelligence', 'atherosclerotic plaque', 'bioengineering /biomedical engineering', 'bioimaging /biomedical imaging', 'biomedical automation', 'cardiovascular disorder diagnosis', 'clinical research', 'diagnosis design /evaluation', 'human data', 'image processing', 'informatics', 'magnetic resonance imaging']",NHLBI,ISCHEM CORPORATION,R44,2004,374972,0.01930457374483864
"Sub-millimeter Simultaneous SPECT-CT for Imaging    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    We are proposing to develop a single, bench-top animal scanner that will acquire both functional SPECT images and anatomical CT images with sub-millimeter spatial resolution for both imaging modalities. The sub-mm SPECT-CT will provide a technique for noninvasive functional imaging in mice for a wide range of applications, including the development of new radio-pharmaceuticals, assessment of new therapeutic approaches, and investigation of fundamental biological processes in transgenic and knockout mice. This would allow investigators to perform serial imaging studies in the same animal at multiple time points to investigate tumor growth, tissue pathology, the effects of therapy, and the mechanism of action of new diagnostic agents. The system will have wide applicability and significant impact in research that uses small animals to advance our understanding of human disease processes. During phase I we successfully completed all proposed feasibility studies to demonstrate SPECT/CT with gamma performance of 1.3mm intrinsic spatial resolution, E range from 30keV to 350keV, and,deltaE/E=12% at 140keV and - 100mu m CT capability from a 50xS0mm CMOS based digital x-ray detector. In addition, we acquired outstanding dual SPECT-CT images of euthanized mice. During the phase II project we will complete the integration of the high-resolution SPECT and transmission CT subsystems and develop all necessary hardware and software. The result will be a fully functional dual-modality prototype scanner for anatomical and quantitative metabolic imaging of small animals.         n/a",Sub-millimeter Simultaneous SPECT-CT for Imaging,6773880,R44RR016393,"['artificial intelligence', 'bioimaging /biomedical imaging', 'computed axial tomography', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'image processing', 'laboratory mouse', 'noninvasive diagnosis', 'single photon emission computed tomography', 'technology /technique development', 'whole body imaging /scanning']",NCRR,"PHOTON IMAGING, INC.",R44,2004,368960,0.015468126027518006
"Reconstruction Hardware for Real-Time Moving Table MRI    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    The overall goal of this project is to design and integrate instrumentation allowing the next generation of real-time image formation in MRI. The motivation comes from an existing project for forming MR images during continuous motion of the patient table. When applied to peripheral MR angiography the target is the formation of a moving table angiogram in which the table motion is precisely matched to the transit of the contrast bolus through the patient. However, implementation of this requires that a number of mathematical processes be done at high speed, including: (i) time-resolved 3D MRI of an extended field of view (FOV); (ii) determination of localized time-dependent parameters such as bolus arrival time and bolus velocity; (iii) variable ordering of phase encodings over the course of an MRI scan, allowing optimized local resolution; (iv) gradient warping correction for MR acquisition done using a moving patient table; (v) multi-coil reconstruction using the SENSE technique, allowing improved lateral resolution for a given acquisition time; (vi) MR acquisition done using a variable table velocity When implemented, these methods will allow the formation of peripheral MR angiograms with optimized, patient-specific table motion, maximum efficiency, and high spatial resolution. Specific aims are: 1. Construction of the Next Generation Real-Time Image MR Reconstruction System. The funding will allow the construction of a system enabling the real-time performance of the mathematical algorithms which perform the above processes. System design will allow the data acquisition and reconstruction to be modified in real time. 2. Incorporation of the New System into the Project of Moving Table MRA.

"Applied Imagery Pattern Recognition Workshop   DESCRIPTION (Provided by Applicant):                                                 The Applied Imagery, Pattern Recognition (AIPR) Workshop is held annually in         Washington, D.C., at the Cosmos Club.  This workshop brings together 60-80           members of academia, industry, and other federal agencies, with a particular         history of involvement with the broader intelligence community in image              processing and analysis.  The workshop format for the last decade has                generally involved three days of high-quality presentations and investigator         interaction, both formally and informally at evening meeting receptions held         at the Cosmos Club.  The 30th meeting will be held from October 10-12, 2001,         and focus on Time-Varying Imagery.  This has particular relevance to medical         imaging, as it is increasingly being used to describe intrinsically-varying          physiologic phenomena (e.g., blood flow, intra-operative conditions).  The           goals of the meeting are the following: to provide technology transfer among         the three groups and to demonstrate the complementary capabilities of the            groups.  This is especially important in the area of validation of algorithms,       and the consequent need for databases that permit that validation.

"Automated Plaque Detection and Classification using MRI DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Acute thrombus formation on disrupted/eroded human atherosclerotic lesions plays a critical role on the onset of acute coronary syndromes and progression of atherosclerosis. Pathological evidence has clearly established that it is plaque composition rather than stenotic severity that modulates plaque vulnerability and thrombogenicity. Therefore, the possibility of detecting and characterizing atherosclerotic lesions would have significant clinical implications. Among the different imaging modalities, MRI seems to be the most promising in terms of discrimination and due to its non-invasive nature. We propose to develop an automated MRI image analysis system for detecting, measuring, and classifying atherosclerotic plaques. The proposed project will be conducted by a highly experienced team of experts in signal processing, pattern recognition, statistics, and product development in close collaboration with key cardiovascular researchers, with specific expertise in MRI imaging and atherosclerosis. Automation would establish a fast, objective (observer-independent), and standard diagnostic measure of plaque burden, allowing for comparison of results between laboratories, throughout longitudinal studies, and across different imaging equipment. In a clinical setting, this system would greatly reduce the diagnostic costs involved in measuring the degree of stenosis and detecting thrombosis-prone plaques. n/a",Automated Plaque Detection and Classification using MRI,6643700,R43HL071470,"['artificial intelligence', ' atherosclerotic plaque', ' bioengineering /biomedical engineering', ' bioimaging /biomedical imaging', ' biomedical automation', ' cardiovascular disorder diagnosis', ' diagnosis design /evaluation', ' human data', ' image processing', ' magnetic resonance imaging']",NHLBI,ISCHEM CORPORATION,R43,2003,99850,0.01930457374483864
"Sub-millimeter Simultaneous SPECT-CT for Imaging    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    We are proposing to develop a single, bench-top animal scanner that will acquire both functional SPECT images and anatomical CT images with sub-millimeter spatial resolution for both imaging modalities. The sub-mm SPECT-CT will provide a technique for noninvasive functional imaging in mice for a wide range of applications, including the development of new radio-pharmaceuticals, assessment of new therapeutic approaches, and investigation of fundamental biological processes in transgenic and knockout mice. This would allow investigators to perform serial imaging studies in the same animal at multiple time points to investigate tumor growth, tissue pathology, the effects of therapy, and the mechanism of action of new diagnostic agents. The system will have wide applicability and significant impact in research that uses small animals to advance our understanding of human disease processes. During phase I we successfully completed all proposed feasibility studies to demonstrate SPECT/CT with gamma performance of 1.3mm intrinsic spatial resolution, E range from 30keV to 350keV, and,deltaE/E=12% at 140keV and - 100mu m CT capability from a 50xS0mm CMOS based digital x-ray detector. In addition, we acquired outstanding dual SPECT-CT images of euthanized mice. During the phase II project we will complete the integration of the high-resolution SPECT and transmission CT subsystems and develop all necessary hardware and software. The result will be a fully functional dual-modality prototype scanner for anatomical and quantitative metabolic imaging of small animals.         n/a",Sub-millimeter Simultaneous SPECT-CT for Imaging,6693866,R44RR016393,"['artificial intelligence', ' bioimaging /biomedical imaging', ' computed axial tomography', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' image processing', ' laboratory mouse', ' noninvasive diagnosis', ' single photon emission computed tomography', ' technology /technique development', ' whole body imaging /scanning']",NCRR,"PHOTON IMAGING, INC.",R44,2003,379863,0.015468126027518006
"Medical Advice from Glaucoma Informatics (MAGI)  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The project, Medical Advice from Glaucoma Informatics (MAGI), seeks to improve glaucoma diagnosis and management with state-of-the-art machine learning classifiers. These classifiers will automate the interpretation of standard automated perimetry (SAP), newer visual field tests, and structural tests for glaucoma in the general population and in stratified glaucoma populations. Phase 1 will complete the feasibility testing already underway. Phase 2 will apply the refined methods to a wider set of glaucoma testing problems.The management of glaucoma depends on a series of classifications. The glaucoma provider classifies tests as normal or indicative of glaucoma. The clinician then determines whether an eye has glaucoma or has had progression. Assembling these classifications, the provider makes decisions about management. Automated test interpreters, either as part of the testing machine or as a computer-based resource, can aid glaucoma providers with real-time interpretations. The research we propose takes advantage of our extensive data sets and builds on the ongoing research in our laboratories.Statistical classifiers, Bayesian nets, machine learning classifiers, and expert systems represent different types of classifiers with diverse properties. Machine learning classifiers can perform exceptionally well at identifying classes, even when the data are complex and have dependencies. We will test and select the optimal machine learning classifier for diagnosis. We will further improve classifier performance and determine feature utility by optimizing the feature set visual field tests are time consuming and stressful. We will streamline the tests by removing unimportant test points.Even with decades of experience, there is uncertainty with regard to the evaluation of the SAP. There is less accumulated knowledge about non-standard tests, such as short-wavelength automated perimetry, nerve fiber layer thickness, or optic nerve head topography. Machine classifiers may learn how to interpret nonstandard tests better. We will go beyond STATPAC's capabilities with classifiers that have learned to interpret SAP, nonstandard visual field tests, structural glaucoma tests, and STATPAC plots in the general population and in patients stratified by race, family history, and other information available at the time of the test.Conversion of suspects to glaucoma and progression of glaucoma cannot yet be predicted from tests. We will develop classifiers for these predictions. Classifiers will be designed to diagnose early glaucoma, detect early progression, and identify glaucomatous eyes at risk of progression.Unsupervised learning provides cluster analysis that can determine distinct groups with members in some way similar from the test data. In an effort to discover new and use useful information with unsupervised learning, we will mine our data in visual function and structural tests for glaucoma  and in specific combinations of population groups. n/a",Medical Advice from Glaucoma Informatics (MAGI),6788651,R33EY013928,"['clinical research', ' diagnosis design /evaluation', ' diagnosis quality /standard', ' early diagnosis', ' eye disorder diagnosis', ' glaucoma', ' glaucoma test', ' human subject', ' neural information processing', ' neuropathology', ' visual fields']",NEI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SAN DIEGO,R33,2003,591603,0.05583498489703746
"A Context-Sensitive Teleconsultation Infrastructure DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Consultation with appropriate specialists improves the quality of healthcare, particularly in patients with complicated cases or chronic illnesses. And for the majority of such patients, specialists use imaging studies (e.g., MR, CT) to objectively document the disease process (e.g., a cancer patient on chemotherapy). However, specialists are generally not available in all communities, tending to be concentrated in academic/specialty centers. Thus, to facilitate the routine use of teleconsultations for patients when specialists are not locally present: 1) the images captured to document the patient's condition must be incorporated into the medical record to enable proper review; and 2) the remote consultant should only receive pertinent parts of the medical record to streamline the consultation process. This proposal is focused on developing and testing a ""context-sensitive"" telehealth infrastructure based on: 1) automated incorporation of clinical context (patient presentation and referring physician hypothesis) to focus the consultation process; 2) a knowledge-base derived from data mining of natural language processing (NLP) results, mapping patient presentation to select an appropriate imaging study based on anatomical region and imaging parameters; and 3) automated selection of key anatomical structures in the acquired imaging study through the use of a contrast-customizable atlas and rigid body/deformable registration algorithms. Collectively, these technologies will allow context-sensitive, automated summarization of medical records for telehealth in a real-world environment. The proposed technologies will be implemented for neurological and musculoskeletal domains, two areas that are MR imaging intensive.      Technical evaluation will be performed with experts serving as the reference standard and will focus on measuring: 1) the accuracy of the corpus based, NLP-guided knowledge-base in selecting relevant anatomical structures; and 2) the accuracy of anatomical structure delineation using the customizable atlas registration methods. Clinical evaluation will be conducted in a real-world teleconsultation environment in a before/after study design using two performance metrics: 1) the time required for consultations; and 2) the effect on the quality of the consultations. n/a",A Context-Sensitive Teleconsultation Infrastructure,6725819,R01EB002247,"['anatomy', ' clinical research', ' computer assisted diagnosis', ' computer assisted medical decision making', ' computer assisted patient care', ' computer data analysis', ' computer graphics /printing', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' diagnosis quality /standard', ' health care quality', ' health care referral /consultation', ' human data', ' image enhancement', ' image processing', ' magnetic resonance imaging', ' musculoskeletal disorder', ' nervous system disorder', ' statistics /biometry', ' telemedicine']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2003,383268,0.023672191272927672

"ENERGY RESOLVED DIGITAL HPGE X OR Y-RAY IMAGING DETECTOR Imaging detectors for 10 to 150 keV photons have many uses in medical technology, including tumor imaging, SPECT, and radiography. Digital output is particularly useful since it allows image enhancement, analysis, transmission and storage. In Phase I we proposed a new technology that could capture images with 100 microm spatial resolution and 1 keV energy resolution or better. This capability would facilitate entirely new classes of medical diagnostic procedures, particularly for transgenic small animal imaging. Our Phase I work demonstrated the feasibility of this approach. In this Phase II effort, collaborating with Paul Luke at LBNL, we will construct 1 cm thick crossed-strip HPGe detectors having 10 x 10 strips, each 2 mm x 20 mm. We will develop cooled FET preamplifiers having low noise and large bandwidth properties specifically required by this approach. We will also develop analog filtering electronics to condition the detector's novel signals and employ digital pulse processing electronics to acquire these signals at rates up to 10/6 cps. Finally, we will devise procedures to test the detector's linearity and develop processing algorithms to perfect this quality. Phase II will conclude with a working and tested prototype. Phase III will entail primarily production engineering efforts. PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION: As an energy resolved digital detector with 100 microm spatial resolution, the proposed detector technology could find many medical applications, including SPECT, energy resolved angiography for small mammals, bone densitometry on rodent bones, and small, hand-held gamma cameras.

"Shearography for Non-Invasive Dental Health Evaluation   DESCRIPTION: Optical holography has been applied to non-invasive clinical            diagnosis and monitoring of Dental and oral/facial pathology, but has been           sharply limited in its usefulness by its requirements of high laser coherence.       absolute stability of setup. and wet processing of holograms. Physical Optics        Corporation (POC) proposes to develop a shearographic micro-optic camera as a        novel means of non-invasive Dental evaluation and characterization based on          shearing speckle interferometry, miniature camera imaging, and proprietary           neural network image processing. The innovation in this concept is the use of        shearography to avoid the need for high stability, high temporal coherence, and      wet processing. Nearfield shearography will have high spatial resolution, and        the neural network will perform real-time data processing and display.

In Phase 1. POC will develop a miniature shearographic micro-optic camera            (SMOC) with fiber light delivery. a micro-CCD imaging component. and neural          network. It will be capable of distinguishing among tooth enamel, cementum,           dentine, pulp, and soft tissue.

"INFORMATION PROCESSING IN MEDICAL IMAGING CONFERENCE This application is a request for support of the July 2001 meeting on Information Processing in Medical Imaging (IPMI'01) to be held on the campus of the University of California, Davis. During 16 previous meetings, this biennial workshop-style conference has traditionally concentrated on the latest advancements in the acquisition, processing, analysis, display, and perception of medical images. At the 2001 meeting, we intend to continue this tradition while encouraging contributions from young investigators, specifically advanced graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, and junior faculty. The emphasis is on applied mathematical techniques in computer vision, microimaging techniques, and information technology. Advances reported at this meeting are especially important in the study of neurological disorders, cardiovascular disease and cancer, although applications in the area of functional genomics, orthopedics and soft tissue biomechanics are also represented. The conference attracts researchers from a broad range of disciplines, particularly computer scientists, neuroscientists, electrical engineers, cardiologists, mathematicians, oncologists, and physicists. All share an interest in improving the quality of health care through the extraction and presentation of diagnostic information from medical image data. Approximately 130 individuals will be invited to attend; there will be approximately 25-30 speakers and 25-30 poster presentations. Papers are accepted based on peer review by a 25 member scientific committee of 15-20 page manuscripts.

"DEVELOPMENT OF A KNOWLEDGE-BASED IMAGE REPORTING SYSTEM We have constructed a prototype structured reporting system that replaces conventional dictation and transcription for medical image reporting. Key design features include reporting speed, generation of graphical reports, structured storage of imaging findings, and the use of existing lexicons. Pilot timing data suggest that a radiologist using our system can generate a report more rapidly than with conventional reporting methods or speech recognition systems. Support is sought to refine the prototype, and to conduct feasibility testing. The specific aims are (1) to augment and refine a hierarchical test lexicon of imaging terms (2) to develop methods for the representation and reporting of imaging findings and their logical relationships, (3) to evaluate the system's performance on clinical imaging reports, and (4) to assess the completeness of existing lexicons for imaging. The project is supported by a Technical Advisory Committee comprised of experts in key methodological areas. A successful Phase I will lead (in Phase II) to testing of the approach for cross-sectional imaging, to adoption, augmentation, and use of an existing lexicon, to construction of real-time decision support techniques based on the knowledge base of imaging findings generated by the system, and to system evaluation in a clinical setting. PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS: Our structured reporting system is appealing to radiologists because it speeds up the reporting process compared to conventional dictation/transcription or speech recognition. In addition, the system eliminates the costs, delays, inaccuracies, and other organizational problems associated with transcription services, thereby improving patient care. Therefore, time-efficient, speech-augmented structured reporting systems will likely capture a significant segment of the $1.2 billion annual market for radiology transcription services.  n/a",DEVELOPMENT OF A KNOWLEDGE-BASED IMAGE REPORTING SYSTEM,6073984,R43LM006837,"['artificial intelligence', ' bioimaging /biomedical imaging', ' computer assisted medical decision making', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' data management', ' imaging /visualization /scanning', ' information systems', ' vocabulary', ' vocabulary development for information system']",NLM,"EDICT SYSTEMS, INC.",R43,2000,98563,-0.0038796447866648715
"A hybrid artificial intelligence framework for glaucoma monitoring Glaucoma is a complex neurodegenerative disease that results in degeneration of retinal ganglion cells and their axons. With older people making up the fastest growing part of the US population, glaucoma will become even more prevalent in the US in the coming decades. Due to the complex interaction of multiple factors in glaucoma, better structural and functional predictors are needed for its progression. The main impediments are massive health record data and sophisticated computational models. Our overall goal is to leverage the power of big data and rapidly evolving machine learning approaches. The NEI's “Big Data to Knowledge (BD2K)” initiative and the American Academy of Ophthalmology Intelligent Research in Sight (IRIS) registry are all efforts to exploit the power of data and to better understand diseases and to provide improved prevention and treatment.  In this multi-PI proposal, we offer to assemble over 1 million optical coherence tomography (OCT) and visual fields (VFs) from the glaucoma research network (GRN). We propose to develop a hybrid artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm that synthesizes Gaussian mixture model expectation maximization (GEM) and archetypal machine learning approach to identify glaucoma progression and its monitoring using VFs and retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness measurements. We will make these tools openly available to the vision and ophthalmology research communities.  Our proposed studies could offer substantial improvements in the prognosis of glaucoma as well as potentially providing OCT and joint VF/OCT surrogate endpoints to be used in glaucoma clinical trials. Leveraging big data in eye care is challenging. This study uses big functional and structural glaucoma data and develops hybrid machine learning models to identify glaucoma progression and its monitoring. Results could offer substantial improvements in prognosis of glaucoma and may provide surrogate endpoints for use in glaucoma clinical trials.",A hybrid artificial intelligence framework for glaucoma monitoring,9892013,R21EY030142,"['Academy', 'Address', 'American', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Axon', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Big Data', 'Big Data to Knowledge', 'Blindness', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Evolution', 'Eye', 'Gaussian model', 'Glaucoma', 'Goals', 'Hybrids', 'Institutes', 'Intelligence', 'Joints', 'Judgment', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Ophthalmology', 'Optic Nerve', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Public Health', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Retina', 'Severity of illness', 'Source', 'Structural Models', 'Structure', 'Surrogate Endpoint', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Thinness', 'Time', 'Training', 'Vision', 'Visual Fields', 'analytical method', 'archetypal analysis', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'data space', 'design', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'early onset', 'evidence base', 'expectation', 'field study', 'health record', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'intelligent algorithm', 'machine learning algorithm', 'multidimensional data', 'novel', 'open source', 'optical imaging', 'outcome forecast', 'programs', 'retinal ganglion cell degeneration', 'retinal nerve fiber layer', 'tool']",NEI,UNIVERSITY OF TENNESSEE HEALTH SCI CTR,R21,2020,220808,0.042899223393918606
"Improved Glaucoma Monitoring Using Artificial-Intelligence Enabled Dashboard Detecting functional and structural loss due to glaucoma is critical to making treatment decisions with the goal of preserving vision and maintaining quality of life. However, most of the approaches for glaucoma assessment through visual fields (VFs) or optical coherence tomography (OCT) measurements have several limitations that poses critical challenge to their clinical utility. Identifying glaucoma-induced changes from a sequence of VF or OCT data is challenging either if the patients is in the early stages of the disease with subtle manifested structural and functional signs or if the patients are in the later stages of the disease with significant VF variability and OCT flooring effect. A major limitation of the current glaucoma monitoring techniques is that they generate a binary outcome of whether the glaucoma is worsening or not while current high-throughput data (e.g., OCT) has more information than a binary outcome. Another major drawback of some of these approaches is that they rely on traditional paradigms for progression detection such as linear regression. However, rates of glaucomatous progression may be non-linear and rapid, particularly during the later stages of the disease. Another limitation is that ad-hoc rules are adopted to define glaucoma progression while objective criteria are required to define thresholds for progression. Finally, a major deficiency of most of these methods is that they lack advanced visualization and interpretation. We propose to address these limitations by developing artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled visualization tools for effectively monitoring the functional and structural loss in patients with glaucoma. This approach provides qualitative and quantitative means to monitor 1) global visual functional and structural worsening, 2) extent of loss in hemifields, and 3) local patterns of functional and structural loss on advanced 2-D visualization tools. To achieve these objectives, we have assembled a team of interdisciplinary experts with access to large clinically annotated glaucoma data. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that advanced interpretable machine learning applied to a complete profile of VFs in all test locations (e.g., 54 in 24-2 system) and OCT-derived measurements of retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) (e.g., 768 A-scans around the optic disc and 7 global sectoral regions) can objectively and automatically learn and quantify the most important features, yielding a more specific and sensitive means for monitoring of glaucoma worsening than current subjectively-specified or statistically-identified approaches. We also hypothesize that machine learning can provide interpretable models with several layers of glaucoma knowledge that may provide a promising complement to current glaucoma assessment tests. Our proposed studies may offer substantial improvements in prognosis and management of glaucoma through effective use of analysis and visualization to improve glaucoma management and making more informed treatment options. Current glaucoma assessment is hampered by several limitations including lack of visualization and interpretation, providing binary rather than more-informed results, utilizing traditional approaches for data analysis, and adopting ad-hoc assessment criteria. Glaucoma is best managed and treated if both functional and structural data is utilized and mined using advanced computational tools to generate more-informative quantitative results. We propose developing artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled visualization dashboards for qualitative and quantitative monitoring of global visual functional and structural worsening, extent of loss in hemifields, and local patterns of functional and structural loss on advanced interpretable 2-D and 3-D visualization maps.",Improved Glaucoma Monitoring Using Artificial-Intelligence Enabled Dashboard,10043768,R21EY031725,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Axon', 'Big Data to Knowledge', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Computer Systems', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Eye', 'Floor', 'Glaucoma', 'Goals', 'Health', 'High Performance Computing', 'Image', 'Incidence', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Linear Regressions', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Ophthalmology', 'Optic Disk', 'Optic Nerve', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Quality of life', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Retinal Ganglion Cells', 'Savings', 'Scanning', 'Severities', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Treatment Cost', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'Visual Fields', 'Visualization', 'Visualization software', 'base', 'computerized tools', 'dashboard', 'field study', 'glaucoma test', 'hands-on learning', 'improved', 'large datasets', 'longitudinal dataset', 'multidimensional data', 'open source', 'outcome forecast', 'preservation', 'retinal nerve fiber layer', 'structured data', 'three-dimensional visualization', 'tool', 'treatment strategy', 'unsupervised learning']",NEI,UNIVERSITY OF TENNESSEE HEALTH SCI CTR,R21,2020,253379,0.053131807504491306
"Deep learning to quantify glaucomatous damage on fundus photographs for teleophthalmology PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Candidate: Atalie Carina Thompson, MD, MPH is a current glaucoma fellow and Heed fellow with a long-term career goal of becoming an independent clinician-scientist and leader in the field of glaucoma and public health. She has a long-standing interest in addressing healthcare disparities in medicine, and in improving the diagnosis of glaucoma and other ophthalmic diseases through imaging technology. While obtaining a medical degree at Stanford, she received a fellowship to complete a master’s degree in public health with additional higher-level coursework in biostatistics and epidemiology. Her immediate goal in this proposal is to refine and validate a deep learning (DL) algorithm capable of quantifying neuroretinal damage on optic disc photographs and then to apply it in a pilot teleophthalmology program. With a K23 Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award, she will acquire additional didactic training and mentored research experience in glaucoma imaging, machine learning, biostatistics, clinical research, and the responsible conduct of research. Environment: The mentorship and expertise of the advisory committee, the extensive resources at the Duke Eye Center and Departments of Biostatistics and Biomedical Engineering, and the significant institutional commitment will provide her with the support needed to transition successfully into an independent clinician-scientist. Research: This proposal will test the hypothesis that a DL algorithm trained with SDOCT detects glaucoma on optic disc photographs with greater accuracy than human graders. In Specific Aim 1, a DL algorithm that quantifies neuroretinal damage on optic disc photographs will be refined. The main hypothesis is that the quantitative output provided by the DL algorithm will allow accurate discrimination of eyes at different stages of the disease according to standard automated perimetry, and will generate cut-offs suitable for use in a screening setting. In Specific Aim 2, the short-term repeatability and reproducibility of the DL algorithm in optic disc photographs acquired over a time period of several weeks will be determined. The hypothesis is that the test-retest variability of the predictions from the DL algorithm will be similar to the original measurements acquired by SDOCT. In Specific Aim 3, the DL algorithm will be applied to optic disc photographs obtained during a pilot screening teleophthalmology program in primary care clinics and assisted living facilities. The hypothesis is that the DL algorithm will be more accurate than human graders when a full ophthalmic examination is used as the gold standard. This work will constitute the basis of an R01 grant and will advance our understanding of the application of deep learning algorithms in glaucoma and teleophthalmology. PROJECT NARRATIVE Glaucoma is the leading cause of irreversible blindness in the world. However, since the disease can be asymptomatic until later stages, many patients with glaucoma will not know they have glaucoma until they suffer substantial and irreversible visual field loss.

"Improving cardiovascular image-based phenotyping using emerging methods in artificial intelligence Summary / Abstract Objective — The goal of this proposal is to develop and optimize novel deep learning (DL) assisted approaches to improve diagnosis and clinical decision-making for congenital heart disease (CHD). This will be achieved by using DL, machine learning (ML), and related methods to extract diagnosis, biometric characterizations, and other information from fetal ultrasound imaging. Notably, this work includes a clinical translational evaluation of these methods in a population-wide imaging collection spanning two decades, tens of thousands of patients, and several clinical centers. Background — Despite clear and numerous benefits to prenatal detection of CHD and an ability for fetal ultrasound to detect over 90% of CHD lesions in theory, in practice the fetal CHD detection rate is closer to 50%. Prior literature suggests a key cause of this startling diagnosis gap is suboptimal acquisition and interpretation of fetal heart images. DL is a novel data science technique that is proving excellent at pattern recognition in images. DL models are a function of the design and tuning of a neural network architecture, and the curation and processing of the image data used to train the network. Preliminary Studies — We have assembled a multidisciplinary team of experts in echocardiography and CHD (Drs. Grady, Levine, and Arnaout), DL and data science (Drs. Keiser, Butte and Arnaout), and statistics and clinical research (Drs. Arnaout and Grady) and secured access to tens of thousands of multicenter (UCSF and six other centers), multimodal fetal imaging studies. We have created a scalable image processing pipeline to transform clinical studies into image data ready for computing. We have designed and trained DL models to find key cardiac views in fetal ultrasound, calculate standard and advanced fetal cardiac biometrics from those views, and distinguish between normal hearts and certain CHD lesions. Hypothesis — While DL is powerful, much work is still needed to adapt it for clinical imaging and to translate it toward clinically relevant performance in patient populations. We hypothesize that an integrated ensemble DL/ML approach can lead to vast improvements in fetal CHD diagnosis. Aims — To this end, the main Aims of this proposal are (1) to develop and optimize neural network architectures and efficient data inputs to relieve key performance bottlenecks for DL in fetal CHD; and (2) to deploy DL models population-wide to evaluate their ability to improve diagnosis, biometric characterization, and precision phenotyping over the current standard of care. Our methods include DL/ML algorithms and retrospective imaging analysis. Environment and Impact — This work will be supported in an outstanding environment for research at the crossroads of data science, cardiovascular and fetal imaging, and translational informatics. The work proposed will provide valuable tools and insight into designing and evaluating both the data and the algorithms for DL on imaging for clinically relevant goals, and will lay important groundwork for DL-assisted phenotyping for both clinical use and precision medicine research. Project Narrative Medical imaging is critical to almost every type of diagnostic and management decision, but human interpretation of medical images can lack accuracy and reproducibility. By developing machine learning methods for analyzing medical images, the work in our proposal can improve diagnostic accuracy in medical imaging, for both clinical and research uses.",Improving cardiovascular image-based phenotyping using emerging methods in artificial intelligence,9867431,R01HL150394,"['Abdomen', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Apical', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biometry', 'Birth', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Congenital Abnormality', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Echocardiography', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Face', 'Fetal Heart', 'Goals', 'Heart', 'Heart Abnormalities', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Informatics', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Lesion', 'Life', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Pregnant Women', 'Provider', 'Psyche structure', 'Quality Control', 'Rare Diseases', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Secure', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'Surveys', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Trachea', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Ultrasonography', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'cardiovascular imaging', 'clinical center', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical imaging', 'clinically relevant', 'comorbidity', 'computerized data processing', 'congenital heart disorder', 'cost', 'data curation', 'data harmonization', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'design', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'disease diagnosis', 'fetal', 'fetal diagnosis', 'heart imaging', 'image guided', 'image processing', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'insight', 'learning network', 'machine learning algorithm', 'machine learning method', 'model design', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'multimodality', 'neural network', 'neural network architecture', 'novel', 'patient population', 'precision medicine', 'prenatal', 'prevent', 'programs', 'repaired', 'screening', 'standard of care', 'statistics', 'theories', 'tool']",NHLBI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2020,806128,0.002023469413860177
"Deep Learning Approaches for Personalized Modeling and Forecasting of Glaucomatous Changes Project Summary Glaucoma is a leading cause of vision morbidity and blindness worldwide. Early disease detection and sensitive monitoring of progression are crucial to allow timely treatment for preservation of vision. The introduction of ocular imaging technologies significantly improves these capabilities, but in clinical practice there are still substantial challenges at managing the optimal care for individual cases due to difficulties of accurately assessing the potential progression and its speed and magnitude. These difficulties are due to a variety of causes that change over the course of the disease, including large inter-subject variability, inherent measurement variability, image quality, varying dynamic ranges of measurements, minimal measurable level of tissues, etc. In this proposal, we propose novel agnostic data-driven deep learning approaches to detect glaucoma and accurately forecast its progression that are optimized to each individual case. We will use state- of-the-art automated computerized machine learning methods, namely the deep learning approach, to identify structural features embedded within OCT images that are associated with glaucoma and its progression without any a priori assumptions. This will provide novel insight into structural information, and has shown very encouraging preliminary results. Instead of relying on the conventional knowledge-based approaches (e.g. quantifying tissues known to be significantly associated with glaucoma such as retinal nerve fiber layer), the proposed cutting-edge agnostic deep learning approaches determine the features responsible for future structural and functional changes out of thousands of features autonomously by learning from the provided large longitudinal dataset. This program will advance the use of structural and functional information obtained in the clinics with a substantial impact on the clinical management of subjects with glaucoma. Furthermore, the developed methods have potentials to be applied to various clinical applications beyond glaucoma and ophthalmology. Project Narrative This research proposal is focusing on the development and refinement of innovative analytical methods and cutting-edge technologies using agnostic deep learning approaches that will substantially improve detection of glaucoma and its progression forecasting and monitoring in order to prevent blindness.",Deep Learning Approaches for Personalized Modeling and Forecasting of Glaucomatous Changes,9864905,R01EY030929,"['3-Dimensional', 'Area', 'Atlases', 'Blindness', 'Brain', 'Caring', 'Clinic', 'Clinic Visits', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Collaborations', 'Color', 'Complex', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Disease model', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Eye', 'Future', 'Glaucoma', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging technology', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Investments', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measurable', 'Measurement', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Ophthalmology', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Research', 'Research Proposals', 'Retina', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Thinness', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Vision', 'Visit', 'Visual Fields', 'analytical method', 'base', 'case-by-case basis', 'clinical application', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'computerized', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'falls', 'feature selection', 'follow-up', 'image processing', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'individual patient', 'innovation', 'insight', 'knowledge base', 'longitudinal analysis', 'longitudinal dataset', 'machine learning method', 'novel', 'ocular imaging', 'personalized approach', 'personalized medicine', 'personalized predictions', 'predictive modeling', 'preservation', 'prevent', 'programs', 'retinal nerve fiber layer', 'theories', 'tool', 'treatment planning', 'trend']",NEI,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R01,2020,400056,0.037971924229013514
"Learning an Optimized Variational Network for Medical Image Reconstruction Project Summary We propose a novel way of reconstructing medical images rooted in deep learning and computer vision that models the process how human radiologists are using years of experience from reading thousands of cases to recognize anatomical structures, pathologies and image artifacts. Our approach is based on the novel idea of a variational network, which embeds a generalized compressed sensing concept within a deep learning framework. We propose to learn a complete reconstruction procedure, including filter kernels and penalty functions to separate between true image content and artifacts, all parameters that normally have to be tuned manually as well as the associated numerical algorithm described by this variational network. The training step is decoupled from the time critical image reconstruction step, which can then be performed in near-real-time without interruption of clinical workflow. Our preliminary patient data from accelerated magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) acquisitions suggest that our learning approach outperforms the state-of-the-art of currently existing image reconstruction methods and is robust with respect to the variations that arise in a daily clinical imaging situation. In our first aim, we will test the hypothesis that learning can be performed such that it is robust against changes in data acquisition. In the second aim, we will answer the question if it is possible to learn a single reconstruction procedure for multiple MR imaging applications. Finally, we will perform a clinical reader study for 300 patients undergoing imaging for internal derangement of the knee. We will compare our proposed approach to a clinical standard reconstruction. Our hypothesis is that our approach will lead to the same clinical diagnosis and patient management decisions when using a 5min exam. The immediate benefit of the project is to bring accelerated imaging to an application with wide public-health impact, thereby improving clinical outcomes and reducing health-care costs. Additionally, the insights gained from the developments in this project will answer the currently most important open questions in the emerging field of machine learning for medical image reconstruction. Finally, given the recent increase of activities in this field, there is a significant demand for a publicly available data repository for raw k-space data that can be used for training and validation. Since all data that will be acquired in this project will be made available to the research community, this project will be a first step to meet this demand. Project Narrative The overarching goal of the proposal is to develop a novel machine learning-based image reconstruction approach and validate it for accelerated magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The approach is able to learn the characteristic appearance of clinical imaging datasets, as well as suppression of artifacts that arise during data acquisition. We will test the hypotheses that learning can be performed such that it is robust against changes in data acquisition, answer the question if it is possible to learn a single reconstruction procedure for multiple MR imaging applications, and validate our approach in a clinical reader study for 300 patients undergoing imaging for internal derangement of the knee.",Learning an Optimized Variational Network for Medical Image Reconstruction,9997914,R01EB024532,"['Acceleration', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Appearance', 'Area', 'Blinded', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Protocols', 'Communities', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Evaluation Studies', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Interruption', 'Joints', 'Knee', 'Learning', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manuals', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Motivation', 'Musculoskeletal', 'Neurologic', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Plant Roots', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Reader', 'Reading', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Step training', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Touch sensation', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'base', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinical imaging', 'clinical translation', 'conditioning', 'cost', 'data acquisition', 'data space', 'data warehouse', 'deep learning', 'experience', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'indexing', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'novel', 'pathology imaging', 'patient population', 'performance tests', 'prospective', 'radiologist', 'reconstruction', 'research clinical testing']",NIBIB,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R01,2020,498014,0.010428297451690046
"Deep Learning Approaches to Detect Glaucoma and Predict Progression from Spectral Domain Optical Coherence Tomography Project Abstract / Summary Primary open angle glaucoma (POAG) is a leading cause of blindness in the United States and worldwide. It is estimated that over 2.2 million Americans suffer from POAG and that over 130,000 are legally blind from the disease. As the population ages, the number of people with POAG in the United States will increase to over 3.3 million in 2020 and worldwide to an estimated 111.8 million by 2040. POAG is a progressive disease associated with characteristic functional and structural changes that clinicians use to diagnose and monitor the disease. Over the past several years, spectral domain optical coherent tomography (SDOCT) has become the standard tool for measuring structure in POAG. This 3D imaging modality provides a wealth of information about retinal structure and POAG-related retinal layers. This large amount of data is hard for clinicians to interpret and use effectively to help guide treatment decisions. Instead, summary metrics such as average layer thicknesses are used to reduce SDOCT images to a handful of values. While these metrics are useful, they can be difficult to interpret and they throwaway important information regarding voxel intensity and texture, relationships across retinal layers, and the overall 3D structure of the retina. Relying too heavily on these metrics limits our ability to gain a deeper understanding structural contributions to POAG, the relationship between structure and visual function, and how structural (and functional) changes progress in POAG. Recent advances in artificial intelligence and deep learning, however, offer new data-driven tools and techniques to interpret 3D SDOCT images and learn from the large SDOCT datasets being collected in clinics around the world. This proposal will apply state-of-the-art deep learning techniques to 3D SDOCT data in order to (1) develop more accurate POAG detection tools, (2) reveal structure-function relationships, and (3) predict structural and functional progression in POAG. This proposal also details a training plan to help the PI transition from a postdoctoral scholar to an independent researcher. The mentored phase of this award will be supervised by the primary mentor, Dr. Linda Zangwill, and a multidisciplinary mentoring team including Dr. Robert Weinreb (Ophthalmology), Dr. David Kriegman (Computer Science and Engineering), and Dr. Armin Schwartzman (Biostatistics). Performing the proposed research, formal coursework, and mentored career development will the provide the PI with highly sought- after skills and experience to help ensure a successful transition into independence. Project Narrative Three-dimensional imaging techniques such as optical coherence tomography have become an essential tool in the clinical care of glaucoma and other eye diseases. These imaging techniques provide clinicians with huge amounts of structural information, but interpreting the data and using it effectively to improve outcomes remains challenging in clinical glaucoma management.

While, quantitative evaluation Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) plays a central role in OA research in the clinical setting MR reports often tend to be subjective, qualitative, and the grading schemes utilized in epidemiological research are not used because they are extraordinarily time consuming and do not lend themselves to the demands of todays changing healthcare scenario. The “Big Data” challenge and opportunity facing us makes it necessary to build enabling tools (i) to automate the extraction of morphological OA imaging features, with the aim of evaluating disease progression prediction capabilities on larger sample sizes that have never been explored before; (ii) to discover latent patterns by uncovering unexplored data-driven imaging features by the application of state of the art deep learning approaches (1); (iii) combine multi-modality imaging with clinical, functional, activity, and other data to define the trajectory of joint degeneration in OA. Leveraging the power of these state of the art techniques, and with the extraordinary availability of a large datasets of annotated images; in this project, we propose to develop an automatic post-processing pipeline able to segment musculoskeletal tissues and identify morphological OA features in Magnetic Resonance Images (MRI), as defined by commonly used MRI grading systems. Automation of morphological grading of the tissues in the joint would be a significant breakthrough in both OA research and clinical practice. It would enable the analysis of large sample sizes, assist the radiologist/clinician in the grading of images, take a relatively short amount of time, reduce cost, and could potentially, improve classification models. The availability of automatic pipelines for the identification of morphological abnormities in MRI would drastically change clinical practice, and include semi-quantitative grades, rather than subjective impressions in radiology clinical reports. In this study, we also aim to develop a complete supervised deep learning approach to obtain data-driven representations as non-linear and semantic aggregation among elementary features able to exploit the latent information hidden in the complexity of a 3D MR images, eliminating the need for nominal grades of selected features. This second aim, while being at high risk has also a potential exceptional high impact; as it departs from the classical hypothesis driven studies, and builds a novel translational platform to revolutionize morphological grading of MR images in research studies, but also is paradigm-shifting in that it may provide a more quantitative feature driven basis for routine radiological clinical reports. The clinical impact of this proposal lies in the third aim (R33 phase), in which we propose to translate the solutions developed in the R61 phase on images in the UCSF clinical archives (PACS), and plan to include also demographic and clinical data in the electronic health records, to build the models defining total knee replacements. PROJECT NARRATIVE Deep learning is revolutionizing medical imaging by solving challenging problems in disease classification, progression and therapeutic response. In this project, we focus on using deep learning methodology on magnetic resonance images of the knee to study osteoarthritis prevalence, and progression. The usage of features derived from the imaging data, rather than established, and often subjective grading schemes, will have significant impact on clinical radiology, establishing quantitative physician assist tools with an ultimate goal of reducing the economic and healthcare burden of total knee replacement.",Deep Learning for Characterizing Knee Joint Degeneration Predicting Progression of Osteoarthritis and Total Knee Replacement,10193990,R33AR073552,"['3-Dimensional', 'Algorithms', 'Archives', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Automation', 'Big Data', 'Bone Marrow', 'Cartilage', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical/Radiologic', 'Computer Models', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Data Reporting', 'Data Set', 'Degenerative polyarthritis', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Economics', 'Edema', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Epidemiology', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Image', 'Incidence', 'Joints', 'Knee', 'Knee Osteoarthritis', 'Knee joint', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Ligaments', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Medical Imaging', 'Meniscus structure of joint', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Musculoskeletal', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Physical activity', 'Physicians', 'Picture Archiving and Communication System', 'Play', 'Prevalence', 'Quantitative Evaluations', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Role', 'Sample Size', 'Scheme', 'Semantics', 'Structure', 'Subchondral Cyst', 'Supervision', 'Synovitis', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Visual', 'automated segmentation', 'bone', 'clinical practice', 'clinical translation', 'convolutional neural network', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'disease classification', 'drug discovery', 'epidemiology study', 'feature extraction', 'high risk', 'impression', 'improved', 'joint destruction', 'knee replacement arthroplasty', 'large datasets', 'learning strategy', 'musculoskeletal imaging', 'novel', 'parallel processing', 'patient population', 'radiologist', 'research study', 'speech recognition', 'tool', 'treatment response']",NIAMS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R33,2020,403748,0.024940026305794716
"Developing Database and Software infrastructure for Quantitative Radiologic Analysis of Lumbar Radiculopathy Project Summary/Abstract Diagnosis of lumbar radiculopathy (LR) currently relies on a qualitative interpretation of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies and lacks standardization. This has led to inconsistent treatment and rising costs, while quality of life metrics have remained stagnant. To standardize the diagnosis of LR, the subjective and qualitative radiologic assessment needs to be augmented with accurate measurements of neuroforamina (NF) and central canal (CC) areas, two anatomical structures that are critical to the etiology of LR. However, precise measurements will require manual delineations of these regions on MRI. This is a tedious and time-consuming process that is not feasible on a daily, large-scale basis in the clinic. Deep Learning (DL) is a relatively new machine learning technique, which holds the promise of automating NF and CC segmentation. None the less, there remain several challenges to making DL-based segmentation routine in clinical practice. First, training and validating a DL model for segmentation of a given anatomical structure requires a large amount of expert annotated training data. Expert annotated data is expensive and time consuming to obtain, thus thwarting the development of quantitative imaging diagnostics for LR. To address this, we propose an expert-led manual delineation of NF and CC using de-identified MRI data extracted from UCLA's picture archiving and communications system (PACS). We expect the resulting database to contain data from over 35,000 lumbar MRI scans, with associated clinical history, demographics, and patient outcomes data. In a subset (1000) of these data, NFs and CCs will be annotated by multiple human expert raters. The consensus of these delineations will be used as ground truth segmentations to train, validate and improve our understanding of DL models. Secondly, as a part of this proposal, we aim to address several technical challenges that limit the deployment of automated image segmentation techniques to the clinic. Chief amongst these challenges is the failure of automated methodologies in the face of variation due to factors such as pathology, scanner protocol alterations, and general demographic variation. Additionally, our current understanding of DL does not allow us to categorically state the total number of expert annotated data that will be needed to train a model with a specified level of accuracy. Finally, we do not currently understand how selection of training cases for expert delineation affects generalization accuracy. To address the aforementioned challenges, we propose experiments to define the relationship between DL algorithms and the cardinality of training data. We will also explore the use of unsupervised machine learning strategies, namely clustering and reinforcement learning, to understand how training data selection influences algorithmic accuracy. In summary, we propose to address data availability and technical knowledge gaps to the development of accurate DL-based techniques for automated NF and CC delineation, with a broader view to standardize the diagnosis and treatment of LR. Project Narrative Basing radiological diagnoses on a quantitative characterization of neuroforamina (NF) and central canal (CC) areas would greatly improve the diagnosis and treatment of lumbar radiculopathy (LR). Manual measurement of this anatomy on every clinical study is not feasible; however, deep learning- (DL) based automated methods can reliable perform this task if 1) expert annotations to train DL algorithms are available and 2) we can train DL models to work accurately despite image heterogeneity. We address these knowledge gaps by developing 1) a database containing spine MR images with expert annotation of NFs and CCs and 2) intelligent training data selection frameworks to train DL algorithms and assess their robustness to heterogeneity.",Developing Database and Software infrastructure for Quantitative Radiologic Analysis of Lumbar Radiculopathy,9928429,R21EB026665,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Categories', 'Central cord canal structure', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Communities', 'Computer Analysis', 'Consensus', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Expenditure', 'Face', 'Failure', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Health system', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Intelligence', 'Intraobserver Variability', 'Investigative Techniques', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Link', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Natural History', 'Needs Assessment', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Picture Archiving and Communication System', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Quality of life', 'Radiculopathy', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Selection for Treatments', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Specialist', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Spinal Diseases', 'Standardization', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Treatment Effectiveness', 'United States', 'Variant', 'Vertebral column', 'Work', 'algorithm training', 'base', 'clinical application', 'clinical database', 'clinical practice', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'deep neural network', 'demographics', 'experimental study', 'imaging Segmentation', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'network architecture', 'neural network architecture', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'quantitative imaging', 'relational database', 'segmentation algorithm', 'software infrastructure', 'theories', 'treatment adherence', 'treatment optimization', 'unsupervised learning']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R21,2020,195000,0.008518145833094282
"Artificial Intelligence-Based Approaches for Renal Structure Characterization in Computed Tomography Images ABSTRACT The goal of this R03 Small Grant Program for NIDDK is to provide additional funding for Dr. Kline to expand upon his work on his K award and apply his expertise to new image acquisitions and problems related to renal imaging. Dr. Kline’s work has piqued the interest of many internal and external investigators and has led to recent collaborations with Drs. Rule, Denic, and Kim. Together with Dr. Erickson, this new research team has prepared this R03 proposal which takes advantage of the unique expertise of each team member. The focus of this proposal is to bridge the gap between microscopic observations and those assessable non-invasively by radiological imaging. To do this, we have established a unique dataset of renal CT imaging data and corresponding biopsy measured nephron densities. We have also generated a large database of gold-standard segmentation data of kidneys, cortical regions, and medullary pyramids. Using this existing data, we propose to: (i) develop tools for segmentation of kidneys, segmentation of individual medullary pyramids, and imputing missing parts of the kidneys outside of the imaged field-of-view in the CT image, and (ii) to establish imaging biomarkers of early CKD, and correlate macroscopic imaging findings to underlying microscopic structure. This research will be facilitated by Mayo Clinic’s outstanding clinical and research environment dedicated to improving patient care, as well as the Aging Kidney Anatomy Study (PI: Rule), which led to the generation of this unique and well characterized dataset. Dr. Kline’s background in imaging technologies and image processing makes him particularly well suited to perform this research. In addition to the above aims, near the end of this research project Dr. Kline will submit a highly competitive R01 application expanding upon the findings from this research proposal. This proposal will lead to vast improvements to current analysis workflows, as well as an improved understanding of the prognostic power of renal imaging biomarkers. Obtaining this R03 Award will greatly facilitate Dr. Kline’s transition into a prosperous independent researcher focused on developing novel imaging technologies and image analysis techniques for abdominal organ pathologies. Narrative Non-invasive methods for characterizing micro-structural changes of the kidney during aging as well as in health and disease are currently not possible. This research program proposes to use our existing database of renal imaging and renal biopsy data to bridge the gap between macroscopic radiological findings on computed tomography images to those assessable in microscopic images of renal biopsies. This program will develop new automated methods for performing measurements on the images, as well as use machine/deep learning methods to search for new imaging biomarkers that relate to nephron density and size, as well as establish their usefulness for early chronic kidney disease detection and transplant planning.",Artificial Intelligence-Based Approaches for Renal Structure Characterization in Computed Tomography Images,10040835,R03DK125632,"['Abdomen', 'Affect', 'Aging', 'Albuminuria', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Arteries', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney', 'Award', 'Biopsy', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Clinic', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Environment', 'Fibrosis', 'Funding', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Hepatic Cyst', 'Hour', 'Hypertension', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging technology', 'Individual', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Microscopic', 'National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases', 'Nephrons', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Patient Care', 'Patient imaging', 'Patients', 'Polycystic Kidney Diseases', 'Radiologic Finding', 'Renal Blood Flow', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Research Proposals', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Scanning', 'Semantics', 'Services', 'Stenosis', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Transplantation', 'Tubular formation', 'Visit', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'automated analysis', 'automated image analysis', 'automated segmentation', 'base', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical practice', 'deep learning', 'density', 'early detection biomarkers', 'graft failure', 'image processing', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'interest', 'interstitial', 'kidney biopsy', 'learning strategy', 'living kidney donor', 'member', 'microscopic imaging', 'non-invasive imaging', 'novel', 'novel imaging technology', 'personalized decision', 'precision medicine', 'prognostic value', 'programs', 'radiological imaging', 'research clinical testing', 'tool']",NIDDK,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,R03,2020,113350,0.0002644018584455346

"Motion-Resolved, Comprehensive Quantitative Tissue Characterization Using MR Multitasking PROJECT SUMMARY  Quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measures tissue parameters such as T1, T2, T2*, and diffusion to detect subtle differences in tissue states (such as microstructure, diffuse fibrosis, edema, hemorrhage, and iron content) from neurological, oncological, and cardiovascular diseases. Because each parameter offers complementary tissue information, multiparameter mapping is very promising for risk assessment, early detection, accurate staging, and treatment monitoring of disease. However, quantitative MRI is typically very time consuming and difficult to perform. Each parameter is typically measured from its own series of images, so measuring multiple parameters leads to long, inefficient scanning sessions. Furthermore, cardiac and breathing motion creates misalignment between images, causing additional problems.  The standard approach to motion is to either remove it (e.g., ask the patient to hold their breath) or to synchronize image acquisition with it (e.g., using electrocardiography (ECG) to monitor cardiac motion). This approach makes scan times even longer, limits imaging to patients who can repeatedly perform long breath holds (which is difficult for aging or weak patients) and who have predictable cardiac motion (which is not true of patients with cardiac arrhythmias). Furthermore, these methods are often unreliable and difficult to perform.  This project is to develop and validate a new technology, MR Multitasking, to perform multiple simultaneous measurements in a single, push-button scan that is both comfortable for patients and simple for technologists to perform. MR Multitasking redesigns quantitative MRI around the concept of images as functions of many time dimensions, each corresponding to a different dynamic process (e.g., motion, T1, T2, T2*, and diffusion), and then uses mathematical models called low-rank tensors to perform fast, multidimensional imaging. This allows continuous acquisition of imaging data even while the subject is moving, providing motion-resolved parameter maps without breath holding or motion synchronization. We will scan healthy subjects, liver patients, prostate cancer patients, and cardiovascular patients to develop and validate this technology and use artificial intelligence to quickly reconstruct images from the collected data. The resulting tool will be applicable to any organ system, offering clinicians and investigators a valuable tool to answer a wide range of biomedical questions. PROJECT NARRATIVE  This project is to develop and validate a one-stop, push-button solution for comprehensive, motion- resolved quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). This will be accomplished by cultivating a new technology, MR Multitasking, which can measure multiple tissue biomarkers in a single scan, even in moving organs. The resulting technology will be applicable to any organ system, offering clinicians and investigators a valuable tool to diagnose, monitor, and study a wide range of diseases.","Motion-Resolved, Comprehensive Quantitative Tissue Characterization Using MR Multitasking",9886248,R01EB028146,"['Address', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Arrhythmia', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Blood flow', 'Breathing', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diffuse', 'Diffusion', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Edema', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Fibrosis', 'Hemorrhage', 'Image', 'Iron', 'Joints', 'Lead', 'Lipids', 'Liver', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Magnetism', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Nature', 'Neurologic', 'Organ', 'Patients', 'Physiological', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predisposition', 'Process', 'Property', 'Recovery', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Respiration', 'Risk Assessment', 'Scanning', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Staging', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissue imaging', 'Tissues', 'Validation', 'body system', 'deep learning', 'heart motion', 'image reconstruction', 'magnetic field', 'magnetohydrodynamic', 'mathematical model', 'multitask', 'new technology', 'prospective', 'quantitative imaging', 'reconstruction', 'respiratory', 'time use', 'tissue biomarkers', 'tool']",NIBIB,CEDARS-SINAI MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2020,628575,-0.012315008065946018
"Deep Learning-based Imaging Biomarkers for Knee Osteoarthritis ABSTRACT In the U.S., more than 600,000 knee osteoarthritis (OA)-related total knee joint replacement (TKR) cases are reported every year, exceeding $17 billion estimated direct costs annually. There is a growing need for disease- modifying therapies that prevent or delay the need for TKR. However, development of such therapies remains challenging due to the lack of objective and measurable OA biomarkers for disease progression. The course of the OA is highly variable between individuals and the OA progresses too slowly, making it difficult to identify sensitive OA biomarkers capable of capturing minor changes on the knee joint. This has slowed development of effective therapies and prevents physicians from providing the most effective advice about minimizing the need for TKR. In this project, our goal is to develop imaging biomarkers to monitor minor OA-related changes in knee joint health that lead to TKR. To achieve this goal, we will combine novel deep learning algorithms with clinical and imaging data from the Osteoarthritis Initiative (OAI). The OAI dataset includes clinical data, biospecimens, radiographs, and magnetic resonance (MR) images collected over 8 years. The proposed project has three Specific Aims: (i) to develop an automated OA-relevant biomarker identification tool from the bilateral posteroanterior fixed-flexion knee radiographs using deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) combined with the OA progression outcome of subjects (n = 882); (ii) to develop an automated OA-relevant biomarker identification tool from structural and compositional MR images using 3D CNNs with RNNs combined with the OA progression outcome of subjects (n = 882); and (iii) to determine whether deep learning–based imaging biomarkers can act as surrogates to predict the OA progression using a subject cohort (n = 296) independent of the cohort used to identify imaging biomarkers. The proposed project will couple deep learning with diagnostic radiology to unveil key combinations of OA-relevant features directly from images with minimal user interaction. This will facilitate fast individualized assessment of OA progression using whole knee joint images directly. If successful, this study will bring new insights into the development of imaging biomarkers for OA progression and more broadly into our understanding and treatment of OA. The knowledge gained in this project will help to advance close monitoring of OA progression by opening new perspectives on the regions and parameters for potential inclusion in both intervention studies and clinical practice. NARRATIVE Osteoarthritis (OA) is a chronic degenerative disorder of joints and is the most common reason leading to total knee joint replacement. Our proposed study aims to develop a novel automated OA-relevant imaging biomarker identification system based on radiographs, magnetic resonance images, and deep learning methods to study knee OA progression. We will address whether combining deep learning algorithms with medical images will determine the key combinations of features relevant to knee OA that are required to accurately predict the OA progression outcome.",Deep Learning-based Imaging Biomarkers for Knee Osteoarthritis,9970413,R01AR074453,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Bilateral', 'Biological Markers', 'Case Study', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cohort Studies', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Degenerative Disorder', 'Degenerative polyarthritis', 'Development', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Direct Costs', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Joints', 'Knee', 'Knee Osteoarthritis', 'Knee joint', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Length', 'Location', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurable', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methods', 'Minor', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Musculoskeletal System', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Play', 'Probability', 'Replacement Arthroplasty', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Severities', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Training', 'Visit', 'arthropathies', 'automated algorithm', 'automated analysis', 'base', 'biomarker identification', 'bone', 'clinical practice', 'clinical risk', 'cohort', 'convolutional neural network', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'effective therapy', 'feature extraction', 'high risk', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'information model', 'innovation', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'outcome prediction', 'patient stratification', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'recurrent neural network', 'tool']",NIAMS,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R01,2020,497020,0.013047824872355987
"Quantitative MR Imaging of Vascular Factors in Parkinsons Disease Abstract Vascular health has been shown to be an important factor in the development of neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases. Hence, the ability to measure reliably and quantitatively early hemodynamic changes in the aging brain can be a powerful tool for diagnosing, studying, and developing treatments. Arterial Spin Labeling (ASL) magnetic resonance imaging can yield quantitative perfusion images without the use of contrast agents. We propose that combining new ASL techniques, such as Velocity Selective Inversion (VSI) labeling pulses and magnetic resonance fingerprinting (MRF) with deep learning regression methods will allow quantification of multiple hemodynamic parameters beyond perfusion, thus providing a much more nuanced picture of the state of the vasculature. We also expect that the new technique will offer dramatic improvements in SNR, specificity and sensitivity of ASL, and that the proposed techniques will have many other applications in research and in the clinic. We propose to use these techniques to fill the knowledge gap regarding the relationship between vascular changes and Parkinson’s disease and its symptoms, particularly fatigue, whose pathogenesis is not well understood. If we are successful in this application, future work will use the hemodynamic parameters of interest as biomarkers to assess risk of neurodegeneration, determine therapeutic targets, and guide in the development of new therapies.

"Machine learning for fast motion compensated quantitative abdominal DCE-MRI Project Summary: Functional imaging with dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI) provides important physiological markers of permeability, perfusion and glomerular filtration rate (GFR), a measure of kidney function, without exposing patients to ionizing radiation. DCE-MR images are at the same time used for evaluation of anatomy. Functional markers from DCE-MRI, if computed accurately, would play a critical role in diagnosing and assessing the progression of a number of pediatric diseases including those compromising kidney function, liver diseases, tumors, and Crohn's disease. One of the most important applications of DCE-MRI is assessing kidney function (GFR) in hydronephrosis patients with obstruction. In the absence of GFR information, children who stand to benefit from immediate surgical reconstruction might be overlooked or delayed in receiving treatment, and those who might benefit from a more conservative approach (i.e., “watchful waiting”) might receive an unnecessary surgical intervention. While the current reference standard, nuclear renography (MAG3), yields some useful diagnostic information, it is slow, provides low resolution, does not offer anatomic detail, and delivers potentially harmful ionizing radiation. There is a clinical need for accurate computation of quantitative functional markers. Unfortunately, current methods of DCE-MRI in neonates and children are less than optimal, and therefore, DCE-MRI is underutilized in clinical practice. The technical challenges include insufficient temporal resolution to capture fast arterial input function (AIF) dynamics (which are required for accurate computation of quantitative markers), unavoidable respiratory motion and bulk motion (which reduce image quality and significantly lower the accuracy of parameter estimates), and a lack of robust, fast, automated post processing techniques for accurate computation of markers. Thus, there is an urgent, unmet need to develop a motion-compensated, high spatiotemporal resolution DCE-MRI method addressing these challenges. The primary objective of this exploratory, three-year study, is three-fold: first, to develop and evaluate a new bulk and respiratory motion-compensated, high spatiotemporal resolution DCE-MRI technique for accurate estimation of functional markers; second, to further improve the robustness and speed of DCE-MRI using a fast, deep learning (DL) technique with integrated temporal prior for the reconstruction of motion-compensated, higher quality, high temporal resolution images; and third, to develop an automatic quantitative analysis pipeline including segmentation and tracer kinetic model-fitting using DL techniques for fast, robust and accurate quantification of functional markers. The successful completion of these aims will provide new, clinically important abdominal imaging capabilities, with real-time, motion-compensated image reconstruction and reliable real-time parameter estimation from high temporal and spatial resolution DCE-MRI. This work will extend the usefulness of DCE-MRI to pediatric patients who are unable to remain still in the scanner, and eliminate the need for repeated scans and sedation in infants. ! !

"Functional and Structural Optical Coherence Tomography for Glaucoma PROJECT SUMMARY Glaucoma is a leading cause of blindness. Early diagnosis and close monitoring of glaucoma are important because the onset is insidious and the damage is irreversible. Advanced imaging modalities such as optical coherence tomography (OCT) have been used in the past 2 decades to improve the objective evaluation of glaucoma. OCT has higher axial spatial resolution than other posterior eye imaging modalities and can precisely measure neural structures. However, structural imaging alone has limited sensitivity for detecting early glaucoma and only moderate correlation with visual field (VF) loss. Using high-speed OCT systems, we have developed novel OCT angiography technologies to image vascular plexuses that supply the retinal nerve fibers and ganglion cells damaged by glaucoma. Our results showed that OCT angiographic parameters have better correlation with VF parameters. We have also found that measurement of focal and sectoral glaucoma damage using high-definition volumetric OCT angiographic and structural parameters improves diagnostic performance. The goal of the proposed project is to further improve the diagnosis and monitoring of glaucoma using ultrahigh-speed OCT and artificial intelligence machine learning techniques. The specific aims are: 1. Develop quantitative wide-field OCT angiography. We will develop a swept-source OCT prototype that  is 4 times faster than current commercial OCT systems. The higher speed will be used to fully sample the  neural structures and associated capillary plexuses damaged by glaucoma. 2. Simulate VF by combining structural and angiographic OCT. Preliminary results showed that both  structural and angiographic OCT parameters have high correlation with VF on a sector basis. It may be  possible to accurately simulate VF results by combining these parameters using an artificial neural  network. The simulated VF may be more precise and reliable than subjective VF testing. 3. Longitudinal clinical study in glaucoma diagnosis and monitoring. Our novel OCT structural and  angiographic parameters have high accuracy in diagnosing glaucoma. Neural network analysis of structural  and angiographic data from a larger clinical study could further improve diagnostic accuracy. Longitudinal  follow-up will assess if simulated VF could monitor disease progression as well as actual VF. 4. Clinical study to assess the effects of glaucoma treatments. Preliminary results suggest that OCT  angiography could detect the improvement in capillary density after glaucoma surgery and the effects of  drugs. These intriguing effects will be tested in before-and-after comparison studies. If successful, we will have an OCT diagnostic system that in minutes provides objective information on the location and severity of glaucoma damage. This approach could replace time-consuming and unreliable VF testing. Measuring the improvement in retinal circulation could be a quicker way to detect the benefit of glaucoma therapies that work through neuroprotection or regeneration, compared to monitoring VF. PROJECT NARRATIVE Optical coherence tomography is a high-resolution imaging technology that can non-invasively measure both the eye structures and small blood vessels that are damaged by glaucoma, a leading cause of blindness. The proposed research will further improve this technology so that it can provide detailed measurement over wider areas inside the eye, detect earlier stages of glaucoma, evaluate the location and severity of glaucoma damage, monitor disease progression, and provide more timely assessment of the effectiveness of therapy. A goal of this project is to determine if this objective imaging technology can provide information that is equivalent to or better than subjective visual field testing, which though time-consuming and poorly reliable, is the current gold standard for long-term monitoring and management of glaucoma.",Functional and Structural Optical Coherence Tomography for Glaucoma,9952373,R01EY023285,"['Abbreviations', 'Affect', 'Angiography', 'Applications Grants', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Blindness', 'Blood Vessels', 'Blood capillaries', 'Blood flow', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Effectiveness', 'Evaluation', 'Eye', 'Eyedrops', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Geography', 'Glaucoma', 'Glossary', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Grant', 'Image', 'Imaging technology', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Lasers', 'Location', 'Longitudinal observational study', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Natural regeneration', 'Nerve Fibers', 'Noise', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Optic Disk', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Outcome', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Perfusion', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiologic Intraocular Pressure', 'Postoperative Period', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Retina', 'Retinal macula', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Severities', 'Shunt Device', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Speed', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Trabeculectomy', 'Variant', 'Vision', 'Visit', 'Visual Fields', 'Work', 'analytical tool', 'artificial neural network', 'base', 'bulk motion', 'cell injury', 'clinical practice', 'cost', 'density', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'fiber cell', 'field study', 'follow-up', 'ganglion cell', 'glaucoma surgery', 'high resolution imaging', 'high risk', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'macula', 'neural network', 'neuroprotection', 'new technology', 'novel', 'prototype', 'quantitative imaging', 'relating to nervous system', 'retina circulation', 'screening', 'tool', 'treatment effect', 'vascular factor', 'visual performance']",NEI,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,564228,0.07747365751868607
"Novel Glaucoma Diagnostics for Structure and Function  - Renewal - 1 Project Summary Glaucoma is a leading cause of vision morbidity and blindness worldwide. Early disease detection and sensitive monitoring of progression are crucial to allow timely treatment for preservation of vision. The introduction of ocular imaging technologies significantly improves these capabilities, but in clinical practice there are still substantial challenges at certain stages of the disease severity spectrum, specifically in the early stage and in advanced disease. These difficulties are due to a variety of causes that change over the course of the disease, including large between-subject variability, inherent measurement variability, image quality, varying dynamic ranges of measurements, minimal measurable level of tissues, etc. In this proposal, we build on our long-standing contribution to ocular imaging and propose novel and sensitive means to detect glaucoma and its progression that are optimized to the various stages of disease severity. We will use information gathered from visual fields (functional information) and a leading ocular imaging technology – optical coherence tomography (OCT; structural information) to map the capability of detecting changes across the entire disease severity spectrum to identify optimal parameters for each stage of the disease. Both commonly used parameters provided by the technologies and newly developed parameters with good diagnostic potential will be analyzed. We will use state-of-the-art automated computerized machine learning methods, namely the deep learning approach, to identify structural features embedded within OCT images that are associated with glaucoma and its progression without any a priori assumptions. This will provide novel insight into structural information, and has shown very encouraging preliminary results. We will also utilize a new imaging technology, the visible light OCT, to generate retinal images with outstanding resolution to extract information about the oxygen saturation of the tissue. This will provide in-vivo, real time, and noninvasive insight into tissue functionality. Taken together, this program will advance the use of structural and functional information with a substantial impact on the clinical management of subjects with glaucoma Project Narrative This research proposal is focusing on the development and refinement of innovative analytical methods and cutting-edge technologies that will substantially improve detection of glaucoma and its progression monitoring in order to prevent blindness.",Novel Glaucoma Diagnostics for Structure and Function  - Renewal - 1,10019553,R01EY013178,"['3-Dimensional', 'Blindness', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Research', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Evaluation', 'Eye', 'Floor', 'Future', 'Glaucoma', 'Health', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging technology', 'Inner Plexiform Layer', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Light', 'Maps', 'Measurable', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Optic Disk', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Outcome', 'Oxygen Consumption', 'Oxygen saturation measurement', 'Pathology', 'Research Proposals', 'Resolution', 'Retina', 'Retinal Diseases', 'Scanning', 'Severities', 'Severity of illness', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Tissue Extracts', 'Tissues', 'Translating', 'Visible Radiation', 'Vision', 'Visual Fields', 'Width', 'advanced disease', 'analytical method', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'computerized', 'deep learning', 'density', 'ganglion cell', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'innovative technologies', 'insight', 'instrument', 'invention', 'knowledge base', 'longitudinal dataset', 'machine learning method', 'macula', 'mathematical methods', 'new technology', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'ocular imaging', 'preservation', 'prevent', 'programs', 'research study', 'retinal imaging', 'retinal nerve fiber layer', 'tissue oxygenation', 'tool']",NEI,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R01,2020,687519,0.05074468078725102
"Quantitative, non-invasive characterization of urinary stone composition and fragility using multi-energy CT and machine learning techniques PROJECT SUMMARY Symptomatic urinary stone disease (USD) affects >8% of the United States population, resulting in an estimated annual medical cost exceeding $10 billion. Computed tomography (CT) is the established method for imaging urinary calculi and can provide accurate sub-millimeter details of the size and location of renal stones. However, in vivo characterization of more than just size and location is critical for quantifying stone characteristics important for optimal patient health management and essential for clinical research. A complete characterization of renal stones, including stone composition and fragility, is needed for safe and cost effective management of USD, as well as for phenotyping of research subjects. Our proposal meets these needs by developing methods to accurately and non-invasively characterize stones using low-dose, multi-energy CT. Our long-term goal is to use advanced CT methodologies to characterize urinary calculi for the purpose of directing clinical treatment and facilitating clinical investigation. Our objectives in this application are to develop and validate in vivo quantitative techniques for characterizing mixed and non-uric-acid stone types, as well as for predicting the likelihood of successful stone comminution, a novel concept we refer to as stone fragility. These image-based stone biometrics will enable evidence-based identification of treatment strategies that maximize effectiveness while minimizing risk, as well as accurate and non-invasive classification of research subjects to accelerate scientific advances in the understanding and treatment of USD. We will meet these objectives by accomplishing the following specific aims:  Specific Aim 1: Develop and validate CT techniques to characterize mixed and non-uric-acid  stone types.  Specific Aim 2: Develop and validate CT techniques to predict stone fragility. Current state-of-the-art stone imaging technology cannot accurately identify the composition of mixed and non- uric-acid stone types, nor can it provide quantitative indications of the likelihood of efficient comminution using the lowest risk technique. The innovation of this proposal lies in the use of newly developed statistical, deep learning and texture analysis techniques to quantitatively describe essential characteristics of urinary calculi, namely composition and fragility. The significance of this proposal is that the knowledge derived from using such techniques represents unique quantitative biomarkers that will allow physicians and researchers to more effectively manage and study USD. The developed methods respond to critical needs in the field of stone disease and will advance the ability of physicians to optimally direct patient therapy and scientists to phenotype research subjects. PROJECT NARRATIVE This proposal will develop imaging techniques that can determine urinary stone composition and fragility in patients. The significance of this is that these advanced CT imaging techniques will allow physicians to more efficiently direct patient therapy and perform clinical research, potentially avoiding procedures associated with higher risk or cost.","Quantitative, non-invasive characterization of urinary stone composition and fragility using multi-energy CT and machine learning techniques",9936447,R01EB028591,"['Affect', 'Alkalies', 'Bilateral', 'Biological Markers', 'Biometry', 'Calcium Oxalate', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Cost Effective Management', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Economic Burden', 'Effectiveness', 'Excision', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Imaging technology', 'Injury to Kidney', 'Kidney Calculi', 'Knowledge', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Minerals', 'Morphology', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Percutaneous Nephrolithotomy', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Procedures', 'Publishing', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Subjects', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Scientific Advances and Accomplishments', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Shapes', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Time', 'United States', 'Ureteroscopy', 'Uric Acid', 'Urinary Calculi', 'Validation', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'attenuation', 'base', 'calcium phosphate', 'clinical investigation', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'evidence base', 'health management', 'high risk', 'imaging modality', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'novel', 'photon-counting detector', 'prevent', 'risk minimization', 'statistical learning', 'treatment strategy']",NIBIB,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,R01,2020,357486,0.0015050334201808808
"Objective Quantification of Neural Damage for Screening, Diagnosis and Monitoring of Glaucoma with Fundus Photographs PROJECT SUMMARY Glaucoma is a progressive optic neuropathy and the leading cause of irreversible blindness in the world. As the disease remains largely asymptomatic until late stages, there is a pressing need to develop affordable approaches for screening before visual impairment occurs. Although sophisticated imaging technologies such as Spectral domain-optical coherence tomography (SDOCT) can provide highly reproducible and accurate quantitative assessment of glaucomatous damage, their application in widespread screening or non-specialized settings is unfeasible, given the high cost and operator requirements. Fundus photography is a low-cost alternative that has been used successfully in teleophthalmology programs. However, subjective human grading of fundus photos for glaucoma is poorly reproducible and highly inaccurate, as gradings tend to largely over- or underestimate damage. We propose a new paradigm for assessing glaucomatous damage by training a deep learning (DL) convolutional neural network to provide quantitative estimates of the amount of neural damage from fundus photographs. In our Machine-to-Machine (M2M) approach, we trained a DL network to analyze fundus photos and predict quantitative measurements of glaucomatous damage provided by SDOCT, such as retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness and neuroretinal rim measurements. Our preliminary results showed that the M2M predictions have very high correlation and agreement with the original SDOCT observations. This provides an objective method to quantify neural damage in fundus photos without requiring human graders, which could potentially be used for screening, diagnoses and monitoring in teleophthalmology and non- specialized point-of-care settings. In this proposal, we aim at refining and validating the M2M model in suitable, large datasets from population-based studies, electronic medical records, and clinical trial data. Our central hypothesis is that the M2M approach will be more accurate than subjective human gradings in screening, diagnosing, predicting and detecting longitudinal damage over time. In Aim 1, we will investigate the performance of the M2M model to screen for glaucomatous damage using large datasets from 6 population-based studies: Blue Mountains Eye Study, Los Angeles Latino Eye Study, Tema Eye Survey, Beijing Eye Study, Central India Eye and Medical Study and the Ural Eye and Medical Study, which will provide data on over 25,000 subjects of diverse racial groups. In Aim 2, we will investigate the ability of the M2M model to predict future development of glaucoma in eyes of suspects using the data from the Ocular Hypertension Treatment Study (OHTS). In Aim 3, we will investigate the ability of the M2M model in detecting glaucomatous progression over time using data from the Duke Glaucoma Registry, a large database of longitudinal structure and function data in glaucoma with over 25,000 patients followed over time. If successful, this proposal will lead to a validated, inexpensive, and widely applicable tool for screening, early diagnosis and monitoring of glaucoma, that could be applied under population-based settings and also at non-specialized point-of-care settings. Project Narrative Glaucoma is a leading cause of irreversible visual impairment in the world. This proposal will employ a novel artificial intelligence paradigm for quantifying neural damage on ocular fundus photographs for the purpose of screening, diagnosing and monitoring glaucoma damage. The approach will be validated on large datasets from population-based studies, electronic medical records and clinical trial data.","Objective Quantification of Neural Damage for Screening, Diagnosis and Monitoring of Glaucoma with Fundus Photographs",10047364,R21EY031898,"['Agreement', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Blindness', 'Clinical Trials', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diabetic Retinopathy', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Exhibits', 'Eye', 'Eye diseases', 'Fundus', 'Fundus photography', 'Future', 'Glaucoma', 'Human', 'Imaging technology', 'India', 'Investigation', 'Label', 'Latino', 'Los Angeles', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Names', 'Nature', 'Ocular Hypertension', 'Ophthalmology', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Population Study', 'Race', 'Reference Standards', 'Registries', 'Reproducibility', 'Risk', 'Science', 'Screening procedure', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Visual impairment', 'algorithm training', 'clinical care', 'convolutional neural network', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'deep neural network', 'flexibility', 'hypertension treatment', 'intelligent algorithm', 'interest', 'large datasets', 'learning network', 'longitudinal database', 'novel', 'optic nerve disorder', 'point of care', 'population based', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'racial diversity', 'relating to nervous system', 'retinal nerve fiber layer', 'screening', 'time use', 'tool']",NEI,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R21,2020,241500,0.02090271667080477
"Molecular mapping of microbial communities at the host-pathogen interface by multi-modal 3-dimensional imaging mass spectrometry PROJECT SUMMARY  Cellular interactions with the environment form the basis of health and disease for all organisms. Exposure to nutrients, toxins, and neighboring cells trigger coordinated molecular responses that impact cell function and metabolism in a beneficial, adaptive, or detrimental manner. Although the benefits of multicellularity for the formation of complex tissue structures or the function of entire organ systems has been long appreciated, it has only recently been understood that microbial inhabitants of vertebrates also have a tremendous impact on host cell function and dysfunction. Despite this, an understanding of these interactions has not moved beyond simple associations, and there are virtually no molecular technologies available that adequately define how a complex microbial ecosystem impacts host cell function, or how the host response to microbial colonization affects the bacterial community. This gap in knowledge is striking when one considers the broad and significant impact that microbes have on human health. In this application, we propose to expressly fill this knowledge gap through development of a novel multimodal imaging pipeline that will provide 3-dimensional information on the molecular heterogeneity of microbial communities and the immune response at the host-pathogen interface.  This proposal combines our expertise in immunology, infection biology, mass spectrometry, small animal imaging, machine learning, and computer vision to develop an integrated multimodal visualization method for studying infectious disease. Our unique approach will computationally combine ultra-high speed (~50px/s) MALDI-TOF images, ultra-high mass resolution (>200,000 resolving power) MALDI FTICR IMS, metal imaging by LA-ICP-IMS, high-spatial resolution optical microscopy, and MR imaging using data-driven image fusion. This strategy will enable 3-D molecular images to be generated for thousands of elements, metabolites, lipids, and proteins with an unprecedented combination of chemical specificity and spatial fidelity more than 50x faster than is currently possible. We will use this next-generation imaging capability to (i) define the heterogeneous microbial subpopulations throughout the 3-D volume of a S. aureus community, (ii) uncover the host molecules that form the abscess and accumulate to restrict microbial growth in murine models, and (iii) elucidate molecular markers that differentiate in vivo biofilms at the host-pathogen interface, between abscesses at various stages of progression, and under distinct degrees of nutrient stress. These studies will uncover new targets for therapeutic intervention and the techniques developed as a result of this proposal will be broadly applicable to all physiologically relevant processes, profoundly impacting biomedical research. PROJECT NARRATIVE This proposal will enable detailed views of the molecular components of infectious disease with unprecedented resolution through the development of a multimodal, 3-dimensional imaging platform. The proposed technologies will improve throughput and molecular specificity, enable automated high-precision and high-accuracy image alignment, and allow for descriptions of molecular signals in 3-D through the fusion of multi-modal imaging data.

"Relationship between Glaucoma and the Three-Dimensional Optic Nerve Head Related Structure Project Summary Glaucoma is the second leading cause of blindness globally, and is characterized by optic nerve damage that leads to the death of retinal ganglion cells with accompanying visual field (VF) loss. The optic nerve head (ONH) is the site of injury to the optic nerve fibers and plays a central role in glaucoma pathogenesis and diagnosis. Traditionally, glaucoma is diagnosed based on fundus inspection of the ONH, which provides information about the surface contour of the ONH. However, the optic nerve damage occurs in the deeper layers. With the development of optical coherence tomography (OCT) techniques for three-dimensional (3D) retinal imaging, parameters derived from the 3D ONH related structure (e.g., Bruch's membrane opening minimum rim width, peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer thickness, disc tilt etc.) have been studied to better understand glaucoma pathogenesis, and are used to supplement clinical diagnosis. In addition, studies of the ONH biomechanics have also shown that the strain level at the ONH at any given intraocular pressure level depends on the 3D geometry of the ONH related structure. A high strain level is hypothesized to contribute to retinal ganglion cell injury. Previous research has suggested that the 3D ONH related structure is correlated to glaucoma pathogenesis and critically important to glaucoma diagnosis. However, to date, a systematic study using clinical data to determine the impact of the 3D ONH related structure on glaucoma has not been conducted.  We propose to study the relationship between the 3D ONH related structure and glaucoma with a diverse set of combined techniques including image processing, computational mechanics and machine learning. The specific aims of this project are to: (1) Derive features from the 3D ONH related structure and study their implications on VF loss patterns (K99 Phase). (2) Investigate the impact of the strain field patterns at the ONH on glaucoma (K99 Phase). (3) Study the effect of the 3D ONH related features on OCT diagnostic parameters (R00 Phase). (4) Model central vision loss from the 3D ONH related structural features (R00 Phase). Collectively, these studies will provide new insights and perspectives into the structure-function relationships in glaucoma and establish ocular anatomy specific norms of retinal nerve fiber layer profiles, which will advance our current understanding of glaucoma pathogenesis and improve glaucoma diagnosis. Our research is of high clinical relevance and can be potentially translated into clinical practice for better glaucoma diagnosis, monitoring and treatment.  Through the proposed research and training plans, the applicant will build a solid knowledge base in ophthalmology and further improve his expertise in mathematical modeling and data science. This project will provide critical training opportunities to further enhance the applicant's capabilities to become an independent computational vision scientist in ophthalmology.

"2021 International Workshop on Pulmonary Imaging SUMMARY This application requests funding to support the 2021 International Workshop on Pulmonary Imaging, a three- day meeting to be held from February 25-27, 2021, which will be the seventh of its kind hosted by the University of Pennsylvania. The requested funds will primarily be used to cover travel and lodging for junior researchers who will be presenting at the workshop: undergraduate, graduate and junior faculty. Some funds may also be allocated to help pay for live webcasting and publication costs related to workshop materials. As with previous meetings, we intend to stream each session of the meeting in real-time, allowing those who are interested in the proceedings but unable to attend in person to access them online for free. As mortalities associated with pulmonary disease continue to rise worldwide, innovative imaging techniques capable of both diagnosing and helping to treat these pathologies are becoming an increasingly important. As a field, pulmonary imaging currently encompasses a wider range of techniques for the structural, functional and molecular assessment of lung disorders than at any time in its history. What is more, these techniques are being developed and optimized by researchers across an increasingly diverse set of fields such as biology, chemistry, physics, engineering, computer science and medicine. Given the field's rapidly-evolving nature, the existence of a regular forum in which scientists and clinicians can communicate their ideas with each other is of the utmost importance. Given the absence of other scientific meetings with a similarly focused agenda, our previous workshops have succeeded in providing just such a forum—allowing a diverse group of pulmonary imaging researchers to come together for the kind of rigorous, collaborative exchange that can continue to advance the field. The specific aims of the proposed workshop are as follows: (1) host a one-day workshop on pulmonary inflammation; (2) inform the pulmonary imaging community of the latest advances in structural, functional and molecular lung imaging; (3) explore the use of pulmonary imaging to evaluate therapeutic response, the inherent obstacles to doing so, and strategies to overcome them; (4) investigate new approaches for integrating deep learning and pulmonary imaging techniques to more accurately diagnose and phenotype disease and predict injury progression; (5) broadcast the entire workshop live online, thereby enabling interested parties not in attendance to access the proceedings in real-time, free of charge. Based on the uniformly positive feedback in response to our one-day boot camp on pulmonary physiology prior to the 2019 workshop, we intend to hold another boot camp before the 2021 meeting, this time focused on pulmonary inflammation. This boot camp will consist of ~5 longer presentations (approximately 1 hour each) on topics related to this central theme, with significant time devoted to question and answer after each, and a final discussion panel aimed at synthesizing the most important issues covered over the course of the day. In addition to this exciting addition to the format, the 2021 workshop will again seek a more equitable balance between functional, structural and molecular imaging approaches to pulmonary disease across the invited talks, while also continuing to expand our recent focus on the topics of imaging assessments of treatment response and the integration of imaging techniques with machine learning. Finally, the 2021 workshop add a session on bridging the gap between current clinical practice and innovative imaging technologies. NARRATIVE This application requests funding to support the 2021 International Workshop on Pulmonary Imaging at the University of Pennsylvania. This recurring workshop provides a necessary and valuable opportunity for researchers working in the fields of functional, structural, and molecular imaging technique development for assessing lung diseases such as lung cancer, COPD, IPF and ARDS to come together in order to discuss and share their work.

"An Integrated Software Platform for Accelerating Image-Driven Ophthalmic Research and Driving New Insights and Endpoints to the Clinic ABSTRACT More than 20 million patients suffer from age-related macular degeneration, diabetic retinopathy, or glaucoma. These degenerative eye diseases develop over decades, and their prevalence is increasing. Retinal imaging technologies such as optical coherence tomography and adaptive optics ophthalmoscopy are essential tools in the investigation and management of eye disease. New quantitative biomarkers derived from these and other imaging modalities are critical to the clinical translation of emerging ophthalmic innovations. However, biomarker development in the era of artificial intelligence requires large volumes of annotated images and transparent, reproducible processes, which places new demands on the management of living subjects research, data sharing, and algorithm development. Unfortunately, current software platforms are not effective in integrating these data in a manner that meets specific requirements in ophthalmology, Our goal in this Direct-to-Phase II SBIR, consistent with objectives of the NIH Strategic Plan for Data Science, is to create an integrated platform (PaaS) for the collection, curation, analysis, and sharing of ocular images and data. We will extend the capabilities of systems developed by the Advanced Ocular Imaging Program (AOIP), Medical College of Wisconsin (MCW), which include: (a) LATTICE - a software solution that reduces costs, reduces errors, and improves communications in the management of living-subjects research; (b) MOSAIC - an image processing platform and algorithm library with traditional and AI-trained algorithms; and (c) The AOIP Image Bank - a Repository that houses images and data on 1578 fully-consent human research subjects. To create the integrative platform, we will address four aims: (a) Extend LATTICE to meet the workflow requirements of academic and sponsored research in local and multisite environments, including the extensible direct integration of data relevant to ocular studies; (b) Design and implement a hybrid (local + cloud) REPOSITORY architecture, data schema, knowledge ontology, and query architecture for Owners and Readers of data.; (c) Integrate and demonstrate LATTICE, REPOSITORY and MOSAIC into a continuous ocular science workflow and (d) integrate and demonstrate Lattice, Repository and Mosaic into a continuous ocular science workflow. Our Integrated Translational Imaging platform will enable ophthalmic innovators to translate sight-saving insights and interventions to the clinic faster, with less frustration, and greater confidence. Our proposal fills an important technology gap in the field of ophthalmic data science and biomarker development. While the number and type of imaging devices continues to grow, the tools to develop and deploy new biomarkers and clinical endpoints using these exquisite imaging devices has not kept pace. With this program we will enable a new generation of image-driven innovation to find its way to the clinic. Project Narrative With more than 20 million patients suffering from age-related macular degeneration, diabetic retinopathy, or glaucoma, it is crucial to develop non-invasive biomarkers as early predictors of eye disease and reliable tests of the safety and efficacy of new preventative and restorative therapies. To meet the unmet need for rapid access and analysis of ophthalmic research data for the discovery of these biomarkers, we will create an integrated platform (PaaS) for the collection, curation, sharing, and analysis of ocular images and data. If we meet our objectives, our platform will reduce the cost of clinical research and increase the speed of translating critical research insights to saving the sight of millions of patients.",An Integrated Software Platform for Accelerating Image-Driven Ophthalmic Research and Driving New Insights and Endpoints to the Clinic,9908389,R44EY031198,"['Address', 'Age related macular degeneration', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Automobile Driving', 'Biological Markers', 'Blindness', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Collection', 'Communication', 'Computer software', 'Consent', 'Data', 'Data Discovery', 'Data Science', 'Diabetic Retinopathy', 'Docking', 'Economics', 'Environment', 'Eye diseases', 'Foundations', 'Frustration', 'Funding', 'Glaucoma', 'Goals', 'Housing', 'Human Subject Research', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Imaging Device', 'Imaging technology', 'Influentials', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Libraries', 'Mosaicism', 'Ontology', 'Ophthalmology', 'Ophthalmoscopy', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Policies', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Reader', 'Research', 'Research Subjects', 'Savings', 'Science', 'Site', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Speed', 'Strategic Planning', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Vision', 'Wisconsin', 'adaptive optics', 'algorithm development', 'algorithm training', 'application programming interface', 'biomarker development', 'biomarker discovery', 'clinical translation', 'cost', 'data access', 'data exchange', 'data integration', 'data sharing', 'data warehouse', 'deep learning', 'design', 'efficacy testing', 'experience', 'fighting', 'image processing', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging modality', 'imaging platform', 'imaging program', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'medical schools', 'microsystems', 'ocular imaging', 'process repeatability', 'programs', 'repository', 'retinal imaging', 'safety testing', 'software systems', 'structured data', 'tool', 'verification and validation', 'vision science']",NEI,"TRANSLATIONAL IMAGING INNOVATIONS, INC.",R44,2020,743347,0.002784569749934236
"Neuroimaging Analysis Center (NAC) Project Summary/Abstract The ability to access huge cohorts of patient medical records and radiology data, the emergence of ever-more detailed imaging modalities, and the availability of unprecedented computer processing power marks the pos- sibility for a new era in neuroimaging, disease understanding, and patient treatment. To unlock the full medical potential made possible by these new technologies, new algorithms and clinically-relevant techniques must be developed by close collaboration between computer scientists, physicians, and medical researchers. We are excited to propose a national resource center with the goal of finding new ways of extracting disease characteristics from advanced imaging and computation, and to make these methods available to the larger medical community through a proven methodology of world-class research, open-source software, and exten- sive collaboration. The overarching theme for this P41 renewal is the discovery and analysis of novel imaging phenotypes to characterize disease. We use the term imaging phenotypes to describe patterns or features of disease that can be detected through imaging (predominantly MRI) followed by machine learning, statistical analysis, feature detection, and correlation with other indicators of disease such as structured patient infor- mation. The three proposed Technology Research & Development (TR&D) projects address this common question us- ing a variety of complementary approaches and clinical testbeds. TR&D 1 addresses microstructure of tissue, including novel imaging methods to detect tumor microstructure. TR&D 2 investigates rich spatial patterns of disease extracted from clinical imaging with a focus on cerebrovascular and neurodegenerative conditions such as stroke. Finally, TR&D 3 proposes novel image and connectivity-based features that can be correlated with a variety of diseases, with a clinical emphasis on pediatric brain development. Technical innovation will be driven by intense collaboration between the TR&Ds and key collaborators in neurosurgery, neurology, and pe- diatrics. The TR&Ds will leverage recent important developments in the fields of image acquisition, machine learning, and data science to identify and exploit novel imaging phenotypes of disease. Building on our long history of developing clinically-relevant methods, each TR&D includes a translational and clinical validation aim to ensure our work is clinically relevant and effective at meeting the driving clinical goals. NAC's proven software engi- neering, translation, and dissemination infrastructure, along with its established network of academic, medical, and industrial partners, enhance the center's value as a national resource.

"IEEE Medical Imaging Conference Abstract  The IEEE Medical Imaging Conference (MIC) is the leading international scientific meeting bringing together a broad community interested in the physics, engineering and mathematical aspects of medical imaging, with special emphasis on nuclear medicine and multi-modal systems. The MIC runs in conjunction with the IEEE Nuclear Science Symposium (NSS) and the Workshop on Room Temperature Semiconductor X-ray and Gamma-ray Detectors (RTSD).  The purpose of the MIC is to disseminate and foster new research in physics and bio-engineering methods in medical imaging. While the traditional topics of primary interest are related to nuclear medicine techniques such as positron emission tomography (PET) and single photon emission computerized tomography (SPECT), increasing space will be also given to recently evolving imaging modalities such as X-ray, CT, optical, MR, with special emphasis on their multi-modal combination with nuclear medical imaging. Recently there has also been additional interest in employing deep learning and AI to enhance the field medical imaging. The conference provides a well-established forum of scientific exchange and dialogue between researchers in academia, industry, and government as well as education of the public, with special emphasis on young generations. This is reflected by the large spectrum of educational refresher sessions and short courses. One of the major objectives of the conference is the education of young investigators, and therefore this NIH R13 proposal seeks $10,000 in funding for each of the next three years to provide 20 trainee grants of $500 each to partially cover costs of MIC conference registration, housing and/or short course fees for graduate students and postdoctoral fellows based at US institutions.  We anticipate that the main impact of this grant program will be to increase attendance of students and postdocs at the 2020 meeting, especially those typically underrepresented, as well as to support their participation in educational activities. It is important to bring young generations, especially women, minorities, and those with disabilities, into the medical imaging field, where they could become main actors in the coming years. They will attend plenary and oral presentations given by many of the world leaders in the nuclear medical imaging instrumentation, image processing, and quantitative analysis fields. Moreover, they will be given the unique opportunity of direct personal interaction through the short courses and dedicated poster presentations. In turn their work will be exposed to the other participants for critical evaluation, constructive suggestions and dissemination. Furthermore, many of these trainees will likely continue in this field, thereby contributing to advancing technology with high societal relevance as being increasingly used in the clinical management of disease and therapeutic interventions. Narrative  The IEEE Medical Imaging Conference (MIC) has the purpose to disseminate and foster new research in physics and bio-engineering methods in medical imaging. The conference covers a variety of medical imaging topics including quantitative imaging, PET/SPECT techniques, image reconstruction, imaging in radiation therapy, portable imaging, multi-modality systems, new medical imaging technologies, CT/MR/optical/ultrasound, parametric/kinetic image modeling, and signal/image processing and modeling. One of the major objectives of the conference is the education and encouragement of young investigators, and therefore this NIH R13 proposal seeks funding to provide twenty grants for each of the next three years to graduate students and postdoctoral fellows based at US institutions to partially cover costs of MIC conference registration and short course fees.",IEEE Medical Imaging Conference,10071524,R13EB030423,"['Academia', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Attention', 'Award', 'Biological', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Brain', 'Clinical Management', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disabled Persons', 'Discipline of Nuclear Medicine', 'Disease Management', 'Education', 'Educational Activities', 'Educational workshop', 'Emission-Computed Tomography', 'Engineering', 'Evaluation', 'Exposure to', 'Fees', 'Fostering', 'Funding', 'Gamma Rays', 'Generations', 'Government', 'Grant', 'Housing', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging technology', 'Industrialization', 'Industry', 'Institution', 'International', 'Italy', 'Japan', 'Joints', 'Kinetics', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Mathematics', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Medical Imaging', 'Medical Technology', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Nuclear', 'Optics', 'Oral', 'Participant', 'Photons', 'Physics', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Radiation therapy', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Running', 'Scientist', 'Semiconductors', 'Signal Transduction', 'Students', 'Suggestion', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Temperature', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Tracer', 'Translations', 'Ultrasonography', 'Underrepresented Groups', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Woman', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical imaging', 'clinical practice', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'design', 'detector', 'disability', 'graduate student', 'image processing', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging modality', 'innovation', 'instrumentation', 'interest', 'kinetic model', 'meetings', 'member', 'models and simulation', 'multidisciplinary', 'multimodality', 'nanoparticle', 'novel', 'nuclear science', 'parametric imaging', 'portability', 'posters', 'programs', 'public education', 'quantitative imaging', 'radiation detector', 'reconstruction', 'signal processing', 'statistics', 'symposium', 'theranostics']",NIBIB,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R13,2020,10000,0.011171471498177047
"Development of Multi-Compartment MR-Fingerprinting for Subvoxel Estimation of Quantitative Tissue Biomarkers Project Summary Magnetic resonance fingerprinting (MRF) has been proposed as a technique to quantify tissue parameters, such as T1 and T2 relaxation times, which are biomarkers for various pathologies. One assumption of MRF is that the signal in each voxel is generated by exactly one set of tissue parameters. Due to MRI resolution at the range of millimeter in combination with the cellular structure of biological tissue, each voxel consists of multiple tissue compartments. An over-simplified single compartment model results in apparent relaxation times that are influenced by the relaxation times and the fractional proton densities of all contributing compartments. This can lead to a misinterpretation of signal changes. For example, in diseases that causes demyelination in white matter (Multiple Sclerosis, Dementia), a reduction of the myelin water fraction would result in a misleading change of the apparent relaxation time of the voxel. We propose a multi-compartment MRF method that allows to identify multiple tissue contributions within a voxel, including the fractional proton density (PD) of different compartments. Our machine learning based approach automatically identifies the number of compartments within each voxel that can be identified with the available SNR in that voxel. We will correct for partial-volume effects at the borders of two types of tissues, as well as analyze tissue microstructure. For the second case our learned model will also include chemical exchange between compartments. After an initial validation phase using numerical simulations, we will first perform MRF scans of dedicated 3D printed phantoms with multiple compartments. Our quality criterion is successful estimation of all simulated tissue compartments for all voxels with a relative error of less than 5% to the ground truth. We will then perform in-vivo MRF measurements of healthy volunteers (n=5). We will generate synthetic FLAIR and MP-RAGE contrasts from parameter maps estimated with conventional and the proposed multi-compartment MRF technique. We will compare them with currently used clinical contrasts acquired using established pulse sequences and validate the performance of our approach by measuring the cortical thickness. Further, we will validate the performance for microstructure composition in white matter. Our hypothesis is that it will be possible separate the compartments for myelin, intra- and extra-cellular water and compare the results to ex-vivo data found in literature. In summary, the methods developed in this R21 proposal will provide a novel technique to accurately and reproducibly identify biomarkers beyond the resolution of a voxel. It will allow to identify changes in tissue composition and fractional proton density at the microstructure level. Project Narrative The overarching goal of this proposal is to establish a MR imaging technique for quantifying biomarkers at the sub-voxel level. We will develop a machine learning based MR fingerprinting image reconstruction that enables the identification and characterization of multiple compartments within a voxel in terms of fractional proton density and relaxation times. We will generate accurate synthetic fluid suppressed images such as the FLAIR and MP- RAGE with accurate partial volume behavior and analyze the myelin water fraction and the corresponding relaxation times in white matter.",Development of Multi-Compartment MR-Fingerprinting for Subvoxel Estimation of Quantitative Tissue Biomarkers,10016296,R21EB027241,"['3D Print', 'Address', 'Behavior', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Cellular Structures', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Chemicals', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Computer-Assisted Diagnosis', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dementia', 'Demyelinations', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dictionary', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Fingerprint', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Liquid substance', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Multicenter Studies', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Myelin', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Noise', 'Pathology', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physics', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Procedures', 'Protons', 'Relaxation', 'Reproducibility', 'Resolution', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Standardization', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Water', 'base', 'clinical translation', 'conditioning', 'deep neural network', 'density', 'gray matter', 'healthy volunteer', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging system', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'magnetic resonance imaging biomarker', 'millimeter', 'neuroimaging', 'noninvasive diagnosis', 'novel', 'physical process', 'reconstruction', 'simulation', 'soft tissue', 'tissue biomarkers', 'white matter']",NIBIB,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R21,2020,252175,0.01670131035091195
"Quantitative MRI of Multiple Sclerosis - Resubmission - 1 Project Summary  In this project, we propose a novel T1 and T2 quantification method that generates quantitative T1 or T2 maps from weighted MR images. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is commonly used as a tool to diagnose Multiple Sclerosis (MS) and track lesional changes over time. Because MRI has various contrasts that display different information about the underlying tissue microstructure and physiology, it can potentially be used as a tool to predict MS disease progression and even disability. However, there is no known measure derived from MR images of MS that correlates well with clinical disability as described by the Expanded Disability Status Score (EDSS). Previous efforts to correlate MRI features and EDSS have included calculating total lesion load on T1- and T2-weighted images, measuring the variations in the magnetic transfer ration of normal-appearing brain tissues, and calculating cerebral atrophy, each with a varying level of success. Yet, there has been little study of the evolution of relaxation times of the lesions over time and how it relates to disability. Because changes in the T1 (spin-lattice) and T2 (spin-spin) relaxation times of a tissue can reflect pathological changes in that tissue over time, quantitative T1 and T2 maps derived from MR images may be more indicative of microscopic changes that manifest as disability in MS patients.  The specific aims of this proposal are: (1) develop and validate novel T1 and T2 quantification method on spin-echo MR images, (2) extend the novel quantification method to common MS imaging sequences, and (3) apply the novel quantification method to MS datasets to predict EDSS using machine learning. Aim 1 will involve the validation of the quantification pipeline on both T1- and T2-weighted spin-echo MR images in vivo, resulting in a range of acceptable parameters for the novel quantification method. Aim 2 will extend the quantification pipeline to include commonly used and more complicated MS imaging sequences, again resulting in a range of acceptable parameters for the quantification method. Aim 3 will use the quantification pipeline to compare machine learning algorithms with and without quantification to determine the added value of quantification in the imaging of MS. Additionally, Aim 3 will result in a predictive machine learning model utilizing multiple imaging contrasts for the prediction of disability in MS. These results will provide a more thorough understanding of the role of MR quantification in the evaluation of neurological diseases, such as MS, and will offer a scientific foundation to extend the use of MR quantification as a potential imaging biomarker for other diseases and pathologies. Project Narrative The proposed research aims to develop and validate a T1 and T2 quantification method using internal reference values derived from T1- or T2-weighted MR images. This method will be applied to weighted images of patients who have been diagnosed Multiple Sclerosis and input into various classification algorithms to determine which method is most predictive of worsening clinical disability as described by the Expanded Disability Status Score. By doing this, we will determine the impact of this novel quantification method as a tool for both the analysis of patients with Multiple Sclerosis as well as a tool for the normalization of big MR datasets before being input into machine learning algorithms.",Quantitative MRI of Multiple Sclerosis - Resubmission - 1,10154293,F31NS118930,"['Affect', 'Age-Years', 'Attenuated', 'Axon', 'Brain', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Clinical', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Demyelinations', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Ensure', 'Equation', 'Evaluation', 'Evolution', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Image', 'Inflammation', 'Investigation', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Liquid substance', 'Literature', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Magnetism', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Microscopic', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Neuraxis', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Patient imaging', 'Patients', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Predictive Value', 'Process', 'ROC Curve', 'Recovery', 'Reference Values', 'Relaxation', 'Research', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'T2 weighted imaging', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'brain tissue', 'cerebral atrophy', 'classification algorithm', 'contrast enhanced', 'contrast imaging', 'data harmonization', 'digital', 'disability', 'gray matter', 'healthy volunteer', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'in vivo imaging', 'longitudinal dataset', 'machine learning algorithm', 'multiple sclerosis patient', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'prospective', 'simulation', 'subcutaneous', 'success', 'tool', 'treatment response', 'white matter']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,F31,2020,45520,0.011190961807543266
"Optimizing Acquisition and Reconstruction of Under-sampled MRI for Signal Detection PROJECT SUMMARY Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a versatile imaging modality that suffers from slow acquisition times which is a challenge for both time sensitive applications and for patient throughput. Accelerating MRI would benefit patients both by reducing the time they need to be in the scanner and in reducing the cost of healthcare. This project is part of a larger scientific effort to accelerate MRI while maintaining the diagnostic quality. Acceleration, even by a factor of two would result in a major advance for public health. Two of the current approaches to accelerate MRI rely on collecting less data (under-sampling) and constrained or deep learning reconstruction. These approaches can lead to images with diagnostic quality with significant under-sampling but may suffer from artifacts which are hard to characterize. Specifically, this project will optimize the performance of constrained reconstruction and deep learning on detecting subtle lesions in acquiring and reconstructing under-sampled MRI. To carry out this optimization, we will first develop the methods required for detection of lesions by machine and human observer models. Then the models will be validated by psychophysical studies where humans perform the detection task. In the first aim of this project, we will optimize constrained reconstruction based on the ideal linear observer. We will consider under-sampled acquisition strategies in 2D MRI including one and two dimensional subsampling methods with constrained reconstruction using both wavelet and total variation constraints. We will perform simulations using anatomical backgrounds both for lesions which match the prior information of the constraints and those which do not to better understand how choices in acquisition and reconstruction affect ideal detection. While the ideal linear observer approximates the best possible detection, typically the signal detection is carried out by a human. In the second aim, we will optimize constrained reconstruction using human observer models and validate the models using human observer studies. A recent approach to reconstruction of under- sampled images is based on deep learning. In the third aim, this work will optimize deep learning reconstruction based on ideal and human observers. Due to the complexity of the deep learning approach, having this task-based approach to optimization is particularly relevant. This project will optimize a network using signal detection to better understand how training and architecture choices in the neural network affect detection of lesions which are not included in training images. This research project will help to strengthen the research environment at Manhattan College by involving students in biomedical research incorporating applied mathematics, statistics and data science. PROJECT NARRATIVE Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a versatile imaging modality that suffers from slow acquisition times which is a challenge for both time sensitive applications and for patient throughput.

This project would advance a larger scientific effort to accelerate MRI while maintaining the diagnostic quality by optimizing the performance of constrained reconstruction and deep learning on detecting subtle lesions in accelerated MRI.",Optimizing Acquisition and Reconstruction of Under-sampled MRI for Signal Detection,9880534,R15EB029172,"['Acceleration', 'Affect', 'Anatomy', 'Architecture', 'Biomedical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Dependence', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Gaussian model', 'Grant', 'Health Care Costs', 'Human', 'Image', 'Lead', 'Lesion', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Mathematics', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Psychophysics', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Students', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'college', 'deep learning', 'density', 'flexibility', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'insight', 'neural network', 'neural network architecture', 'predictive modeling', 'reconstruction', 'simulation', 'single photon emission computed tomography', 'statistics', 'two-dimensional']",NIBIB,MANHATTAN COLLEGE,R15,2020,395210,-0.04532029922435594
"THE XNAT IMAGING INFORMATICS PLATFORM PROJECT SUMMARY This proposal aims to continue the development of XNAT. XNAT is an imaging informatics platform designed to facilitate common management and productivity tasks for imaging and associated data. We will develop the next generation of XNAT technology to support the ongoing evolution of imaging research. Development will focus on modernizing and expanding the current system. In Aim 1, we will implement new web application infrastructure that includes a new archive file management system, a new event bus to manage cross-service orchestration and a new Javascript library to simplify user interface development. We will also implement new core services, including a Docker Container service, a dynamic scripting engine, and a global XNAT federation. In Aim 2, we will implement two innovative new capabilities that build on the services developed in Aim 1. The XNAT Publisher framework will streamline the process of data sharing by automating the creation and curation of data releases following best practices for data publication and stewardship. The XNAT Machine Learning framework will streamline the development and use of machine learning applications by integrating XNAT with the TensorFlow machine learning environment and implementing provenance and other monitoring features to help avoid the pitfalls that often plague machine learning efforts. For both Aim 1 and 2, all capabilities will be developed and evaluated in the context of real world scientific programs that are actively using the XNAT platform. In Aim 3, we will provide extensive support to the XNAT community, including training workshops, online documentation, discussion forums, and . These activities will be targeted at both XNAT users and developers. RELEVANCE Medical imaging is one of the key methods used by biomedical researchers to study human biology in health and disease. The imaging informatics platform described in this application will enable biomedical researchers to capture, analyze, and share imaging and related data.

"Center for Advanced Imaging Innovation and Research (CAI2R) Overall Project Summary  The Center for Advanced Imaging Innovation and Research (CAI2R) pursues a mission of bringing people together to create new ways of seeing. The work of our Center has been focused on creating new paradigms for the acquisition, reconstruction, and interpretation of biomedical images, and on implementing new collaboration models in order to translate these developments rapidly into clinical practice.  The world of biomedical imaging is changing, and CAI2R has been at the forefront of that change. Tasks that were once the sole domain of meticulously-engineered imaging hardware are now beginning to be accomplished in software, increasingly informed by diverse arrays of inexpensive auxiliary sensors. Information once pursued through the laborious acquisition of carefully separated image datasets is now being derived from newly integrated, and richly quantitative, data streams. In keeping with these themes, our Center will be organized around the following four Technology Research and Development (TR&D) projects going forward: 1. Reimagining the Future of Scanning: Intelligent image acquisition, reconstruction, and analysis. 2. Unshackling the Scanners of the Future: Flexible, self-correcting, multisensor machines. 3. Enriching the Data Stream: MRI and PET in concert. 4. Revealing Microstructure: Biophysical modeling and validation for discovery and clinical care.  In each of these projects, we aim to push medical imaging technology to the next level, both in hardware and in software. Having made great strides in developing rapid, continuous imaging data streams, we will next aim to add key new information to those streams, both from physics-driven microstructural modeling and from data- driven machine learning. Having focused on the development of robust tools for image acquisition and reconstruction, we will extend the pipeline to image interpretation, using the results of human- or machine- derived evaluations of image content as feedback for the further improvement of acquisition strategies and sensor designs. We will also aim to close the loop between diagnostic sensing and therapeutic intervention, exploring new ways to guide therapy with continuously-acquired information about tissue bioeffects.  Our Center has an explicit translational focus, which is reflected in the day-to-day operation of TR&D projects as well as in the topics of Collaborative Projects (CPs) and Service Projects (SPs), which are focused on three general areas of high public health impact: cancer, musculoskeletal disease, and neurologic disease.  In keeping with this translational emphasis, CAI2R is also be driven by an embedded collaboration model in which basic scientists, clinicians, and industry developers sit down together regularly at the scanners for interactive technology development and assessment. With early involvement of clinical stakeholders and industry partners, we aim to make CAI2R technologies widely available, for the advancement of biomedical knowledge and for the benefit of patients and the physicians who care for them. Overall Project Narrative  The Center for Advanced Imaging Innovation and Research (CAI2R) develops novel imaging techniques and technologies for the improved diagnosis and management of cancer, musculoskeletal disease, neurological disease and other disorders with a profound impact on human health.

"Deep Learning for Pulmonary Embolism Imaging Decision Support: A Multi-institutional Collaboration Project Summary Diagnostic imaging costs $100 billion annually. These healthcare costs are expected to increase in the coming decade as the national population ages and the pool of insured patients increases. The size and growth of these costs concern policy makers, payers, and society alike. The use of advanced imaging for PE has increased 27 fold in recent years, and this sharp escalation has the potential to expose patients to unnecessary procedures, tests, and risks due to incidental findings. Although radiologists do not order most radiology exams, these physicians are the target of criticism about the rising costs and possible overuse of radiology services. The healthcare industry has called upon radiologists to manage the potential overuse of advanced imaging and to take the lead on investigating best practices for the optimal use of advanced imaging. The ideal sources of information for imaging utilization guidelines are randomized, controlled imaging clinical trials. However, these trials are cost and time intensive, exceedingly difficult to conduct, and typically use narrow patient-inclusion criteria, making it challenging to generalize the results to broader clinical situations. Alternative sources of reliable evidence, such as observational or retrospective studies, have been lacking. The widespread adoption of electronic medical records (EMRs) and the increasing availability of computational methods to process vast amounts of unstructured information now make it possible to learn directly from practice-based evidence. We propose that “big data” clinical repositories, including radiology reports, can lend themselves to a treasure trove of point-of-care, relevant, actionable data that can be used in an innovative and cost-sensitive approach to evaluate the appropriate use of medical imaging. We aim to create a predictive model that leverages real-time EMR clinical data from top national medical centers to arrive at a patient-specific imaging outcome prediction. We recognize that clinicians have to make on-the-spot medical imaging-ordering decisions and they generally do not comply with existing clinical decision support rules. Our study aims to provide clinicians with a tool that can leverage aggregate patient data for medical imaging decision making at the point of care. The overarching approach of this study is to utilize scalable methodology that can be widely applied to leverage EMR data to predict the outcome of a several other high-cost, low-yield imaging tests. This proposal has the potential to better inform advanced imaging in the learning healthcare system of the future and reduce unnecessary imaging examinations and healthcare costs. Project Narrative Imaging costs make up a significant proportion of health care expenditures and cause concern among policy makers, insurers, and patients alike; the inappropriate use of imaging technology is in part a result of imperfect risk models for imaging clinical decision support tools. Current risk models are often irrelevant to patients and as such, clinicians do not always heed to these recommendations, which in turn leads to unnecessary treatments and increased costs. We propose to create a precision health predictive model that leverages real-time electronic medical record data to arrive at a patient-specific imaging prediction in order to enhance imaging decision making at the point of care and optimize advanced image utilization.",Deep Learning for Pulmonary Embolism Imaging Decision Support: A Multi-institutional Collaboration,9926311,R01LM012966,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Acute', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Big Data', 'Biometry', 'Caring', 'Cigarette', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Comparative Effectiveness Research', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Support Model', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Evidence based practice', 'Exposure to', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Gold', 'Growth', 'Guidelines', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Expenditures', 'Healthcare Industry', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Image', 'Image Enhancement', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Imaging technology', 'Immune System Diseases', 'Incidental Findings', 'Informatics', 'Institution', 'Insurance Carriers', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Medical center', 'Medicare', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Obesity', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Policy Maker', 'Population', 'Precision Health', 'Pregnancy', 'Principal Investigator', 'Process', 'Pulmonary Embolism', 'Radiation exposure', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Randomized', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Research Personnel', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Services', 'Societies', 'Source', 'Spottings', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Unnecessary Procedures', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'aged', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'chemotherapy', 'clinical data warehouse', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical imaging', 'cohort', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'diagnosis standard', 'flexibility', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'inclusion criteria', 'informatics tool', 'innovation', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'lung imaging', 'model building', 'mortality', 'new technology', 'outcome prediction', 'patient oriented', 'payment', 'personalized risk prediction', 'point of care', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'pressure', 'radiologist', 'support tools', 'tool', 'unnecessary treatment']",NLM,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,348620,0.011762962401556049
"Visible-light OCT angiography, velocimetry, and oximetry for characterizing retinal vascular alterations in glaucoma Project Summary Glaucoma damage to the optic nerve and impairment of vision are progressive and irreversible. Understanding mechanisms of glaucomatous injury will help to develop new approaches for treatments that can be used along with traditional therapies that lower intraocular pressure (IOP). Recent developments in optical coherence tomography (OCT) angiography have brought increased attention to the role of the inner retinal circulation in glaucoma. To improve our understanding of retinal vascular alterations in glaucoma, we can take advantage of recent developments in visible-light OCT (vis-OCT) to characterize simultaneously tissue structure, vessel density, blood flow and oxygenation. The goal of this project is to further advance vis-OCT by attaining capillary-level measurements, test the value of measuring their local alterations as early indicators of glaucoma and glaucomatous progression and use this to evaluate impaired retinal autoregulation from retinal ganglion cell (RGC) loss as a potential cause of increased susceptibility in advanced glaucoma. In Specific Aim 1 we will develop high-speed, high-sensitivity, high-resolution vis-OCT. The speed will be double that of the current system. A more stable supercontinuum laser will be used to improve system sensitivity, and a tighter focus will be used to improve lateral resolution. This will enable complete detection of capillaries that may be vulnerable to vascular dysfunction. Specific Aim 2 will develop quantitative OCT angiography, velocimetry and oximetry in capillaries as well as arteries and veins. Building on the high-resolution, high-contrast scans acquired in Aim 1, we will use machine learning to segment capillary plexuses, and advanced image processing to extract capillary architecture. Aided by this capillary architecture, we will automatically measure blood flow and oxygenation in capillary segments and incorporate them into a real-time platform. Specific Aim 3 will use this system to demonstrate that acute loss of RGCs, produced by optic nerve transection, alters retinal capillary plexus density, oximetry and velocimetry over time and that these changes precede altered oximetry and flow in larger retinal vessels. We will also show that loss of RGCs impairs the autoregulatory response to acute IOP challenge. In Specific Aim 4, we will demonstrate that optic nerve injury in a model of controlled, elevated IOP produces early alterations in capillary velocimetry, oximetry and autoregulation, show that they are more persistent with advanced injury, and demonstrate the pathophysiologic consequences of these observations. Successful development of this new technology will improve methods of early glaucoma diagnosis and detection of progression. Better understanding of retinal vascular factors that lead to increased susceptibility in advanced glaucoma will lead to improved treatments for these highly vulnerable patients. Project Narrative This project will develop advanced technology to image retinal capillaries and measure capillary blood flow and oxygen content. This may provide an early indicator of glaucoma progression and help study a potential cause of increased susceptibility to intraocular pressure in glaucoma patients.","Visible-light OCT angiography, velocimetry, and oximetry for characterizing retinal vascular alterations in glaucoma",9944107,R01EY031394,"['3-Dimensional', 'Abbreviations', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Angiography', 'Architecture', 'Arteries', 'Attention', 'Axon', 'Blindness', 'Blood Circulation', 'Blood Vessels', 'Blood capillaries', 'Blood flow', 'Computer software', 'Defect', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Event', 'Eye', 'Glaucoma', 'Glossary', 'Goals', 'Homeostasis', 'Impairment', 'Injury', 'Intraocular pressure test', 'Lasers', 'Lateral', 'Lead', 'Lighting', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Noise', 'Optic Nerve', 'Optic Nerve Injuries', 'Optic Nerve Transections', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Oxygen', 'Oxygen saturation measurement', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physiologic Intraocular Pressure', 'Predisposition', 'Process', 'Progressive Disease', 'Rattus', 'Resolution', 'Retina', 'Retinal Ganglion Cells', 'Rodent Model', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'Structure of central vein of the retina', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Vascular Diseases', 'Veins', 'Velocimetries', 'Visible Radiation', 'Vision', 'Visual impairment', 'attenuation', 'automated segmentation', 'central retinal artery', 'data acquisition', 'deep learning', 'density', 'image processing', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'insight', 'metabolic rate', 'new technology', 'novel strategies', 'preservation', 'pressure', 'prototype', 'response', 'retina blood vessel structure', 'retina circulation', 'retinal imaging', 'retinal ischemia', 'traditional therapy', 'vascular factor']",NEI,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,552591,0.03743150384778621
"Super-multiplexed fluorescence nanoscopy for imaging-based proteomics PROJECT SUMMARY In situ immunofluorescence imaging is a powerful method to study the locations, expression levels and structures of proteins in cells and tissues. In particular, multiplexed imaging reveals the interaction networks of proteins, which allows us to understand the underlying mechanisms of many diseases. However, it has been challenging to perform multiplexed immunofluorescence imaging due to its extremely time-consuming process, high cost and lack of signal amplification. The limited spatial resolution achievable with confocal microscopy often fails to reveal complex spatial organization and to determine localizations of proteins. Here we propose super-multiplexed immunofluorescence nanoscopy that is capable of imaging more than twenty different proteins in 24 hours with nanoscale resolution. We will employ DNA-barcoded secondary nanobodies that are monovalent, open-source and designed for quantitative labeling. Repeated introduction and washing of fluorescent DNA imagers will generate highly multiplexed images. Moreover, we will develop unprecedentedly fast stimulated emission depletion (STED) microscopy that employs a parallelized line array of doughnut beams. It will feature a large imaging area and excellent optical sectioning capability. Photon reassignment, hyperspectral imaging and deep-learning will further facilitate rapid super-resolution-based protein profiling. Our new biochemical and optical tools will play crucial roles in diverse biomedical areas including brain proteomics and cancer profiling.

"Next-Generation Ultrasound Localization Microscopy Project Summary/Abstract Abnormal alterations of tissue microcirculation are often associated with early stage of tissue pathology. Detection and characterization of these early microvascular abnormalities can greatly benefit clinical diagnosis and treatment monitoring as well as facilitating the creation of new therapies to counter disease development. For decades, there has been a longstanding quest for the development of a clinical imaging modality that can noninvasively and directly image such tissue microvascular variations. To date, however, such an imaging method remains elusive due to the fundamental compromise between imaging spatial resolution and depth penetration. Therefore, the long-term objective of this project is to fulfill this unmet clinical need by developing the next-generation ultrasound localization microscopy (ULM), which is an ultrasound-based imaging technique that can directly assess structural and functional tissue microvasculature in vivo in humans at a clinically relevant depth. Different from other imaging modalities, ULM is not limited by the resolution-penetration compromise: ULM can noninvasively image capillary-scale microvessels at several centimeters depth and quantitatively measure their blood flow speed (as low as 1 mm/s). Such combination of deep imaging penetration and exquisite spatial resolution and the unique functionality of measuring small vessel blood flow speed make ULM a promising technique for many clinical applications including cancer and cardiovascular diseases. At present, however, ULM is not ready for clinical use due to several key technical limitations: 1) ULM data acquisition is very slow (tens of seconds with breath holding); 2) ULM post-processing is very expensive computationally (several hours to generate a single 2D ULM image); 3) ULM is difficult to be extended to 3D imaging (which is important for comprehensive evaluation of tissue microvasculature such as in cancer applications). These limitations largely forbids ULM from being effectively used in the clinic to provide useful microvascular biomarkers. In this proposal, we will concentrate on addressing these technical barriers and transform ULM to a truly useful clinical imaging tool. Our approach synergistically combines deep learning (DL), parallel computing, and ultrafast 3D ultrasound imaging to fundamentally shorten ULM data acquisition time, substantially accelerate ULM post-processing, and enhance ULM to 3D imaging. Our first aim will develop and validate DL-based ULM data processing algorithms that would enable real-time 4D morphometric ULM and fast 3D quantitative ULM. Our method uniquely collects real labeled optical imaging data on a chicken embryo microvessel model for DL training. Our second aim will focus on realizing 3D-ULM on a 2D row-column-addressing transducer with ultrafast 3D plane wave imaging. We will develop a DL-based beamforming technique to enable high-fidelity 3D microbubble imaging for robust 3D-ULM. Our final aim will focus on validating the in vivo performance of the newly developed 3D-ULM imaging techniques on a mouse tumor model. We will be collaborating with world-renowned experts in deep learning, optical imaging, and comparative medicine at the University of Illinois to accomplish these aims of the proposal. Project Narrative Imaging-based detection and characterization of abnormal tissue microvascular variations is clinically significant for diagnosis, treatment evaluation, and therapy development in many pathologies such as cancer, cardiovascular diseases, inflammation, and neurodegenerative diseases. At present, there is no viable noninvasive imaging tool that can fulfill this important clinical need. To fill this gap, we propose to develop a new ultrasound-based super-resolution microvessel imaging technique that can directly and quantitatively assess the structure and the function of tissue microcirculation in vivo in humans.",Next-Generation Ultrasound Localization Microscopy,10039725,R21EB030072,"['3-Dimensional', '3D ultrasound', '4T1', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Animals', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood Vessels', 'Blood capillaries', 'Blood flow', 'Breast Carcinoma', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Chickens', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Embryo', 'Evaluation', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Illinois', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging Device', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Incentives', 'Inflammation', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Microbubbles', 'Microcirculation', 'Microscopy', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Mus', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Noise', 'Nutrient', 'Organ', 'Oxygen', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Penetration', 'Performance', 'Property', 'Provider', 'Resolution', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Skin', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'Techniques', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Transducers', 'Transportation', 'Ultrasonic Transducer', 'Ultrasonography', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Vendor', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinical application', 'clinical imaging', 'clinical practice', 'clinically relevant', 'clinically significant', 'comparative', 'computerized data processing', 'cost', 'data acquisition', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'hemodynamics', 'imaging detection', 'imaging modality', 'in vivo', 'in vivo imaging', 'innovation', 'instrumentation', 'microCT', 'microscopic imaging', 'next generation', 'non-invasive imaging', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'optical imaging', 'parallel computer', 'performance tests', 'quantitative ultrasound', 'real-time images', 'therapy development', 'tool', 'tumor', 'two photon microscopy']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT URBANA-CHAMPAIGN,R21,2020,565346,0.03599168254451414
"Fast motion-robust fetal neuroimaging with MRI PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Fetal-brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has become an invaluable tool for studying the early development of the brain and can resolve diagnostic ambiguities that may remain after routine ultrasound exams. Unfortunately, high levels of fetal and maternal motion (1) limit fetal MRI to rapid two-dimensional (2D) sequences and frequently introduce dramatic artifacts such as (2) image misorientation relative to the standard sagittal, coronal, axial planes needed for clinical assessment and (3) partial to complete signal loss. These factors lead to the inefficient practice of repeating ~30 s stack-of-slices acquisitions until motion-free images have been obtained. Throughout the session, technologists manually adjust the orientation of scans in response to motion, and about 38% of datasets are typically discarded. Thus, subject motion is the fundamental impediment to reaping the full benefits of MRI for answering clinical and investigational questions in the fetus. The overarching goal of this project is to overcome the challenges posed by motion by exploiting innovations in deep learning, which have enabled image-analysis algorithms with unprecedented speed and reliability. We propose to integrate these into the MRI acquisition pipeline to unlock the potential of fetal MRI. We will develop practical pulse-sequence technology for automated and dynamically motion-corrected fetal neuroimaging without the need for external hardware or calibration. We hypothesize that this will radically improve the quality and success rates of clinical and research studies, while dramatically reducing patient discomfort and cost. We propose as Aim 1 to eradicate (2) the vulnerability of acquisitions to image-brain misorientation with rapid, automated prescription of standard anatomical planes. In Aim 2, we propose to address (3) motion during the scan with real-time correction of fetal-head motion. An anatomical stack-of-slices acquisition will be interleaved with volumetric navigators. These will be used to measure motion as it happens in the scanner and to adaptively update the slice tilt/position. We propose as Aim 3 to develop a 3D radial sequence and estimate motion between subsets of radial spokes for real-time self-navigation. Adaptively updating the orientation of spokes and selectively re-acquiring corrupted subsets at the end of the scan will enable 3D imaging of the fetal brain (1). Since the applicant has a physics background, the proposed training program at MIT and HMS will focus on deep learning and fetal development/neuroscience during the K99 phase to develop the skills needed for transitioning to independence in the R00 phase. The applicant’s goal is to become a fetal image acquisition and analysis scientist acting as bridge between deep learning, MRI and clinical fetal-imaging applications to shift the boundaries of what is currently possible with state-of-the-art technology. Fulfilling the research aims will promote this, as it will result in a practical framework for automation and motion correction, applicable to a wide variety of fetal neuroimaging sequences. PROJECT NARRATIVE Subject motion is the fundamental impediment to reaping the full benefits of fetal-brain magnetic resonance imaging, as it frequently produces images with dramatic artifacts. The goal of this project is to exploit innovations in deep learning and integrate them into the acquisition pipeline to overcome the challenges posed by motion in fetal neuroimaging studies. This will be achieved by using fast, automated scan prescription of standard anatomical planes and by adaptively updating the acquisition as motion happens in the scanner, based on sub-second navigator scans interleaved with the imaging sequence.",Fast motion-robust fetal neuroimaging with MRI,9950474,K99HD101553,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Amniotic Fluid', 'Anatomy', 'Automation', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Calibration', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical assessments', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Echo-Planar Imaging', 'Fetal Development', 'Fetus', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manuals', 'Masks', 'Measures', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Neurosciences', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Physics', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Radial', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Residual state', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Scientist', 'Signal Transduction', 'Slice', 'Speed', 'Technology', 'Thick', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Translating', 'Ultrasonography', 'Update', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical investigation', 'convolutional neural network', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'echo detection', 'experience', 'fetal', 'image archival system', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'prospective', 'radiologist', 'reconstruction', 'repaired', 'research study', 'response', 'skills', 'success', 'tool', 'two-dimensional']",NICHD,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,K99,2020,108601,0.013295395988787888
"Improving Pediatric SPECT Imaging: Enhanced Lesion Detection with Dose Reduction through Advanced Reconstruction and Motion Correction Nuclear medicine imaging in children has been shown to have significant clinical value across all organ systems. In providing this significant benefit it is critical to minimize the radiation dose used in pediatric patients, whose risk for adverse health effects (such as cancer) per unit administered activity is much higher than that of adults, owing to their higher tissue sensitivity and longer potential lifespan. The governing principle of this project will be to minimize radiation dose while methodically ensuring that lesion detection performance is fully preserved. This will be accomplished by using validations based on both numerical and physician observers measuring performance in tasks that emulate those performed clinically. We will employ two approaches in tandem to enable lowering dose while maintaining performance. First, we will use advanced image reconstruction and processing techniques. Corrections for various forms of image quality degradation will be incorporated in the reconstruction, and deep learning (DL) will be used for post-reconstruction denoising. Second, we will develop methods to correct for both body and respiratory motion, which degrade diagnostic accuracy. Correcting for body and respiratory motion will allow dose to be reduced without loss of image quality and will also offer a technological alternative to using sedation or even general anesthesia to minimize motion when imaging children. For this investigation we have selected 99mTc-labeled dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) renal imaging as a testbed to demonstrate our approaches. Damage to the renal cortex resulting from infection of the kidneys is a critical issue in children, including newborns and toddlers. DMSA SPECT is the “gold-standard” in the evaluation of pyelonephritis and renal scarring post- infection. The concepts we will demonstrate for reduction of radiation dose and correction of motion with DMSA will be translatable to other SPECT (and PET) studies in pediatric imaging and beyond.  Our Specific Aims are: 1. Establish infrastructure for investigating and evaluating advanced reconstruction and motion correction; 2. Determine the extent of radiation dose reduction to pediatric patients through improved reconstruction and DL denoising while maintaining optimal full-dose lesion detection accuracy; 3. Develop data-driven and depth-sensing camera methods for body and respiratory motion estimation and correction; and 4. Conduct numerical and physician observer studies to validate the level of dose reduction enabled by DL denoising and motion correction. Narrative  In nuclear medicine imaging, it is critical to minimize the radiation dose used in pediatric patients, whose risk for adverse health effects (such as cancer) per unit administered activity is much higher than that in adults, owing to their higher tissue sensitivity and longer potential lifespan. Correcting for body and respiratory motion occurring during imaging will improve the quality of the formed three-dimensional images of the patient by reducing blurring and image artifacts and offer a technological alternative to using sedation or even general anesthesia to reduce motion when imaging children, which can bear health risks of its own. We propose an advanced reconstruction methodology which would enable reduction in the amount of activity administered and compensate for patient motion during imaging.",Improving Pediatric SPECT Imaging: Enhanced Lesion Detection with Dose Reduction through Advanced Reconstruction and Motion Correction,9914572,R01EB029315,"['3-Dimensional', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Area', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'DMSA', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Discipline of Nuclear Medicine', 'Dose', 'Enhancing Lesion', 'Ensure', 'European', 'Evaluation', 'Freedom', 'Gaussian model', 'General Anesthesia', 'Gold', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Imaging problem', 'Infection', 'Infrastructure', 'Investigation', 'Kidney', 'Label', 'Lesion', 'Longevity', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Newborn Infant', 'Patient imaging', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Procedures', 'Pyelonephritis', 'ROC Curve', 'Radiation Dose Unit', 'Respiration', 'Risk', 'Scheme', 'Sedation procedure', 'Societies', 'Statistical Study', 'Task Performances', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Toddler', 'Ursidae Family', 'Validation', 'base', 'body system', 'cardiac single photon emission computed tomography', 'clinically significant', 'deep learning', 'denoising', 'denoising deep learning', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'image processing', 'image reconstruction', 'improved', 'innovation', 'kidney cortex', 'kidney infection', 'molecular imaging', 'pediatric patients', 'preservation', 'reconstruction', 'renal scarring', 'respiratory', 'response', 'single photon emission computed tomography']",NIBIB,UNIV OF MASSACHUSETTS MED SCH WORCESTER,R01,2020,773763,-0.05154894923913196
"ClearScope Combined in vivo and ex vivo three-dimensional (3D) whole-brain imaging of non-transgenic and transgenic animal models holds the promise of novel insights into neural network connectivity patterns. With regard to ex vivo light microscopic imaging of 3D whole-brain datasets, the best approach is brain clearing followed by whole-brain light sheet microscopy (LSM) because of its unique combination of speed, 3D resolving power, and low phototoxicity compared to confocal and multiphoton microscopy. Unlike other methods, the combined brain clearing / LSM approach makes it possible to use intact tissue and retain all intracellular connections within the brain structure. However, LSM systems commercially available are not suitable for ex vivo light microscopic imaging of 3D whole-brain datasets in advanced connectomics research. Recently, Dr. Raju Tomer (Dept. Biol. Sci., Columbia Univ., New York, NY) developed light sheet theta microscopy (LSTM), essentially a unique arrangement of two light sheets oblique to the specimen and one detection objective perpendicular to the specimen. This novel microscope is the basis for a number of capabilities in LSTM that are not all available with any other commercially available LSM systems. The LSTM technology has distinct advantages over confocal and other light sheet microscopes, including the unmatched ability to image thicker tissue specimens over a larger lateral area (XY) at higher optical resolutions, while maintaining fast imaging speed, high imaging quality, and low photo-bleaching. This promising technology serves as the basis for this Lab to Marketplace proposal to develop the ClearScope™, which refines and improves Dr. Tomer's original LSTM system to create a successful commercial microscope for wide-spread adoption. The key technical objectives for developing the ClearScope as a commercial product include creating and testing (i) a ClearScope prototype based on an optimized microscope hardware design; (ii) novel microscope hardware components for the ClearScope, comprising a novel chamber that contains the investigated specimen and the immersion medium, and a novel detection objective changer; (iii) novel control and image acquisition software for the ClearScope; and importantly, (iv) novel software that surpasses the existing state-of-the-art technology to assemble acquired image stacks into large 3D image volumes exceeding 10TB without need to downsample the image information. The production version of the ClearScope will benefit the neuroscience research community, pharmacological and biotechnological R&D, and society in general by improving understanding of neural network connectivity patterns as well as the neuropathological underpinnings of the large-scale connectional alterations associated with human neuropsychiatric and neurological conditions. In particular, this will result in an improved basis for developing novel treatment strategies for complex brain diseases. The proposed project will enable important new research, that is not currently feasible, into whole-brain neural network connectivity patterns by means of ex vivo light microscopic imaging of three-dimensional whole-brain datasets. To achieve this, the proposed project will create the ClearScope light sheet microscope featuring signficant capabilities to image thick specimens of unlimited lateral (XY) size with resolution that permits investigatons of subcellular structures to distinguish adjacent neuronal processes (axons, dendrites, varicosities and dendritic spines). Because these features are not all available with any commercially available light sheet microscopes, the benefit for the neuroscience research community, pharmacological and biotechnological R&D, and society in general will be the possibility to better understand neural network connectivity patterns as well as the neuropathological underpinnings of the large-scale connectional alterations associated with human neuropsychiatric and neurological conditions, ultimately resulting in an improved basis for developing novel treatment strategies for complex brain diseases.",ClearScope,10019728,R44MH116827,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Adoption', 'Animal Model', 'Area', 'Axon', 'Behavioral Research', 'Benchmarking', 'Biotechnology', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Brain imaging', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Confocal Microscopy', 'Data Set', 'Dendrites', 'Dendritic Spines', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Human', 'Image', 'Immersion', 'Lateral', 'Legal patent', 'Light', 'Lighting', 'Literature', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Microscope', 'Microscopy', 'Mus', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurologic', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences Research', 'New York', 'Optics', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Pharmacology', 'Phase', 'Photobleaching', 'Phototoxicity', 'Preparation', 'Process', 'Production', 'Rattus', 'Refractive Indices', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Societies', 'Specimen', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'Subcellular structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Tissues', 'Transgenic Animals', 'Translations', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Varicosity', 'base', 'brain research', 'design', 'ex vivo imaging', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'insight', 'microscopic imaging', 'multiphoton microscopy', 'neural network', 'neuropsychiatry', 'new technology', 'nonhuman primate', 'novel', 'prototype', 'research and development', 'tool', 'treatment strategy', 'usability', 'user-friendly']",NIMH,"MICROBRIGHTFIELD, LLC",R44,2020,1313060,0.009987390943002446
"Biomechanical Analysis in Strabismus Surgery We propose 3 interrelated aims to define the biomechanics of the eye rotating (extraocular) muscles (EOMs) & optic nerve (ON) in health & visual disease, understand novel EOM actions, & characterize mechanical effects that may contribute to severe myopia. We aim to improve treatment of strabismus, misalignment of visual directions of the eyes; glaucoma & non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NA-AION), both common blinding ON diseases; & high axial myopia, an ocular elongation & distortion that has become a worldwide epidemic & major cause of blindness. We propose a novel & critical nexus linking the EOMs, ON, & structure of the eye's scleral wall that we will explore using modern imaging & artificial intelligence techniques. Aim I will clarify the kinematic (motion) properties of the human eye, testing by multipositional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the eyeball & EOMs the hypothesis that translational (linear) movement contributes importantly to ocular alignment. MRI will be performed during horizontal convergence & vertical eye rotation in normal people, & in patients who have common forms of strabismus including convergence insufficiency, eye crossing (esotropia), & outward ocular deviation (exotropia), both before & after corrective EOM surgery. Clarification of ocular translation is necessary to understand normal ocular motility and treat its disorders. Aim II will characterize the mechanical loading on the ON caused by eye movements. We will characterize the mechanical effects of ON tractional loading on the eyeball during horizontal & vertical eye rotations at 2 scales in living people, to test the hypothesis that such ON loading deforms it & adjacent retina & blood vessels as loading translates the eye. We propose that the resulting deformation during eye movements may create repetitive strain injury contributing to glaucoma, NA-AION, & axial myopia. In groups of subjects with the foregoing diseases, & in an equal group of matched healthy subjects, we will study mechanical effects of eye movement within the living eye by imaging its internal micro structure & blood vessels with optical coherence tomography, & outside the eyeball in the eye socket using MRI. Effects of tethering during eye movement will be studied ex vivo by precision 3D optical imaging of fresh human eye bank specimens subjected to mechanical tension on the ON that mimic effects of the eye movements imaged in the living subjects. Aim III will model the biomechanics of ocular kinematics. The constitutive mechanical properties of the non-muscular ocular & eye socket tissues will be described by finite element models (FEMs) using modern engineering methods for computational simulation to predict ocular kinematics, as well as local mechanical strains in the ON & sclera that may cause glaucoma, NA-AION, & the ocular deformities underlying extreme nearsightedness. We will determine if FEMs employing normal tissue properties can simulate normal ocular translation during horizontal & vertical rotations & convergence. By FEM simulation, we will also test the hypothesis that ocular loading by eye movement might contribute to: normal vergence, strabismus, & the effects of strabismus surgery. Relevance. Strabismus is a common clinical disorder that can cause double vision in adults and vision loss in children. Strabismus is often treated by surgical manipulation of the eye muscles, although current knowledge of their structure and function is incomplete. Proposed functional imaging and biomechanical studies of the properties of the eye muscles, eyeball, and optic nerve will improve understanding of the causes and treatment of strabismus, optic nerve diseases, and nearsightedness.",Biomechanical Analysis in Strabismus Surgery,9972266,R01EY008313,"['3-Dimensional', 'Accounting', 'Adult', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Anterior Ischemic Optic Neuropathy', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavior', 'Biological Specimen Banks', 'Biomechanics', 'Blindness', 'Blood Vessels', 'Child', 'Choroid', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Connective Tissue', 'Convergence Insufficiency', 'Cumulative Trauma Disorders', 'Deformity', 'Degenerative Myopia', 'Diplopia', 'Disease', 'Duct (organ) structure', 'Elements', 'Engineering', 'Epidemic', 'Equilibrium', 'Esotropia', 'Etiology', 'Exotropia', 'Eye', 'Eye Banks', 'Eye Movements', 'Failure', 'Functional Imaging', 'Gap Junctions', 'Glaucoma', 'Health', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Lasers', 'Link', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Matched Group', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Motion', 'Movement', 'Muscle', 'Muscle Contraction', 'Myopia', 'Normal tissue morphology', 'Ocular orbit', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Ophthalmoscopy', 'Optic Disk', 'Optic Nerve', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Optics', 'Patients', 'Physiologic Intraocular Pressure', 'Play', 'Primary Open Angle Glaucoma', 'Property', 'Retina', 'Role', 'Rotation', 'Scanning', 'Sclera', 'Strabismus', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissues', 'Traction', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Visual', 'anatomic imaging', 'biomechanical model', 'cell motility', 'crosslink', 'digital imaging', 'ex vivo imaging', 'human tissue', 'improved', 'in vivo imaging', 'in vivo optical imaging', 'kinematics', 'mechanical load', 'mechanical properties', 'model development', 'models and simulation', 'monocular', 'neglect', 'novel', 'ocular imaging', 'optic nerve disorder', 'optical imaging', 'orbit muscle', 'predictive modeling', 'quantitative imaging', 'retina blood vessel structure', 'simulation']",NEI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2020,622245,0.007121746229843321
"Groundwork for a Synchrotron MicroCT Imaging Resource for Biology (SMIRB) Project Summary Each major human disease is associated with a specific range of morphological changes to cells and tissues in the micron scale. Normal and abnormal structure was discovered and is still characterized using histology - a microscopic technique that depends on physical tissue slices. Presently, histology’s use in systems biology is limited by its largely descriptive and two-dimensional nature. Making histology quantitative and three-dimensional would be potentially transformational for research and diagnostics, but has been impractical. Accordingly, we have now created a 3D form of histology by customizing X-ray microtomography (micro-CT) of fixed and stained, millimeter-scale, whole organisms and tissue samples. We used fixed and metal-stained, whole zebrafish because they contain a full range of tissues within the size range currently studied histologically. The result is the first practical way to create virtual histology-like “sections” in any plane. Three-dimensional, complete histological phenotyping has potential use in genetic and chemical screens, and in clinical and toxicological tissue diagnostics. Here, we propose the next steps needed to enable high-throughput, quantitative, 3D histological phenotyping of whole, millimeter-scale animals. The proposed work applies the principles of chemistry, physics, and computer science to improve image resolution, throughput, and analytics, organized into three specific aims. Specific Aim 1 will build on our developments in this project and further improve imaging volume and resolution by upgrading imaging array, optics, and sub-pixel shifting, and to throughput by changes in sample embedding, loading geometry and mechanics, helical CT scanning, scintillator material, and to data sharing by improvements to the ViewTool infrastructure and user interface. Specific Aim 2 will yield reference images to define the range of normal phenotypic variation and to obtain samples related to a range of potential applications. Specific Aim 3 will apply the power of machine learning to segmentation, annotation, and analytics. Together, this work will establish a practical foundation for large-scale genetic and chemical screens involving mm-scale, whole organisms based on 3-dimensional, quantitative, histological phenotyping. The instrumentation and analytics will be state-of-the-art in its combination of resolution, field-of-view, pancellularity, image quality, analytical potential, throughput, sample stability, and reproducibility and largely usable with both tube and synchrotron X-ray sources. The voxel resolution will be at least 0.5 μm across fields-of-view of up to 1 cm. Representation of every cell type make the images suitable for cross-referencing across imaging modalities. Potential applications will be explored, “wild-type” will begin to be defined, and training sets for automated segmentation generated. The potential impact will encompass the missions of most NIH Institutes and Centers. The whole-animal genetic and chemical screens enabled are expected to impact drug development, diagnostics, and our basic understanding of how genes and environment define phenotype. Project Narrative Our group has established the only three-dimensional form of histology that is suitable for histopathology and quantitative tissue phenotyping, tissue X-ray microtomography (micro-CT). We outline here a plan to establish mechanisms for increasing resolution and field-of-view, to add sample multiplexing, to simply sample preparation, and to explore machine learning mechanisms for defining normal and abnormal structure towards whole-organism complete tissue phenotyping. The resulting tools will allow the community to comprehensively and computationally determine the roles of genes and environment in defining phenotype, which has implications in drug development, biomedical research, and medicine.",Groundwork for a Synchrotron MicroCT Imaging Resource for Biology (SMIRB),9991958,R24OD018559,"['3-Dimensional', 'Adolescent', 'Age', 'Animal Genetics', 'Animals', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Research', 'Body measure procedure', 'Caenorhabditis elegans', 'Cells', 'Cellular Structures', 'Cesium', 'Chemicals', 'Chemistry', 'Communities', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Drosophila genus', 'Embryo', 'Environment', 'Fishes', 'Foundations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Histologic', 'Histology', 'Histopathology', 'Image', 'Infrastructure', 'Institutes', 'Iodides', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Medicine', 'Metals', 'Microscopic', 'Mission', 'Morphology', 'Mus', 'Mutation', 'Nature', 'Nerve', 'Normal Range', 'Online Systems', 'Optics', 'Organ', 'Output', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Physics', 'Preparation', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Robotics', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Series', 'Siblings', 'Signal Transduction', 'Slice', 'Source', 'Spiral Computed Tomography', 'Stains', 'Structural defect', 'Structure', 'Synchrotrons', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Time', 'Tissue Sample', 'Tissue imaging', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Travel', 'Tube', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'Whole Organism', 'Work', 'Writing', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'Zebrafish', 'automated segmentation', 'base', 'bone', 'cell type', 'clinical toxicology', 'computer science', 'computerized tools', 'crowdsourcing', 'data dissemination', 'data sharing', 'detector', 'disease phenotype', 'drug development', 'feature detection', 'histological studies', 'human disease', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'instrumentation', 'microCT', 'millimeter', 'mutant', 'programs', 'supervised learning', 'tool', 'two-dimensional', 'unsupervised learning', 'virtual']",OD,PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIV HERSHEY MED CTR,R24,2020,655482,0.012211165192320026
"Osteoarthritis: Quantitative Evaluation of Whole Joint Disease with MRI Project Summary Osteoarthritis (OA) is an enormous clinical problem and worldwide cause of disability. Development of new therapies for OA is hampered by a lack of sensitive imaging tests that respond to changes in disease status. Recently FDA and CE approved clinical knee 7T MRI has the potential to add sensitivity and specificity to advanced MRI biomarkers of OA progression. This project will compare changes seen at 3T and 7T across two different vendors systems and assess the potential for 7T MRI to improve our ability to study and develop new disease- modifying therapies. This study will enhance future studies and clinical exams at 7T and can be used to improve routine 3T MRI though machine learning reconstruction and enhanced understanding of OA disease mechanisms. Understanding the relative strengths of 3T and 7T MRI in this important clinical application is critical to developing new disease-modifying treatments for patients with OA. Narrative Osteoarthritis affects more than half of the population during their lives and is the leading cause of disability worldwide. Diagnostic imaging of osteoarthritis is often limited to x-ray, but more sensitive and specific imaging is a critical need for development of disease-modifying treatments.

"A robust platform for multiplexed, subcellular proteomic imaging in human tissue Project Summary Multiplexed Ion Beam Imaging by Time of Flight (MIBI-TOF) uses secondary ion mass spectrometry and metal conjugated primary antibodies to simultaneously visualize dozens of proteins at subcellular resolution in a single tissue section. This technology is back compatible with archival formalin fixed, paraffin embedded tissue (FFPE) and has been used in peer-reviewed work to simultaneously visualize and quantify 36 proteins in retrospective human tissue cohorts. In line with the stated goals of the HuBMAP consortium to develop both “High-sensitivity, high-resolution imaging techniques that can rapidly provide spectral data over large areas of tissue” and “Quantitative imaging analysis tools, including automated 3D image segmentation, feature extraction, and image annotation,” the work outlined here will create a standardized, high throughput, and user-friendly workflow for using MIBI-TOF in basic and translational research to gain insight into how single cell phenotype and tissue structure are functionally-linked in health and disease. To achieve this, we will validate 100 FFPE antibodies and optimize ready-to-use multiplexed staining panels in lyophilized format that will permit storage for at least two years. Protocols and reagents for multiplexed signal amplification of protein and mRNA targets will be further refined, while next generation instrumentation will increase sample throughput to permit full tissue section imaging of up to 40 proteins in 1 hour. Standardized reagents and more robust instrumentation will be accompanied by an automated computational pipeline that utilizes a standard set of segmentation markers and machine learning to accurately identify nuclei and cell borders in any non-neural human tissue. This data will be used to cluster single cell events into functionally distinct populations according to morphology, protein expression, and histological distribution. The reagents and computational pipeline proposed here synergize with existing HuBMAP-funded platforms and could be readily generalized to virtually any high dimensional imaging modality. Thus, this work will not only provide a practical, back compatible imaging platform for high throughput multiplexed imaging, but will also accelerate development of other complimentary imaging technologies as well. Project Narrative Multiplexed ion beam imaging by time of flight (MIBI-TOF) is a new technology for visualizing dozens of proteins in standard clinical tissue biopsies at high resolution.

"Quantitative magnetic resonance imaging and automated textural radiomics for assessment of human placenta accreta spectrum PROJECT SUMMARY  Placenta Accreta Spectrum (PAS) disorder is a condition in which the placenta fails to separate partially or totally from the uterine wall, resulting in significant intrapartum maternal morbidity and mortality at delivery. Depending on the extent of the placental invasion into surrounding tissue, hysterectomy may be lifesaving. Assessment of PAS severity prior to delivery is crucial for multidisciplinary surgical planning and patient counseling. However, there is an unmet clinical need for quantitative, objective measures of abnormal placentation that can serve as predictors of risk of invasion and hysterectomy. The overall goal of the proposed project is to prospectively assess PAS in high-risk women across gestation using quantitative multi-parametric magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and automated textural radiomics and to correlate findings with surgical outcomes.  Coming from a highly interdisciplinary background of MR chemistry, biology, and physics, the candidate's long-term career goal is to become an independent investigator with in-depth knowledge and skills to conduct translational placental imaging research. The candidate's short-term goal is to complete a pilot study under the mentorship of an interdisciplinary advisory committee to evaluate PAS in women with high-risk pregnancies using multi-parametric MRI and textural radiomics.  To meet these goals, the following research aims are proposed: 1) Evaluate placental invasion across gestation using multi-parametric MR imaging and deep learning based novel quantification tools in PAS high- risk pregnancies, and 2) Extract the radiomic pattern across gestation of high-risk PAS placenta and determine its association with clinical surgical outcome. These research aims will serve as the platform for the career development plan and training aims which include: 1) Gain knowledge in translational prospective research design, 2) Improve technical skills in advanced clinical MR acquisition development, 3) Acquire applied statistical and data analysis skills, and 4) Develop mentorship and leadership skills while under training.  Together, the research and training aims will provide the training, experience and preliminary data for an R01 application. The future R01 will develop a clinical and surgical outcome prediction model for high-risk PAS pregnancies, potentially improving maternal and fetal outcomes. The training will position the candidate to become a leader in translational placental imaging research. PROJECT NARRATIVE After a woman has had a cesarean delivery, if the placenta implants on the surgical scar in a subsequent pregnancy, there is a risk for invasion, referred to as placenta accreta spectrum (PAS); depending on its severity, a cesarean hysterectomy may be required with significant morbidity. Imaging techniques such as magnetic resonance (MR) imaging have shown promise in defining characteristics that alert the obstetrician to the severity of PAS. We will explore the vascularity and tissue characteristics of the placenta with MRI and identify quantitative predictive markers of disease severity and hope to better understand the pathophysiology of placenta accreta spectrum.",Quantitative magnetic resonance imaging and automated textural radiomics for assessment of human placenta accreta spectrum,10105139,K25HD104004,"['Abnormal placentation', 'Advisory Committees', 'Affect', 'Anatomy', 'Biology', 'Blood Vessels', 'Cellularity', 'Cesarean section', 'Characteristics', 'Chemistry', 'Cicatrix', 'Clinical', 'Counseling', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnosis', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Exhibits', 'First Pregnancy Trimester', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Gestational Age', 'Goals', 'Hemorrhage', 'Heterogeneity', 'High Risk Woman', 'High-Risk Pregnancy', 'Human', 'Hysterectomy', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Implant', 'Knowledge', 'Leadership', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Maternal Mortality', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mentorship', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Motion', 'Nature', 'Noise', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perfusion', 'Perinatal', 'Physics', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Pilot Projects', 'Placenta', 'Placenta Accreta', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Pregnancy', 'Protocols documentation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Resolution', 'Respiration', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Severities', 'Severity of illness', 'Spin Labels', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'T2 weighted imaging', 'Technical Expertise', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Third Pregnancy Trimester', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Ultrasonography', 'Uterus', 'Visualization', 'Woman', 'Work', 'automated algorithm', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'experience', 'fetal', 'high risk', 'imaging modality', 'implantation', 'improved', 'interest', 'intrapartum', 'maternal morbidity', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'prospective', 'radiomics', 'recruit', 'skills', 'soft tissue', 'surgery outcome', 'tool']",NICHD,UT SOUTHWESTERN MEDICAL CENTER,K25,2020,114184,0.019225077636322294
"Improving Liver Ultrasound Image Quality in Difficult-to-Image Patients ABSTRACT The prevalence of obesity in the United States has risen to record levels over the past 40 years, putting strain on the healthcare system and creating difficult challenges for medical imaging. We propose to overcome the challenges that obesity poses to ultrasound imaging by (1) developing novel image-quality improvement techniques, and (2) implementing them on pulse-echo ultrasound imaging systems to yield high-quality images of the liver. Ultrasound imaging is uniquely affected by the presence of additional connective tissue and thick subcutaneous fat layers in overweight and obese patients; these additional subcutaneous layers greatly exacerbate reverberation and phase-aberration of the acoustic wave, leading to high levels of clutter, degraded resolution, and overall poor-quality ultrasound images. Our proposed methods will determine the local speed-of-sound in abdominal tissue layers and use this information to accomplish distributed phase-aberration correction. We also apply machine learning techniques to model and suppress the effects of reverberation clutter and speckle noise. The combination of these techniques is expected to achieve significant improvements in liver image quality. These image-quality improvement methods will be implemented on a real-time ultrasound scanner and will be evaluated in clinical imaging tasks of overweight and obese patients undergoing ultrasound surveillance of hepatocellular carcinoma. Successful development of the proposed technology will not only enable high-quality ultrasound imaging of the liver in otherwise difficult-to-image overweight and obese patients, but also facilitate improved image quality across nearly all ultrasound imaging applications, for all populations. NARRATIVE This proposal aims to develop and test several new techniques to overcome the current limitations of ultrasound to make high-quality images in overweight and obese individuals.

"Novel Platform for Quantitative Subcellular Resolution Imaging of Human Tissues Using Mass Spectrometry Novel Platform for Quantitative Subcellular Resolution Imaging of Human Tissues Using Mass Spectrometry Mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) is a powerful technique that enables label-free spatial mapping of different classes of biomolecules in biological systems. Because it does not require any special sample pretreatment, ambient MSI is particularly attractive for high throughput automated imaging applications. The throughput of ambient MSI experiments is typically limited by the inherently slow microprobe-type sampling from surfaces, which is a characteristic shortcoming of many chemical imaging modalities. This project will combine several highly innovative approaches to address challenges associated with the high-throughput high- resolution ambient MSI of lipids and metabolites using nanospray desorption electrospray ionization (nano-DESI). Nano-DESI is an ambient ionization technique, which relies on gentle localized liquid extraction of molecules from tissue sections into a flowing solvent confined between two glass capillaries. The extracted molecules are efficiently delivered to a mass spectrometer inlet and ionized by soft electrospray ionization. Nano-DESI MSI enables detection of hundreds of metabolites, lipids, and peptides in tissue sections with high sensitivity, high spatial resolution, and without special sample pretreatment. Furthermore, on-the-fly quantification of lipids and metabolites in tissue sections during nano-DESI imaging experiments is achieved by doping the working solvent with appropriate standards of known concentration. This project will extend these powerful capabilities of nano-DESI MSI to enable high-throughput imaging of large tissue sections of interest to the HubMAP Consortium. This will be achieved using a combination of a conceptually different nano-DESI probe design optimized for robustness, ease of fabrication, and spatial resolution and a suite of advanced machine learning and compressed sensing computational approaches. These developments will be applicable to different types of human tissues and will transform quantitative molecular imaging of multiple classes of biomolecules in tissue sections. Although the capabilities of the new imaging platform will be demonstrated using non-diseased tissue, these developments will be broadly applicable to scientific problems associated with understanding health and disease Project Narrative This research is focused on the development of a transformative technology for rapid, quantitative, and robust imaging of different classes of biomolecules in human tissues using mass spectrometry.

"8th International CEST workshop (CEST2020) Project Summary/Abstract The 8th International Workshop of chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST) MRI in November 2020 (CEST2020) brings together an international community of experts in CEST imaging. CEST MRI has gained tremendous interest from the research community, and many leading institutions have joined forces to optimize CEST MRI and develop new applications in a host of diseases including acute stroke, epilepsy, and, most importantly, tumor imaging. Recently, machine learning and neuron networks have been explored for CEST imaging. The CEST 2020 forges research and learning opportunities for students and young researchers in a dedicated forum unmatched by other meetings. CEST 2020 is being organized by Phillip Zhe Sun, Ph.D. (Emory University), in conjunction with the CEST Workshop steering committee of well- established scholars in the CEST MRI field. It will run November 8-11, 2020, at the Emory Conference Center Hotel located on the Emory University campus in Atlanta, Georgia. The goal is to bring together researchers from varying backgrounds and clinicians from related disciplines and to provide a forum for communication among these multi-disciplinary groups. The workshop will feature a blend of plenary sessions, invited scientific presentations, manuscripts, poster presentations, and panel discussions. The meeting will provide all participants the opportunity to present and learn emerging applications of CEST imaging. Emory University researchers have contributed to the development of the CEST MRI field, from the theory, experimental optimization, and quantification. Members well established in the CEST MRI field including Dr. Peter van Zijl, Dr. Dean Sherry, Dr. John Gore, Dr. Marty Pagel, and Dr. Reddy Ravinder, will attend and present their work. This creates an outstanding intellectual enrichment opportunity not just for well-established investigators but also for students, postdocs and junior faculty as they enter into this exciting field of MRI research. The primary goal is to create opportunities and offer supportive mentoring at this formative stage in the trainee's career to enhance their research potential and the likelihood of success. We will have two plenary sessions, two poster sessions, and two power pitch sessions, in which the goal is to share the state of the art CEST research and engage newcomers to the field. Also, we will select 3-4 oral presentations for each scientific session from submitted abstracts to promote the rising stars in the field and provide our feedback on their work, strength, and, most importantly, areas to improve. This grant will support students, postdocs and junior faculty to participate in the CEST2020 Workshop.

"A New J-Resolved MRSI Framework for Whole-Brain Simultaneous Metabolite and Neurotransmitter Mapping PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The metabolite and neurotransmitter profiles of neural tissues provide a unique window into brain’s physiological state and can be used to extract potential biomarkers for detecting and characterizing neurodegenerative diseases. Magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) allows simultaneous mapping and quantification of a number of metabolites and neurotransmitters without exogenous contrast agents thus promised tremendous opportunities for molecular imaging of the brain. However, due to several fundamental technical challenges, including low SNR, poor spatial resolution, long imaging time and inaccurate separation of spectrally overlapping molecular signals, most in vivo MRSI studies to date are still limited to very low-resolution experiments (~1cm3 voxel size) with small brain coverages. The primary goal of this proposed research is to develop, optimize and evaluate a new framework to model, acquire and process MRSI data to enable simultaneous, high-resolution, whole- brain mapping of metabolites and neurotransmitters in clinically feasible time. To achieve this goal, in Aim 1, we will design and implement a novel acquisition strategy that synergistically combines SNR- efficient, multi-slab and multi-TE excitation, sparse sampling in a (k,t,TE)-space and optimized TE selection with maximum echo sampling to generate J-resolved (multi-TE) MRSI data with an unprecedented combination of speed, resolution and organ coverage. In Aim 2, we will develop novel nonlinear low-dimensional models of general MR spectra using a learning-based strategy that integrates the biochemical priors of neural tissues, known physics-based MRSI signal modeling and deep neural networks. These learned models will effectively reduce the dimensionality of the imaging problem and allow for significantly improved speed, resolution and SNR tradeoffs as well as signal separation. Novel computational solutions that effectively exploit the learned models and other spatial-spectral-TE constraints will be developed for spatiospectral reconstruction of metabolites and neurotransmitters from the noisy, high-resolution J-resolved MRSI data. Finally, in Aim 3, we will systematically evaluate the proposed technology in terms of speed, resolution, SNR, and quantitative accuracy using computer simulations, phantom and in vivo experiments. The feasibility and robustness of the proposed technology for mapping metabolites and neurotransmitters in both healthy volunteers and temporal lobe epilepsy patients with mesial temporal sclerosis will be demonstrated. The success of the proposed research will lead to significant progress for in vivo MRSI and represent an important step towards the creation of a powerful tool for studying the molecular basis of brain functions and diseases. This tool, when fully developed, will add a transformative dimension to the existing neuroimaging technology profiles, with the potential to impact the diagnosis and management of neurological and neurodegenerative diseases. PROJECT NARRATIVE Magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) is a potentially powerful modality that allows simultaneous mapping of a number of metabolites and neurotransmitters noninvasively, which provide a unique window into brain’s physiological states and can be used to extract biomarkers for detecting and characterizing neurodegenerative diseases. However, the current MRSI techniques do not provide the desired combination of resolution, imaging speed and organ coverage for many basic science and clinical applications. The proposed research will develop a new rapid, J-resolved MRSI technology to enable high-resolution, whole-brain mapping of metabolites and neurotransmitters in clinically feasible time, which, if successful, will lead to significant progress for the field of MRSI and an important step towards the creation of a powerful tool for studying the molecular basis of brain functions and diseases.",A New J-Resolved MRSI Framework for Whole-Brain Simultaneous Metabolite and Neurotransmitter Mapping,10057847,R21EB029076,"['Address', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Basic Science', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain Mapping', 'Brain imaging', 'Clinical', 'Computer Simulation', 'Contrast Media', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Equation', 'Evaluation', 'Evolution', 'Experimental Designs', 'Foundations', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Imaging problem', 'Imaging technology', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mechanics', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurologic', 'Neurotransmitters', 'Noise', 'Organ', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Physics', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Physiological', 'Physiological Processes', 'Process', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Scheme', 'Scientist', 'Sclerosis', 'Signal Transduction', 'Software Tools', 'Solid', 'Spectrum Analysis', 'Speed', 'Technology', 'Temporal Lobe Epilepsy', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Water', 'base', 'clinical application', 'clinical translation', 'computerized data processing', 'deep neural network', 'design', 'experimental study', 'healthy volunteer', 'high dimensionality', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'interest', 'magnetic field', 'magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging', 'molecular imaging', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'patient population', 'potential biomarker', 'quantum', 'reconstruction', 'relating to nervous system', 'simulation', 'spectroscopic imaging', 'success', 'tool']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT URBANA-CHAMPAIGN,R21,2020,565546,0.0027435842068591777
"High-definition, wide field of view corneal imaging The cornea is the primary focusing structure of our visual system. Infections and diseases in the tissue can impair vision and lead to blindness, even in eyes with intact neurosensory function. Corneal disease is one of the leading causes of visual deficiency and blindness in the world. Tissue evaluation is an important step for assessing the health of the donor cornea and its appropriateness for different types of placement, yet this process suffers from high subjectivity. High-definition corneal imaging is needed to assist in selection of the most appropriate tissue for transplant. Progress on this front would greatly serve public need, as the cornea is the most commonly transplanted tissue worldwide, with nearly 185,000 transplants annually. Thus, a more sensitive and quantitative method for objective evaluation of tissue at eye banks is needed. We have developed a 3D high-definition imaging instrument based on Gabor-Domain Optical Coherence Microscopy (GDOCM). Our SBIR Phase I research successfully accomplished all Aims and demonstrated the feasibility of quantitative assessment of corneal tissue over a large field of view with GDOCM. Our Phase I results demonstrated that GDOCM has the following key advantages over existing corneal imaging techniques, which include specular and confocal microscopy: 1) improved accuracy of tissue qualification with 4-10x increase in field of view that reduces sampling error – this will provides a truer assessment of the overall tissue characteristics; 2) ability to simultaneously measure corneal thickness, quantify endothelial cell density, and identify morphological variations due to corneal disease – this will lead to complete corneal evaluation in a single instrument; 3) leveraging machine learning innovations to minimize variability induced by users – this will result in a more objective evaluation; 4) enhanced 3D cellular-level imaging of thin translucent endothelial cells – this will enable a detailed understanding of cell viability. The results of the proposed Phase studies II will demonstrate that GDOCM can provide high-definition, 3D visualization of corneal structures with immediate commercial application for qualification of donor tissue in eye banks, and with a path to in vivo clinical imaging of patients with corneal disease. Current corneal evaluation methods employed at eye banks have limited field of view and/or insufficient resolution, and their results suffer from high subjectivity.

"Structural and functional tests of ganglion cell damage in glaucoma This project will use a combination of structural and functional measurements to test the hypothesis that early- stage damage in human glaucoma occurs first in the inner plexiform layer (IPL) of the retina – especially its OFF sub-lamina – as suggested by murine glaucoma models. In the first Aim, we will use a novel visible-light optical coherence tomograph (VIS OCT) to study structural changes in the retina of glaucoma patients. The newly developed VIS OCT has sufficient image contrast and resolution to segment the IPL boundaries and to define sub-lamination in volumetric OCT data, something not currently possible with existing near-infrared OCT instruments. We will make comparative measurements within the IPL and between the IPL, the ganglion cell layer (GCL) and the retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL). Because data from mouse models of glaucoma suggests that early damage occurs preferentially within the OFF sub-lamina of the IPL, we will make separate VIS OCT measurements biased for the OFF- and ON-sublaminae of the IPL and use machine learning approaches to determine whether a similar damage process can be demonstrated in human. To test whether OFF-pathway function is preferentially lost in glaucoma, we will use a novel Steady-State Visual Evoked Potential (SSVEP) paradigm that employs sawtooth increments and decrements to bias the measurement to ON vs OFF pathways, respectively, a paradigm our data suggests discriminates glaucoma from control patients. The second Aim will optimize this SSVEP measurement for testing localized areas of the visual field. The third Aim will make comparative measurements of visual-field, VIS OCT and SSVEP loss patterns in a large sample of glaucoma patients and in age- and sex-matched controls. Thickness and interface reflectivity amplitude maps derived from VIS OCT imaging of the RNFL, GCL and IPL including sublaminae will be correlated topographically with visual field defects to assess the relative sensitivity of our structural biomarkers at and near visual field locations with demonstrable losses on conventional (Humphrey) perimetry. Similarly, SSVEP responses from different locations in the visual field will be correlated topographically with visual field loss patterns and to VIS OCT losses, with special emphasis on correlating structural damage in OFF vs ON sub-laminae of the IPL with the functional correlates derived from regional decremental and incremental SSVEPs. Separately and in combination, our structural and functional measurements are designed to provide strong tests of the biological hypothesis that the OFF pathway is preferentially damaged in human glaucoma, and to reveal new biomarkers for the disease. Improving visual outcomes in glaucoma will require a better understanding of the earliest sites and processes of damage and methods to measure them quickly and accurately in patients. This project will address both needs through a combination of novel Optical Coherence Tomography and electrophysiological measurements. The new imaging and electrophysiological tests that will be developed here, either separately or together, could eventually replace conventional visual field testing which is time-consuming and unreliable.",Structural and functional tests of ganglion cell damage in glaucoma,9913546,R01EY030361,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Animal Model', 'Area', 'Atrophic', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Testing', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Economic Burden', 'Electrodes', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Elements', 'Frequencies', 'Ganglion Cell Layer', 'Glaucoma', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Human', 'Image', 'Inner Plexiform Layer', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Mus', 'Noise', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Optics', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perimetry', 'Process', 'Property', 'Resolution', 'Retina', 'Retinal Ganglion Cells', 'Rodent Model', 'Sampling', 'Scotoma', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'Speed', 'Structural defect', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Visible Radiation', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'Visual Fields', 'Visual evoked cortical potential', 'base', 'cell injury', 'comparative', 'contrast imaging', 'design', 'extrastriate visual cortex', 'field study', 'ganglion cell', 'improved', 'instrument', 'mouse model', 'novel', 'optic nerve disorder', 'response', 'retinal imaging', 'retinal nerve fiber layer', 'sex']",NEI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,521102,0.05246616808883982
"Development of Methods for a Simplified and Reliable Prostate Cancer MRI Exam Abstract Non-invasive, multi-parametric characterization of prostate cancer (PC), with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) methods, is an active area of research with great potential for providing improved diagnosis and treatment monitoring. The PI-RADSv2 assessment system that was established by an international team of experts recognizes the value of quantitative images in PC diagnosis, but relies largely on qualitative evaluation of weighted images. Although this grading approach achieves reasonably good separation be- tween normal and abnormal prostate tissue, it does not achieve adequate separation between indolent and aggressive disease, with the risk that more unnecessary and costly surgery is performed with poten- tially dire consequences on patient quality of life. High-value protocols, without need for an invasive and costly endo-rectal radio-frequency coil are being investigated. This comes at the cost of extended scan time and reduced image quality in terms of spatial resolution, signal-to-noise ratio and signal bias, which negatively impacts sensitivity and speciﬁcity of multi-parametric MRI. With the pronounced increase of multi-parametric MRI exams, there is also the desire to integrate the support by the most recent revolution in diagnostic imaging, i.e., machine learning. It becomes increasingly clear, that in order to avoid having to train neural networks for each speciﬁc system and protocol, reproducible and thus preferably quantitative imaging protocols are essential. To overcome these limitations, we propose both pulse sequence develop- ment, investigation of ADC validity and reproducibility and novel post-processing strategies. The overall objective is to demonstrate the added value of lesion characterization with quantitative values and at the same time understand and minimize the inﬂuence of protocol choices and scan hardware, hence improve overall reproducibility. Speciﬁc Aim 1 will focus on the development of a low distortion MR imaging sequence for rapid concurrent quantiﬁcation of T2 and diﬀusion signal decay. Speciﬁc Aim 2 will examine ADC variations that result from changes in diﬀusion time over a range that is typical with present day clinical MR systems. Speciﬁc Aim 3 introduces advanced handling of low noise diﬀusion data, which will be indispensable for achieving high accuracy and precision with non-invasive and economic external coils. Speciﬁc Aim 4 introduces a novel ADC computation approach that fully captures the complex diﬀusion signal decays in tissues and at the same time is largely protocol and system independent. Moreover, re- sulting images and quantitative maps processed according this approach, exhibit considerably lower noise, which can be traded for higher spatial resolution or shorter scan duration. In combination, the consis- tently quantitative nature of the data and its ubiquitous validity and comparability will greatly facilitate the establishment of recommendations for disease-related thresholds. Ultimately this may permit much more reliable diﬀerentiation of aggressive from indolent disease. Project Narrative Magnetic resonance imaging plays an important role for staging of prostate cancer. We propose advances that permit quantitative and a more reliable assessment of prostate cancer. Potentially this will permit better diﬀerentiation of disease that is aggressive from disease that poses low risk of spreading.",Development of Methods for a Simplified and Reliable Prostate Cancer MRI Exam,9973564,R01CA241817,"['Architecture', 'Area', 'Biological Markers', 'Biopsy', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Consequentialism', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Economics', 'Enrollment', 'Exhibits', 'Fingerprint', 'Image', 'Indolent', 'International', 'Investigation', 'Joints', 'Lesion', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Microscopic', 'Monitor', 'Nature', 'Noise', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Play', 'Process', 'Prostate', 'Protocols documentation', 'Qualitative Evaluations', 'Quality of life', 'Radical Prostatectomy', 'Recommendation', 'Relaxation', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Signal Transduction', 'Staging', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Tweens', 'Variant', 'Weight', 'cancer diagnosis', 'contrast imaging', 'cost', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'magnetic field', 'method development', 'neural network', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'quantitative imaging', 'radio frequency', 'rectal']",NCI,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2020,454234,0.009231886325282391
"In vivo Macroscopic Fluorescence Lifetime Molecular Optical Imaging In vivo Macroscopic Fluorescence Lifetime Molecular Optical Imaging ABSTRACT There is still great need in better characterizing new targeted therapies in vivo, especially prior to clinical translation. In this regard, preclinical molecular imaging is a central tool in the targeted drug development pipeline. However, there is still a lack of integrated imaging platforms that can enable longitudinal (multiple time points) and spatially-resolved monitoring of complex fingerprints including molecular, metabolic and functional signatures in the same tumor/subject. This new integrated multiplexing imaging platform will play a crucial role in the development of the next generation of targeted drugs and elucidating (multi-) drug resistance mechanisms. Recently, we have demonstrated the unique capabilities of optical imaging in quantifying receptor-target engagement in live subjects by leveraging fluorescence lifetime. This outstanding achievement was realized thanks to the combination of instrumental, algorithmic and biochemical innovations to enable, for the first time, whole-body time-resolved optical imaging based on structured light for 2D or 3D Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) imaging in live subjects. Herein, we will further impact the field of optical preclinical imaging and drug delivery assessment by 1) integrating a cutting-edge high-resolution, time-resolved SPAD array imager for improved photon collection efficiency, spatial resolution, and portability; 2) we will harness the latest developments in Deep Learning (DL) for ultra-fast, quantitative, but fitting/iterative inverse solver-free image formation, in both 2D and 3D providing image formation/processing solutions to facilitate multiplexed imaging; 3) we will implement new functionalities in our imaging platform to enable the concurrent longitudinal imaging of multiple clinically relevant target-receptor interactions (e.g. HER receptor family members involved in many cancers) as well as metabolic and functional status across the whole-tumor region in live intact animals. NARRATIVE Following an ever increased focus on personalized medicine, there is a continuing need to develop preclinical molecular imaging modalities to guide the development and optimization of targeted therapies. This research program will combine novel time-resolved cameras as well as deep learning techniques to broaden the impact of macroscopic lifetime imaging with the overarching goal to facilitate multiplexed imaging for a comprehensive assessment of cellular delivery efficacy of multiple clinically relevant drugs (e.g. HER receptor family members involved in many cancers) as well as drug response via metabolic and functional status across the whole-tumor region in live intact animals.",In vivo Macroscopic Fluorescence Lifetime Molecular Optical Imaging,9997447,R01CA250636,"['3-Dimensional', 'Achievement', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Biochemical', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Blood Vessels', 'Cancer Biology', 'Cells', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Drug Delivery Systems', 'Drug Targeting', 'ERBB2 gene', 'Electronics', 'Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor', 'Family member', 'Fingerprint', 'Fluorescence', 'Fluorescence Microscopy', 'Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer', 'Foundations', 'Functional Imaging', 'Goals', 'Hemoglobin', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image-Guided Surgery', 'Imaging ligands', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Light', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammary Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Probes', 'Molecular Target', 'Monitor', 'Multi-Drug Resistance', 'Optical Tomography', 'Optics', 'Oxygen', 'Penetration', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Photons', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Reporter Genes', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Side', 'Signal Transduction', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'base', 'bioimaging', 'clinical translation', 'clinically relevant', 'cost effective', 'deep learning', 'design', 'detector', 'drug development', 'drug efficacy', 'fluorescence lifetime imaging', 'functional status', 'imager', 'imaging agent', 'imaging modality', 'imaging platform', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'metabolic imaging', 'molecular imaging', 'multiplexed imaging', 'new technology', 'new therapeutic target', 'next generation', 'novel', 'optical imaging', 'personalized medicine', 'portability', 'pre-clinical', 'preclinical imaging', 'preclinical study', 'programs', 'quantitative imaging', 'receptor', 'resistance mechanism', 'response', 'serial imaging', 'targeted treatment', 'technological innovation', 'tomography', 'tool', 'treatment response', 'tumor', 'tumor xenograft', 'user-friendly']",NCI,RENSSELAER POLYTECHNIC INSTITUTE,R01,2020,637634,0.027916291292126787
"Development of Sodium Fluoride PET-MRI for Quantitative Assessment of Knee Osteoarthritis Project Summary Osteoarthritis (OA) is the leading cause of disability worldwide. The inability of non-invasive techniques to quantify disease progression has limited understanding of the pathogenesis of OA. While numerous magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) methods have been proposed for imaging OA, sensitivity to bone metabolism has been limited. We propose to develop advanced three-dimensional PET-MRI methods for bone and soft tissue metabolism to study the response of the tissues in the joint to changes in knee load. This work will lead to a new understanding of OA pathogenesis by revealing relationships between changes in cartilage and bone metabolism over time. This project aims to develop PET-MRI methods to sensitively track changes of OA in response to biomechanical loading. Our specific aims are to (1) Develop accurate, reproducible and dose-optimized kinetic models of dynamic 18F-NaF PET-MRI for quantitative bilateral whole joint imaging using deep learning and advanced MR coil technology, (2) Study the relationship between resting state bone metabolism and biomechanics using PET- MRI and (3) Perform a longitudinal study to assess the response of our new imaging methods to changes in joint biomechanics from gait retraining. The innovation of this work lies in the development of novel imaging techniques that simultaneously offer quantitative measures of tissue physiology in cartilage and bone using PET-MRI. The significance of this work is that we will be able to sensitively and quantitatively track changes in bone metabolism and soft tissue microstructure due to changes in biomechanical loading in the knee joint over time. This will provide new and more sensitive imaging tools to assess the responses of the joint to biomechanical interventions to treat OA such as gait retraining, bracing, or high tibial osteotomy. Narrative Osteoarthritis affects more than half of the population during their lives and is the leading cause of disability worldwide. Diagnostic imaging of osteoarthritis is often limited to x-ray, but more sensitive and specific imaging is a critical need for assessment of disease-modifying treatments such as bracing or gait modification. This work aims to develop novel 3D imaging approaches using positron-emission tomography (PET) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), to quantitatively assess joint health during mechanical treatment of osteoarthritis. !",Development of Sodium Fluoride PET-MRI for Quantitative Assessment of Knee Osteoarthritis,9997783,R01AR074492,"['3-Dimensional', 'Affect', 'Anatomy', 'Architecture', 'Arthralgia', 'Bilateral', 'Biochemical', 'Biomechanics', 'Bone Matrix', 'Bone Spur', 'Bone Tissue', 'Bone remodeling', 'Canes', 'Cartilage', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Degenerative polyarthritis', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Dose', 'Environment', 'Extracellular Matrix', 'Fluoride Ion', 'Future', 'Gait', 'Health', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Imaging Device', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Imaging technology', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Knee', 'Knee Osteoarthritis', 'Knee joint', 'Lateral', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Medial', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Morphology', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Needs Assessment', 'Orthopedics', 'Osteotomy', 'Pain', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Perfusion', 'Photons', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Process', 'Productivity', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quality of life', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Risk Factors', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Sclerosis', 'Severities', 'Shapes', 'Societies', 'Sodium Fluoride', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Tracer', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Work', 'analysis pipeline', 'attenuation', 'base', 'bone', 'bone metabolism', 'cartilage metabolism', 'clinical translation', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'disability', 'flexibility', 'gait examination', 'gait rehabilitation', 'imaging approach', 'imaging capabilities', 'imaging modality', 'imaging system', 'improved', 'innovation', 'joint loading', 'kinetic model', 'mechanical force', 'mechanical properties', 'mineralization', 'molecular marker', 'non-invasive imaging', 'novel', 'novel imaging technique', 'pharmacokinetic model', 'quantitative imaging', 'radiotracer', 'response', 'soft tissue', 'subchondral bone', 'tool', 'treatment strategy', 'uptake']",NIAMS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,435694,0.016813903531840983
"Noninvasive assessment of the cornea by diffusion OCT Keratoconus is a degenerative disease of the cornea that is a major cause of reduced vision-related quality of life in the United States, often leading to corneal transplantation. Ectasia after refractive surgery is a vision-threatening complication that can occur in apparently low-risk patients despite current screening technology. The biomechanical properties of the cornea play a central role in these diseases, but diagnostics are still rooted in shape measures because doctors lack direct measures of biomechanical change. While several methods have shown early promise for addressing this gap, most require contact with or perturbation of the cornea, cannot spatially resolve biomechanical properties, or involve expensive optical systems.  To address the need for direct biomechanical measurement of the cornea and the limitations of other approaches, we introduce phase-decorrelation OCT (phd-OCT). Phd-OCT makes use optical coherence tomography (OCT) to quantify random nanoscale mobility that is related to the strength and cohesion of the cornea. Preliminary results strongly support the rationale, feasibility and potential advantages of the approach. Our objectives are: (1) to refine our method to optimize detection sensitivity and speed, and (2) to determine if the technique is clinically useful. We will achieve these objectives through the following aims: 1. To develop and validate mobility-sensitive phd-OCT for corneal imaging. Spectral-domain OCT will be used for anterior segment phase-decorrelation imaging and the analysis algorithm will be optimized. The system will be validated using phantoms and torsional rheometry. 2. To investigate the potential influence of physiological factors (intraocular pressure (IOP), hydration, and temperature). Factorial design experiments in porcine and human donor globes will establish the sensitivity of phd-OCT measurements to potential confounders. 3. To develop and validate data acquisition and processing methods to enable clinical testing. GPU processing and machine learning will be configured to minimize processing time. Scan patterns will be optimized to minimize scan time and return clinically useful data. 4. To assess feasibility and preliminary diagnostic performance of clinical mobility-sensitive OCT imaging of the cornea. A first-in-human study will characterize repeatability and test the hypotheses that phd-OCT mobility measurements are increased in the region of a LASIK flap and decreased in CXL.  Expected Outcomes: The proposed studies will establish a new, non-contact method for imaging corneal biomechanical properties with the potential to address many shortcomings of current and emerging methods. Success could lead to earlier detection of of ectasia risk and allow more appropriate timing and customization of corneal treatments. Future integration of data into computational models has the potential to greatly impact the field by driving a shift from empirical planning and risk analysis to patient-specific strategies. The mechanical properties of the cornea, the transparent front of the eye, are important for diseases that affect vision as well as for corrective treatments like crosslinking therapy and LASIK. We have developed a new optical coherence tomography (OCT)-based method to detect and map corneal mechanical properties that has advantages that may make it readily translatable to clinical use. The objective of this proposal is to determine whether this technique is clinically feasible and useful by refining the technology, testing it in animal and human donor corneas, and performing studies in patients with corneal conditions of interest.",Noninvasive assessment of the cornea by diffusion OCT,9942461,R01EY028667,"['Achievement', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Anterior', 'Automobile Driving', 'Biomechanics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Complication', 'Computational Technique', 'Computer Models', 'Cornea', 'Corneal Diseases', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Degenerative Disorder', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffusion', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Ensure', 'Exhibits', 'Eye', 'Family suidae', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Human', 'Hydration status', 'Image', 'Keratoconus', 'Keratoplasty', 'Laser In Situ Keratomileusis', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Optics', 'Outcome', 'Pathological Dilatation', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physiologic Intraocular Pressure', 'Physiological', 'Plant Roots', 'Play', 'Procedures', 'Property', 'Proxy', 'Quality of life', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Shapes', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'Surgical Flaps', 'Surgical incisions', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Temperature', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Torsion', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Vision', 'Visual impairment', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'cohesion', 'computerized data processing', 'crosslink', 'data acquisition', 'data integration', 'design', 'experimental study', 'first-in-human', 'human study', 'imaging modality', 'interest', 'mechanical properties', 'nanoscale', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'research clinical testing', 'screening', 'simulation', 'success', 'tool', 'treatment effect']",NEI,CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,391938,0.016940039139924527
"Simultaneous coaxial widefield imaging and reflectance confocal microscopy for improved diagnosis of skin cancers in vivo 1 Dermatologists rely on visual (clinical widefield) and dermoscopic examination of skin lesions to guide the need  2 for biopsy. With this approach, sensitivity is high, but specificity tends to be quite variable and lower, resulting  3 in millions of biopsies of benign lesions every year. To improve specificity, several optical technologies are  4 being developed to noninvasively detect skin cancer. Of these, reflectance confocal microscopy (RCM) is the  5 furthest advanced in clinical utility, proven for diagnosing skin cancers with high sensitivity and specificity.  6 RCM imaging, guided by dermoscopy, detects skin cancers with 2 times superior specificity, and reduces the  7 benign-to-malignant biopsy rate by 2 times, compared to that with dermoscopy alone. In 2016, the Centers for  8 Medicare and Medicaid Services granted current procedural terminology (CPT) reimbursement codes for RCM  9 imaging of skin. RCM imaging combined with dermoscopy is now advancing into clinical practice, sparing pa- 10 tients from unnecessary biopsies of benign lesions. However, toward widespread acceptance and adoption, a 11 key challenge is that clinical widefield examination, dermoscopy and RCM imaging are currently performed as 12 three separate procedures with separate devices. Clinicians do not precisely know the location of RCM imag- 13 es relative to the surrounding contextual lesion morphology that is seen with clinical widefield examination and 14 dermoscopy, resulting in lower and more variable diagnostic accuracy (particularly, sensitivity, positive and 15 negative predictive values). We propose a novel solution: (i) a new objective lens with an integrated micro- 16 camera, to deliver a concurrent widefield image of the skin surface surrounding the location of RCM imaging; 17 (ii) a new software algorithm for widefield image-based tracking of the location of RCM images within a dermoscopic 18 field of view; (iii) a new diagnostic approach that will proactively use widefield imaging to locate RCM images in 19 dermoscopic images. We intend to deliver this integrated widefield clinical, dermoscopic and RCM imaging ap- 20 proach into the clinic, toward a new standard for more accurate, consistent and faster RCM imaging to guide 21 patient care. Preliminary studies with a “mock” objective lens and micro-camera on a bench-top set-up 22 demonstrated excellent optical sectioning (~2 µm) and resolution (~1 µm) for RCM imaging, and accurate and 23 repeatable location of RCM fields-of-view within the widefield image. RCM images showed excellent cellular 24 and morphologic detail in vivo. Our specific aims are (1) to develop a handheld reflectance confocal micro- 25 scope with integrated widefield camera; (2) to develop image processing algorithms for real-time widefield im- 26 aging-guided tracking of RCM image locations within dermoscopic fields; (3) to test and validate performance 27 on 100 patients. Although our proposition is for skin lesions, the research will surely have wider impact for 28 imaging in other settings, particularly, with miniaturized confocal microscopes and endoscopes, which have 29 very small fields-of-view. We are a highly synergistic team from Montana State University, Memorial Sloan 30 Kettering Cancer Center, Northeastern University and Caliber Imaging and Diagnostics (formerly, Lucid Inc.). RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH Clinical examination and dermoscopy combined with reflectance confocal microscopy (RCM) imaging is a newly emerging optical imaging procedure that can noninvasively guide diagnosis of skin cancers, and reduce the need for biopsy. However, clinical examination, dermoscopy and RCM imaging are currently performed as three separate procedures with separate devices, limiting effectiveness and impact. We propose a device to combine the three into a single procedure, which will help dermatologists and patients by making the skin examinations quicker, more accurate and more consistent, expanding the impact of this proven approach.",Simultaneous coaxial widefield imaging and reflectance confocal microscopy for improved diagnosis of skin cancers in vivo,9860776,R01EB028752,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Affordable Care Act', 'Aging', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Benign', 'Biopsy', 'Caliber', 'Cancer Center', 'Categories', 'Cellular Morphology', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Current Procedural Terminology', 'Dermatologist', 'Dermatology', 'Dermis', 'Dermoscopy', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Drops', 'Effectiveness', 'Endoscopes', 'Engineering', 'Epidermis', 'Grant', 'Head and neck structure', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Lesion', 'Lesion by Morphology', 'Letters', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medicaid services', 'Medicare/Medicaid', 'Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center', 'Microscope', 'Microscopic', 'Montana', 'Morphology', 'Optics', 'Oral', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Predictive Value', 'Procedures', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Site', 'Skin', 'Skin Cancer', 'Specificity', 'Surface', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services', 'Universities', 'Visual', 'base', 'blind', 'cancer diagnosis', 'clinical examination', 'clinical practice', 'cost', 'design', 'design and construction', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'gastrointestinal', 'image guided', 'image processing', 'image registration', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'instrumentation', 'interest', 'lens', 'medical specialties', 'microscopic imaging', 'miniaturize', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'optical imaging', 'prospective test', 'reflectance confocal microscopy', 'response', 'routine practice', 'skin lesion', 'volunteer']",NIBIB,MONTANA STATE UNIVERSITY - BOZEMAN,R01,2020,649717,0.003545794016028806
"Enabling Kinematic Joint Profiling Using MRI Project Summary We propose a technical feasibility study seeking to develop methods for quantitative kinematic proﬁling of moving joints using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). In the context of this study, a kinematic proﬁle is deﬁned as a collection of joint characteristics computed and tracked during the course of movement. This project is motivated by the hypothesis that such proﬁling of moving joints can highlight dysfunction, treatment progress, and point towards favorable (or unfavorable) surgical interventions. At a high level, it is envisioned that the proposed kinematic proﬁles could ﬁt into clinical management workﬂows much in the same way as blood biomarker panels.  While kinematic imaging of joints can be performed using plain-ﬁlm (PF) X-ray, computed tomography (CT), and ultrasound (US) methods, MRI is the gold-standard for advanced orthopedic assessment and is an appealing option for accessory kinematic analysis. A set of relatively fast kinematic proﬁling acquisitions could feasibly be added to routine orthopedic MRI exams, thereby providing optimal diagnostic imaging in both static and kinematic contexts within a single visit.  Though several preliminary studies have hinted at the potential diagnostic value of kinematic imaging data, such data is difﬁcult to interpret and cannot easily be quantiﬁed or captured in clinical records. In this study, we seek to establish fundamental methods that can provide simple and easily digestible kinematic imaging reports with data acquired in a short scan interval using conventional clinical MRI equipment.  As a preliminary feasibility investigation of these methods, kinematic imaging of the wrist will be studied. Dysfunction of the scaphoid and lunate bones in the wrist is a well-studied kinematic problem of diagnostic signiﬁcance. Novel 4D zero-echo-time MRI of the wrist will be used to capture the kinematic imaging using for proﬁling of the scaphoid-lunate mechanics during two established wrist movement patterns.  The goal of this project is to establish and demonstrate methodological components required for MRI kinematic proﬁling. Data collection on a modest-sized cohort of 100 healthy control subjects is proposed for this purpose. Novel MRI pulse-sequence and post-processing development components are introduced and tasked for analysis of this normative data. Using the acquired MRI data, kinematic parameters for each dynamic dataset will be extracted and curated into a multi-parametric proﬁle for each subject.  Aim 2 of the study proposes the use of external sensor motion capture methods to validate the MRI-based kinematic parameter measurements on 50% of the study cohort.  Finally, Aim 3 of the study seeks to use machine-learning clustering approaches to develop a kinematic proﬁle normalization procedure using the acquired control dataset. Such normalization is a crucial milestone in the translation of kinematic proﬁling to the clinic and will establish a baseline for future translational studies of symptomatic cohorts. Project Narrative We seek to develop and demonstrate fundamental methods in quantitative kinematic proﬁling using clinical diagnostic imaging equipment. This technical development project is constructed under the hypothesis that such proﬁling of moving joints can highlight dysfunction, treatment progress, and point towards favorable (or unfavorable) surgical interventions. Using currently available advanced magnetic resonance imaging technology, data collected from a controlled subject cohort will be used to develop and test the proposed kinematic proﬁling technology on the moving wrist.",Enabling Kinematic Joint Profiling Using MRI,9893679,R21AR075327,"['3-Dimensional', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Biological Process', 'Biomechanics', 'Blood', 'Blood flow', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cartilage', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Cohort Studies', 'Collection', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Disease', 'Equipment', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Film', 'Functional Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Hand', 'Image', 'Imaging technology', 'Investigation', 'Joints', 'Ligaments', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Morphology', 'Motion', 'Movement', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Orthopedics', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Physiological', 'Population Control', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Resolution', 'Rest', 'Rewards', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Scanning', 'Scaphoid bone', 'Semilunar Bone', 'Series', 'Structure', 'Surgeon', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Ultrasonography', 'Upper Extremity', 'Visit', 'Work', 'Wrist', 'Wrist joint', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'biomarker panel', 'blood perfusion', 'bone', 'clinical diagnostics', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'heart function', 'high resolution imaging', 'human subject', 'image registration', 'imaging Segmentation', 'imaging modality', 'interest', 'joint mobilization', 'kinematics', 'motion sensor', 'novel', 'radiologist', 'soft tissue', 'task analysis', 'tool', 'translational study', 'volunteer', 'water diffusion']",NIAMS,MEDICAL COLLEGE OF WISCONSIN,R21,2020,214720,0.03360190498760196
"Assessment of ultrasound features of knee osteoarthritis in a population-based community cohort Project summary Our long-term goal is to demonstrate the utility of ultrasound for OA assessment, standardize its acquisition and scoring, and promote increased uptake of US for use in clinical, research, and trial settings. Knee osteoarthritis (KOA) is highly prevalent and frequently debilitating. Development of potential treatments has been hampered by the heterogenous nature of this common chronic condition, which is characterized by a number of subgroups, or phenotypes, with different underlying pathophysiological mechanisms. Imaging, genetics, biochemical biomarkers, and other features can be used to characterize phenotypes, but variations in data types can make it difficult to harmonize definitions. While radiography is widely used in KOA imaging, it is limited in its ability to assess early disease (when interventions are most likely to succeed) and is insensitive to change. Ultrasound (US) is a widely accessible, time-efficient and cost-effective imaging modality that can provide detailed and reliable information about all joint tissues (e.g., cartilage, meniscus, synovium, bone), and could therefore inform phenotypes in KOA (e.g., by presence of synovitis, effusion, cartilage damage, calcium crystal deposition, and popliteal cysts). Use of US is currently limited by the lack of systematically performed studies in well-characterized non-clinical populations. To address this gap and further the use of this advantageous imaging modality for KOA, we will obtain standardized US and radiography in the population- based Johnston County Health Study (JoCoHS), the new enrollment phase of the 25+ year Johnston County OA Project which includes white, African American, and Hispanic men and women aged 35-70, to achieve three aims. In Aim 1, we will determine the population prevalence (n~3000) of knee US features including cartilage and meniscal damage, synovitis/effusion, calcium crystal deposition, popliteal cysts and osteophytes overall and in key subgroups by age, sex, race/ethnicity, and symptom status. Aim 2 will allow quantification of the associations between these US features and radiographic findings and symptom scores overall and in key subgroups (e.g., those with and without radiographic KOA, by sex, by race/ethnicity). For Aim 3, we will apply novel machine learning methodologies (e.g., Direction-projection-permutation [DiProPerm] hypothesis testing, Joint and Individual Variation [JIVE], and Distance-Weighted Discrimination [DWD]) to a) develop an overall US score for symptomatic KOA and b) identify the contribution of US variables to phenotypes relevant to KOA based on general health, physical activity, and functional assessments. This study is a crucial step to establish the foundation for US as an assessment tool for clinical use, research, and clinical trials in KOA, providing unique population-based cross-sectional data regarding the utility of US and forming the basis for future longitudinal work evaluating its value and performance characteristics related to incident and progressive KOA. Project narrative Osteoarthritis is an enormous and increasing public health problem that, like many other chronic conditions, is not a single disease but a heterogeneous condition consisting of multiple subgroups, or phenotypes, with differing underlying mechanisms. Ultrasound is an accessible, time-efficient, and cost-effective imaging modality that provides invaluable data about all joint tissues involved in osteoarthritis and has the potential to identify important phenotypes. The proposed work is relevant to the NIAMS mission and represents a crucial step to establish the foundation for ultrasound as an assessment tool for use in clinics, research, and clinical trials in osteoarthritis.",Assessment of ultrasound features of knee osteoarthritis in a population-based community cohort,9944803,R01AR077060,"['Address', 'African American', 'Age', 'Area', 'Assessment tool', 'Bilateral', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Markers', 'Bone Spur', 'Calcium', 'Cartilage', 'Categories', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Claustrophobias', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Assessment Tool', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cohort Studies', 'Communities', 'County', 'Crystal Formation', 'Crystallization', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Degenerative polyarthritis', 'Development', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Enrollment', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Etiology', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hispanics', 'Image', 'Implant', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Knee', 'Knee Osteoarthritis', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Meniscus structure of joint', 'Methodology', 'Mission', 'Modality', 'Musculoskeletal', 'National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases', 'Nature', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Participant', 'Pathology', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physical activity', 'Popliteal Cyst', 'Population', 'Population Study', 'Prevalence', 'Public Health', 'Race', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Research', 'Risk Factors', 'Sex Differences', 'Specialist', 'Standardization', 'Subgroup', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'Synovial Membrane', 'Synovitis', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Ultrasonography', 'Variant', 'Woman', 'Work', 'aged', 'base', 'bone', 'cohort', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'effusion', 'follow-up', 'imaging genetics', 'imaging modality', 'individual variation', 'interest', 'men', 'novel', 'point of care', 'population based', 'recruit', 'rheumatologist', 'sex', 'uptake']",NIAMS,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2020,342100,0.007599840945258137
"Functional Cardiovascular 4D MRI in Congenital Heart Disease SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Congenital heart disease (CHD) is the most common birth defect, affecting 1.2% of all live births. Imaging plays a major role in managing CHD but remains challenging for evaluating complex cardiac and vascular abnormalities across a wide range of age and habitus. To address these limitations, the PIs have developed cardiovascular 4D flow MRI which can measure complex 3D blood flow in-vivo, a task difficult or impossible to obtain with other imaging strategies. Recent efforts have focused on two forms of CHD: 1) bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) which is the most common form of CHD, and 2) single ventricle physiology (SVP), one of the most severe forms of CHD. Our 4D flow MRI studies have successfully identified new hemodynamic biomarkers to better characterize CHD. We were the first to establish a physiologic link between aberrant 3D blood flow, elevated wall shear stress (WSS), aortopathy phenotype, and aortic wall tissue degeneration on histopathology in patients with BAV. In patients with SVP, our findings demonstrated relationships between surgical correction strategies and flow distribution to the lungs, a known factor implicated in SVP outcome. We have achieved successful clinical translation at Northwestern, where 4D flow MRI is now used as a clinical tool in diagnostic MRI exams for patients with CHD and aortic disease. Over the past four years, the PIs have assembled one of the largest 4D MRI databases with over 2500 patient exams. For this renewal application, we identified a need to increase the dynamic range of 4D MRI flow sensitivity to account for data complexity (3D + time) and the wide age range in CHD by a combination of dual-venc flow encoding, compressed sensing, and SSFP imaging. Second, three is a need for longitudinal studies to identify predictors of BAV and SVP outcome. Third, making these unique but complex 4D MRI data sets and analysis tools more widely available to the greater research community is challenging. In addition, no automated methods currently exist for advanced processing such as atlas based analysis across large cohorts. Analysis is thus time consuming and requires manual interactions (e.g. 3D vessel segmentation) which limits reproducibility and translation. To address this need, an established Northwestern data archival and pipeline processing resource based on remote high-performance computing clusters (NUNDA) will be utilized for standardized data archival, sharing, and pipeline processing of 4D MRI data. This platform will provide the unique opportunity to utilize annotated data available in the 4D MRI database (>1300 BAV, SVP, and control 4D MRI data analyzed in the initial funding cycle) for application of machine learning concepts to establish (semi-)automated 4D MRI analysis workflows in NUNDA. Thus, the renewal application for this study aims to 1) develop a rapid (15 min) non-contrast 4D MRI for clinical translation, 2) leverage the existing large 4D MRI database to identify 4D MRI metrics predictive of long-term (> 5 years) CHD patient outcome, and 3) establish a remote NUNDA platform for 4D MRI data sharing and automated analysis across large cohorts. PROJECT NARRATIVE Our goal is to develop non-contrast 4D MRI, a new diagnostic test to achieve an improved assessment for the most common and one of the most severe forms of congenital heart disease: bicuspid aortic valve and single ventricle physiology. We will leverage an existing large 4D MRI database to allow for long-term 5-8-year follow-up to establish new measures for improved outcome prediction and therapy management for patients with bicuspid aortic valve and single ventricle physiology.

"Multi-modal Health Information Technology Innovations for Precision Management of Glaucoma PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Glaucoma is the world's leading cause of irreversible blindness and will affect >110 million people by 2040. Early detection and treatment are critical, as symptoms typically do not present until the disease is advanced. A data-driven precision medicine approach is needed to better identify individuals who are at greatest risk of developing the disease and who are at greatest risk of progressing quickly to vision loss. While there has been considerable progress in eye imaging and testing to improve glaucoma monitoring, precision management of glaucoma is incomplete without accounting for patients' co-existing systemic conditions, concurrent systemic medications and treatments, and adherence with prescribed glaucoma treatment. Understanding how systemic conditions, and specifically vascular conditions such as hypertension, impact glaucoma presents growing public health importance given the increasing co-morbidities facing aging populations. Preliminary studies have demonstrated the predictive value of systemic data, even without ophthalmic endpoints. Similarly, measuring medication adherence is important for guiding patient counseling and engagement and avoiding downstream interventions such as surgeries, which carry high cost and morbidity. These factors are important for providing a more comprehensive perspective of glaucoma management and for improving patient outcomes, yet they are relatively understudied. I propose applying multi-modal advancements in health information technology (IT) to address these gaps and achieve the following specific aims: (1) Develop machine learning-based predictive models classifying patients at risk for glaucoma progression using systemic electronic health record (EHR) data from a diverse nationwide patient cohort; (2) evaluate how integrating blood pressure (BP) data from novel smartwatch-based home BP monitors enhance predictive models for risk stratification in glaucoma, and (3) measure glaucoma medication adherence using innovative flexible electronic sensors to validate their use for future interventions aimed at improving adherence and clinical outcomes in glaucoma. These studies would leverage state- of-the-art methods in big-data predictive modeling as well as cutting-edge advancements in sensor technologies. This multi-faceted approach will build a foundation for a health IT framework geared toward improving risk stratification and generating novel therapeutic targets for glaucoma patients. PROJECT NARRATIVE A precision medicine approach is critical for early detection and treatment of glaucoma, an insidious chronic eye disease that can lead to blindness and severely decreased quality of life. The relationship between systemic conditions and treatments with glaucoma progression, as well as methods for monitoring and promoting glaucoma medication adherence, represent areas of glaucoma management that are not well-understood and are thus critical opportunities for technology-driven interventions. This study proposes the development and application of multi- modal health information technology innovations – such as machine learning-based predictive modeling, massive electronic datasets, wearable devices, and flexible sensor electronics – to enhance understanding of glaucoma pathophysiology and identify new potential therapeutic strategies.",Multi-modal Health Information Technology Innovations for Precision Management of Glaucoma,10018290,DP5OD029610,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adherence', 'Affect', 'African American', 'Aging', 'All of Us Research Program', 'Area', 'Award', 'Big Data', 'Blindness', 'Blood Pressure', 'Blood Vessels', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Counseling', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Department chair', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Electronics', 'Ensure', 'Exhibits', 'Eye', 'Eye diseases', 'Eyedrops', 'Fellowship', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Glaucoma', 'Home Blood Pressure Monitoring', 'Home environment', 'Human Resources', 'Hypertension', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Institutes', 'Institution', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Latino', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Ophthalmologist', 'Ophthalmology', 'Optic Nerve', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physical activity', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Predictive Analytics', 'Predictive Value', 'Public Health', 'Public Health Informatics', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk stratification', 'Role', 'Sleep', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Track and Field', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vision', 'Visual Fields', 'Work', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'blood pressure regulation', 'circadian regulation', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'cost', 'data integration', 'early onset', 'electronic data', 'experience', 'faculty community', 'flexibility', 'health information technology', 'improved', 'innovation', 'medication compliance', 'multidisciplinary', 'multimodality', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'patient engagement', 'personalized management', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'professor', 'programs', 'racial minority', 'sensor', 'sensor technology', 'smart watch', 'treatment adherence', 'wearable device']",OD,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",DP5,2020,393957,0.03620945501182602
"Development of a Fast Large Area Multiphoton Exoscope (FLAME) Summary. Our long-term goal is to develop a powerful tool based on multiphoton microscopy (MPM) for non- invasive human skin imaging in order to improve clinical diagnosis, guide effective treatment and advance clinical and cosmetic/pharmaceutical research by providing access to dynamic cellular and molecular processes during therapy. MPM is a nonlinear optical imaging technique that provides unique structural and molecular contrast based on endogenous signals such as second harmonic generation from collagen and two- photon excited fluorescence from NADH/FAD+, keratin, melanin and elastin fibers. This contrast allows MPM to provide multi-color, rich molecular information content images that can enhance diagnostic accuracy. MPM overcomes fundamental limitations of existing optical imaging technologies for sub-surface skin imaging and extends the area of applicability beyond skin lesions that can be diagnosed through morphological assessment alone. Validation of the clinical potential of this technology has been facilitated over the past 10 years by a device developed by Jenlab in Germany, currently the only clinical MPM system on the market. This device has technical limitations in terms of field-of-view (FOV), imaging speed, complexity and cost, which are major barriers to clinical adoption. The goal of this Phase I proposal is to develop and test the technical feasibility for in vivo human skin imaging of a MPM system that is highly optimized for rapid, label-free, macroscopic imaging of human skin with microscopic resolution. The Fast Large Area Multiphoton Exoscope (FLAME) imaging platform will incorporate the innovative optical engine of a benchtop prototype developed at BLI. InfraDerm will innovate on this design to transform it into a compact, portable device, suitable for human skin imaging in clinical setting. Key innovations include: 1) a compact engineering design based on integrating a compact fs fiber laser into the imaging head along with a customized folded optical design to reduce complexity and cost and enhance portability; 2) hardware and software strategies that include a customized patient interface and a combination of optical and mechanical scanning mechanisms with deep learning image restoration to allow millimeter-to-centimeter scale imaging within minutes while maintaining sub-micron resolution. This approach will expand the in vivo imaging area from mm to cm scale, which will be scanned within minutes with sub- cellular resolution. In Aim 1 we will develop the FLAME prototype that incorporates these features. In Aim 2 we will test its technical feasibility for in vivo human skin imaging by evaluating potential effects of motion artifacts. In Aim 3, we will demonstrate the FLAME system potential for non-invasive assessment of melanin content, an ability with potential impact in differential diagnosis and early assessment of treatment efficacy of pigmentary skin disorders, such as melasma. Phase II will refine the technological approach and will test the device feasibility in a first clinical application, differential diagnosis of patients with melasma, a long time dermatology challenge and a particular interest for pharma companies developing therapies for this skin condition. Narrative  InfraDerm LLC proposes to develop and test the technical feasibility for in vivo human skin imaging of a laser scanning microscope based on multiphoton microscopy (MPM) that addresses fundamental and technical limitations of existing optical imaging technologies for sub-surface skin imaging, extending the area of applicability beyond skin lesions that can be diagnosed through morphological assessment alone. The proposed Fast Large Area Multiphoton Exoscope (FLAME) prototype will be highly optimized for rapid, label- free, macroscopic imaging of human skin with microscopic resolution.

"Development and Validation of Radiation-Free Pediatric Renal Function Quantification Project Abstract Motivation: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) affects more than 500 million people. Children commonly develop CKD from urinary obstructive diseases and nephrotoxic therapies, and then suffer severe growth failure,  hypertension, cardiovascular risks, and neurocognitive deficits, and eventually end-stage kidney disease. Accurate renal function quantification will improve clinical management of hydronephrosis (1 in 100 babies) and  dosing/selection of chemotherapeutic regimens in oncology patients. Glomerular filtration rate (GFR), the biomarker of renal function, is derived from blood or urine tests. These tests only provide global GFR and are limited in accuracy, especially in children, and even more so in children with cancer. MRI offers superb anatomic delineation without ionizing radiation, and is thus ideal for pediatric kidney imaging. However, MRI has not been widely adopted for pediatric renal function evaluation due to lack of reliability and cumbersome workflow. These hurdles stem from the fact that the critical components required for global and regional GFR calculation, including high spatiotemporal resolution, plasma flow and arterial input function, are difficult to obtain, and that accurate image segmentation of kidneys (cortex and medulla) is labor intensive. Additionally, although the same contrast agent injection can be used for obstruction evaluation, certain areas of the kidney suffer from significant signal loss using standard MRI acquisition techniques due to high contrast agent concentrations. This project addresses these major challenges for automated comprehensive renal function evaluation in children. Approach: The project has three development aims, which are validated by clinical studies. Aim 1 will enable novel free-breathing time-resolved 3D dynamic contrast enhanced MRI that simultaneously provides accurate GFR calculation and renal plasma flow. This is achieved by incorporating self-navigated motion compensation, fast acquisition with parallel imaging and compressed sensing, and phase-contrast flow imaging. The second aim is to develop multiple new image analysis methods to extract GFR and renal plasma flow (RPF) that  leverage novel flow data of Aim 1, as well as automated new machine-learning image processing techniques for the segmentation of kidneys and ultimately global and regional GFR calculation. In Aim 3, we will develop and integrate ultrashort-echo-time techniques to address the MRI signal loss due to T2* effects from high contrast concentration for patients with obstruction, and further incorporate motion compensation and accelerated  imaging methods to enable time-resolved high-resolution dynamic MRI for contrast washout kinetics analysis in the same MR exam. Aim 4 will determine the performance of these methods in a clinical setting. Significance: This work will lead to robust, automated comprehensive pediatric renal MRI for safer and more accurate renal function evaluation in children. The techniques will facilitate widespread application in the com- munity setting and permit robust evaluation of renal function, for both children and adults. Project Narrative Kidney diseases in children often stem from blockages of the urinary tract or toxicity from medications, such as antibiotics or chemotherapies. Kidney function quantification is crucial for clinical management of these children.

"Disposable, medication-integrated tactile and motion sensor for glaucoma therapy compliance improvement ABSTRACT Glaucoma is the leading cause of irreversible blindness in the world. The number of people with primary open angle glaucoma is expected to exceed 100 million by 2040. The first-line therapy for glaucoma treatment is patient-administered hypotensive medication delivered topically via an eye drop. However, studies have consistently shown that patients rarely adhere to dosing recommendations. According to the Wilmer Glaucoma Center of Excellence, nearly 50% of individuals discontinue eye drops within six months of their first prescription. Of those that persist beyond six months, only 37% continue the therapy after three years, and only 10% of those prescribed glaucoma drops are persistent (without gaps) over the first year. Failure to adhere to dosing recommendations dramatically limits the effectiveness of eye drops in lowering intraocular pressure and delaying or preventing the progression of glaucoma. This well-known problem has prompted the development of several technological solutions for tracking adherence. Retinal Care's proposed solution is fundamentally different. The proposed device is a simple and inexpensive combination of sensors designed to provide feedback to patients, providers, payers, and care coordinators regarding the way a patient interacts with their medication. Tactile and motion data is acquired through a custom force-sensitive resistor (FSR) and a standard three-axis accelerometer. Combined, these two data sources provide significant insight into drop adherence, application mechanics, and patient behavior. More importantly, this data can inform decisions on how and when to intervene with a patient to maximize the likelihood of continued long-term drop adherence and vision preservation. The primary innovations are in the single-use design (enabled by low-cost custom FSR fabrication and the unique combination of low-cost electrical components), the novel mining of motion and tactile information for patient adherence and behavioral data, and the integration with an existing care coordination framework. Retinal Care approaches health care more holistically than traditional companies; recognizing the behavioral and psychosocial factors that are a root cause of blindness from eye diseases like glaucoma. While Retinal Care employs cutting-edge technology such as deep learning and advanced medical devices, we work actively toward implementing technology in a way that translates directly to improved quality of life for our patients by managing the entire care path. The technology proposed here, while novel in design, is not intended primarily as a tracking tool, though it will accomplish that sub-goal with greater effectiveness and at less cost than any existing product. Instead, it is designed explicitly to reduce blindness by providing the crucial data needed to tailor our interaction and intervention strategies to the individual patient; to maximize patient engagement and adherence to glaucoma care through a combination of education, incentivization, tailored communications, and personal interaction with our trained care coordinators. The goal of this project is to demonstrate feasibility (cost and functionality) of the simple device that will enable Retinal Care to effectively reduce blindness and visual impairment from glaucoma. PROJECT NARRATIVE Glaucoma is the leading cause of irreversible blindness globally and in the US, where it affects more than 3 million Americans and costs the US economy $2.86 billion every year in direct costs and productivity losses. Topical medication administered through eye drops is a common and effective first-line therapy for reducing intraocular pressure and controlling glaucoma, but patient adherence to dosing recommendations is a consistent and pervasive issue that contributes significantly to vision loss. Retinal Care Inc. intends to develop and deploy a suite of simple, disposable, bottle-integrated sensors that will continuously collect real-time adherence and behavioral data to inform the design of patient-specific intervention and incentivization strategies to improve adherence and reduce blindness from glaucoma.","Disposable, medication-integrated tactile and motion sensor for glaucoma therapy compliance improvement",10010396,R41EY031632,"['Accelerometer', 'Adherence', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Age related macular degeneration', 'American', 'Antihypertensive Agents', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Blindness', 'Businesses', 'Caring', 'Cells', 'Cellular Phone', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Coin', 'Communication', 'Consumption', 'Coupled', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Device or Instrument Development', 'Devices', 'Diabetic Retinopathy', 'Direct Costs', 'Dose', 'Drops', 'Education', 'Educational Intervention', 'Effectiveness', 'Electrical Engineering', 'Electronics', 'Engineering', 'Eye', 'Eye diseases', 'Eyedrops', 'Failure', 'Feedback', 'Film', 'Generations', 'Glaucoma', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Human', 'Incentives', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Kinetics', 'Label', 'Liquid substance', 'Measurement', 'Mechanics', 'Medical', 'Medical Device', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Mobile Health Application', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Nylons', 'Ophthalmology', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Peripheral', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiologic Intraocular Pressure', 'Plant Roots', 'Polyurethanes', 'Primary Open Angle Glaucoma', 'Provider', 'Psychosocial Factor', 'Quality of life', 'Radio', 'Recommendation', 'Regimen', 'Resistance', 'Retina', 'Tactile', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Textiles', 'Thinness', 'Time', 'Topical application', 'Touch sensation', 'Training', 'Translating', 'United States', 'Vision', 'Visual Fields', 'Visual impairment', 'Work', 'advanced analytics', 'analog', 'base', 'care coordination', 'compliance behavior', 'cost', 'data integration', 'deep learning', 'design', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'incentive strategies', 'individual patient', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interoperability', 'iterative design', 'kinematics', 'motion sensor', 'novel', 'patient engagement', 'performance tests', 'predictive modeling', 'preference', 'preservation', 'prevent', 'productivity loss', 'prototype', 'recruit', 'screening', 'sensor', 'tool', 'treatment adherence', 'usability', 'wearable device']",NEI,"RETINAL CARE, INC.",R41,2020,219896,0.0005022669303874793
"Rapid Low-Cost Quantitative 3D MRI and Gait Assessment of the Knee Project Abstract Motivation: Osteoarthritis (OA) is a painful disease that affects tens of millions of Americans, but is poorly understood, resulting in a lack of treatments. Enabling low-cost approaches for widespread study of risk factors, onset and early progression of OA will enable better understanding of OA mechanisms, treatment development, and triage of patients to different treatments based on speciﬁc disease phenotypes. Multiple systemic factors, biochemical factors, and other risk factors are associated with OA, but causes are difﬁ- cult to isolate and study during slow progression. Currently OA is diagnosed as joint-space narrowing using X-ray radiography, at a stage well beyond when interventions can be effective. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of- fers sensitivity to morphologic and biochemical changes, but most methods are impractical for widespread clinical or research use. Usually MRI exams study only one knee, precluding the opportunity to compare knees. Sim- ilarly, biomechanics assessment typically requires numerous tests using advanced and rarely-available equip- ment and time-intensive analysis by skilled personnel, making this a challenge for widespread use. We have shown rapid, simultaneous 3D scanning of both knees with quantitative relaxometry and diffusion map- ping of connective tissues, combined with novel visualization of longitudinal change validated in a population with anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tears. We have developed fully-automated cartilage and meniscus seg- mentation to simplify post-processing. (Our automated cartilage segmentation variability approaches that of reader-to-reader variability.) We now propose to combine MRI acquisition, reconstruction and analysis tech- niques with simple measures of kinematics into a widely applicable low-cost imaging and biomechanical test, which we will validate in subjects with ACL-injury and subjects with varying Kellgren-Lawrence grades of OA. Approach: We will begin by developing a robust 5-to-8-minute bilateral knee MRI exam, using an efﬁcient 3D isotropic acquisition and novel deep-learning based image reconstructions. This will be followed with automated cartilage segmentation and quantitative analysis (thickness, T2, diffusion) of all 3 knee plates and automated semiquantitative scoring approaches for synovitis, bone marrow and cartilage lesions. Inertial measurement units (IMUs) will be used to measure kinematics, and gait asymmetries. We will continue our studies in ACL pa- tients to validate techniques and to develop asymmetry analyses for both imaging and biomechanical measures. Finally, in subjects with varying OA grade, we will evaluate the potential of the overall low-cost approach to relate asymmetry and longitudinal change measures to progression and OA grade. Signiﬁcance: This project will develop an acquisition and analysis pipeline to quantify knee changes and left/right asymmetries that precede OA. We will characterize methods in idiopathic OA subjects and ACL- injured subjects at risk of post-traumatic OA. The very low target cost, under $120/subject, will ultimately enable widespread study of early onset and progression of different OA types, leading to earlier and better treatments. Project Narrative Osteoarthritis remains the leading cause of disability, and effective treatment will require efﬁcient assessment of disease risk-factors, onset, and progression, both for development and personalization of minimally invasive interventions. We propose a 5-minute 3D MRI exam of both knees without radiation or contrast injection, that will be combined with low-cost measures of knee motion and fully automated analysis methods to provide quan- titative measurements of cartilage, tendon, ligament, bone and ﬁbrocartilage health and asymmetries between knees. This low-cost, rapid, bilateral assessment will enable research studies in large populations, as well as adding quantitative bilateral information to clinical scans to dramatically improve understanding of onset of dif- ferent types of osteoarthritis.",Rapid Low-Cost Quantitative 3D MRI and Gait Assessment of the Knee,10032904,R01AR077604,"['3-Dimensional', 'Affect', 'American', 'Anterior Cruciate Ligament', 'Articulation', 'Bilateral', 'Biochemical', 'Biomechanics', 'Body mass index', 'Bone Marrow', 'Bone Spur', 'Cartilage', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Connective Tissue', 'Cost Measures', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Pooling', 'Degenerative polyarthritis', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Equipment', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Female', 'Fibrocartilages', 'Future', 'Gait', 'Gait abnormality', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human Resources', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Inflammatory', 'Injections', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Kellgren-Lawrence grade', 'Knee', 'Knee Osteoarthritis', 'Left', 'Length', 'Lesion', 'Ligaments', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Meniscus structure of joint', 'Methods', 'Morphology', 'Motion', 'Motivation', 'Output', 'Pain', 'Patient Triage', 'Patients', 'Population', 'Protocols documentation', 'Protons', 'Quality of life', 'Quantitative Evaluations', 'Radiation', 'Reader', 'Replacement Arthroplasty', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Sex Differences', 'Slice', 'Surface', 'Synovitis', 'Techniques', 'Tendon structure', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Visualization', 'analysis pipeline', 'anterior cruciate ligament injury', 'anterior cruciate ligament rupture', 'automated analysis', 'base', 'bone', 'cohort', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'density', 'disability', 'disease phenotype', 'disorder risk', 'early onset', 'effective therapy', 'gait examination', 'image reconstruction', 'improved', 'kinematics', 'learning classifier', 'meniscus injury', 'minimally invasive', 'novel', 'predictive test', 'primary outcome', 'quantitative imaging', 'reconstruction', 'research study', 'sensor', 'societal costs', 'therapy development', 'tissue biomarkers']",NIAMS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,658342,0.01857688036644921
"Skeletal Myopathy in Systemic Sclerosis: Devising a Classification Schema Predictive of Outcomes PROJECT SUMMARY Skeletal myopathy in systemic sclerosis (SSc) is associated with increased disability and mortality. There is no consensus classification of SSc-associated myopathy that can be utilized to lay the groundwork for understanding muscle disease in scleroderma. We know that there is pathological, serological, and outcome heterogeneity that may be informative in defining distinct subsets of myopathy in SSc. Our preliminary data demonstrate that (1) muscle histopathology is heterogeneous in SSc, (2) patients with a fibrosing myopathy have poor outcomes, in particular cardiac death, and (3) there is intense signal uptake on advanced MRI imaging such as diffusion weighted and tensor imaging and T2 mapping in SSc-associated myopathy which may indicate early disease related changes when compared to conventional muscle MRI. This K23 proposal will first establish a Myopathy cohort (Aim 1), devise a classification schema and test its utility in predicting long term outcomes such as trajectory, cardiopulmonary disease, disability, mortality, and treatment responsiveness(Aim 2), and detect and quantify early disease related muscle changes on advanced muscle MRI (Aim 3). This application is for a K23 award for Julie Paik, MD, MHS, Assistant Professor of Medicine in the Division of Rheumatology at the Johns Hopkins University. Her long term career goal is to become a leading clinical investigator in scleroderma muscle disease in the context of observational cohort studies, state of the art imaging biomarkers, and clinical trial methodology. Her short term goal of devising this classification schema will provide a new gold standard for the validation of external myopathy cohorts in SSc and lay the framework for future studies directed at understanding biological mechanism and developing a therapeutic trial using measurable outcomes such as quantitative muscle MRI. This proposal takes advantage of the rich resources and infrastructure at the Johns Hopkins Scleroderma Center, a recently designated Precision Center of Excellence in 2018. Her mentoring team includes Dr. Laura Hummers and Dr. Fredrick Wigley, both renowned experts in SSc and clinical epidemiology, Dr. Andrew Mammen is an internationally recognized myositis expert, and Dr. Scott Zeger a leader in bio statistical and epidemiological research. Dr. Paik has recruited vital members to her Advisory Committee, composed of mentors and collaborators who have specific expertise relevant to the proposal and are fully supportive of Dr. Paik’s research and career goals. These include Dr. Michael Jacobs (advanced radiological imaging), Dr. Laura Fayad (musculoskeletal radiology), Dr. Andrea Corse (muscle histopathology), Dr. Tom Lloyd (classification schemas in inclusion body myositis), and Dr. Ami Shah (scleroderma translational research). This K23 award will allow Dr. Paik to gain the skills needed to analyze and develop a classification schema of skeletal myopathy in scleroderma, develop expertise in advanced muscle MRI analysis, and build her clinical trial skill set to ultimately support a future R01 proposal. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research will establish a comprehensive, prospective myopathy cohort in systemic sclerosis (SSc or scleroderma) to ultimately devise a novel classification schema for SSc-associated myopathy that is predictive of outcomes such as treatment response, disability, cardiopulmonary disease trajectory, and death. Advanced muscle MRI techniques include diffusion weighted imaging, diffusion tensor imaging, and T2 mapping will also be used to detect and quantify early muscle disease related changes in SSc associated myopathy. The knowledge gained from this study will lay the foundation for discovering predictive biomarkers of disease course and to allow future studies of the specific biological process involved in each phenotype.",Skeletal Myopathy in Systemic Sclerosis: Devising a Classification Schema Predictive of Outcomes,9892505,K23AR073927,"['Address', 'Advisory Committees', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Biopsy', 'Cardiac Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cohort Studies', 'Consensus', 'Creatine Kinase', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Early identification', 'Edema', 'Electromyography', 'Enrollment', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Fibrosis', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Heterogeneity', 'Histologic', 'Histopathology', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Incidence', 'Inclusion Body Myositis', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammation Process', 'Inflammatory', 'Infrastructure', 'International', 'Intramuscular', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Measurable', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Metabolic', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Muscle', 'Muscle Weakness', 'Musculoskeletal', 'Myopathy', 'Myositis', 'Necrosis', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Prospective cohort', 'Protocols documentation', 'Pulmonary Heart Disease', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Rheumatology', 'Sampling Biases', 'Scleroderma', 'Serologic tests', 'Serological', 'Signal Transduction', 'Skeletal Muscle', 'Systemic Scleroderma', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Trials', 'Translational Research', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'career', 'clinical development', 'clinical epidemiology', 'clinically significant', 'cohort', 'diffusion weighted', 'disability', 'disorder control', 'epidemiology study', 'high risk', 'illness length', 'imaging biomarker', 'interest', 'member', 'mortality', 'muscle form', 'muscle strength', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'predictive marker', 'professor', 'prospective', 'quantitative imaging', 'radiological imaging', 'random forest', 'recruit', 'skeletal', 'skills', 'treatment response', 'uptake']",NIAMS,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,K23,2020,158743,0.00266398298552804
"Genetic Modulators of Glaucoma Glaucoma is the leading cause of irreversible blindness in the world. While elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) is a major risk factor, damage and death of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) underlies visual field loss. However, a thorough understanding of this disease is a major challenge because its genetic basis is heterogeneous and it represents a family of age-related disorders resulting from intersecting gene-regulated pathophysiologic networks. We propose to continue to use the BXD (C57BL/6 x DBA/2J) family of recombinant inbred (RI) lines of mice as a genetic reference panel (GRP) and to combine our work with human genome wide association studies (GWAS), to uncover and clarify the genetic heterogeneity that underlies optic nerve (ON) damage. We have had recent success using this combined approach in the regulation of intraocular pressure (IOP). We are very well positioned to take the next step and apply this approach to define cellular targets of RGC damage and death. We propose to uncover phenotypic diversities of glaucoma-related ON damage and uncover common underlying mechanisms that are shared with IOP modulation. Our long-term research goal is to identify disease mechanisms and develop neuroprotective therapies to preserve retinal health in patients at risk for glaucoma. Our overall objective is to identify novel gene products and related mechanisms that lead to glaucomatous endophenotypes using multi-dimensional genetic analyses, cross-species comparisons (mouse, rat and human) and validation using novel murine glaucoma models. Our central hypothesis is that molecular processes leading to glaucoma associated-endophenotypes, such as elevated IOP and ON damage, are shared across species, and that species comparisons can uncover common underlying mechanisms, and efficient testing of targeted glaucoma therapeutics. In the current investigation, we perform a systematic analysis of ON damage, and an additional species—rat. We will mine the extensive databases of IOP and ON damage that we are generating for more than 70 BXD strains across five age cohorts with the goal of defining new models of glaucoma. An overall strength of this proposal is the combination of cutting-edge systems genetics methods, species comparisons of glaucoma phenotypes, and a strong interdisciplinary team that includes investigators with extensive experience in systems genetics, glaucoma, GWAS in human and rats, and advanced computational methods. To test our hypothesis, we will perform the following thress studies: 1) Identify the candidate gene on chromosome 12 that modulates ON damage; 2) Determine if modulation of IOP and/or ON damage is shared across rodent species; and 3) Identify novel spontaneous glaucoma models through a comprehensive analysis of our enlarged BXD GRP of 100 or more BXD strains. The outcomes of these studies will define novel genes and molecular networks that underlie glaucoma-associated phenotypes and also provide unique glaucoma models for future analysis. These results are expected to fundamentally advance the field of glaucoma disease mechanisms and enable targeted therapeutic development. Glaucoma is the leading cause of irreversible blindness in the world and a thorough understanding of this disease is a major challenge because its genetic basis is heterogeneous, and it likely represents a family of disorders resulting from intersecting gene-regulated pathophysiologic pathways. Our goals are to: identify candidate gene(s) that modulate optic nerve damage; determine if regulation of intraocular pressure and/or optic nerve damage are shared across species; and identify novel spontaneous glaucoma models.

"Multiband ASL for Neurodevelopment Study Project Summary/Abstract The developmental period between childhood to adolescence and young adulthood is marked by a mix of potential and vulnerability. A number of potentially life-long behavioral and emotional problems emerge during this critical period, including alcohol and illicit drug use, risky behaviors, and the first signs of emotional disorders. It is important to understand detailed patterns of typical development, so alterations can be identified and rectified as early as possible. As an entirely noninvasive and quantitative imaging method, arterial spin labeled (ASL) perfusion MRI is increasingly being recognized as an important biomarker for functional brain development in both healthy populations and neurodevelopmental disorders. However, there remain significant challenges for making ASL an impactful tool in studying neurodevelopment, including: 1) a coarse spatial resolution of ~4x4x4mm3, 2) susceptibility to head motion with segmented 3D acquisitions, and 3) potential confounding effects of age dependent variations in arterial transit time using a single post-labeling delay (PLD) scan. Simultaneous multi-slice (SMS) or multiband (MB) is a new accelerated imaging technology that simultaneously excites multiple slices and recovers each slice with parallel imaging techniques. Preliminary studies combining MB with ASL showed that MB can reduce T1 relaxation of the label, improve spatial coverage and/or resolution compared to those of standard 2D ASL. MB imaging may also overcome the limitation of 3D ASL acquisitions in terms of head motion and spatial blurring. However, the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of existing MB ASL is inferior to that of 3D ASL. This project builds on two recent innovations from our lab: 1) a constrained slice-dependent (CSD) background suppression (BS) technique that improves the SNR of 2D MB pCASL to be comparable to that of 3D pCASL; and 2) a single-shot 3D GRASE pCASL method with 2D CAIPIRINHA accelerations that improves the imaging speed of 3D pCASL. The goal of this R01 project is to develop and evaluate cutting-edge MB pCASL protocols that are able to offer a high spatial resolution of isotropic 2mm or higher, resistance to head motion and multi-delay capability for accurate perfusion quantification in pediatric populations. A convolutional neural network (CNN) based denoising algorithm for multi-delay MB pCASL will be further developed. The developed suite of MB pCASL protocol and post- processing algorithms will be evaluated in 40 typically developing children and adolescents. The successful completion of this R01 project will lead to a robust multi-delay MB pCASL protocol that is highly valuable as potential biomarker for both neurodevelopment research and pediatric clinical care. To maximize the scientific and clinical impact, we will continue disseminating the pulse sequence and associated post-processing software as we have been doing in the past decade. Relevance to Public Health A number of potentially life-long behavioral and emotional problems emerge during the developmental period between childhood to adolescence and young adulthood, including alcohol and illicit drug use, risky behaviors, and emotional disorders.

"Accurate quantification of kidney function with non-sedated motion-compensated pediatric MRI Project Summary: Ureteropelvic junction obstruction (UPJO) is an impairment of urine flow from the renal pelvis into the proximal ureter and is the most common cause of hydronephrosis in neonates. This disorder is detected in up to 7% of all maternal ultrasound scans, and an estimated 10% of these newborns have hydronephrosis, which, if left untreated, may result in early failure of functional renal development in these patients. Current methods of assessing kidney function in neonates and children are less than optimal, however. While the current reference standard, nuclear renography (MAG3), yields some useful diagnostic information; it is invasive, slow, provides low resolution, does not offer anatomic detail, and delivers potentially harmful ionizing radiation. Thus, there is an urgent, unmet need to develop a method for functional imaging of kidneys that is non-invasive, safe, accurate, reproducible and radiation-free. The primary objective of this exploratory, two-year study, therefore, is two-fold: first, to develop advanced methods of motion-compensated, high spatial and temporal resolution magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for the improved quantification of the glomerular filtration rate (GFR), an important marker of renal function; and second, to demonstrate the superiority of this method over the current reference standard, nuclear renography (MAG3). Our application in response to PAR-18-743 is specifically aimed at developing, and evaluating motion-robust, high spatiotemporal resolution dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI) for quantifying GFR (MR-GFR) as well as creating new automated analysis software to enable the robust and reproducible assessment of differential renal function in newborns eliminating need for sedation, and in older children. Our method will overcome the technical challenges of current DCE-MRI techniques providing high temporal resolution to capture fast arterial input function dynamics required for accurate computation of GFR, compensate for unavoidable respiratory and bulk motion to reconstruct high quality images and will provide robust, fast, automated post processing techniques for accurate GFR computation. As a non-invasive, motion-robust, radiation-free imaging technique that can depict renal structures at much higher resolution, MR-GFR will offer, for the first time, a level of diagnostic information that is unattainable with MAG3. The critical importance of understanding the extent and severity of UPJO (and resulting hydronephrosis) cannot be understated; for in the absence of this information, children who stand to benefit from immediate surgery might be overlooked or delayed in receiving treatment; and those who might benefit from a more conservative approach (i.e., watching waiting) might receive an unnecessary surgical intervention. Indeed, this novel imaging approach is expected to substantially improve clinical decision-making. The successful completion of our aims will enable 1) assessment of renal function accurately; 2) predicting the likelihood of functional decline; and 3) determining whether surgery is indicated. DCE-MRI is expected to have rapid translational impact for several diseases effecting kidney function once it is introduced into clinical practice. Project Narrative: This project addresses the need to develop advanced methods of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to assess kidney function in newborns and in older children who have been diagnosed with ureteropelvic junction obstruction (UPJO), an impairment of urine flow that is the most common cause of hydronephrosis (inability to void urine). Unfortunately, severe hydronephrosis, left untreated, can result in permanent damage to the child's kidneys and our novel method of assessing kidney function, dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI), promises to evaluate the extent of this disorder in a way that is highly accurate, non- invasive, safe, reliable, and radiation-free and will eliminate the need of repeated scans, sedation and anesthesia when imaging newborns with congenital hydronephrosis. Most importantly, this approach will enable the clinician to confidently and quickly refer children for corrective surgery based on imaging results; and likewise, recommend other children for more conservative “watchful-waiting”, effectively reducing the number of unnecessary surgeries.",Accurate quantification of kidney function with non-sedated motion-compensated pediatric MRI,9877232,R21DK123569,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Age-Months', 'Agreement', 'Anatomy', 'Anesthesia procedures', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Chronic Kidney Insufficiency', 'Clinical', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dialysis procedure', 'Discipline of Nuclear Medicine', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Drainage procedure', 'Ethics', 'Failure', 'Free Will', 'Functional Imaging', 'Gadolinium', 'Glomerular Filtration Rate', 'Hospitalization', 'Hydronephrosis', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Impairment', 'Infection', 'Injections', 'Ionizing radiation', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Function Tests', 'Kidney Transplantation', 'Lead', 'Left', 'Liquid substance', 'Lower urinary tract', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Neonatal', 'Nephrectomy', 'Newborn Infant', 'Nuclear', 'Obstruction', 'Oncology', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Pain', 'Patient imaging', 'Patient observation', 'Patients', 'Pentetic Acid', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Radiation', 'Reference Standards', 'Renal function', 'Renal pelvis', 'Reproducibility', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Sedation procedure', 'Severities', 'Sleep', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tracer', 'Ultrasonography', 'Unnecessary Surgery', 'Ureter', 'Ureteropelvic junction obstruction', 'Urine', 'Urology', 'analysis pipeline', 'automated algorithm', 'automated analysis', 'base', 'bulk motion', 'care costs', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical practice', 'contrast enhanced', 'deep neural network', 'functional decline', 'heart motion', 'image processing', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging approach', 'improved', 'innovation', 'kidney imaging', 'kinetic model', 'neonate', 'neural network algorithm', 'novel', 'pharmacokinetic model', 'renal artery', 'respiratory', 'response', 'spatiotemporal', 'temporal measurement', 'translational impact', 'urologic']",NIDDK,BOSTON CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,R21,2020,221250,0.02532952754738967
"3-D Imaging Flow Cytometry PROJECT SUMMARY This project aims to develop and test two innovative platforms and related software for 3-D imaging flow cytometry of fluorescent or absorbing (stained) samples. These systems will allow 3-D structural and functional imaging of many single cells at a subcellular resolution and at a scale that used to be available only in flow cytometry or recently in 2-D imaging. Thereby, the proposed methods have the potential to fundamentally change the ways cultured cells, patient-derived samples, and small experimental organisms are studied. Automated classification based on the 3-D features will enable the diagnosis of hematologic disorders at single-cell precision. Existing 3-D microscopy methods can provide the same information at higher resolution; however, by relying on a scanning mechanism they cannot be applied to suspending cells, especially in a flow configuration, which is essential for high-speed interrogation. Snapshot 3-D microscopy techniques have been developed to address this challenge, but they have insufficient spatial resolution for single-cell imaging and suffer from long data processing time. We overcome these limitations by combining two novel snapshot techniques developed by the PI with the most rigorous optical imaging theories and cutting-edge component technologies. We will use an array of lenslets, which simultaneously records many projection images corresponding with different viewing angles. The use of pupil phase masks, designed using wavefront coding and a theory of 3-D high-numerical-aperture optical imaging, will increase the resolution of each projection image to the theoretical limit given by the objective-lens numerical aperture. The target resolution is 0.5 µm, which is comparable to existing 2-D imaging flow cytometry systems. The target imaging throughputs based on current component technologies are 120 volumes/sec for fluorescence imaging and 700 volumes/sec for absorption imaging, which are higher than 100 volumes/sec of cutting-edge 3-D optical microscopy for stationary specimens. The vast amount of data acquired by these 3-D imaging systems imposes a serious challenge to data processing. The developed systems record true projection images, which obviate iterative deconvolution process, thereby allowing much faster tomographic reconstruction than in existing snapshot techniques. Using general-purpose graphics processing units and optical diffraction tomography, which includes the diffraction of light by subcellular organelles, our tomographic reconstruction algorithm will be faster yet more accurate than existing approaches. Further, we will explore the feasibility of applying a deep convolutional neural network to the images acquired by the developed systems for accurate single-cell classification based on 3-D features. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project aims to develop 3-D imaging flow cytometry platforms for fluorescent or absorbing (stained) cells at high resolution and high throughput in a flow configuration. The developed systems will be built upon two novel snapshot 3-D techniques developed by the PI in combination with most rigorous 3-D optical imaging theories and cutting-edge component technologies.

"Array-Compressed Parallel Transmission for High Resolution Neuroimaging at 7T Project Summary The goal of this project is to develop a framework for high-performance parallel transmission (pTx) that is trans- ferable to a wide range of MRI scanners, and apply it to push the spatial encoding limits of echo planar imaging (EPI) at 7 Tesla. EPI is by far the most widely used pulse sequence for rapid functional, diffusion, and perfusion imaging, and has been the focus of considerable development in recent years to increase its speed and spatial resolution. Now there is a strong desire to push EPI's spatial resolution down to the micro scale. For functional MRI (fMRI), this would enable imaging of ﬁne structures (layers, columns, and nuclei) of cortical and subcortical architecture while better resolving the hemodynamic response. For diffusion MRI (dMRI), micro scale EPI would improve surface and laminar analysis of ﬁbers in the cortex, as well as brain parcelation using fractional anisotropy differences between gray matter regions, while broadly reducing partial volume effects. It would further enable EPI to be broadly applied to accelerate anatomic scans that are geometrically matched to fMRI and dMRI scans. However, increasing the resolution of single-shot EPI requires longer readouts which extend echo times and re- duce functional contrast in fMRI and signal-to-noise in dMRI at 7 Tesla, while increasing geometric distortions and blurring. Segmented or multishot EPI is a classic method to increase spatial resolution without increasing readout durations, but is underutilized, primarily due to its high sensitivity to motion and dynamic phase changes between shots which cause large image artifacts.  We propose to develop a new multishot EPI technique called shuttered EPI, which addresses the lim- itations of conventional multishot EPI by imaging a set of spatially disjoint shutters in each shot. The shutters are produced by a multidimensional excitation pulse and are spatially shifted between shots to cover an entire slice. However, with thin slices the length of the excitation pulses are impractical (20-100 ms). Many-coil pTx (> 8 coils) can shorten the length of these pulses to feasible durations, but current 7 Tesla scanners have only 8 transmit channels due to cost, footprint, cabling, and other constraints. In the ﬁrst project period we pioneered a technique called array-compressed pTx (acpTx) which overcomes this limitation. Using acpTx, 8 transmit chan- nels can control an arbitrarily large number of coils, where the channels and coils are connected via an array compression network that is optimized with RF pulses for speciﬁc excitations. In this project, we will develop and apply acpTx methods and hardware (a many-coil head transmit array and an 8 channel-to-many coil array com- pression network) to achieve feasible RF pulse durations when exciting the shutter patterns required for shuttered EPI. These developments will be implemented on two major 7T scanner platforms and evaluated in submillimeter (600 micron) fMRI and dMRI acquisitions. Overall, the project encompasses the synergistic design of RF pulses, hardware, acquisitions and reconstructions to achieve a major advance in spatial encoding. Project Narrative Diffusion and functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at 7 Tesla ﬁeld strength using echo planar imaging (EPI) has the potential to deliver clear images of brain structure and function at the level of layers, columns, and nuclei. However, when existing EPI scans are pushed to the spatial resolutions required to resolve these structures, they become highly sensitive to off resonance-induced geometric distortions, relaxation-induced blur- ring, physiological noise and motion. To address this problem, in this project we will develop many-coil array- compressed parallel transmission and apply it to enable shuttered multishot EPI scans that are robust to these effects.",Array-Compressed Parallel Transmission for High Resolution Neuroimaging at 7T,9850978,R01EB016695,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Anisotropy', 'Architecture', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Echo-Planar Imaging', 'Elements', 'Fiber', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Homebound Persons', 'Image', 'Image Enhancement', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Length', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Noise', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Physiological', 'Problem Formulations', 'Relaxation', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Scanning', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Slice', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Thinness', 'Time', 'base', 'blood oxygen level dependent', 'cost', 'design', 'gray matter', 'hemodynamics', 'image reconstruction', 'improved', 'magnetic field', 'motion sensitivity', 'neuroimaging', 'perfusion imaging', 'phase change', 'reconstruction', 'response', 'simulation', 'spectroscopic imaging', 'time use', 'transmission process', 'virtual']",NIBIB,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,569563,0.022932902711448183
"Simulation Tools for 3D and 4D CT and Dosimetry Abstract Photon-counting CT (PCCT) is a major technological advance in CT imaging. Using photon-counting instead of current energy-integrating detectors, PCCT can offer superior performance in terms of spatial resolution, artifact reduction, and most notably, material decomposition. PCCT’s energy differentiation utility offers an ability to more precisely distinguish different materials and optimize and expand the use of contrast agents in CT. With these abilities, PCCT can significantly facilitate quantitative imaging, reduce radiation exposure, and enable revolutionary new applications in functional and physiological imaging beyond existing CT techniques. To realize the full potential of PCCT in clinical practice, the technology needs comprehensive assessments and application-based optimizations. Effective design and deployment of PCCT depends on many design and use choices that should be made in view of the eventual clinical utility. Making these choices requires large scale trials on actual patients. However, such trials are challenging, considering the need to make many decisions prior to prototyping, the limited numbers of prototype PCCT scanners available today, and the often-unknown ground-truth in the patient images. Even for existing prototype systems, many decisions require repetitive trials with multiple acquisitions. This is both unethical and impractical considering radiation safety concerns and costs. These challenges can be overcome by utilizing virtual imaging trials (VITs) using computerized patients and imaging models. VITs provide an efficient means with which to determine the most effective and optimized design and use of imaging technologies with complete control over the study design. In our prior funded project, we developed a VIT framework to evaluate standard energy-integrating detector CT technologies. In this project, we expand the applicability of this framework to photon-counting detector CT. Specifically, we enhance our computational XCAT phantoms to model the necessary higher-resolution detail including normal and abnormal tissue heterogeneities and intra-organ contrast perfusion diversity across populations (Aim 1). To image the phantoms, we develop the first PCCT simulator capable of mimicking existing and emerging prototypes (Aim 2). The enhanced VIT framework will provide the essential foundation with which to comprehensively evaluate and optimize PCCT technologies and applications. In Aim 3, we assess and optimize the use of PCCT for morphological, textural, and compositional quantification in select oncologic and cardiac applications, two leading health detriments in the US where PCCT can offer a notable impact. The results will be the first of their kind in comprehensively evaluating the task-based merits and capabilities of PCCT, determining optimum dose per patient size for PCCT imaging of patients for cancerous lesions and cardiac plaque/stenoses, and helping to establish the effective utility of PCCT in clinical care. The purpose of this project is to develop and utilize a virtual framework to comprehensively evaluate and optimize emerging photon-counting devices and applications in CT imaging. The results will be the first of their kind evaluating the task-based merits and capabilities of photon-counting CT and will help establish its effectual utility in oncologic and cardiac care.",Simulation Tools for 3D and 4D CT and Dosimetry,10051026,R01EB001838,"['3-Dimensional', 'Abdomen', 'Anatomy', 'Cancerous', 'Cardiac', 'Caring', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Computer software', 'Contrast Media', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Ensure', 'Ethics', 'Evaluation', 'Foundations', 'Functional Imaging', 'Funding', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging Phantoms', 'Imaging technology', 'Industry', 'Lesion', 'Manufacturer Name', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Morphology', 'Noise', 'Organ', 'Pathologic', 'Patient imaging', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Perfusion', 'Photons', 'Population', 'Radiation', 'Radiation Dose Unit', 'Radiation exposure', 'Research Design', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Specimen', 'Stenosis', 'System', 'Task Performances', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Texture', 'Tissue Model', 'Tissues', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'analytical method', 'base', 'cardiac plaque', 'clinical application', 'clinical care', 'clinical practice', 'computerized', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'cost efficient', 'deep learning', 'design', 'detector', 'dosimetry', 'experimental study', 'human imaging', 'human subject', 'improved', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'photon-counting detector', 'prototype', 'quantitative imaging', 'simulation', 'soft tissue', 'tool', 'virtual', 'virtual imaging']",NIBIB,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,545403,-0.019490177163574915
"Multi-Task MR Simulation for Abdominal Radiation Treatment Planning ABSTRACT The accuracy of radiation treatment planning (RTP) heavily influences the effectiveness of external beam radiotherapy (EBRT). Individualized RTP begins with a “simulation”, in which the patient in a treatment position is commonly scanned using computed tomography (CT) to define the treatment target and organs at risk (OARs). When soft-tissue contrast is inadequate to support accurate target and OAR delineation in CT based RTP, conservatively large treatment margins are used to avoid a geometric miss. The crude treatment prevents delivering sufficient radiation dose to the tumor without exceeding the tolerance of surrounding normal tissues. Magnetic resonance (MR) can be used as a simulation platform complementary to CT for improved soft-tissue conspicuity. Yet, such a complicated, costly and tedious multi-modal RTP workflow along with unavoidable systematic MR-CT co-registration errors has limited its applications in EBRT, especially at the abdominal site whereby anatomies are highly mobile. Over the past few years, there is a keen interest in the integration of MR alone into RTP and even the therapy workflow (i.e. MR-guided radiotherapy, MRgRT). The abdomen poses critical challenges to MR simulation. Current MR imaging sequences are suboptimal to produce motion-free images and resolve respiratory motion. MR data processing for abdominal RTP is underdeveloped. Contouring of OARs typically relies on manual, tedious procedures that are time-consuming and variation-prone. In this proposal, we will substantially improve the MR acquisition and multi-organ auto-segmentation, so the potential of MR as a simulation modality can be fully unleashed for abdominal EBRT. Three specific aims will be completed. In Aim 1, we will develop a standalone multi-task MR (MT-MR) sequence dedicated to abdominal MR simulation. In Aim 2, we will optimize multi-organ auto-segmentation based on MT-MR images. In Aim 3, we will assess the performance of MT-MR in the context of pancreatic cancer stereotactic body radiotherapy planning. Successful completion of the project will dramatically improve treatment precision and clinical outcomes, thus further promoting the adoption of radiotherapy in the management of abdominal cancers. Moreover, the developed techniques will open the door to future studies aiming at optimizations in many aspects of radiotherapy. PROJECT NARRATIVE Imaging is essential for precise radiation treatment planning. MR based planning is challenging in the abdomen whereby anatomies are highly mobile. We will substantially improve the MR acquisition and multi-organ auto- segmentation, so the potential of MR as an imaging-based planning modality can be fully unleashed for abdominal radiation treatment.",Multi-Task MR Simulation for Abdominal Radiation Treatment Planning,10053211,R01EB029088,"['3-Dimensional', '4D MRI', 'Abdomen', 'Adoption', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Breathing', 'Clinical', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Development', 'Dose', 'Effectiveness', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Future', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Institution', 'Interobserver Variability', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant neoplasm of abdomen', 'Malignant neoplasm of pancreas', 'Manuals', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Motion', 'Normal tissue morphology', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Planning Techniques', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Precision therapeutics', 'Procedures', 'Protons', 'Radiation Dose Unit', 'Radiation therapy', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Scanning', 'Site', 'Solid', 'Study Subject', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Translations', 'Variant', 'Water', 'Weight', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'automated segmentation', 'base', 'computerized data processing', 'contrast imaging', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'density', 'experience', 'image reconstruction', 'improved', 'interest', 'multimodality', 'multitask', 'novel', 'prevent', 'reconstruction', 'respiratory', 'segmentation algorithm', 'simulation', 'soft tissue', 'success', 'treatment planning', 'tumor']",NIBIB,CEDARS-SINAI MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2020,556712,-0.019852612466052046
"Enabling the Next Generation of High Performance Pediatric Whole Body MR Imaging Project Abstract Motivation: We aim to develop and implement a new approach to transform pediatric MRI. The ultimate goal is ultra-fast and motion-robust imaging in a dedicated child-friendly environment to enable more children undergo MRI without anesthesia. For those who still require anesthesia, it will be briefer and lighter, and performed in a safer environment. This project leverages a small compact magnet, designed for adult brain MRI, with gradients that enable very fast imaging. With this magnet as an outstanding starting point, we will tailor our deep experience and multiple successes in developing new MRI approaches to high-density receiver coils, fast imaging sequences, and new image reconstruction methods to set a new standard for pediatric MRI. Approach: Although the compact scanner is designed for adult heads, with a 37 cm inner diameter, it can accommodate children under eight to ten years of age to image any body part. To transform this system for ideal pediatric scanning, three development aims will be pursued. The ﬁrst is to enable optimal signal reception. This will be accomplished through creating new receive chain electronics that are matched to the gradient capabilities, for ultra-high bandwidth imaging. This will be coupled to very thin and formed receive arrays that maximize the size of the patient that can be accommodated in the small bore of the scanner. The second aim is to develop methods of obtaining the highest performance out of the system by characterizing and correcting for its imperfections. This will be coupled to a bespoke approach to peripheral nerve stimulation, enabling maximal use of the gradients on each patient. These two developments will then be leveraged for high efﬁciency and motion robust noncartesian scanning. The ﬁnal aim is to develop a full environment and infrastructure that is well suited to pediatric imaging. Patient preparation and acclimation to MRI will be enhanced by virtual reality. Support equipment for anesthesia, new physiological sensors, and a novel child-friendly audiovisual system will be created. Signiﬁcance: The result of this project will be a revolutionary change in the way that MRI is used and per- formed for children. MRI will be more available, cheaper, safer, and have markedly improved image quality. Project Narrative We will leverage the outstanding magnet and gradients of a unique small bore MRI scanner to create a new standard for unprecedented whole-body pediatric MR imaging. We will develop, integrate, and validate a set of technologies speciﬁcally for pediatric imaging. These include ultra-high bandwidth MRI signal reception from thin form-ﬁtting hardware, high-speed image data acquisition and image reconstruction, and environmental support appropriate for children.",Enabling the Next Generation of High Performance Pediatric Whole Body MR Imaging,9944392,U01EB029427,"['10 year old', '8 year old', 'Acclimatization', 'Acoustics', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Anatomy', 'Anesthesia procedures', 'Body part', 'Brain', 'Caliber', 'Caregivers', 'Child', 'Child Health', 'Childhood', 'Cone', 'Coupled', 'Custom', 'Development', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Electronics', 'Environment', 'Equipment', 'Flare', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Image', 'Immersion', 'Infrastructure', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Motivation', 'Noise', 'Partner in relationship', 'Patients', 'Pediatrics', 'Performance', 'Peripheral Nerve Stimulation', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Physiological', 'Preparation', 'Radiation', 'Resolution', 'Respiration', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Side', 'Signal Transduction', 'Speed', 'Support System', 'System', 'T2 weighted imaging', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Temperature', 'Testing', 'Thinness', 'Time', 'Vendor', 'base', 'commercialization', 'contrast imaging', 'data acquisition', 'density', 'design', 'digital', 'experience', 'hemodynamics', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging capabilities', 'imaging system', 'improved', 'innovation', 'next generation', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'open source', 'pediatric patients', 'reconstruction', 'respiratory', 'sensor', 'success', 'tool', 'virtual reality', 'whole body imaging']",NIBIB,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,U01,2020,887058,0.029873819397993197
"A novel multi-modal, multi-scale imaging pipeline for the validation of diffusion MRI of the brain Project Summary  In this project, we propose to validate and characterize ﬁber orientation estimation from diffusion tensor imag- ing (DTI) through the optimization of a multi-modality, multi-scale imaging pipeline for whole mouse brains. DTI is a powerful tool used to noninvasively report 3D microstructural properties of nervous tissue on a macroscopic scale, and has played an important role in the understanding and diagnosis of a number of neurological disease processes. Modern acquisitions of DTI data can be processed to generate a 3D diffusion proﬁle known as an orientation diffusion function (ODF) at each voxel. The ODF is used to infer the orientation of local axon ﬁber pop- ulations. Previous efforts to validate these orientation estimates have primarily relied on serial optical histology as a ground truth dataset. Histology-based pipelines involve the labor intensive task of physically sectioning the tissue into thin slices, leading to physical destruction of the sample and anisotropic resolution. These limitations potentially confound the accuracy of 3D orientation estimation, complicate the process of spatially registering the ground-truth and DTI datasets, and limit quantitative comparisons to select regions of interest (ROI) across the brain sample.  In recent years, synchrotron x-ray microcomputed tomography (microCT) has emerged as a powerful tool for high-resolution tissue imaging. With a mosaic projection-stitching method, a whole mouse brain can be imaged at an isotropic, 3D resolution of 1.2 microns after prior imaging with DTI. To enhance microCT contrast, the tis- sue specimens are ﬁxed and stained with the same kind of metal-based stains used in electron microscopy (EM) prior to embedding in resin. We will optimize this microCT-EM validation pipeline to address the limitations of pre- vious histology-based studies, and characterize DTI algorithm performance across a whole mouse brain using micron- to nano-scale neurological information.  The speciﬁc aims of the proposal are: (1) model phase contrast to optimize microCT data acquisition, (2) vali- date DTI ODF reconstruction methods using ground-truth microCT (3) characterize DTI performance using under- lying tissue microstructure information from EM. Upon completion, aim 1 will generate a novel theoretical model and acquisition strategy to exploit microCT phase contrast in strongly absorbing biological samples. Aim 2 will generate a ground-truth dataset of ODFs across a whole mouse brain, which will be used to calculate algorithm- speciﬁc spatial maps of DTI performance. In Aim 3, around 20 ROI will be selected for nano-scale imaging with EM, and DTI performance will be characterized by quantitative features of the underlying neural architecture. These results will provide an unprecedented microstructure-driven understanding of the DTI signal, allowing fu- ture studies to develop more advanced DTI models and acquisition strategies to better leverage ﬁber orientation and connectivity information in the treatment of neurological disease. Project Narrative The goal of the proposed research is to use synchrotron x-ray microcomputed tomography and serial electron microscopy to validate diffusion MRI reconstruction methods. This unprecedented pipeline allows for imaging the same tissue across scales ranging from hundreds of microns to tens of nanometers. The high resolution modalities will provide insight into the true neurological microstructure driving the diffusion MRI signal, leading to better modeling and increased clinical and research utility.","A novel multi-modal, multi-scale imaging pipeline for the validation of diffusion MRI of the brain",9987313,F31NS113571,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Architecture', 'Automobile Driving', 'Axon', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical Research', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Electron Microscopy', 'Failure', 'Fiber', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Heavy Metals', 'Histologic', 'Histology', 'Image', 'Imaging Device', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Metals', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Morphology', 'Mosaicism', 'Mus', 'Nerve Tissue', 'Neurologic', 'Optics', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Plant Resins', 'Play', 'Population', 'Process', 'Property', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Scheme', 'Signal Transduction', 'Slice', 'Specificity', 'Specimen', 'Stains', 'Structure', 'Synchrotrons', 'Techniques', 'Theoretical model', 'Thick', 'Thinness', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Time', 'Tissue imaging', 'Tissues', 'Validation', 'Work', 'absorption', 'base', 'contrast enhanced', 'data acquisition', 'electron tomography', 'follow-up', 'image reconstruction', 'insight', 'interest', 'microCT', 'multimodality', 'nanometer', 'nanoscale', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'physical process', 'reconstruction', 'relating to nervous system', 'success', 'tomography', 'tool', 'tractography', 'validation studies']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,F31,2020,40827,0.009486629307314772
"Harmonization of Multi-Site Neuroimaging Data from Complex Study Designs PROJECT SUMMARY Over the past decade, the number of large multi-center neuroimaging studies has skyrocketed due to growing investments by federal governments and private entities interested in brain development, aging, and pathology. This has led to the accumulation of vast amounts of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data which have been acquired with varying amounts of technical harmonization. Such efforts, which have focused on protocol harmonization and comparisons with imaging phantoms, have shown great strides toward reducing inter- scanner differences in imaging features extracted for further study. Unfortunately, MRI show inter-instrument biases even in the most carefully controlled studies. Our group, among many others, has shown that these differences often dwarf biological differences of interest measured using both structural and functional MRI.  To address this, the field has rapidly been developing tools for the harmonization of imaging data after acquisition. We have proposed several such tools, and our work has often focused on the adaptation of methods used in genomic studies for batch effect correction. Our most recent such work involved the ComBat method, which uses empirical Bayesian estimation to correct for site effects in both means and variances of imaging features under study. To date, these tools have been successfully applied in studies of cortical thickness, white matter microstructure, and functional connectivity. However, there are unfortunately several key limitations to the ComBat method for imaging studies that stem from its original conception for gene expression studies.  ComBat was designed for the study of inter-scanner differences in cross-sectionally acquired data. While cross-sectional studies are of great interest and exceedingly common, much focus in the context of healthy brain development and aging has shifted to measuring longitudinal trajectories. In such cases, the naïve application of ComBat is flawed and methodological research is necessary for appropriate harmonization tools to be developed. Furthermore, more complex nested study design in which multiple scanners are used per institution, or a subset of subjects are imaged on multiple scanners for harmonization purposes, are increasingly common. Another key area of interest in modern neuroimaging studies is to focus on inter-region structural or functional connectivity and uses multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) to improve our understanding of phenotypic associations as well as for personalized predictions. Unfortunately, the current state-of-the-art in image harmonization ignores correlation structure between measurements, and thus inter- scanner differences often persist.  In this project, we propose a new generation of techniques that are applicable under complex study designs and harmonize appropriately for studies involving applications of MVPA. In our final aim of this proposal, we will apply the methods developed for more complex study designs and MVPA in the context of two of the largest NIH-funded multi-center consortia across the lifespan. PROJECT NARRATIVE Over the past decade, the number of large multi-center neuroimaging studies has skyrocketed due to growing investments by federal governments and private entities interested in brain development, aging, and pathology. This has led to the accumulation of vast amounts of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data acquired using various study designs, but the statistical methodology necessary for harmonizing these data for integrated analyses is currently lacking. In this project, we propose to develop, implement, and apply next-generation imaging harmonization methods for data acquired longitudinally or from more complex study designs, as well as appropriate harmonization methods for use in conjunction with popular multivariate pattern analysis techniques.",Harmonization of Multi-Site Neuroimaging Data from Complex Study Designs,10028642,R01MH123550,"['Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adopted', 'Adoption', 'Advocate', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Area', 'Atrophic', 'Benchmarking', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Conceptions', 'Controlled Study', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Dwarfism', 'Federal Government', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression', 'Generations', 'Genomics', 'Gold', 'Image', 'Imaging Phantoms', 'Institution', 'Intelligence', 'Investments', 'Liquid substance', 'Location', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manufacturer Name', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Multicenter Studies', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Pathology', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Privatization', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reproducibility', 'Research Design', 'Research Methodology', 'Sex Differences', 'Site', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Thick', 'Travel', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'cognitive development', 'combat', 'complex data ', 'data harmonization', 'design', 'gray matter', 'healthy aging', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging modality', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'instrument', 'interest', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'neuroimaging', 'next generation', 'novel', 'personalized predictions', 'predictive modeling', 'stem', 'tool', 'white matter']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2020,602030,0.00019105639176226067
"Rapid Robust Pediatric MRI Project Abstract Motivation: This is a competing renewal of our successful project, Rapid Robust Pediatric MRI, R01 EB009690. MRI offers superb soft tissue contrast for children, without the ionizing radiation and cancer risk of CT. However, MRI use has been limited due to long exams, low spatial resolution, and motion-artifacts. Thus, MRI often requires prolonged anesthesia with breath-holds and attendant risk; hence, children often lack the beneﬁts of cross-sectional imaging altogether or are exposed to ionizing radiation. The previous project addressed these concerns by creating a dedicated pediatric imaging system. Highly par- allel, high-SNR 3T receive coil arrays were designed and constructed speciﬁcally for pediatric body imaging. The high SNR was used to accelerate scans reconstructed with a combination of parallel imaging, new mo- tion correction algorithms, compressed sensing (CS), and higher dimensional imaging. The resulting system is now being used extensively in clinical practice, signiﬁcantly reducing anesthesia depth and duration, and has markedly increased our MRI utilization. Key technologies have been or are now being commercialized with GE Healthcare, including the pediatric receive array, CS, 4D ﬂow, full-Fourier single-shot T2-weighted scanning, and coil compression. Siemens has licensed ﬁve of our patents, implemented them in work-in-progress packages, and productized our coil compression and our ESPIRiT coil sensitivity estimation. Philips has licensed three of our patents. This ensures broad impact. Approach: Despite signiﬁcant progress and reduced anesthesia depth and duration, patient cooperation re- mains the main limitation to eliminate anesthesia in all pediatric body MRI exams. Many children will cooperate for several minutes, but then ﬁdget and get out of the scanner. Others are content until acoustic noise agi- tates them. Therefore the major emphasis now is greater exam execution speed, comprehensive elimination of acoustic noise, and increased robustness, particularly to contrast agent injection. The project has three interrelated development aims, validated by clinical studies. Aim 1 will enable fast 2D imag- ing for quiet T2 and quiet low-distortion diffusion weighted imaging. A second aim is to develop free-breathing 3D contrast-enhanced and diffusion-weighted imaging that is silent and motion-robust. The third aim will enable au- tomated, smart scanning to speed the exam execution and adaptive protocols to increase the exam robustness. The impact of all of these developments in the clinic will then be assessed to assess the resulting reduction of anesthesia. Signiﬁcance: This work will lead to fast, robust, broadly-applicable pediatric MRI protocols with less anes- thesia, making MRI safer, cheaper, and more available to children. MRI will be transformed into a workhorse modality, reducing CT radiation burden. The techniques will facilitate wide application in the community setting and permit new MRI applications, for both pediatric and adult diseases. Project Narrative Pediatric MRI often requires anesthesia. After considerable progress reducing the depth and duration of anes- thesia, this work aims to reduce the frequency of anesthesia through a synergistic combination of fast, quiet, motion-robust, automated, and adaptive scanning. This will make MRI safer, cheaper, and more widely available to children, reducing the population risk of radiation from CT.",Rapid Robust Pediatric MRI,9927622,R01EB009690,"['3-Dimensional', 'Acoustics', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Anesthesia procedures', 'Body part', 'Bolus Infusion', 'Breathing', 'Child', 'Child Health', 'Childhood', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Computational Technique', 'Consumption', 'Contrast Media', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Ensure', 'Exposure to', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Image', 'Image Compression', 'Image Enhancement', 'Injections', 'Ionizing radiation', 'Legal patent', 'Letters', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Motivation', 'Noise', 'Patients', 'Pediatric Oncology', 'Pediatrics', 'Population', 'Protocols documentation', 'Radiation', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Running', 'Scanning', 'Speed', 'System', 'T2 weighted imaging', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Time', 'Transplantation', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'cancer risk', 'clinical practice', 'clinical translation', 'community setting', 'compliance behavior', 'contrast enhanced', 'data quality', 'design and construction', 'experience', 'high dimensionality', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging system', 'innovation', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'patient tolerability', 'pediatric patients', 'programs', 'radiation risk', 'reconstruction', 'skills', 'soft tissue', 'volunteer']",NIBIB,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,664041,0.02731386948418208
"Aging eyes and aging brains in studying alzheimer's disease: Modern ophthalmic data collection in the adult changes in thought (ACT) study PROJECT SUMMARY ABSTRACT The overarching goals of this R01 proposal are to improve scientific understanding of potential mechanisms by which ophthalmic diseases lead to the risk of Alzheimer’s disease. The investigators will leverage modern ophthalmic data with state-of-the-art imaging and extensive archived clinical data from a well-characterized cohort of older adults. The investigators propose to examine the effect of structural and functional changes in retina and longitudinal severity of ophthalmic diseases on Alzheimer’s disease and related neuropathology. The proposal builds on the resources of the Adult Changes in Thought (ACT) study, a prospective longitudinal, population-based, dementia-free cohort of over 5,500 people to date established in 1994 which has detected >1,014 research quality diagnoses of Alzheimer’s disease and >1,254 dementia to date. ACT follows consenting participants to autopsy and has performed state-of-the arts autopsy on >781 decedents to date. In this extremely well-characterized cohort, the investigators found that several ophthalmic diseases (diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma, age-related macular degeneration) are significantly associated with the risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease. The investigators will use three advanced ophthalmic imaging modalities at both home and clinical research study visits: fundus photography, optical coherence tomography (OCT), and OCT angiography (OCTA), to obtain quantitative data relevant to these ophthalmic diseases. The study team will establish the distribution (Aim 1a) and 2- and 4-year evolution of ophthalmic imaging characteristics found in older adults in the community and determine associations with change in cognition (Aim 1 b, c). Additionally, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and MRI angiography (MRA) will be obtained in a subset of participants to investigate the contribution of small (retinal) and large (cerebral) vascular disease towards cognitive changes (Aim 1d). The study team will continue ACT study’s strong commitment for meaningful data sharing. In collaboration with the Laboratory of Neuro Imaging at University of Southern California, the study team will promulgate these ophthalmic data in addition to neuroimaging data to the research community (Aim 1e). In Aim 2, the investigators will use extensive clinical ophthalmology data captured over many decades and incorporate them in novel longitudinal models of eye disease severity. The investigators will analyze eye disease severity along with extensive neuropathology data from the ACT study, including both standard (Aim 2a) and novel quantitative (Aim 2b) neuropathology data, to further scientific understanding of neuropathological mechanisms underlying associations between eye conditions and Alzheimer’s disease risk. The brain is not amenable to direct observations during life. In contrast, the eye is an anterior extension of the central nervous system and may provide a valuable window to illuminate neurodegenerative processes in the aging brain. Proposed investigations will substantially enhance scientific understanding of the role of modern ophthalmic evaluations in delineating risk of Alzheimer's disease and other forms of neuropathology. PROJECT NARRATIVE Using a large, well-characterized, longitudinal, prospective, cohort study, the study team previously found that diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma, and age-related macular degeneration were significantly associated with Alzheimer’s disease risk. The team proposes to use three cutting edge ophthalmic imaging modalities to obtain quantitative data at both home and clinic research study visits in addition to MRI and MRA in a subset of participants to evaluate their associations with change in cognition over time (Aim 1). The team will leverage extensive ophthalmic clinical and neuropathological data already available for 781 study participants to date as well as new state-of-the-art quantitative measures of beta amyloid (Aβ1-42) and phosphorylated tau to elucidate mechanisms underlying associations between ophthalmic conditions and Alzheimer’s disease (Aim 2).",Aging eyes and aging brains in studying alzheimer's disease: Modern ophthalmic data collection in the adult changes in thought (ACT) study,10005108,R01AG060942,"['Adult', 'Age related macular degeneration', 'Age-associated memory impairment', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease diagnosis', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Amyloid beta-Protein', 'Angiography', 'Anterior', 'Archives', 'Autopsy', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Vessels', 'Brain', 'California', 'Cerebrovascular Disorders', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognition', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Consent', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Dementia', 'Diabetic Retinopathy', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Drusen', 'Elderly', 'Evaluation', 'Evolution', 'Eye', 'Eye diseases', 'Fundus', 'Fundus photography', 'Ganglion Cell Layer', 'Glaucoma', 'Goals', 'Home environment', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Investigation', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Magnetic Resonance Angiography', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Microvascular Dysfunction', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Nerve Fibers', 'Neuraxis', 'Occipital lobe', 'Ophthalmology', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Participant', 'Pathology', 'Perfusion', 'Persons', 'Predisposition', 'Process', 'Prospective cohort study', 'Provider', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Retina', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Selection Bias', 'Series', 'Severities', 'Severity of illness', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Universities', 'Vascular Diseases', 'Visit', 'aging brain', 'area striata', 'automated algorithm', 'base', 'cognitive change', 'cohort', 'data sharing', 'deep learning', 'diagnosis quality', 'epidemiology study', 'fiber cell', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropathology', 'novel', 'paired helical filament', 'population based', 'prospective', 'public repository', 'research study', 'resilience', 'tau Proteins', 'tau-1', 'vascular contributions']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2020,3349913,-0.048629584263033904
"Advanced MR Imaging and Image Analytics as a Precision Medicine Tool to Manage ADPKD ABSTRACT The goal of this NIDDK Mentored Research Scientist Development Award is to provide an organized scientific and educational environment for Dr. Timothy Kline to begin his transition into an independent research career focused on developing novel imaging technologies and image analysis techniques for abdominal organ pathologies. This proposal outlines a five-year training plan at Mayo Clinic under the primary mentorship of Dr. Bradley Erickson and a Mentoring Team comprised of accomplished researchers in the fields of: biology, nephrology, genetics, radiology, informatics; medical physics, biostatistics, image processing, and physiology. The focus of this proposal is to improve both research studies and disease prognosis for autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) patients through biomedical imaging techniques. It is well understood that imaging is essential for ADPKD diagnosis, monitoring, and outcome prediction. Clinical studies utilize total kidney volume (TKV) (as measured by MRI as an image-based biomarker) to follow the progression of ADPKD, as larger TKVs have been shown to correlate with worse prognosis in both human and animal-model studies. However, there are challenges with using TKV as a marker of disease progression. For one, it is a simplification of the disease state and does not inform on microscopic disease processes that are involved with piecemeal destruction of healthy renal tissue. In addition, measurements of TKVs are time consuming, costly, and poorly standardized. The introduction of automated approaches for measuring TKV will: greatly improve measurement throughput, significantly reduce costs associated with performing research studies, allow accurate and reproducible measurements to be obtained both within and across institutions; facilitate the search for new imaging biomarkers. The specific aims of this project are to: (i) develop and validate automated tools to characterize renal structure, such as TKV and cystic burden; (ii) explore new imaging biomarkers by image texture feature analysis and pattern recognition techniques; and (iii) develop a new technique to measure renal blood flow. This research will be facilitated by Mayo Clinic's outstanding clinical and research environment dedicated to improving patient care, as well as the Mayo Clinic Translational PKD Center, which focuses on translating basic science research into improvements in the management and treatment of ADPKD patients. Dr. Kline's background in imaging technologies and image processing makes him particularly suited to perform this research. In addition to the above aims, Dr. Kline will: 1) develop a strong knowledge base in both nephrology and radiology by attending relevant rounds, seminars, and national conferences; 2) enhance his knowledge of medical imaging, biology, physiology, genetics, and programming through coursework and mentoring; 3) attend workshops focused on grant and publication writing; and 4) submit a highly competitive R01 application expanding upon the findings from this research proposal. This proposal will lead to vast improvements to current analysis workflows, as well as an improved understanding of the prognostic power of new imaging biomarkers of ADPKD. Obtaining this K Award will greatly facilitate Dr. Kline's transition into a prosperous independent research career. Narrative Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is one of the most common monogenic disorders and is a leading cause of end-stage renal disease. Total kidney volume (TKV) has become the main image-based biomarker for following ADPKD progression. However, there are challenges with using TKV as a marker of disease progression. For one, it is a simplification of the disease state and does not inform on microscopic disease processes that are involved with piecemeal destruction of healthy renal tissue. In addition, measurements of TKVs are time consuming and costly. This project will develop automated tools to increase measurement throughput, and explore new image-based biomarkers that will significantly add to the assessment of patient prognosis, and will have the ability to more quickly judge the effectiveness of interventions.",Advanced MR Imaging and Image Analytics as a Precision Medicine Tool to Manage ADPKD,10011565,K01DK110136,"['3-Dimensional', 'Abdomen', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Anatomy', 'Animals', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney', 'Basic Science', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Biometry', 'Blood Vessels', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Research', 'Consumption', 'Cyst', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Disease Marker', 'Disease Progression', 'Educational workshop', 'Effectiveness of Interventions', 'End stage renal failure', 'Environment', 'FarGo', 'Fibrosis', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Programming', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Grant', 'Hepatic Cyst', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Imaging technology', 'Informatics', 'Institution', 'Intervention', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Kidney', 'Knowledge', 'Liver', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Mendelian disorder', 'Mentored Research Scientist Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Microscopic', 'Monitor', 'National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases', 'Nephrology', 'Organ', 'Pathology', 'Patient Care', 'Patient imaging', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Performance', 'Perfusion', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physics', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Physiology', 'Polycystic Kidney Diseases', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publications', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Renal Blood Flow', 'Renal Tissue', 'Renal function', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Proposals', 'Resolution', 'Spin Labels', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Study models', 'Suggestion', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Treatment Effectiveness', 'Writing', 'automated segmentation', 'base', 'bioimaging', 'career', 'clinical practice', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'disease diagnosis', 'educational atmosphere', 'functional decline', 'human model', 'image processing', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'insight', 'interest', 'kidney vascular structure', 'knowledge base', 'novel imaging technology', 'outcome forecast', 'outcome prediction', 'precision medicine', 'pressure', 'prognostic value', 'radiological imaging', 'renal artery', 'research study', 'shear stress', 'symposium', 'tool']",NIDDK,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,K01,2020,154915,0.0295009573866628
