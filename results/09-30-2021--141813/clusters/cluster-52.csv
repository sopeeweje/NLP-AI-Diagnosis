"Identifying Children and Teens at Risk for Early Onset Alcohol Use: An Innovative Application of Machine Learning Algorithms to Prevention PROJECT SUMMARY Early onset of alcohol use during adolescence is associated with increased probability of later alcohol dependence, polydrug abuse, victimization, conduct problems, psychiatric comorbidities, and delayed achievement of adult milestones. Methods that yield rapid, accurate, and reliable predictions of which children and teens are at risk for early onset can improve the targeting of prevention interventions and enable the concentration of resources on the most debilitating and costly cases. One promising and untapped approach to this prediction problem is machine learning (also called “statistical learning,” “data mining,” or “predictive modeling”), a class of techniques arising from statistics, computer science, and engineering that seeks to build data-driven predictive algorithms. These techniques are most noticeably distinguished from “traditional” statistical methods (e.g., ordinary least squares regression) by their extreme emphasis on prediction of future cases, rather than explanation of the current data, and thus they may offer dramatic advantages over traditional approaches to identifying which children and teens will develop early onset alcohol use. This proposal will explore the potential contribution of machine learning methods by directly comparing their predictive performance to that of the traditional approach in a large-scale, multisite longitudinal study of the development of early onset alcohol use (N = 731). If machine learning methods do significantly outperform the traditional approach, future directions might include the development and implementation of machine-learning- based screening methods for real-world use. On the other hand, if machine learning methods do not outperform the traditional approach, this will suggest that at least in the context of the present study (i.e., these predictors, timeline, and outcome), machine learning does not improve the prediction of early onset alcohol use. Analyses will investigate whether the performance of machine learning methods varies across the nature of predictor variables use, the age span covered, and the outcome to be predicted. Thus, the current proposal uses an extant longitudinal dataset to carry out two specific aims: (1) Train five different machine learning algorithms and one traditional algorithm (ordinary logistic regression) for predicting later early onset alcohol use in a subset (70%) of the data. (2) Test these six predictive algorithms on the rest (30%) of the data and directly compare their predictive performance in multiple contexts. PROJECT NARRATIVE Prospectively predicting which children and teens are at risk for early onset alcohol use enables targeted implementation of preventive interventions. Machine learning is a promising yet untapped approach that may be well-suited to this task. This study investigates the potential of several machine learning algorithms to contribute to the rapid, accurate, and reliable identification of individuals at risk for early onset alcohol use.",Identifying Children and Teens at Risk for Early Onset Alcohol Use: An Innovative Application of Machine Learning Algorithms to Prevention,9753696,F31AA026768,"['Achievement', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Advertising', 'Age', 'Alcohol abuse', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohol dependence', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Attention', 'Behavioral', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Cocaine Dependence', 'Comorbidity', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Engineering', 'Fraud', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Impulsivity', 'Individual', 'Lasso', 'Least-Squares Analysis', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Performance', 'Prevention', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Probability', 'Procedures', 'Public Health', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Services', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Techniques', 'Teenagers', 'Testing', 'TimeLine', 'Training', 'Victimization', 'Work', 'addiction', 'alcohol screening', 'base', 'classification trees', 'computer science', 'conduct problem', 'cost', 'data mining', 'early alcohol use', 'early onset', 'field study', 'improved', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'longitudinal dataset', 'machine learning algorithm', 'multidrug abuse', 'outcome prediction', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'psychologic', 'random forest', 'screening', 'search engine', 'spam', 'speech recognition', 'statistics', 'success', 'underage drinking', 'vector']",NIAAA,ARIZONA STATE UNIVERSITY-TEMPE CAMPUS,F31,2019,43749,0.13235994120542574
"Applying Machine Learning in the Prediction and Identification of Children Affected by Prenatal Alcohol Exposure Project summary Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD), which are caused by prenatal alcohol exposure, occur in up to 5% of the population in the United States, and are associated with lifelong disability. There are multiple difficulties in obtaining an accurate diagnosis of FASD, including subtlety of physical features and heterogeneity in presentation. Consequently, FASD is grossly under-recognized, and the majority of affected children never receive a diagnosis. If FASD could be diagnosed earlier and with more reliability, many years of beneficial intervention would not be lost. The objective of this research is to apply machine learning to high-dimensional data in well-characterized data sets to predict or characterize children with FASD. The central hypothesis of this research is that the application of machine learning will accurately predict and recognize FASD compared with expert clinical diagnosis. To test this hypothesis, machine learning will be employed to: 1) characterize FASD based on the presence of non-cardinal malformations, 2) establish multivariate predictors of FASD in preschool aged children, and 3) identify diagnosis specific neurodevelopmental markers that distinguish alcohol related neurodevelopmental deficits from neurodevelopmental deficits without prenatal exposure. Two secondary data sources will be used in this proposal; a prospective study of 400 pregnant women and their offspring in Ukraine (half of whom consumed high amounts of alcohol) with full clinical evaluations for FASD, and a cross- sectional study of over 2,900 first grade children in four regions of the U.S., all with clinical FASD evaluations. Upon successful completion of the proposed research, the expected contribution is for more accurate prediction and recognition of children with FASD. The proposed research is innovative, as it represents a departure from current practice by incorporating machine learning techniques into predictive models of FASD. As a perinatal epidemiologist, I have a strong foundation in analytic techniques, and the advanced training in machine learning will further enhance these skills. Additionally, the disease-focused training in dysmorphology and neurodevelopment will provide a strong foundation to make significant contributions to the field of FASD research. Finally, training and mentoring in grant writing and the responsible conduct of research will provide a strong foundation to transition to an independent researcher. This proposed research builds on previous NIAAA funded research by my interdisciplinary mentoring team, who are all strongly supportive of this research and training plan. This seminal application of machine learning to FASD research will demonstrate its capacity to predict and identify affected children, ultimately leading to earlier intervention of children prenatally exposed to alcohol. Narrative Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) are common and result in lifelong disabilities; however, they are clini- cally difficult to identify, and the vast majority of children with FASD are undiagnosed or misdiagnosed. The proposed research will leverage recent advances in machine learning to better identify children with FASD. These advances would lead to earlier identification and intervention in the lives of children prenatally exposed to alcohol, which can improve their developmental outcomes.",Applying Machine Learning in the Prediction and Identification of Children Affected by Prenatal Alcohol Exposure,9805491,K01AA027811,"['Affect', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohols', 'Algorithms', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Consumption', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Dysmorphology', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Epidemiologist', 'Epidemiology', 'Evaluation', 'Fetal Alcohol Exposure', 'Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Growth', 'Heterogeneity', 'Infant', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism', 'Neurodevelopmental Deficit', 'Neuropsychology', 'Nursery Schools', 'Nutritional', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Perinatal', 'Population', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnant Women', 'Process', 'Prospective Studies', 'Provider', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Sampling', 'Seminal', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Ukraine', 'United States', 'Writing', 'accurate diagnosis', 'aged', 'alcohol exposure', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'disability', 'fetal diagnosis', 'first grade', 'improved', 'infancy', 'innovation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'malformation', 'multidimensional data', 'neurodevelopment', 'novel strategies', 'offspring', 'predictive modeling', 'prenatal', 'prenatal exposure', 'research clinical testing', 'responsible research conduct', 'skills', 'sociodemographics', 'success']",NIAAA,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",K01,2019,164791,0.11209409744176738
"Development of a novel photocatalytic system for direct deoxyfunctionalization of alcohols involving machine learning Project Summary Development of general and efficient methods for functionalization of alcohols is highly warranted due to the ubiquity and prominence of this functional group in natural products. Such methods would allow for late-stage diversification of complex molecules and, consequently, could have a broad impact in natural product synthesis and preparation of relevant pharmaceutical materials. However, owing to the chemical inertness of alcohols, most methods typically require installation of activating groups for functionalization, making them unattractive from an atom- and step-economical perspective. Nonetheless, many advances have been made. In particular, the Barton-McCombie reaction has become an indispensable tool for reductive functionalization of alcohols. Unfortunately, this transformation requires pre- functionalization of the alcohol substrate, employs highly toxic tin reagents, and invokes the use high reaction temperatures or harmful UV light for initiation of radical intermediates. Furthermore, the overall transformation is limited to H-atom incorporation or reductive coupling with alkenes. Lastly, only a few deoxygenation methods exist that are amenable for late-stage and site-selective deoxygenation in complex systems. Moreover, physical organic chemistry tools available to facilitate the selection of a set of conditions or parameters to afford site-selectivity are limited. In this proposal, we will develop a mild and practical photocatalytic deoxygenation of alcohols. Our strategy will focus on solving the inherent limitation of the Barton McCombie reaction by 1) avoiding the use of toxic tin reagents, 2) obviating the need for pre-functionalization of the alcohol substrate, and 3) allowing for modular coupling of formed alkyl radicals via Ni-catalysis. Specific aim 1 explores the development of a novel photoredox-catalyzed deoxygenation of alcohols. In addition, we outline a general protocol for deoxyfunctionalization of alcohols via inception of the alkyl radical intermediate, formed via β-scission, with various radical electrophiles. Moreover, we highlight an innovative method for the direct cross-coupling of alcohols via metallophotoredox catalysis in both racemic and enantioselective fashion. Specific aim 2 addresses the design strategy for implementing physical chemistry techniques such as Machine Learning in order to facilitate optimization and prediction of reaction performance in multi-dimensional chemical space. Also, we outline applying this strategy to identify a set of optimal conditions to confer site-selective functionalization in complex polyols. Project Narrative Mild and site-controlled deoxygenation of alcohols could significantly accelerate the late-stage synthesis/diversification of important organic molecules; however, current methods often employ toxic tin reagents, harsh reaction conditions, and require prefunctionalization of the alcohols employed. The strategy proposed would allow for a mild photocatalytic deoxygenation, as well as deoxyfunctionalization, of alcohols that solves the aforementioned limitations of prior art. Moreover, the proposed strategy outlines implementation of physical organic chemistry tools Machine Learning in order to facilitate optimization and prediction of reaction performance in multi-dimensional chemical space.",Development of a novel photocatalytic system for direct deoxyfunctionalization of alcohols involving machine learning,9759306,F32GM129910,"['Address', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohols', 'Alkenes', 'Arts', 'Catalysis', 'Chemicals', 'Complex', 'Coupling', 'Development', 'Employment', 'Intercept', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Natural Products', 'Organic Chemistry', 'Organic Synthesis', 'Performance', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Phosphines', 'Physical Chemistry', 'Preparation', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reaction', 'Reagent', 'Site', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Temperature', 'Tin', 'Ultraviolet Rays', 'Visible Radiation', 'alcohol involvement', 'catalyst', 'design', 'functional group', 'innovation', 'novel', 'polyol', 'predictive tools', 'tool']",NIGMS,PRINCETON UNIVERSITY,F32,2019,61226,0.17664063032201302
"Machine Learning for Computerized Surveillance of Tobacco and Alcohol Brands in Streamed Entertainment Media Consumption of cancer causing products (CCPs) is the root cause of many of the cancers and chronic diseases we aim to cure with translational medicine. Tobacco and alcohol consumption is a function of highly successful, coordinated global business models that promote consumption. The marketing of CCPs can be seen as a disease vector that drives CCP consumption and worthy of surveillance. The present project addresses the marketing of tobacco and alcohol to young people in the current media environment, in which youths increasingly stream their entertainment in a relatively commercial free environment. To address decreasing reach of traditional advertising, companies have sought to embed their brands in the entertainment itself. Alcohol companies actively seek entertainment placement deals. While cigarette companies have agreed not to pay for product placement, they may evade current restrictions by burying placements in the massive streamed entertainment environment. E-cigarette companies have no such restrictions and advertise on television. Youths obtain exposure to brands that spend more on advertising (e.g., Budweiser); these are also the most commonly consumed brands by youth. Product placement exposures may put adolescents at greater risk for CCP consumption. This study represents the first step in assessing that risk--to obtain infoveillance on CCP brand prevalence in streamed entertainment media. Aim 1 involves a partnership with machine learning researchers at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) to develop and validate a computer recognition system for major cigarette, e-cigarette, and alcohol brands in streamed entertainment media. Aim 1 relies on an existing, large Dartmouth media training library that includes detailed timing for tobacco and alcohol brands from over 2000 contemporary movies. JPL researchers will use the Dartmouth media library, combined with a large corpus of brand logos retrieved from the web, to train and validate an automated Video Content Coding (VCC) system that identifies content associated with key alcohol and tobacco brands. The VCC system will leverage recent techniques to construct robust object detection systems using Convolutional Neural Networks built on large image databases, along with text extraction methods to identify brand names in advertising logos. Second, we will deploy the automated recognition system on the Dartmouth computer cluster to assess the frequency of major cigarette, e-cigarette, and alcohol brand placements from a large sample of streamed/cable and movie entertainment. This proposal involves a unique multidisciplinary team of Dartmouth behavioral scientists and NASA machine learning scientists who will leverage new technologies to study a significant CCP marketing platform. The novel approach offers unprecedented opportunities to conduct surveillance on CCP marketing in large media samples. Our project will set the stage for future research on exposure to this type of marketing and its relation to CCP consumption in youths and lead to a better understanding of the risks CCP brand placements pose to health. Project Narrative This project addresses the potential exposure of youth to marketing of cancer causing products— tobacco and alcohol— in the popular commercial-free streaming environment, where products are embedded in the media itself through product placement. We will employ machine learning to develop an automated visual recognition system for major tobacco and alcohol brands and deploy that system to evaluate brand placement in a large sample of streamed entertainment from cable (e.g., HBO) and other (e.g., Netflix Originals) companies. This surveillance program will have the capability to monitor embedded marketing across many platforms and ultimately allow us to assess youth exposure to embedded brands and its relation with early onset of tobacco and alcohol use.",Machine Learning for Computerized Surveillance of Tobacco and Alcohol Brands in Streamed Entertainment Media,9656103,R01CA225845,"['Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adopted', 'Advertising', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcoholic Beverages', 'Alcohols', 'Attitude', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Businesses', 'Cancer Control', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Cigarette', 'Code', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communication', 'Communication Methods', 'Communication Research', 'Computers', 'Consumption', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Disease', 'Disease Vectors', 'Electronic cigarette', 'Environment', 'Epidemic', 'Exposure to', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heart Diseases', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Image', 'Immersion Investigative Technique', 'Influenza', 'Internet', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Life Style', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Marketing', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Names', 'Perception', 'Plant Roots', 'Play', 'Prevalence', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scientific Inquiry', 'Scientist', 'Shapes', 'Smoking', 'Stream', 'Surveillance Program', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Television', 'Text', 'Time', 'Tobacco', 'Tobacco Surveillance', 'Tobacco use', 'Training', 'United States', 'United States National Aeronautics and Space Administration', 'Visual', 'Work', 'Youth', 'cancer risk', 'cohort', 'computer cluster', 'computerized', 'convolutional neural network', 'drinking', 'early onset', 'handheld mobile device', 'innovation', 'movie', 'movie exposure', 'multidisciplinary', 'new technology', 'novel strategies', 'programs', 'response', 'tobacco advertising', 'tobacco exposure', 'tobacco products', 'translational medicine']",NCI,DARTMOUTH COLLEGE,R01,2019,531248,0.06607829687661819
"Estimating BrAC/BAC from Transdermal Alcohol: Combining First-Principles Physiological Models with Machine-Learning to Create Software to Optimally Process and Quantitatively Interpret Biosensor Data Abstract Transdermal alcohol biosensors offer a promising method for unobtrusively collecting continuous alcohol levels in naturalistic settings over long periods of time. Devices are now available to reliably measure transdermal alcohol concentration (TAC), the amount of alcohol diffusing through the skin, but an often overlooked yet critical issue for making these biosensors valuable is that TAC does not consistently correlate with the easily interpretable measures of breath and blood alcohol concentrations (BrAC/BAC) across individuals, environmental conditions, and devices. The goal of this study is to produce software to convert TAC data into estimates of BrAC/BAC (eBrAC/eBAC). We will meet this goal by 1) developing mathematical models to produce quantitative eBrAC from TAC data, 2) examining alternative options for calibrating these models, 3) testing the model fits using varied types and amounts of very precise data, and 4) packaging the models into a comprehensive data assimilation software program. Specifically, we will enhance the fidelity of the models by integrating advanced physics/physiological-based models with statistical methods and data-driven machine- learning techniques. To reduce the burden currently required to calibrate the models for each individual, we will test a number of calibration procedures, including the replacement of the laboratory alcohol administration session with more varied drinking protocols as well as with population-based parameter estimates. We will test our models and protocols using detailed consumption data collected 1) on two of the investigators, 2) on 40 participants who will each participate in four controlled laboratory drinking sessions, and 3) on 40 participants who will each participate in a field trial and laboratory sessions. We will examine model fits across drinking patterns when using varying amounts of individualized alcohol data (e.g., breath analyzer, drink diary) to calibrate the models, and within and across individuals with differing characteristics (e.g., gender, weight) and under variable conditions (e.g., humidity, heart rate) that may affect model fit. We will create a data assimilation software system, the BrAC Estimator software, that incorporates all available data to produce the most accurate eBrAC measures. The software output will include the identification of drinking episodes, continuous eBrAC signal, and eBrAC summary scores (e.g., peak eBrAC, time of peak eBrAC, area under the drinking curve) with confidence bands. The software will be platform-portable to run alone or to be integrated into other mobile health technologies or precision medicine protocols. This proposal is innovative, technologically sophisticated, and feasible, and would result in the first tool to accomplish the TAC-eBrAC conversion, finally making it possible to obtain interpretable quantitative measurement of naturalistic alcohol consumption in the field. The anticipated result of this study is the expanded utility of TAC biosensors for researchers, clinicians, and individuals to monitor naturalistic alcohol consumption and easily understand the results. Narrative This research program will advance mathematical models and methodological techniques to make it possible to obtain quantitative estimates of breath and blood alcohol concentration levels from the data produced by transdermal alcohol sensors. By making these methodological advancements available in software programs for use by non-mathematicians, the proposed study has the capability of widely enhancing the alcohol research community’s ability to investigate a variety of alcohol-related research topics that cannot be captured retrospectively or in laboratory settings, including naturalistic patterns of consumption, individual differences in response to alcohol, real-time drinking behavior and decisions, clinical intervention outcomes, and the prevention and treatment of alcoholism. More broadly, the software can be integrated with personal health monitoring systems for general public use and provide easily interpreted personalized alcohol consumption feedback.",Estimating BrAC/BAC from Transdermal Alcohol: Combining First-Principles Physiological Models with Machine-Learning to Create Software to Optimally Process and Quantitatively Interpret Biosensor Data,9675194,R01AA026368,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohols', 'Area', 'Area Under Curve', 'Assimilations', 'Bacterial Artificial Chromosomes', 'Biosensor', 'Blood alcohol level measurement', 'Calibration', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Concentration measurement', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diffuse', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Feedback', 'Galvanic Skin Response', 'Gender', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Technology', 'Heart Rate', 'Humidity', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Linear Models', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Physics', 'Physiological', 'Plug-in', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reading', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Running', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Skin', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Temperature', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Uncertainty', 'Weight', 'Work', 'alcohol measurement', 'alcohol research', 'alcohol response', 'alcoholism therapy', 'base', 'breath alcohol measurement', 'data reduction', 'diaries', 'drinking', 'drinking behavior', 'improved', 'innovation', 'mHealth', 'mathematical methods', 'mathematical model', 'physiologic model', 'population based', 'portability', 'precision medicine', 'programs', 'sensor', 'software systems', 'supervised learning', 'time interval', 'time use', 'tool', 'unsupervised learning']",NIAAA,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,R01,2019,508222,0.18128072068629023
"Connectome-based prediction and neurodevelopmental trajectories of alcohol phenotypes across development Abstract Alcohol initiation at an early age is associated with numerous negative outcomes, including a significant increase in the risk of developing an alcohol-use disorder later in life. Vulnerability for early misuse and other problematic alcohol use behaviors have been linked to individual differences in brain function. However, few studies have sought to identify brain-based predictors (‘neuromarkers’) of alcohol use behaviors in youth. Identification of brain-based predictors of alcohol use behaviors in youth is essential for the development of more effective early prevention and intervention efforts. This proposal combines machine learning and longitudinal modeling approaches to 1) identify neural networks predictive of early alcohol initiation and misuse and 2) chart the developmental trajectories of these networks over time in a large sample of youth (N>3,000) using data from three unique, proprietary and completed datasets. Neural networks conferring vulnerability for alcohol use behaviors during adolescence will be identified using connectome-based predictive modeling (CPM). CPM is a machine-learning method of generating behavioral predictions from individual patterns of brain organization; i.e., functional connectivity matrices. Unlike traditional machine learning approaches, CPM is entirely data-driven and requires no a priori selection of brain regions or networks. As such, CPM is both a predictive tool and a method of identifying networks that underlie specific behaviors; i.e., neuromarkers. CPM has been successfully used to predict complex behaviors including future abstinence and other addiction-relevant phenotypes. This proposal will use CPM to identify neuromarkers of alcohol initiation and predict transitions to risky drinking in youth (AIM 1). Quantification of changes in brain function, e.g., growth curve trajectory analysis, is central to the characterization of developmental phenomena. Analyses of developmental trajectories can be used to identify particularly sensitive growth periods, detect variations that may signal risk, define modifiable targets, and monitor the impact of environment and interventions on development. While extant data indicate alcohol-related alterations in neural development, very few studies have assessed interactions between neurodevelopmental trajectories over time and alcohol-use behaviors. Developmental trajectories of identified networks in relation to alcohol use behaviors over time will be assessed using multilevel modeling (AIM 2). This proposal represents the first attempt to identify neural networks predictive of alcohol-initiation and risky drinking using a wholly data- driven, machine learning approach in a large sample of youth and does so using existing data. This is a critical step toward identifying a reliable predictor of alcohol initiation in youth and will shed light on individual difference factors representing vulnerability for misuse. Such predictors are needed to understand the developmental trajectories of alcohol phenotypes and to inform early risk models and preventative intervention efforts. Project Narrative: Alcohol is the most commonly used substance in youth, and earlier ages of alcohol initiation are associated with increased likelihoods of alcohol-use disorder later in life. This project will identify brain networks that predict alcohol initiation and misuse—and chart the developmental trajectories of those networks over time— using existing neuroimaging data from three unique longitudinal datasets (N>3,000). Identification of brain- based predictors of alcohol initiation and misuse will aid in the development of targeted prevention and intervention efforts to address alcohol problems in youth.",Connectome-based prediction and neurodevelopmental trajectories of alcohol phenotypes across development,9713715,R01AA027553,"['Abstinence', 'Addictive Behavior', 'Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Age', 'Alcohol Phenotype', 'Alcohol abuse', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Alcohols', 'Anatomy', 'Base of the Brain', 'Behavior', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Clinical', 'Cohort Studies', 'Complex', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'European', 'Female', 'Fingerprint', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Genetic study', 'Growth', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Intervention', 'Life', 'Light', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Names', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Resolution', 'Rest', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Risk-Taking', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Sex Differences', 'Signal Transduction', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Work', 'Youth', 'addiction', 'alcohol misuse', 'alcohol research', 'alcohol use disorder', 'alcohol use initiation', 'base', 'behavior prediction', 'brain research', 'connectome', 'connectome based predictive modeling', 'financial incentive', 'follow-up', 'hazardous drinking', 'high risk', 'high risk drinking', 'imaging study', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'longitudinal dataset', 'male', 'multilevel analysis', 'multitask', 'neural network', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuroimaging', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive tools', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sex', 'theories', 'time use', 'university student', 'young adult']",NIAAA,YALE UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,463176,0.1812101840907266
"Developing a mobile alcohol biosensor platform for use in medication testing research PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT This mentored patient-oriented research career development award (K23) will enable Dr. Roberts to achieve his long-term career goal of becoming an independent clinical researcher working to develop pharmacotherapies for alcohol use disorder (AUD). This proposal outlines a 5-year training plan that supports a research program focused on developing a mobile biosensor platform for tracking medication effects on alcohol reactivity in ambulating outpatients. Training domains include 1) mobile biosensor assessment of alcohol use, 2) management and analysis of biosensor data, and 3) AUD pharmacotherapy development research. The training plan includes a strategic combination of mentor-led trainings; coursework in mobile health sensing, data science, statistics, bioethics, clinical research methods, and grant writing; attendance at relevant conferences and workshops; and collaboration with investigators conducting research in AUD pharmacotherapy development. The candidate will complete these training activities while completing a research program aimed at developing a mobile biosensor platform that can passively track alcohol consumption and deliver conditional assessments at key points during drinking episodes. In these preliminary studies, heavy drinkers with AUD will wear the mobile biosensors and receive alcohol in the laboratory. In Experiment 1, participants will receive two fixed doses of alcohol while wearing the biosensors and responding to prompted assessments. Goals of this experiment will be to 1) refine the machine-learning derived detection algorithms that will identify key points during drinking episodes and 2) evaluate the user experience and feasibility of delivering prompted assessments on a smartphone during drinking episodes. Experiment 2 will test the detection algorithms in a separate sample of freely behaving participants engaged in self-paced alcohol drinking. Results of these studies will serve as pilot data to support an R-mechanism application to develop a formal paradigm using the biosensor platform to track medication effects of alcohol use and reactivity in ambulating outpatients. Dr. Roberts has assembled an mentorship committee of leaders in the field. Dr. McKee (primary mentor) is a Professor of Psychiatry at the Yale University. She applies innovative laboratory paradigms to AUD pharmacotherapy development research, and she has several lines of research using mobile health biosensors to track substance use behavior. Dr. Ramchandani (primary co-mentor) is a clinical investigator and Chief of the Human Psychopharmacology Section at the NIAAA intramural research program. He will lead Dr. Roberts's training in alcohol pharmacokinetics. Drs. Gueorguieva, Petrakis, and Gerstein will serve as secondary mentors and contribute to Dr. Roberts's training in longitudinal data analysis, AUD pharmacotherapy clinical trials, and machine learning and data science, respectively. Drs. Miranda and Barnett will serve as external advisers and support Dr. Roberts's training in ambulatory assessment in the context of medication development research and transdermal alcohol detection, respectively.

"Elucidating the role of alternative polyadenylation in alcohol related phenotypes using a novel trans-omics computational approach Alcohol consumption is an etiologic essential for the development of alcohol use disorder and many alcohol pathologies. Despite evidence that genetic variations contribute to alcohol consumption, the genetic architecture remains poorly characterized. In terms of the genetic component, individual susceptibility to complex traits such as alcohol consumption arise mainly from variation in gene regulation. It has become increasingly clear in recent years that alternative polyadenylation (APA) – a mechanism by which a single gene encodes multiple RNA isoforms with different polyadenylation (polyA) sites – is extensively used to modulate gene regulation. An improved understanding of the genetic causes of predisposition to alcohol-related problems will facilitate a precision medicine approach through better prevention, diagnosis, and treatment.  Yet shortcomings in current methods for concurrent APA identification and RNA transcript quantitation in high-throughput short read RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) studies have limited our ability to study its genetic contributions to alcohol-related phenotypes. To remedy this, a novel trans-omics method and related software will be developed here that can precisely identify expressed polyA sites and accurately quantify individual isoforms including APA transcripts from a sequenced RNA-Seq library. Specifically, a supervised machine learning algorithm will be built that utilizes both RNA-Seq data and DNA sequence indicators to predict the locations of expressed polyA sites (Aim 1). The “use-all-data” approach will identify and quantify APA isoforms present in the data with greater precision than current, one-dimensional omics techniques. Furthermore, the algorithm will be designed for integration into existing bioinformatics pipelines for quantitation along with other RNA species (Aim 2).  To determine the influence of APA on the genetic predisposition to alcohol consumption, a systems genetics approach will be applied to relate brain RNA expression of the APA isoforms and other RNA molecules, including protein-coding, long non-coding, and microRNA (miRNA) transcripts, to alcohol consumption measures in a two-bottle choice paradigm (Aim 3). From this approach, if and how APA influences gene networks and susceptibility to miRNA regulation, what genetic factors control APA, and how APA may influence alcohol consumption can be evaluated.  An extensive fellowship training plan and a team of mentors with diverse skillsets will be utilized to accomplish the multidisciplinary research project. The result of this training will be an alcohol researcher with not only the latest bioinformatics and computational skills but also the knowledge and experience to interpret, refine, and improve these models in the context of alcohol research. By following a training plan that incorporates the best of both disciplines, this proposal will be an example of a new type of alcohol researcher that can harness big data in a disease relevant way. Understanding the role of alternative polyadenylation (APA) in alcohol-related phenotypes and pathologies will provide important insights into biological mechanisms related to alcohol for improved diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of alcohol-related problems. The proposed research will study the association of APA with a predisposition for free-choice alcohol consumption using a novel trans-omics computational approach.",Elucidating the role of alternative polyadenylation in alcohol related phenotypes using a novel trans-omics computational approach,9833879,F31AA027430,"['3&apos', ' Untranslated Regions', 'Adopted', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohols', 'Algorithms', 'Alternative Splicing', 'Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis', 'Benchmarking', 'Big Data', 'Binding Sites', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Etiology', 'Exhibits', 'Fabry Disease', 'Facioscapulohumeral', 'Fellowship', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genetic Variation', 'Global Change', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heart Hypertrophy', 'Heterogeneity', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Human', 'Inbreeding', 'Individual', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Knowledge', 'Libraries', 'Location', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Metachromatic Leukodystrophy', 'Methods', 'MicroRNAs', 'Modeling', 'Muscle', 'Neurons', 'Nuclear Export', 'Oculopharyngeal Muscular Dystrophy', 'Pathology', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Polyadenylation', 'Predisposition', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Protein Isoforms', 'Proteins', 'RNA', 'RNA Sequences', 'Rattus', 'Recombinants', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Side', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Software Tools', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Transcript', 'Translations', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'alcohol prevention', 'alcohol related problem', 'alcohol research', 'alcohol use disorder', 'bioinformatics tool', 'cohort', 'consumption measures', 'design', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic approach', 'genetic architecture', 'improved', 'insight', 'mRNA Stability', 'machine learning algorithm', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'novel', 'open source', 'personalized medicine', 'precision medicine', 'programs', 'skills', 'software development', 'supervised learning', 'tool', 'trait', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'treatment strategy', 'user-friendly']",NIAAA,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,F31,2019,30732,0.16756714843445866
": Complex systems analysis of the impact of alcohol on bone in non-human primates PROJECT SUMMARY Understanding the impact of alcohol consumption on bone health is important because alcohol influences bone metabolism and over half of the adult population in the United States drinks alcoholic beverages. Low to moderate levels of alcohol consumption are generally associated with beneficial skeletal effects while chronic alcohol abuse predisposes individuals to bone fractures. The long-term goal of our research is to delineate the primary mechanisms mediating the divergent skeletal effects of low/moderate and heavy alcohol consumption. An appreciation of the precise effects and mechanisms of action of alcohol on bone metabolism is important because of the enormous economic, social and personal burden associated with poor bone health. Progress in understanding the actions of alcohol on bone metabolism are hampered by (1) the extreme difficulty in performing intervention studies in humans, (2) limitations of commonly used animal models, (3) failure to adequately consider alcohol’s effects on tissue and organ systems that impact bone, and (4) difficulty in accurately replicating human drinking behavior in animals. The studies proposed in this R01 application will overcome limitations of human and prior animal studies by using a non-human primate (monkey) model for voluntary alcohol consumption that mimics the full range of human drinking behavior. We will use linear regression models, multivariate linear regression models, machine learning, and systems analysis to establish the impact of pattern of alcohol consumption (none, light/moderate, binge, heavy and very heavy) on bone metabolism in rhesus (Macaca mulatta; n=105) and cynomolgus (Macaca fascicularis; n=86) macaques in the context of sex, age and alcohol-induced perturbations in tissue and organ systems that can influence bone. We will identify the latter perturbations by determining the effect of alcohol on specific protein (e.g., peptide hormones and cytokines) and small molecule (e.g., steroid hormones) effectors in blood. Our central hypothesis, based in part on our preliminary data in rats, macaques and humans, is that changes in the blood levels of bone-active hormones and cytokines, derived from several tissues/organs, in response to alcohol intake act in concert to modulate bone cell number and activity. To test our hypothesis, we propose the following two Specific Aims: Specific Aim 1: Define the correlative relationships between the quantity and pattern of alcohol consumption and bone in male and female macaques. Specific Aim 2: Define the correlative relationships among blood ethanol levels, key bone active hormones and cytokines, and biochemical markers of bone turnover in male and female macaques. At the completion of this project, we expect to have established that the magnitude of skeletal response to alcohol will correlate with changes in serum biochemical markers of bone turnover which, in turn, will correlate with changes in circulating levels of specific hormones and cytokines. The primary positive impact of our anticipated findings is identification of key underlying factors responsible for the complex, context-dependent actions of alcohol on bone metabolism. PROJECT NARRATIVE Alcohol is an important nonessential component of diet that has been implicated in having both positive and negative effects on the skeleton. The proposed studies will evaluate the impact of pattern of alcohol consumption (none, light/moderate, binge, heavy, and very heavy) on bone in a non-human primate model for voluntary drinking that mimics the full range of human drinking behavior.

"Toward a Generalized Framework and Flexible Software Environment for Power Analysis of Alcohol Treatment Randomized Controlled Trials PROJECT SUMMARY Pharmacological and behavioral treatments of alcohol use disorder are only useful to the extent that their effects are robust and reliable. A priori determination of statistical power is one of the most significant steps to maximizing scientific reliability; however, it has historically been largely overlooked in the health sciences. Alcohol researchers are increasingly utilizing complex statistical models (e.g., growth curves, mixture models, social networks); yet, accessible methods for sample size determination for all but the simplest statistical tests have not been broadly disseminated. Moreover, even for models in which software programs are readily available, scientists consistently express uncertainty regarding expected parameter estimates, prohibiting the utility of power analysis itself. As a result, many randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are likely not optimally designed to allow for conclusive statistical inference. The overall objective of this proposal is to close this gap by developing a generalized method for power analysis using a combination of established and innovative approaches that can be used to generate and test a vast array of models used in treatment research. This objective will be achieved by pursuing two specific aims: develop a flexible, user-friendly software interface for statistical power and sensitivity analysis (Aim 1); and develop a generalized framework for determining model parameter estimates (Aim 2). The proposal is innovative because the software interface will be grounded in state-of-the-art advancements in computational technology and human-computer interaction. In addition, the framework will be fortified by advances in generalizability-theory-based meta-analyses and guided walk and machine-learning-based simulation studies investigating the effects of uncertainty in individual model parameters on the likelihood of observing hypothesized effects. The software will include automated sensitivity analyses to identify parameters with the largest impact on power and will recommend starting parameters. Development and testing will be grounded in the naltrexone and cognitive behavioral therapy literatures. Their widespread use and diversity of methodological approaches make them ideal testbeds from which to generalize to other treatment domains. This research is synergistic with each of the goals within the NIAAA Strategic Plan (2017-2021). Perhaps most significantly, methodology and guidelines will be developed for designing RCTs that have sufficient precision to distinguish trajectories, mechanisms, heterogeneity, and specificity of treatment efficacy. These efforts will provide researchers with the required a priori information to execute studies that ensure the robustness of their results. The development of these tools for RCT design will have implications for all areas of alcohol treatment research, including in-the-moment risk behaviors, person- level (comorbid) characteristics, targeting underserved and vulnerable populations, and large-scale initiatives. As a result, this proposal will allow for more definitive identification of efficacious interventions and treatments of alcohol use disorder. PROJECT NARRATIVE NIH-funded research is critical to addressing the nearly 44% lifetime prevalence of alcohol use disorder and reducing the $224 billion in annual preventable costs associated with drinking; thus, it is imperative that conclusions drawn from alcohol treatment research be robust and reliable. A priori determination of statistical power is one of the most significant steps in maximizing valid statistical inferences; yet, it has been historically overlooked in the health sciences and few tools exist for ensuring its accurate estimation. This proposal will develop a generalized framework for determining starting parameters and a flexible and user-friendly software platform for conducting power analyses of a wide range of study designs utilized by alcohol treatment researchers, thereby improving the rigor, reproducibility, and transparency of health science research and enhancing the scientific integrity of clinical and public health initiatives based on such findings.",Toward a Generalized Framework and Flexible Software Environment for Power Analysis of Alcohol Treatment Randomized Controlled Trials,9787254,R01AA027264,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Alcohols', 'Area', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive Therapy', 'Collaborations', 'Comorbidity', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Development', 'Elements', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Ethics', 'Family', 'Family Study', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Growth', 'Guidelines', 'Health Sciences', 'Heterogeneity', 'Individual', 'Influentials', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Linear Regressions', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Naltrexone', 'National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism', 'Non-linear Models', 'Output', 'Pattern', 'Peer Review', 'Persons', 'Pharmacological Treatment', 'Pharmacology', 'Plant Roots', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Procedures', 'Public Health', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk Behaviors', 'Sample Size', 'Scientist', 'Social Network', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Specificity', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Models', 'Strategic Planning', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Uncertainty', 'Underserved Population', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Walking', 'alcohol abuse therapy', 'alcohol use disorder', 'base', 'computer human interaction', 'cost', 'design', 'drinking', 'effective therapy', 'flexibility', 'health science research', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'journal article', 'model design', 'novel', 'online registry', 'open data', 'power analysis', 'programs', 'simulation', 'simulation game', 'syntax', 'theories', 'therapy design', 'tool', 'tool development', 'treatment effect', 'treatment trial', 'trial design', 'usability', 'user centered design', 'user friendly software', 'user-friendly', 'virtual', 'web app']",NIAAA,PURDUE UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,680219,0.10934925032215428
"NCANDA: DATA ANALYSIS RESOURCE PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT During young adulthood, drinking dramatically increases, with binge-level drinking peaking at age 22 and nearly half of individuals who drink report binge-level alcohol use. Frequent binge alcohol use during the protracted neuromaturation extending into the mid 20s may result in greater brain and cognitive effects than similar alcohol use in later adulthood. This application is in response to RFA-AA-17-005, Continuation of the National Consortium on Alcohol and Neurodevelopment in Adolescence (NCANDA) Data Analysis Resource (U24) to determine the predictors and effects of accelerated alcohol use in adolescence and young adulthood. NCANDA-2 will follow the initial cohort of 831 participants (ages 12-21 at first visit) from 5 collection sites and acquire the necessary data to advance our understanding of adolescent development and the effects of alcohol use on the adolescent and young adult brain using multimodal neuroimaging, cognitive testing, and behavioral assessment. The examination of alcohol consequences will focus on structural and functional maturation of brain areas that actively develop during adolescence, are involved in psychological regulation, respond to rewards, and appear vulnerable to deleterious effects of alcohol. With the additional longitudinal data provided by this renewal, we will determine the effects of alcohol exposure on the developmental trajectory of the adolescent human brain and identify preexisting psychobiological vulnerabilities that may put an adolescent or young adult at elevated risk for an alcohol use disorder. The Data Analysis Resource (DAR) will 1) oversee data collection with standardization and comparability across sites; 2) perform data analysis for core measures collected at each site; 3) facilitate across-site pooling and centralized data storage; 4) create a database across assessment modalities for efficient retrieval; 5) coordinate data and resource sharing; 6) harmonize data across sites; and 7) create and implement novel, multimodality analyses using machine learning to engage broad spectrum data. The DAR has 5 Specific Aims: Aim 1. Maintain standardized procedures for collection of neuroimaging, neuropsychological, and clinical  assessment data and harmonize with existing large-scale neurodevelopmental research efforts. Aim 2. Ensure across-site quality control for imaging and neuropsychological data acquisition. Aim 3. Maintain and advance informatics infrastructure for data submission, analysis, and distribution.  a) Maintain a database integrating the diverse and comprehensive data from all NCANDA sites.  b) Provide data to consortium PIs for hypothesis testing within and across experimental domains. Aim 4. Provide macrostructural, microstructural, and fMRI neuroimage processing and analysis. Aim 5. Develop and maintain a data sharing and distribution system for the scientific public.

"Image Analysis of Neurofacial Effects of Prenatal Alcohol  Exposure Abstract As a constitutent component of CIFASD4, this project will focus on earlier detection of the neurofacial effects of prenatal alcohol exposure. Four topics of the Request for Application (RFA) will be targeted: a) improved FAS/FASD facial recognition through 3D photography and computer analyses in individuals of different age groups; b) the utility of prenatal ultrasound as a screening or diagnostic modality; c) 3D facial imaging during the neonatal period to detect more subtle facial features affected by prenatal alcohol exposure; d) innovative uses of technologies, including handheld devices with apps, to screen for dysmorphology. Previously, we have implemented methods and associated software for analyzing postnatal face shape for the detection of the effects of prenatal alcohol exposure. Although effective in their accuracy, they rely on the use of expensive and relatively clumsy 3D cameras for which not insignificant training is required. New methods of 2D image analysis are available, mobile device acquisition of 3D images is imminent and online recruitment to clinical research is becoming more common place. Finally, state-of-the-art machine learning methods are proving effective in large-scale analysis of ultrasound and MRI data. To accomplish our goals, we propose the following specific aims: 1. Automated screening of facial images for effects of prenatal alcohol exposure with potential for on-line and  mobile device use and integration of genetic, behavioral and cognitive data; 2. Fetal ultrasound analysis to detect facial, cranial and neural effects of prenatal alcohol exposure with  neonatal follow-up; 3. Algorithm and software development to improve current analysis of face-brain-alcohol interactions. Achieving aim 1 will dramatically impact access to validated facial screening for prenatal alcohol exposure. Successful demonstration of aim 2 will achieve the earliest possible diagnosis enabling further research on interventions but also anticipatory neonatal management. Progress in aim 3 will enhance face-brain morphometric analyses in collaboration with other CIFASD partners (U01:Parnell/Eberhart, U01:Wozniak). We will work collaboratively with consortium partners who will recruit subjects and provide facial and ultrasound images (U01: Chambers; U01: Coles; U01: Mattson; U01: Weinberg; U01: Wozniak). We will co- operate on the analysis of images arising from basic science partners focusing on the use of animal models.

Project Narrative The goal of this project is to develop new methods for screening for the effects of prenatal alcohol exposure.

"Maternal circulating miRNA function in Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders Project Summary Prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) is the leading non-genetic cause of intellectual and other brain disabilities. However, fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD), estimated to affect ~2-5% of school-aged children in the US, remain difficult to diagnose and to prevent. Our recent work (PMCID 5102408) identified several circulating microRNAs (miRNAs) in heavy alcohol-consuming pregnant women whose expression levels in the 2nd and 3rd trimester predicted adverse infant outcomes including craniofacial anomalies and neurobehavioral and growth deficits1. Specifically, Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) models identified 11 elevated plasma miRNAs in mothers whose infants were severely affected by alcohol consumption. Using Random Forest Analysis (RFA), we were further able to use a distinct group of miRNAs to classify infants apparently unaffected by ethanol exposure with affected infants as opposed to alcohol unexposed infants. Aside from their diagnostic value, it is unknown if these Maternal circulating miRNAs associated with Adverse Infant Outcomes (M-circmiRNA-aAIO) contribute to the developmental pathologies of FASD. Bioinformatic analysis suggests these circulating miRNAs potentially regulate important hub genes for STAT3 and ephrin signaling pathways, which are in turn known to control cycles of epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) crucial for normal embryogenesis and placental and fetal development. Therefore, my overarching hypothesis is that PAE impairs early development by interfering with the endocrine action of circulating maternal miRNAs on both the placenta and fetus. In my research proposal, using both human cell lines and in vivo mouse models, I will test the hypothesis that pathogenic levels of circulating miRNAs mediate effects of ethanol on placenta and fetus and that they control embryo growth and survival by regulating EMT-like behaviors of key placental and fetal cells. The long-term goals of this project will be to develop interventional strategies that exploit the biology of endocrine circulating miRNAs in mitigating negative outcomes due to PAE and other teratogens. My immediate goals will be to define the role of maternal miRNAs, which predict FASD outcomes, on placental and embryo growth and development. Aim 1: Determine the impact of M-circmiRNA-aAIOs on trophoblast growth, survival, migration and invasion under basal and ethanol exposed conditions. Aim 2: Determine the impact of M-circmiRNA-aAIOs on embryonic growth, death, and cellular maturation/differentiation under basal and ethanol exposed conditions. Aim 3: Determine the impact of M-circmiRNA-aAIOs on in vivo fetal development and neonatal outcomes. My studies are expected to uncover novel endocrine and pregnancy related functions of FASD-associated maternal systemic miRNAs and may provide novel therapeutic targets and non-invasive modalities to mitigate effects of PAE. Given its translational potential, this project will further my training as a physician-scientist interested in pursuing both clinical duties and research on early developmental disorders. Project Narrative Prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) is the leading non-genetic cause of intellectual and other brain disabilities. This project seeks to characterize the endocrine function of maternal circulating microRNAs, predictive of adverse infant outcome following PAE, on the developing fetus and placenta. The goal of these studies is to uncover new therapeutic targets which can mitigate the effects of PAE and consequently prevent Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD). This goal is consistent with the mission of the National Institute of Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, which is to find ways to ‘reduce alcohol-related problems’ by research in ‘prevention and treatment’.",Maternal circulating miRNA function in Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders,9638420,F31AA026505,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Alcohol abuse', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcoholism', 'Alcohols', 'Analysis of Variance', 'Behavior', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cell Death', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Craniofacial Abnormalities', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Ectoderm', 'Embryo', 'Embryonic Development', 'Endocrine', 'Endoderm', 'Ephrins', 'Epithelial', 'Ethanol', 'Fetal Alcohol Exposure', 'Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder', 'Fetal Development', 'Fetal alcohol effects', 'Fetus', 'Germ Layers', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Growth and Development function', 'Human', 'Human Cell Line', 'Impairment', 'Infant', 'Institutes', 'Intervention', 'Mediating', 'Mesenchymal', 'Mesoderm', 'MicroRNAs', 'Mission', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Mothers', 'Mus', 'National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke', 'Neuroectoderm', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Physicians', 'Placenta', 'Placentation', 'Plasma', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnant Women', 'Prevention', 'Procedures', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Proposals', 'Research Training', 'Role', 'STAT3 gene', 'School-Age Population', 'Scientist', 'Second Pregnancy Trimester', 'Signal Pathway', 'Teratogens', 'Testing', 'Third Pregnancy Trimester', 'Time', 'Training', 'Ultrasonography', 'Work', 'alcohol effect', 'alcohol exposure', 'alcohol related problem', 'base', 'circulating microRNA', 'developmental disease', 'disability', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'fetal', 'fetus cell', 'human female', 'human male', 'in utero', 'in vivo', 'infant outcome', 'interest', 'loss of function', 'migration', 'mouse model', 'neonatal outcome', 'neurobehavioral', 'new therapeutic target', 'non-genetic', 'novel', 'offspring', 'placental morphology', 'pregnant', 'prevent', 'random forest', 'relating to nervous system', 'repository', 'stem cell biology', 'trophoblast', 'undergraduate research']",NIAAA,TEXAS A&M UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCE CTR,F31,2019,33461,0.13143017385747
"Fourth International Conference on Alcohol and Cancer ABSTRACT A contribution of alcohol to the development of several cancers, including esophageal, laryngeal, lung, breast (in women) and colorectal (especially in men), is becoming increasingly evident. Each year, 390,000 cases of cancer world-wide are attributable to alcohol consumption, representing 3.6% of all newly diagnosed cancers. The International Conference on Alcohol and Cancer (ICAC) was established in 2010 to complement the major research conferences in cancer (e.g. AACR) and alcohol (e.g., RSA, ISBRA, ESBRA) which do not have a focus on the role of alcohol in carcinogenesis. After the success of the first three meetings (in Heidelberg, Germany in 2011; Breckenridge, USA in 2013; and Crete, Greece in 2015), we are now in the process of organizing our fourth conference. The conferences have been successful in bringing together over fifty investigators (from sixteen nations) with cutting-edge and complementary expertise in alcohol and cancer. In addition to allowing experts to share their most current results, the conference has promoted interactions between basic scientists and clinicians in all major aspects of alcohol-induced carcinogenesis. In so doing, it has fostered the development of valuable new collaborations that promote major advances in the field. An important secondary function of this conference is to attract young scientists and graduate students into this important field of research. This R13 application seeks mostly travel support for new investigators, and pre- and post-doctoral trainees to allow attendance at the fourth ICAC to be held in Newport, Rhode Island, USA, on April 14-18, 2019. The conference will remain faithful to and build upon the previous conferences by achieving the following specific aims: i) provide a venue for the presentation of cutting-edge research in the field of alcohol and cancer; ii) promote the development of new ideas and research directions by fostering interactions and collaborations between researchers from a variety of sub-specialties and disciplines; iii) foster interactions between young investigators (including postgraduate and graduate students) and established investigators; iv) facilitate distribution of new scientific and translational information to the professional and lay communities, and v) disseminate the findings of the meeting to a wider audience by publishing the presentations. It is anticipated that these conferences will continue to enhance our understanding of the role played by alcohol in carcinogenesis and thereby facilitate the development of treatments that will prevent or treat cancers caused by alcohol. PROJECT NARRATIVE The contribution of alcohol to the development of a variety of cancers is becoming increasingly evident. The proposed meeting will focus on recent advances in epidemiology, molecular mechanisms and biomarkers of alcohol-induced carcinogenesis, and the emerging areas of systems approaches, big data, deep learning and artificial intelligence. As has been the case previously, this meeting will function as an ideal platform for promoting interactions between basic scientists and clinicians in all major aspects of alcohol-induced carcinogenesis. In addition, it will serve to attract young scientists and graduate students into this important field of research.",Fourth International Conference on Alcohol and Cancer,9771126,R13AA027725,"['Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohols', 'American Association of Cancer Research', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Big Data', 'Biological Markers', 'Breast', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Collaborations', 'Colorectal', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Crete', 'Development', 'Discipline', 'Endocrinologist', 'Environment', 'Epidemiologist', 'Epidemiology', 'Esophageal', 'Fostering', 'Germany', 'Greece', 'Inflammation', 'International', 'Larynx', 'Lung', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Molecular', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Oral', 'Play', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Process', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Rhode Island', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'System', 'Travel', 'Woman', 'cancer diagnosis', 'cancer stem cell', 'cancer type', 'carcinogenesis', 'deep learning', 'graduate student', 'medical specialties', 'meetings', 'men', 'posters', 'pre-doctoral', 'prevent', 'success', 'symposium', 'therapy development']",NIAAA,YALE UNIVERSITY,R13,2019,30000,0.08816821136769158
"Tracking and Prediction of Early Brain-Face Biomarkers of Prenatal Alcohol Exposure from Neonates to Children Maternal substance use disorders are a substantial public health concern and the neurological consequences of prenatal exposure are a major threat to the long-term health of offspring. Globally, prevalence of Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS) and Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD) is between 2-7 and 20-50 per 1000, respectively. By contrast, in certain high-risk communities in South Africa, prevalence is reported to be as high as 63 and 155 per 1000, respectively. Though prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) is known to affect the central nervous system, to date, little data exists in respect of the impact of PAE in early childhood, before both higher-level brain networks are established and other potentially confounding post- natal environmental influences have come into play. For neurodevelopmental disorders, studies have consistently shown that early intervention, based on detection and targeted interventions, leads to better long-term outcomes. We aim to address this precise gap in knowledge by imaging the brain and 3D face across the FASD continuum to investigate early biomarkers, trajectories and functional correlates of PAE in a cohort followed prospectively from birth to age 6 years. Data: Our cohort includes a well characterized subsample of children (PAE and healthy controls) enrolled in the Drakenstein Child Health Study in Cape Town, South Africa, who have been scanned as neonates and at 2-3 years of age. Preliminary published data shows highly significant relationships between PAE and regional gray and white matter changes, already discernible in newborns, well before the age FASD is typically diagnosed. An additional longitudinal assessment at 6-years will yield a unique FASD sample with 3 distinct time points (infants, toddlers and children), allowing characterization of brain and face morphology and brain structure and function in this previously understudied early developmental period. This proposal addresses fundamental gaps concerning the presence, timing and regional specificity of altered brain morphology and structural and functional connectivity in association with the effects of PAE on the developing brain from birth to 6 years, and the relationships with facial dysmorphology. The research team has successfully gathered data from the proposed cohort as neonates and at 2–3 years of age. The benefits of extending this research to a subsequent imaging time-point, with a larger range of developmental and neurobehavioral assessments, provides an unprecedented opportunity to determine longitudinal effects of PAE on the trajectory of the developing brain in these critical early years, the links between neural and face predictors of PAE and the long-term clinical significance of these findings. This research will illuminate early neurodevelopmental mechanisms leading to subsequent behavioral and neurological disturbances, which may allow opportunities for targeting interventions when brain plasticity is still relatively fluid. This project might also lead to new strategies for early diagnosis using both face and brain biomarkers. Project Narrative Fetal exposure of the brain to alcohol can trigger brain abnormalities that unfold over a lifetime with severe consequences both for the affected individual and for society at large. To date, these brain abnormalities and associated deficits and behaviors have mostly been studied in late childhood or later, with very few studies following the consequences of well documented fetal alcohol exposure as they develop in the same individual across time in early childhood when the brain is most responsive to potential treatments. This project will extend an ongoing study of children with fetal alcohol exposure, already characterized as newborns and at age 2-3 to add assessments of the brain and behavior at age 6 and will explore alcohol-induced facial abnormalities as a complementary predictor of brain problems. !",Tracking and Prediction of Early Brain-Face Biomarkers of Prenatal Alcohol Exposure from Neonates to Children,9788191,R01AA026834,"['2 year old', '3 year old', '3-Dimensional', '6 year old', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alcohols', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Cellular Phone', 'Child', 'Child Health', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Dysmorphology', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Emotional', 'Enrollment', 'Face', 'Fetal Alcohol Exposure', 'Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder', 'Fetal Alcohol Syndrome', 'Fetal alcohol effects', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Gestational Age', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Link', 'Liquid substance', 'Longevity', 'Longitudinal cohort', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Neonatal', 'Neuraxis', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neurologic', 'Newborn Infant', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Population', 'Pregnancy', 'Prevalence', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Severities', 'Shapes', 'Societies', 'South Africa', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Thalamic structure', 'Time', 'Toddler', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'alcohol exposure', 'antenatal', 'base', 'brain abnormalities', 'brain behavior', 'brain morphology', 'clinically significant', 'cohort', 'connectome', 'cost', 'deep neural network', 'design', 'early childhood', 'early detection biomarkers', 'efficacy testing', 'fetal diagnosis', 'gray matter', 'high dimensionality', 'high risk', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'maternal alcohol use', 'maternal cigarette smoking', 'maternal depression', 'multimodality', 'neonatal brain', 'neonate', 'neurobehavioral', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'offspring', 'prenatal exposure', 'prospective', 'relating to nervous system', 'shape analysis', 'statistics', 'white matter', 'white matter change']",NIAAA,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2019,498954,0.11813813535674438
"A Multisite Neurobehavioral Assessment of Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders Project Summary This request for a renewal of funding is in response to the NIH/NIAAA funding opportunity entitled, “Collaborative Initiative on Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (CIFASD)” (RFA-AA-17-007). The overarching aim of the current proposal is to develop, validate, and implement clinically novel and innovative measurement tools to accurately identify children who are affected by prenatal alcohol exposure. The proposed study is relevant to the overall objective of the CIFASD funding opportunity “to accelerate specific areas of research related to the translation of new or improved capabilities in FASD clinical case recognition.” This is critical need. While there has been a concerted research effort since the initial clinical delineation of fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS), understanding the full spectrum of effects of prenatal alcohol exposure remains incomplete, hindering effective intervention. Although individuals with prenatal alcohol exposure may experience significantly impairing functional difficulties, identification of these individuals is inadequate. High rates of missed diagnoses and misdiagnosis result in lost opportunities for intervention and misunderstanding of the etiology of observed difficulties. Development of accurate and specific identification tools will improve diagnostic capability and clinical decision-making regarding treatment. To this end, during previous funding periods we substantially enhanced the understanding of the specificity of effects of prenatal alcohol exposure to increase identification of alcohol-affected youth. Our hierarchical CIFASD Decision Tree, developed and validated on over 800 subjects, indicates that administration of just 4 measures can distinguish alcohol-affected youth from nonexposed controls with and without behavioral concerns or conditions with accuracy rates of >80%. While a significant step forward, the Decision Tree was developed and validated in a research sample with a high risk of alcohol effects. One aim of the current proposal is to develop and test an electronic version of the Decision Tree (the eTree) in lower risk, international, population-based, and clinic-based samples. Another aim of the proposal, in line with the specific RFA goal to use innovative technologies to screen for dysmorphology and/or neurobehavioral deficits to aid in the identification of alcohol-exposed individuals, is the development and implementation of the FASD Online Neurobehavioral Screen (FONS), a web-based neurobehavioral assessment tool for use with subjects recruited via a web portal (cf. Foroud U01). The FONS will measure domains known to be affected in FASD, including those represented in diagnostic criteria for neurobehavioral disorder associated with prenatal alcohol exposure (ND-PAE). The eTree and the FONS will be validated using laboratory-based in-person neuropsychological assessment of children with histories of prenatal alcohol exposure and non-exposed controls with and without behavioral concerns or conditions. The results of the proposed research will fulfill our research goals, improve recruitment, and most importantly accurately identify individuals affected by prenatal alcohol exposure, leading to improved clinical diagnosis and intervention. Project Narrative This project is directly relevant to public health concerns related to the effects of heavy prenatal alcohol exposure and improved identification of alcohol-affected individuals with novel electronic data collection techniques.

"Transcriptome-guided diagnosis and therapy for alcohol use disorder 1 Project Summary/Abstract  2 Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD) is a chronic, relapsing condition and a major public health problem with few  3 pharmaceutical treatments available. Systems-based computational strategies that integrate brain gene  4 expression signatures of rodent models of AUD risk with gene expression signatures of pharmaceuticals show  5 promise for identifying compounds that decrease excessive drinking in rodents. However, this methodology  6 has limited clinical potential because it is not possible to obtain brain specimens from patients. Identifying a  7 clinically accessible tissue would facilitate the application of advanced computational approaches to identify  8 better therapeutics for AUD and personalize AUD treatment. To this end, the proposed research aims to  9 determine whether blood can be used as a surrogate tissue for brain by using a within-subjects design to 10 compare transcript levels in both tissues in mice during protracted withdrawal, a sensitive time for relapse to 11 excessive alcohol drinking. The research will also determine whether whole blood transcriptome profiles can be 12 used to classify subjects according to alcohol dependence status and to computationally predict compounds 13 that reduce alcohol consumption and anxiety- and depression-like behavior. The clinical and mechanistic 14 insights that will emerge from the proposed research should be considered independently. The first could lead 15 to effective diagnostic tools or candidate treatments, whereas the second will provide insight into the 16 pathophysiology of AUD. It might be the case that the blood transcriptome at least partially reflects the changes 17 in brain, and that targeting these changes is therapeutic. Or it might be the case that targeting the blood 18 transcriptome is therapeutic, irrespective of brain changes. The proposed study will provide crucial new 19 knowledge about a relatively new and unexplored area of addiction research that could drive molecular-based 20 diagnostic or therapeutic tools and personalized medicine approaches for AUD or other diseases where brain is 21 the primary affected tissue. Project Narrative Recent evidence in mice suggests that brain gene expression profiles can predict drugs effective for treating alcoholism, but it is not possible to obtain brain specimens from human patients which limits the usefulness of this approach. This research will investigate the extent to which blood can act as a surrogate for brain tissue and predict alcohol dependence status and drug treatments. This information will help to develop molecular- based diagnosis and treatment options for alcoholics and gain insights into the biological mechanisms that might contribute to the transition from recreational alcohol use to excessive drinking.",Transcriptome-guided diagnosis and therapy for alcohol use disorder,9906637,F32AA028148,"['Acids', 'Affect', 'Air', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohol dependence', 'Alcohol withdrawal syndrome', 'Alcoholism', 'Alcohols', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Animals', 'Anxiety', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Biological', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Blood', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Chronic', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Computer Analysis', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Dependence', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Discriminant Analysis', 'Disease', 'Ethanol', 'Expression Profiling', 'Female', 'Functional disorder', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Genes', 'Healthcare', 'Heavy Drinking', 'Human', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Least-Squares Analysis', 'Libraries', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Marble', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Methodology', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Network-based', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Nucleus Accumbens', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Pergolide', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Population', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Proteins', 'Public Health', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Rodent', 'Rodent Model', 'Schizophrenia', 'Specimen', 'Structure of terminal stria nuclei of preoptic region', 'System', 'Tail Suspension', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Transcript', 'Translating', 'Ventral Tegmental Area', 'Whole Blood', 'Withdrawal', 'addiction', 'alcohol abuse therapy', 'alcohol availability', 'alcohol use disorder', 'artificial neural network', 'base', 'binge drinking', 'brain tissue', 'clinical development', 'design', 'differential expression', 'disorder risk', 'drug candidate', 'forced swim test', 'genome-wide analysis', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'machine learning algorithm', 'male', 'negative affect', 'novel marker', 'personalized medicine', 'problem drinker', 'random forest', 'success', 'tool', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'vapor']",NIAAA,"UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS, AUSTIN",F32,2019,61226,0.12102527885584444
"Identification of fetal alcohol-affected children: Alterations in imprinted gene expression and methylation as biomarkers of neurobehavioral and growth impairment. Abstract Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) are the most common preventable cause of neurodevelopmental disabilities, with prevalence estimates of 3-10/1000 individuals in the US and up to 80/1000 in endemic communities. The promise of an increasing number of interventions tailored to prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE)-related neurobehavioral deficits is limited by diagnostic difficulties in clinical practice. Currently known biomarkers of exposure are neither sensitive nor specific for neurobehavioral deficits, in part because not all exposed children are affected. There is, therefore, a critical need for biomarkers of effect to identify affected children who would benefit from early, tailored therapeutic interventions. A growing body of literature has demonstrated alcohol-induced alterations in epigenetic programming as an important potential mechanism in FASD, suggesting that such alterations may serve as biomarkers of effect. Imprinted genes comprise a unique subset of epigenetically regulated genes that is sensitive to prenatal insults. There is considerable overlap between the neurobehavioral domains affected by FASD and those seen in experimental animal models of imprinted gene dysregulation, including learning, memory, and attachment. In a prenatally- recruited, prospective longitudinal cohort, we recently found that PAE was associated with alterations in placental level of expression of 11 of 93 expressed imprinted genes. Expression changes for five of these genes statistically mediated effects of alcohol on postnatal growth, identifying these alterations as biomarkers of fetal alcohol growth restriction. Given the remarkable overlap between the neurobehavioral domains affected in FASD and those affected by alteration of imprinted gene expression in animal models, alcohol-induced alterations in placental imprinted gene expression may also provide biomarkers for FASD neurocognitive deficits. Although most epigenetic marks are specific to tissue-type and timing of exposure, genomic imprinting maps and our pilot data indicate that markers of imprinted gene dysregulation identified in placental tissue may be detected in blood samples obtained at older ages. The aims of this study are: (1) To characterize the fetal alcohol-related imprintome signature in the placenta and in blood samples obtained at 6 yr; (2) To identify alterations in imprinted gene level of expression and ICR methylation that can serve as biomarkers of effect; (3) To validate findings in Aims 1 and 2 in blood samples from a 2nd, independent cohort. The data for this study will come from two prospective longitudinal cohorts recruited from the Cape Coloured community in Cape Town, South Africa, where the prevalence of FASD is among the highest in the world. Results from this study will make it possible to identify affected children who would benefit from early therapeutic interventions but would likely not be detected by current diagnostic tools. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Despite widespread public health advisories, alcohol use during pregnancy persists in the U.S. and worldwide, making fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) the most common preventable cause of neurodevelopmental delay. The promise of an ever-increasing number of interventions tailored to FASD deficits is limited by difficulties in identifying fetal alcohol-related facial dysmorphology in infancy and early childhood, when interventions are most effective, and in children with alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorder, in which neurodevelopmental impairment occurs in the absence of dysmorphic features. This proposal seeks to identify alterations in imprinted gene expression that can be used as biomarkers of adverse effect to identify infants and children with FASD who would benefit from therapeutic interventions but would probably not be detected by current diagnostic tools.",Identification of fetal alcohol-affected children: Alterations in imprinted gene expression and methylation as biomarkers of neurobehavioral and growth impairment.,9913250,R01AA027916,"['Adolescent', 'Adverse effects', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohol-Related Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Alcohols', 'Animal Model', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood specimen', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Cognitive', 'Color', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dysmorphology', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Experimental Animal Model', 'Face', 'Fetal Alcohol Exposure', 'Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder', 'Fetal Alcohol Syndrome', 'Gene Cluster', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genomic Imprinting', 'Growth', 'Growth Disorders', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Longitudinal cohort', 'Machine Learning', 'Malnutrition', 'Maps', 'Mediating', 'Memory', 'Methylation', 'Microcephaly', 'Neurocognitive Deficit', 'Neurodevelopmental Disability', 'Neurodevelopmental Impairment', 'Nursery Schools', 'Parents', 'Pattern', 'Placenta', 'Play', 'Pregnancy', 'Prevalence', 'Public Health', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'South Africa', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Tissues', 'Toxin', 'alcohol effect', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'early childhood', 'fetal', 'fetal diagnosis', 'gene function', 'imprint', 'infancy', 'neurobehavioral', 'novel', 'performance tests', 'postnatal', 'prenatal', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'recruit', 'targeted treatment', 'tool', 'trait', 'transcriptome', 'whole genome']",NIAAA,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2019,597565,0.0553868658535941
"Big data analytics for the evaluation of whole genome sequence and transcriptome data in alcohol research PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Large-scale U.S. epidemiological studies demonstrate that alcohol use disorders are highly prevalent, highly co-morbid with other psychiatric disorders, disabling, and often go untreated. Compared with other U.S. ethnic groups, Native Americans have the highest rates of alcohol and other drug dependence, and it is associated with particularly significant disability and mortality. Thus studies that identify specific genetic risk factors for alcohol use disorders in the general U.S. population, and especially in Native Americans, are of high public health importance. Alcohol use disorders are complex genetic diseases sensitive to environmental conditions that require complex data strategies to uncover the underlying risk factors. Although recent years have seen significant advancement in our understanding in the biology and genetics of the disorders, exactly how these factors interact in an individual to confer risk or protection from alcohol use disorders is still unclear. Further, the genetic factors identified in the human genome thus far by conventional methods appear to only explain a very small fraction of the overall heritability for the disorders.  The overall objective of this research program is to identify the complex genetic and genomic factors that affect susceptibility to alcohol use disorders and related comorbidities through novel and innovative quantitative methods and big data analytics. The proposed study will utilize whole-genome sequence (WGS) data from a unique high-risk Native American population and a European American population along with gene expression data of alcoholic human brains. The project will develop methodology to analyze WGS data with unique relevance to alcohol research. Selected multivariate, graphical, and dimension-reduction modeling tools will be used in combination with mixed models suitable for genomic data with both population and family structures to dissect polygenic basis for alcohol use disorders and shared genetic risk factors for alcohol use disorders and comorbid disorders. Mixture models and clustering methods will be employed to uncover heterogeneous genetic influences. Differential genetic effects at various levels of heterogeneity will be tested with rigorous statistical methods. The project will identify population and ancestry-specific genetic risk factors and shared risk factors across populations and determine their differential influences on susceptibility to alcohol use disorders. Endophenotypes will also be investigated to help identify unique risk factors for alcohol use disorder traits. The project will further identify alcohol- and addiction-relevant pathways and networks that are differentially expressed in alcoholic brains, and establish directions of causations by combining gene expression data with WGS data, and applying instrumental variable approaches. Finally, an integrated system approach will be taken by further leveraging epigenomic maps and annotation databases in the public domain to build predictive and potentially causal models aimed at more “personalized” prevention and intervention for alcohol use disorders in specific high-risk groups and individuals. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Alcohol use disorders are prevalent, frequently co-occur with other psychiatric disorders, are disabling and often go untreated. Identifying specific genetic risk factors for alcohol use disorders in the general U.S. population, and especially in high risk ethnic groups such as Native Americans, will lead to more personalized thus more effective prevention and intervention for alcoholism in these populations.",Big data analytics for the evaluation of whole genome sequence and transcriptome data in alcohol research,9753834,K25AA025095,"['Affect', 'Alcohol dependence', 'Alcoholism', 'Alcohols', 'American', 'Autopsy', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Big Data', 'Big Data Methods', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Communities', 'Comorbidity', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Drug Addiction', 'Ethnic group', 'Etiology', 'European', 'Evaluation', 'Family Study', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Heritability', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Individual', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mental disorders', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Native Americans', 'New South Wales', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Domains', 'Public Health', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Randomized', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'San Francisco', 'Siblings', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'System', 'Testing', 'Variant', 'addiction', 'alcohol and other drug', 'alcohol intervention', 'alcohol research', 'alcohol use disorder', 'base', 'causal model', 'cohort', 'differential expression', 'disability', 'endophenotype', 'epidemiology study', 'epigenomics', 'family structure', 'genetic risk factor', 'genome wide association study', 'genomic data', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'individualized prevention', 'innovation', 'mortality', 'non-alcoholic', 'novel', 'pleiotropism', 'predictive modeling', 'problem drinker', 'programs', 'risk sharing', 'statistics', 'tissue resource', 'tool', 'trait', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptomics', 'whole genome']",NIAAA,SCRIPPS RESEARCH INSTITUTE,K25,2019,161460,0.14100521124354576
"Targeting corticostriatal synchrony with deep brain stimulation to reduce alcohol drinking Project Summary  Although alcohol use disorder (AUD) affects a large segment of American adults and the current treatments are unsuccessful in a significant proportion of patients. Studying the neural underpinnings of AUD has the potential for uncovering target for developing novel treatments. There is mounting evidence that AUD is correlated with dysregulated synchrony within the corticostriatal network. Neuromodulatory therapies, like deep brain stimulation (DBS), have been successful at treating other disorders, like Parkinson's disease, characterized by network dysregulation. Although, DBS has also shown the potential to treat AUD in pre- clinical models and clinical studies, the variable response to treatment (~50% of subject) limits the clinical adoption of these techniques. If we are able to uncover which measures of corticostriatal synchrony are implicated in the therapeutic effects of DBS, then we could target those features to increase response rates and open the door to a new therapeutic approach to AUD.  The short-term objective of this research is to uncover the synchrony measure indicative of successful DBS treatment of AUD and then improve outcomes by targeting that measure with a novel DBS approach. The longer-term objective is to develop a novel treatment modality—dual-site DBS—which could be used to target dysregulated synchrony between two brain regions by targeting both of those regions. To achieve both of these objectives, (Aim 1) I will use a rodent model of alcohol drinking and an unbiased computational approach to determine what corticostriatal synchrony measure best correlates with successful single-site DBS. Next (Aim 2a), I will determine if dual-site DBS can be optimized to selectively modulate the measure previously associated with alcohol drinking. Last, (Aim 2b) I will test the ability of dual-site DBS to alter both synchrony and drinking behavior compared to single-site DBS.  These aims will not only provide a brain network-based biomarker of successful AUD treatment, but also begin the development of an innovative treatment. To complete these aims I will work with my mentorship team at Dartmouth College on the use of animal models of alcohol use, the analysis of local field potentials, and the implementation of machine learning algorithms. Dartmouth College not only provides cutting-edge facilities which I will use to complete this research, but also has dedicated centers for professional development like the Dartmouth Center for the Advancement of Learning, which I will use over the next two years. Altogether, the training I will receive under this F31 will be integral in my pursuit of a pre-clinical research career. Project Narrative Alcohol use disorder (AUD) affects approximately 15 million adults in the United States with a particular need for new therapeutic options in the treatment resistant population. Brain network dysregulation is implicated in AUD, specifically dysregulated corticostriatal synchrony, and this proposal will uncover the relationship between corticostriatal synchrony induced by deep brain stimulation (DBS) and reduced alcohol drinking in an animal model. Further, this proposal will determine if a novel application of DBS is able to reduce alcohol drinking more than standard DBS by manipulating this dysregulated synchrony.",Targeting corticostriatal synchrony with deep brain stimulation to reduce alcohol drinking,9854732,F31AA027441,"['Adoption', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohols', 'American', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Award', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Data', 'Deep Brain Stimulation', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Educational workshop', 'Electric Stimulation', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Network-based', 'Neuronal Plasticity', 'Nucleus Accumbens', 'Outcome', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Patients', 'Population', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Pre-Clinical Model', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Rewards', 'Rodent Model', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Synapses', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Effect', 'Training', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States', 'Work', 'alcohol abuse therapy', 'alcohol exposure', 'alcohol research', 'alcohol use disorder', 'base', 'career', 'college', 'computational neuroscience', 'design', 'drinking', 'drinking behavior', 'experience', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'neuroregulation', 'novel', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'novel therapeutics', 'pedagogy', 'pre-clinical', 'pre-clinical research', 'reduced alcohol use', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'signal processing', 'symposium', 'treatment response']",NIAAA,DARTMOUTH COLLEGE,F31,2019,45016,0.13534401523935838
"Administrative Core of the CIFASD Project Summary/Abstract The Collaborative Initiative on Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (CIFASD) is a multidisciplinary, international consortium of research projects and resource cores charged with improving prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of FASD. The Administrative Resource Core of the CIFASD (AdminC) has led this consortium since it was first established in 2003 and plays a critical leadership role in the coordination of research efforts and ensuring progress toward consortium goals. CIFASD addresses issues related to prenatal alcohol exposure across the lifespan, using a range of interrelated clinical and preclinical research approaches. This iteration of the consortium consists of multiple collaborative components including four resource U24 cores (AdminC, Dysmorphology, Informatics, and Outreach/Dissemination), nine U01 research projects (clinical, basic science, and/or translational) and two exploratory/developmental UH2 projects. One goal of the CIFASD is to improve identification of individuals who have been affected by prenatal alcohol exposure. This will be accomplished by assessing biomarkers, such as immune and miRNA profiles, and by using neuroimaging techniques that may be more sensitive to subtle pathology seen in individuals who do not meet the diagnostic criteria for FAS. In addition, CIFASD will develop novel tools, such as 3D facial and neurobehavioral screening, which can be assessed remotely and made more universally accessible through eHealth. The use of telemedicine will also provide access to more detailed dysmorphology evaluations. Another goal is to identify risk and resiliency factors, including genetic influences that will help with understanding the mechanisms of alcohol's damaging effects and also lead to more targeted interventions. A third goal is to better understand the effects of prenatal alcohol exposure on consequences across the lifespan, including adulthood. Finally, an intervention for improving outcomes will be modified to a mobile platform, so that it can reach larger populations of individuals with FASD and their families. Collectively, these projects have the potential for moving the FASD field forward, improving the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of FASD and serving a wide audience with the technologies available in eHealth. The Specific Aims of the AdminC are to: 1) Provide scientific and administrative direction, leadership and oversight to CIFASD; 2) Facilitate communication among the various projects and the dissemination of results; 3) Assist with data management strategies; 4) Provide annual evaluations of progress; and 5) Provide assistance to projects with implementing eHealth technology. The AdminC provides the foundation for the interactive and supportive framework of CIFASD by establishing regular communications with all members through monthly conference calls and biannual meetings; leading the Steering Committee in the establishment and implementation of CIFASD priorities and policies; supporting the Science Advisory Board with its evaluations of progress on each component as well as the overall mission of CIFASD; as well as serving as the liaison between the consortium's project scientists and its NIAAA advisors. Project Narrative The consequences resulting from prenatal alcohol exposure are wide-ranging and a major and costly public health problem. The goal of the CIFASD consortium is to enhance the identification and treatment of FASD utilizing a multidisciplinary approach consisting of both basic science and clinical research. The collaborations among research projects will allow CIFASD to improve the diagnosis and treatment of FASD, moving the field forward in ways that could not be easily achieved by individual projects.",Administrative Core of the CIFASD,9698228,U24AA014811,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Alcohols', 'Animal Experimentation', 'Animal Model', 'Archives', 'Basic Science', 'Behavior', 'Behavior assessment', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain imaging', 'Cellular Phone', 'Charge', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Decision Trees', 'Developing Countries', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dysmorphology', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Face', 'Family', 'Fetal Alcohol Exposure', 'Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder', 'Fetal alcohol effects', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Screening', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Human', 'Image', 'Immune', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Information Dissemination', 'Infrastructure', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'MicroRNAs', 'Mission', 'Modality', 'National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Pattern', 'Physical assessment', 'Play', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Progress Reports', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Publications', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resource Allocation', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Schedule', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Screening procedure', 'Tablets', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Telemedicine', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Uncertainty', 'Woman', 'Work', 'base', 'behavioral health', 'behavioral study', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive testing', 'cohort', 'cost', 'cytokine', 'data management', 'diagnostic screening', 'drinking', 'eHealth', 'epidemiology study', 'fetal', 'forging', 'health care service', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'meetings', 'member', 'mobile computing', 'multidisciplinary', 'neurobehavioral', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'outreach', 'pre-clinical research', 'program dissemination', 'recruit', 'repository', 'resilience', 'screening', 'symposium', 'tool', 'web site']",NIAAA,SAN DIEGO STATE UNIVERSITY,U24,2019,435603,0.15664405541295742
"Sex Differences in Alcohol-Related Neurotoxicity During Adolescence ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Adolescence is a time of dramatic development, much of which varies as a function of sex. Also during this time, alcohol use becomes very common. Likely due to heightened plasticity, the adolescent brain is particularly susceptible to the neurotoxic effects of alcohol. While studies have separately documented cross- sectional sex differences in the effects of alcohol on the adolescent brain and hormonal influences on normative adolescent brain development, to fully understand sex-specific adolescent risk and resilience for alcoholism, multimodal prospective longitudinal studies are crucial. To that end, during this funding period, we will assess an additional 120 healthy non-alcohol/drug using 14-16-year-old youth using functional neuroimaging during working memory and decision making, resting state functional neuroimaging, diffusion tensor imaging, neurocognitive assessment, mood/behavior/personality assessment, and serum hormone assays. Together with over 200 youth assessed during the first funding period of the project, all youth will be quarterly monitore for changes in alcohol/drug use, and youth who emerge into heavy alcohol use (as well as a matched non-using control) will be re-assessed at two time points following initiation of heavy drinking behavior. Using a multi-modal longitudinal design, we aim to better understand sex-specific effects of heavy alcohol use on adolescent brain functioning and connectivity, as well as identify premorbid sex-specific neurobiological risk phenotypes that are predictive of problem drinking during adolescence and young adulthood. Further, we will explore moderating variables, such timing and frequency of alcohol and other drug use, as well as the role of gonadal steroids on sex-specific developmental trajectories. Disentangling sex- specific risk for and consequences of alcohol use during adolescence, in relation to normative brain development, and determining which effects may be hormonally influenced, will move the field closer to more personalized prevention and intervention strategies aimed at male and female youth. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The present study seeks to longitudinally examine sex-specific alcohol effects on the adolescent brain and identify sex-specific neurobiological risk markers that are predictive of high levels of drinking during adolescence and young adulthood. Understanding sex-specific risk for and consequences of alcohol use during adolescence is a crucial step toward developing more informed prevention and treatment strategies.",Sex Differences in Alcohol-Related Neurotoxicity During Adolescence,9703801,R01AA017664,"['16 year old', 'Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Alcohol abuse', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcoholism', 'Alcohols', 'Anisotropy', 'Appetitive Behavior', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Assay', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data Collection', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Drug usage', 'Emotional', 'Estradiol', 'Female', 'Fiber', 'Financial compensation', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Glare', 'Gonadal Steroid Hormones', 'Heavy Drinking', 'Hormonal', 'Hormones', 'Knowledge', 'Longitudinal prospective study', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Male Adolescents', 'Mediating', 'Modeling', 'Moods', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurocognitive', 'Parietal', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Personality', 'Personality Assessment', 'Phenotype', 'Prevention strategy', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Prospective Studies', 'Reporting', 'Rest', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Risk Marker', 'Role', 'Serum', 'Sex Differences', 'Sex Functioning', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Testosterone', 'Time', 'Youth', 'adolescent brain development', 'alcohol and other drug', 'alcohol consequences', 'alcohol effect', 'base', 'binge drinking', 'brain behavior', 'cognitive change', 'cohort', 'drinking', 'drinking behavior', 'emotional behavior', 'improved', 'individualized prevention', 'longitudinal design', 'male', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'neurotoxic', 'neurotoxicity', 'predictive marker', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'resilience', 'response', 'sex', 'treatment strategy', 'underage drinking', 'young adult']",NIAAA,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,406172,0.1843430899563411
"3/3 Alcohol Research Consortium in HIV – Intervention Research Arm (ARCH-IRA) Alcohol Use Disorders (AUDs) and hazardous drinking are the fourth leading cause of preventable death in the US and are responsible for 10% of all deaths among working age adults. Among Persons Living with HIV/AIDS (PLWH), heavy alcohol use is up to twice the rate in the general population. Few people engage in behavioral alcohol treatment and alcohol pharmacotherapies are not routinely used as part of alcohol treatment, despite the known efficacy of these interventions. PLWH engaged in treatment for their HIV disease have regular contact with a medical provider and are treated in a medical home model in which all medical services are delivered within HIV clinics, but few HIV providers feel comfortable treating AUDs. During our initial funding period, we implemented routine alcohol screening, developed a computerized brief intervention (CBI), and conducted provider training on alcohol pharmacotherapies. However, while we found a strong impact from routine screening with CBI for reducing alcohol use, few providers prescribed alcohol pharmacotherapy, despite this specialized training, with most indicating continued discomfort and lack of knowledge for use of pharmacotherapy. Algorithms are used routinely to guide providers in treatment selection for many different disorders that are not within their specialty such as diabetes management, obesity, arthritis, and other disorders. In addition, we tested the use of provider algorithms for the treatment of depression and smoking with PLWH and demonstrated increased utilization of these medications. For this renewal, we are proposing an implementation science test of using an algorithm that will build upon our success with CBI and integrate alcohol pharmacotherapies and other behavioral therapies within routine treatment. A decision-tree algorithm that provides more intensive treatments, including alcohol pharmacotherapies, that is also responsive to comorbidities such as depressive or anxiety symptoms will be tested in three HIV clinics across CFAR Network of Integrated Clinical Systems (CNICS). Primary outcomes include reduced alcohol consumption and frequency, improved HIV outcomes, and improvement in comorbid conditions. We will also examine provider, staff, patient, and clinic-level facilitators and barriers to implementation of this algorithm in routine clinical care. Successful implementation of this treatment approach would have considerable impact on reducing AUDs among PLWH and could be integrated within existing electronic health record systems for a sustainable model of alcohol treatment delivery to other HIV clinics. Hazardous alcohol use is the fourth leading cause of preventable death in the United States and is up to twice as high among PLWH. Algorithms have been developed to increase the efficacy of the treatment of chronic diseases with tremendous success but have never been empirically tested to aid in alcohol use disorders (AUDs). We propose to test an algorithm developed to aid providers in selecting behavioral and pharmacotherapy for the treatment of AUDs for PLWH engaged in care.",3/3 Alcohol Research Consortium in HIV – Intervention Research Arm (ARCH-IRA),9768294,U01AA020802,"['AIDS/HIV problem', 'Achievement', 'Adherence', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Alcohol abuse', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohols', 'Algorithms', 'Anxiety', 'Appointment', 'Area', 'Arthritis', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinic', 'Clinic Visits', 'Clinical', 'Comorbidity', 'Computers', 'Counseling', 'Decision Aid', 'Decision Trees', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Drug Use Disorder', 'Drug usage', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Eligibility Determination', 'Enrollment', 'Evidence based treatment', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'General Population', 'Geography', 'HIV', 'Heavy Drinking', 'Hepatitis C virus', 'Home environment', 'Hypertension', 'Incentives', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Intervention Studies', 'Knowledge', 'Maintenance', 'Medical', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Outcomes Assessments', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Population', 'Provider', 'Recurrence', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk Factors', 'Selection for Treatments', 'Services', 'Severities', 'Site', 'Smoking', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Visit', 'alcohol abuse therapy', 'alcohol misuse', 'alcohol research', 'alcohol screening', 'alcohol services', 'alcohol use disorder', 'anxiety symptoms', 'arm', 'base', 'binge drinking', 'brief alcohol intervention', 'brief intervention', 'care providers', 'clinical care', 'computerized', 'consumption measures', 'depressive symptoms', 'diabetes management', 'drinking', 'evidence base', 'hazardous drinking', 'implementation research', 'implementation science', 'improved', 'medical specialties', 'modifiable risk', 'mortality', 'motivational enhancement therapy', 'novel', 'preventable death', 'primary outcome', 'reduced alcohol use', 'routine screening', 'smoking cessation', 'success', 'transmission process', 'treatment effect', 'treatment response', 'treatment strategy']",NIAAA,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,U01,2019,340037,0.15589576624188314
"Multi-modal connectivity methods for the validation of Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder diagnostic criteria Project Summary: FASD is a serious public health crisis with 80,000 to 120,000 U.S. pregnancies per year at high risk. FASD diagnostic clinics are very sparse, difficult to sustain because of diagnostic complexity, unable to meet demand, and plagued by disagreement about diagnostic criteria. A recent comparison of five FASD diagnostic systems acknowledged that the lack of objective biomarkers for prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) contributes to disagreement in the field. The goal of the proposed work is to develop and refine neuroimaging methods capable of identifying subtle neurodevelopmental abnormalities in PAE. A critical component of this project will be to apply these refined neuroimaging “biomarkers” to examine the validity and performance of the most commonly-used FASD diagnostic criteria (alcohol exposure, dysmorphology, growth, and cognition). The proposed project will push the development of imaging methods and will also include an examination of the sensitivity and specificity of current diagnostic factors. The aims are: 1) perform a comprehensive characterization of the FASD “connectome” using state-of- the-art Human Connectome Project (HCP) methods in children with PAE, 2) evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of FASD diagnostic criteria to provide objective evaluation of FASD criteria (which remain in flux), 3) characterize relationships between connectomics and cognitive functioning, & 4) examine the developmental course of functional connectivity, white matter connectivity, cortical gyrification, and intra-cortical myelin. Participants will undergo longitudinal re-assessment at 15-months to match the new HCP-development paradigm (HCP-D) to allow for comparison to a large normative dataset being collected in Minnesota as part of the HCP-D project. We will capitalize on the developments spawned from the $40 million HCP and will benefit from evaluating the brains of children with PAE against the backdrop of a very large HCP normative dataset (n=1300). The proposed study will examine 45 participants with PAE and 45 matched controls, ages 8-16, all of whom will be evaluated by the CIFASD dysmorphology project. Participants will undergo MRI scans at the University of Minnesota's Center for Magnetic Resonance Research (CMRR) at baseline and again 15 months later. The imaging protocol, which contains very high resolution structural, diffusion- weighted, and fMRI scans will evaluate cortical gyrification, intra-cortical myelin, white matter connectivity, and functional connectivity. Data from the HCP-D project will be used as secondary “normative” comparison dataset. We expect to find a number of subtle neurodevelopmental abnormalities in PAE that have not previously been observed and we will characterize individuals with these metrics. Individual identification of neurodevelopmental anomalies will then allow us to probe the screening properties of commonly used FASD diagnostic criteria and to test the performance of Dr. Mattson's Decision Tree model for rapidly identifying children with developmental effects of PAE. The study will have direct implications for FASD clinical practice and public policies as it will provide objective data about the relative advantages and disadvantages of individual diagnostic elements and it will allow for comparisons of competing FASD diagnostic systems. The proposed project aims to use the most advanced MRI brain imaging techniques available to address a highly practical problem faced by clinicians and public health officials: the lack of consensus about diagnostic criteria for Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD) and the challenges of identifying individuals who are affected by prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) but do not have the physical characteristics upon which a diagnosis can be made. The proposed study will identify subtle brain anomalies in children with PAE with a level of sensitivity not previously attainable. The study will push forward our understanding of how PAE negatively affects the efficiency of the brain's networks. In addition, the study will use these brain imaging results to further refine the diagnostic criteria such that more children will be able to be properly identified as having a neurodevelopmental disorder as a result of PAE.",Multi-modal connectivity methods for the validation of Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder diagnostic criteria,9698862,U01AA026102,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Animals', 'Attention', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Categories', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Consensus', 'Control Groups', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Trees', 'Development', 'Developmental Course', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Factor', 'Disadvantaged', 'Dysmorphology', 'Elements', 'Evaluation', 'Executive Dysfunction', 'Face', 'Fetal Alcohol Exposure', 'Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder', 'Fetal alcohol effects', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'MRI Scans', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Minnesota', 'Modeling', 'Myelin', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neurodevelopmental Impairment', 'Neurosciences', 'Participant', 'Performance', 'Predictive Value', 'Pregnancy', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Proxy', 'Psychometrics', 'Public Health', 'Public Policy', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Resource Sharing', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Site', 'Structural defect', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Work', 'alcohol exposure', 'clinical diagnostics', 'clinical practice', 'clinically relevant', 'cognitive function', 'connectome', 'diffusion weighted', 'executive function', 'functional MRI scan', 'high risk', 'imaging modality', 'longitudinal analysis', 'longitudinal dataset', 'multidisciplinary', 'multimodality', 'negative affect', 'neurobehavioral disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroimaging marker', 'performance tests', 'prisma', 'processing speed', 'screening', 'white matter']",NIAAA,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,U01,2019,347168,0.08368520905072079
"Can a Chatbot-delivered Alcohol Intervention Engage Users and Enhance Outcomes Over a Smartphone App? Development and Feasibility Testing of a StepAway 'Bot' PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT A wide gap exists between the number of individuals needing alcohol treatment and those actually receiving it. Many factors account for this gap, including stigma, treatment availability and affordability, and individuals wanting to solve their problems independently. Technologically-delivered interventions may dramatically increase the number of individuals who receive needed alcohol intervention services due to their ability to circumvent treatment barriers. Smartphones are the ideal devices to provide empirically-supported intervention assistance whenever and wherever it is needed. Our research team previously developed and tested a stand-alone, self-administered smartphone-based intervention system for alcohol use disorders that was based on empirically supported face-to-face treatments. This Location-Based Monitoring and Intervention for Alcohol Use Disorders (LBMI-A) system provided a progression through psychoeducational modules and in-the-moment interventions to reduce the likelihood of drinking. In a preliminary 6-week trial study, we contrasted the LBMI-A with a web-based intervention, the Drinker's Checkup (DCU) that was supplemented with bibliotherapy. While alcohol consumption was reduced by >50% in both interventions, only the LBMI-A produced a significant increase in percentage of days abstinent. Greater LBMI-A usage was associated with greater reductions in drinking. A revised and improved iPhone-based version, Step Away, has been developed and has been used by individuals downloading it from the iTunes App Store. Our Step Away usage data indicate that user engagement with modules that are not “pushed” to the user is relatively low, which is a problem that many health apps experience. A new method of delivering Step Away through an artificially intelligent chatbot will be developed in this study that holds potential for providing enhanced user engagement and effectiveness as it can reach out through a text interface to introduce new intervention steps and respond to the user with Step Away's in-the-moment help with having a craving, experiencing distress or needing social support. It could serve as a personal assistant that guides a user through a process of changing their drinking. This project will focus on developing a Step Away chatbot during the first phase of the study. We will also enhance the existing Step Away app's user interface for optimal usability. The second phase will entail performing a pilot study to determine if the Step Away chatbot has enhanced user engagement, intervention fidelity and outcome efficacy in comparison to the Step Away app among a group of problem drinkers. A control condition will consist of a minimal intervention; an assessment-only app. Participants will be interviewed to determine their perceptions of both interventions with a view towards understanding barriers to user engagement. Finally, this project will set the stage for a further, large-scale evaluation of Step Away, the content of which will be determined by the outcome of the pilot study. PROJECT NARRATIVE Smartphone-based alcohol interventions hold potential to bridge the wide gap between the number of individuals needing alcohol intervention and those actually receiving it, but more research is needed about their outcome efficacy and the optimal way to engage users in this new type of intervention. This study will continue to refine an empirically supported smartphone app (Step Away) and develop a similarly focused chatbot that will serve as a personal assistant to an individual interested in changing their drinking. We will also perform a pilot study that will compare user engagement and alcohol outcome variables across the two approaches.",Can a Chatbot-delivered Alcohol Intervention Engage Users and Enhance Outcomes Over a Smartphone App?

"Neural Correlates of Emotion Regulation in Youth at Risk for Alcoholism Project Summary/Abstract According to the latest estimates, over 1 in 7 Americans will develop an Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD) over the course of their lifetime, and alcohol consumption is involved in nearly 4% of deaths worldwide. Thus, AUDs represent a significant public health concern. Currently, the best pharmacotherapies for AUDs require the treatment of 10 patients to observe 1 patient reduce drinking to healthy levels. For this reason, one appealing option is to identify at-risk individuals before they become heavy drinkers; for instance a family history of alcoholism is currently among the best predictors of AUD. Adolescence presents an ideal period to study these factors as it precedes the onset of AUDs but is also a time when there is a rapid increase in consumption. We have recently shown that neuroimaging measures can be used to predict clinically meaningful outcomes (e.g. relapse), suggesting it would also be possible to develop neuroimaging as a predictor of onset of heavy drinking in adolescents. Developing predictive tools to identify adolescents likely to progress to heavy drinking would offer the opportunity for early intervention and could potentially reduce the progression to AUD. Substantial evidence suggests that primary motives for problematic drinking are to enhance positive valence and reduce negative valence emotions. Further, substance use disorders are associated with altered activity in the insula, ventral striatum, amygdala, and anterior cingulate cortex when processing potential rewards and aversive outcomes. We hypothesize that individuals at risk for AUDs will show heightened response to aversive stimuli in the anterior insula and amygdala and heightened response to rewarding stimuli in the ventral striatum and anterior cingulate cortex. We further hypothesize that they will exhibit diminished functional connectivity between reward, salience, and executive control networks. To test this, we will recruit 70 adolescents aged 18–20. Half will be have a biological parent with an AUD. The other half will be a control group matched on current drinking levels, age, gender, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status. All participants will undergo a functional MRI scan with a resting state run and a run during a modified version of the monetary incentive delay task that includes the risk of hearing an aversive sound (i.e. a loud scream). All participants will be followed for 6 months after the scan to determine levels of drinking. This study will provide both mechanistic information on risk for AUD as well as a tool to identify adolescents at greatest risk prior to the onset of problem drinking. This information could help provide personalized information about risk that may maximize likelihood of AUD prevention. In addition to the research goals described above, this is a training proposal that is designed to facilitate the transition of the primary investigator, Dr. Joshua Gowin, from mentored post-doctoral research fellow to independent, tenure-track research faculty at an academic institution. The mentored phase of the proposal will use a multifaceted training plan to improve Dr. Gowin’s knowledge base as well as his research and professional skillsets. Specifically, Dr. Gowin will learn new techniques in resting state functional connectivity analysis and in the cognitive neuroscience of emotion regulation. In addition to this scientific training, Dr. Gowin will gain experience management, teaching, and data presentation. To achieve these goals, Dr. Gowin has assembled a team of advisors from the intra- and extramural community with expertise in these areas to guide his training and development. This committee will include Dr. Vijay Ramchandani-NIAAA, Dr. Monique Ernst-NIMH, Dr. Elliot Stein-NIDA, and Dr. Susan Tapert-UCSD (see letters of support). The skills that will be developed during the mentored phase will position Dr. Gowin for success as he applies for an independent position and establishes his own research program. Project Narrative  Alcohol use disorders will affect over one in 10 Americans over the course of their lifetime. The early identification of individuals at greatest risk may provide opportunities to educate or provide services that mitigate individual risk. Therefore, identifying risk factors for alcohol use disorders is an important goal for researchers. One emerging target for research involves using functional MRI to study brain systems that contribute to risk. This project will explore the neural correlates of positive and negative valence emotional processing and how they contribute to risk for the development of alcohol use disorders. Better understanding of these neural processes could inform us about how alcohol use disorders emerge and, importantly, how we might prevent them.",Neural Correlates of Emotion Regulation in Youth at Risk for Alcoholism,9772202,R00AA024778,"['Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alcohol abuse', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcoholic beverage heavy drinker', 'Alcoholism', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anterior', 'Area', 'Aversive Stimulus', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Consumption', 'Control Groups', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Development', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Extramural Activities', 'Family', 'Family history of', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Hearing', 'Heavy Drinking', 'Individual', 'Institution', 'Insula of Reil', 'Learning', 'Letters', 'Loudness', 'Matched Group', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism', 'Negative Valence', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Personality', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phase', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Positive Valence', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Predictive Value', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Questionnaires', 'Recording of previous events', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Review Literature', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Services', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Stimulus', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'System', 'Targeted Research', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Ventral Striatum', 'Youth', 'aged', 'alcohol risk', 'alcohol use disorder', 'base', 'career', 'cingulate cortex', 'clinical predictors', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'design', 'disorder prevention', 'disorder risk', 'drinking', 'drinking behavior', 'emotion regulation', 'executive function', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'faculty research', 'financial incentive', 'follow-up', 'functional MRI scan', 'high risk', 'improved', 'knowledge base', 'machine learning algorithm', 'negative affect', 'neural correlate', 'neuroimaging', 'positive emotional state', 'predicting response', 'predictive tools', 'prevent', 'programs', 'recruit', 'relapse prediction', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'skills', 'sound', 'success', 'tenure track', 'tool', 'underage drinking']",NIAAA,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,R00,2019,249000,0.06135314680650983
"1-D Titania Nanostructure Based Wearable Alcohol Sensor with Tunable Sensitivity and Artificial Intelligence PROJECT SUMMARY The overarching goal of this proposal is to develop an artificially intelligent alcohol sensor that is wearable, non- invasive, smart, and aesthetic. The aim, in Phase I, is to design and develop the alcohol sensor based on metal (i.e., Cobalt) functionalized Titanium nanotubes (TiNT) to detect, monitor, and display blood alcohol levels in real-time using microcontrollers-based wrist-band like devices. At the core of our innovation, we have Cobalt- functionalized TiNT sensors which are capable of detecting alcohol exposure from the skin in 1ppm level that can be tuned down to 1ppb level as well (i.e., sensitivity of the sensor is tunable). The control unit of our system is reusable, sensors are replaceable, the microcontrollers are equipped with a micro-SD card for personal-data storage, and the proposed unit has a built-in wireless system for data transmission. This proposal also aims, in Phase II, to create an integrated artificially intelligent (AI) network that will have the capabilities of (a) translating the real-time data into a pre-cautious safety signals that will communicate with the personal vehicle safety features through a wireless signal (i.e., Bluetooth), and (c) adaptively taking unattended decisions-on-demand (DoD) through machine learning when the driver is heavily intoxicated. 1 Project Narrative Breath-analyzers within the law enforcement settings alone cannot tackle the problems associated with alcohol consumptions and abuse. Recently developed wearable alcohol sensor technologies mostly rely on wet-electrochemical environments around the skin. Therefore, we propose to develop wearable alcohol sensor using titania nanotube which will be dry, non- invasive, artificially intelligent, and aesthetic.

"Identifying Children and Teens at Risk for Early Onset Alcohol Use: An Innovative Application of Machine Learning Algorithms to Prevention PROJECT SUMMARY Early onset of alcohol use during adolescence is associated with increased probability of later alcohol dependence, polydrug abuse, victimization, conduct problems, psychiatric comorbidities, and delayed achievement of adult milestones. Methods that yield rapid, accurate, and reliable predictions of which children and teens are at risk for early onset can improve the targeting of prevention interventions and enable the concentration of resources on the most debilitating and costly cases. One promising and untapped approach to this prediction problem is machine learning (also called “statistical learning,” “data mining,” or “predictive modeling”), a class of techniques arising from statistics, computer science, and engineering that seeks to build data-driven predictive algorithms. These techniques are most noticeably distinguished from “traditional” statistical methods (e.g., ordinary least squares regression) by their extreme emphasis on prediction of future cases, rather than explanation of the current data, and thus they may offer dramatic advantages over traditional approaches to identifying which children and teens will develop early onset alcohol use. This proposal will explore the potential contribution of machine learning methods by directly comparing their predictive performance to that of the traditional approach in a large-scale, multisite longitudinal study of the development of early onset alcohol use (N = 731). If machine learning methods do significantly outperform the traditional approach, future directions might include the development and implementation of machine-learning- based screening methods for real-world use. On the other hand, if machine learning methods do not outperform the traditional approach, this will suggest that at least in the context of the present study (i.e., these predictors, timeline, and outcome), machine learning does not improve the prediction of early onset alcohol use. Analyses will investigate whether the performance of machine learning methods varies across the nature of predictor variables use, the age span covered, and the outcome to be predicted. Thus, the current proposal uses an extant longitudinal dataset to carry out two specific aims: (1) Train five different machine learning algorithms and one traditional algorithm (ordinary logistic regression) for predicting later early onset alcohol use in a subset (70%) of the data. (2) Test these six predictive algorithms on the rest (30%) of the data and directly compare their predictive performance in multiple contexts. PROJECT NARRATIVE Prospectively predicting which children and teens are at risk for early onset alcohol use enables targeted implementation of preventive interventions. Machine learning is a promising yet untapped approach that may be well-suited to this task. This study investigates the potential of several machine learning algorithms to contribute to the rapid, accurate, and reliable identification of individuals at risk for early onset alcohol use.",Identifying Children and Teens at Risk for Early Onset Alcohol Use: An Innovative Application of Machine Learning Algorithms to Prevention,9540250,F31AA026768,"['Achievement', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Advertising', 'Age', 'Alcohol abuse', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohol dependence', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Attention', 'Behavioral', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Cocaine Dependence', 'Comorbidity', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Engineering', 'Fraud', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Impulsivity', 'Individual', 'Lasso', 'Least-Squares Analysis', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Performance', 'Prevention', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Probability', 'Procedures', 'Public Health', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Services', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Techniques', 'Teenagers', 'Testing', 'TimeLine', 'Training', 'Trees', 'Victimization', 'Work', 'addiction', 'alcohol screening', 'base', 'computer science', 'conduct problem', 'cost', 'data mining', 'early alcohol use', 'early onset', 'field study', 'forest', 'improved', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'longitudinal dataset', 'multidrug abuse', 'outcome prediction', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'psychologic', 'screening', 'search engine', 'spam', 'speech recognition', 'statistics', 'success', 'underage drinking', 'vector']",NIAAA,ARIZONA STATE UNIVERSITY-TEMPE CAMPUS,F31,2018,44524,0.13235994120542574
"A Machine Learning Approach for Inferring Alcohol Intoxication Levels from Gait Data Almost a quarter of the population aged 18 years and older reports binge drinking in the last month. Excessive alcohol consumption is associated with significant health and psychosocial consequences. Despite these high rates of problematic drinking, the majority (85%-90%) of individuals believe they can control drinking behavior on their own. Self-monitoring of drinking is key to behavior change, yet recent approaches utilizing mobile technology to collect real-time data have been limited by participant burden, poor compliance, and inaccuracy. Gait analysis, is one of the most reliable way to determine intoxication in humans. We developed AlcoGait, a smartphone-based alcohol tracking technology that passively infers level of drinking from gait impairment. In the current study, we will continue to refine AlcoGait's machine learning algorithms to passively analyze gait and trunk sway data in order to accurately determine gait impairment associated with elevated BrAC levels, particularly .08 g%. While the use of smartphone technology to conduct gait analysis has been employed with various patient populations, it has yet to be utilized for assessing gait in the context of alcohol intoxication. We will administer alcohol to 250 participants in a laboratory setting. We will collect gait and trunk sway data from the smartphone's accelerometer and gyroscope at preset breath alcohol concentration (BrAC) levels up to the legal limit of .08g%. In Stage 1 (technology preparation), we will program the AlcoGait 2.0 smartphone application to passively gather and export both accelerometer and gyroscope data (gait information) based on the first 10 participants. In Stage 2 (data gathering, analysis and machine learning), the next 190 participants will serve as a “training set,” providing input data for AlcoGait 2.0; these data will allow for the comparison of 4 classifiers types (machine-learning methodologies) that infer BrAC levels associated with impairment, particularly with .08 g%, using gait and trunk sway data. In Stage 3, the best performing classifier as determined using the training set will be programmed into the final AlcoGait 2.0 app and validated with an additional 50 participants completing the alcohol administration laboratory study (“validation set”). AlcoGait 2.0's ability to accurately associate gait impairment with legal intoxication would represent a great advance over other smartphone applications that require the user to manually record and track amount, time, and types of alcohol consumption. With our app's focus on motor impairment, we see our primary users as those who, despite subjective perceptions or counting drinks, are unable to estimate their BrAC accurately but would want to know if they are too impaired to drive. This technology could be used preventively to alert drinkers of impairment and intoxication in real time, mitigating negative consequences. Passive smartphone-based sensing technologies present minimal burden to users and can have ubiquitous impact as smartphones are now widely owned across all ages, ethnicities, and socioeconomic groups. Project Narrative Almost a quarter of the population aged 18 years and older reports binge drinking in the last month. Despite these high rates of problematic drinking, the majority of individuals do not receive formal alcohol treatment, often because they believe they can control drinking behavior on their own. Self-monitoring of drinking is key to behavior change, yet recent approaches utilizing mobile technology to collect real-time data have been limited by participant burden, poor compliance, and inaccuracy. Smartphone technology, leveraging the long-studied connection between alcohol intoxication and gait impairment, allows alcohol use self-monitoring to enter a new era. Such technology, as pioneered in our phone app Alcogait, where gait is passively recorded during usual activities, could be used preventively to alert drinkers when they are passing various blood alcohol concentrations, and when they are legally intoxicated in real time based on gait impairment.",A Machine Learning Approach for Inferring Alcohol Intoxication Levels from Gait Data,9532068,R21AA025193,"['18 year old', 'Accelerometer', 'Address', 'Age', 'Agreement', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcoholic Intoxication', 'Alcohols', 'Algorithms', 'Awareness', 'Behavioral', 'Blood alcohol level measurement', 'Cellular Phone', 'Classification', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Future', 'Gait', 'Health', 'Heavy Drinking', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intoxication', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Laboratory Study', 'Learning', 'Legal', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Monitor', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Perception', 'Persons', 'Population', 'Preparation', 'Preventive', 'Reporting', 'Sample Size', 'Self-control as a personality trait', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Supervision', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Visit', 'Walking', 'Work', 'alcohol abuse therapy', 'alcohol content', 'base', 'behavior change', 'binge drinking', 'breath alcohol measurement', 'brief intervention', 'design', 'drinking', 'drinking behavior', 'experimental study', 'forest', 'gait examination', 'impaired driving performance', 'improved', 'mobile computing', 'motor impairment', 'patient population', 'programs', 'psychosocial', 'sensor technology', 'smartphone Application', 'socioeconomics']",NIAAA,"BUTLER HOSPITAL (PROVIDENCE, RI)",R21,2018,176960,0.15548969172173605
"Machine Learning for Computerized Surveillance of Tobacco and Alcohol Brands in Streamed Entertainment Media Consumption of cancer causing products (CCPs) is the root cause of many of the cancers and chronic diseases we aim to cure with translational medicine. Tobacco and alcohol consumption is a function of highly successful, coordinated global business models that promote consumption. The marketing of CCPs can be seen as a disease vector that drives CCP consumption and worthy of surveillance. The present project addresses the marketing of tobacco and alcohol to young people in the current media environment, in which youths increasingly stream their entertainment in a relatively commercial free environment. To address decreasing reach of traditional advertising, companies have sought to embed their brands in the entertainment itself. Alcohol companies actively seek entertainment placement deals. While cigarette companies have agreed not to pay for product placement, they may evade current restrictions by burying placements in the massive streamed entertainment environment. E-cigarette companies have no such restrictions and advertise on television. Youths obtain exposure to brands that spend more on advertising (e.g., Budweiser); these are also the most commonly consumed brands by youth. Product placement exposures may put adolescents at greater risk for CCP consumption. This study represents the first step in assessing that risk--to obtain infoveillance on CCP brand prevalence in streamed entertainment media. Aim 1 involves a partnership with machine learning researchers at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) to develop and validate a computer recognition system for major cigarette, e-cigarette, and alcohol brands in streamed entertainment media. Aim 1 relies on an existing, large Dartmouth media training library that includes detailed timing for tobacco and alcohol brands from over 2000 contemporary movies. JPL researchers will use the Dartmouth media library, combined with a large corpus of brand logos retrieved from the web, to train and validate an automated Video Content Coding (VCC) system that identifies content associated with key alcohol and tobacco brands. The VCC system will leverage recent techniques to construct robust object detection systems using Convolutional Neural Networks built on large image databases, along with text extraction methods to identify brand names in advertising logos. Second, we will deploy the automated recognition system on the Dartmouth computer cluster to assess the frequency of major cigarette, e-cigarette, and alcohol brand placements from a large sample of streamed/cable and movie entertainment. This proposal involves a unique multidisciplinary team of Dartmouth behavioral scientists and NASA machine learning scientists who will leverage new technologies to study a significant CCP marketing platform. The novel approach offers unprecedented opportunities to conduct surveillance on CCP marketing in large media samples. Our project will set the stage for future research on exposure to this type of marketing and its relation to CCP consumption in youths and lead to a better understanding of the risks CCP brand placements pose to health. Project Narrative This project addresses the potential exposure of youth to marketing of cancer causing products— tobacco and alcohol— in the popular commercial-free streaming environment, where products are embedded in the media itself through product placement. We will employ machine learning to develop an automated visual recognition system for major tobacco and alcohol brands and deploy that system to evaluate brand placement in a large sample of streamed entertainment from cable (e.g., HBO) and other (e.g., Netflix Originals) companies. This surveillance program will have the capability to monitor embedded marketing across many platforms and ultimately allow us to assess youth exposure to embedded brands and its relation with early onset of tobacco and alcohol use.",Machine Learning for Computerized Surveillance of Tobacco and Alcohol Brands in Streamed Entertainment Media,9503952,R01CA225845,"['Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adopted', 'Advertising', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcoholic Beverages', 'Alcohols', 'Attitude', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Businesses', 'Cancer Control', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Cigarette', 'Code', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communication', 'Communication Methods', 'Communication Research', 'Computers', 'Consumption', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Disease', 'Disease Vectors', 'Electronic cigarette', 'Environment', 'Epidemic', 'Exposure to', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heart Diseases', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Image', 'Immersion Investigative Technique', 'Influenza', 'Internet', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Life Style', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Marketing', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Names', 'Perception', 'Plant Roots', 'Play', 'Prevalence', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scientific Inquiry', 'Scientist', 'Shapes', 'Smoking', 'Stream', 'Surveillance Program', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Television', 'Text', 'Time', 'Tobacco', 'Tobacco Surveillance', 'Tobacco use', 'Training', 'United States', 'United States National Aeronautics and Space Administration', 'Visual', 'Work', 'Youth', 'cancer risk', 'cohort', 'computer cluster', 'computerized', 'drinking', 'early onset', 'handheld mobile device', 'innovation', 'movie', 'movie exposure', 'multidisciplinary', 'new technology', 'novel strategies', 'programs', 'response', 'tobacco advertising', 'tobacco exposure', 'translational medicine']",NCI,DARTMOUTH COLLEGE,R01,2018,627735,0.06607829687661819
"Estimating BrAC/BAC from Transdermal Alcohol: Combining First-Principles Physiological Models with Machine-Learning to Create Software to Optimally Process and Quantitatively Interpret Biosensor Data Abstract Transdermal alcohol biosensors offer a promising method for unobtrusively collecting continuous alcohol levels in naturalistic settings over long periods of time. Devices are now available to reliably measure transdermal alcohol concentration (TAC), the amount of alcohol diffusing through the skin, but an often overlooked yet critical issue for making these biosensors valuable is that TAC does not consistently correlate with the easily interpretable measures of breath and blood alcohol concentrations (BrAC/BAC) across individuals, environmental conditions, and devices. The goal of this study is to produce software to convert TAC data into estimates of BrAC/BAC (eBrAC/eBAC). We will meet this goal by 1) developing mathematical models to produce quantitative eBrAC from TAC data, 2) examining alternative options for calibrating these models, 3) testing the model fits using varied types and amounts of very precise data, and 4) packaging the models into a comprehensive data assimilation software program. Specifically, we will enhance the fidelity of the models by integrating advanced physics/physiological-based models with statistical methods and data-driven machine- learning techniques. To reduce the burden currently required to calibrate the models for each individual, we will test a number of calibration procedures, including the replacement of the laboratory alcohol administration session with more varied drinking protocols as well as with population-based parameter estimates. We will test our models and protocols using detailed consumption data collected 1) on two of the investigators, 2) on 40 participants who will each participate in four controlled laboratory drinking sessions, and 3) on 40 participants who will each participate in a field trial and laboratory sessions. We will examine model fits across drinking patterns when using varying amounts of individualized alcohol data (e.g., breath analyzer, drink diary) to calibrate the models, and within and across individuals with differing characteristics (e.g., gender, weight) and under variable conditions (e.g., humidity, heart rate) that may affect model fit. We will create a data assimilation software system, the BrAC Estimator software, that incorporates all available data to produce the most accurate eBrAC measures. The software output will include the identification of drinking episodes, continuous eBrAC signal, and eBrAC summary scores (e.g., peak eBrAC, time of peak eBrAC, area under the drinking curve) with confidence bands. The software will be platform-portable to run alone or to be integrated into other mobile health technologies or precision medicine protocols. This proposal is innovative, technologically sophisticated, and feasible, and would result in the first tool to accomplish the TAC-eBrAC conversion, finally making it possible to obtain interpretable quantitative measurement of naturalistic alcohol consumption in the field. The anticipated result of this study is the expanded utility of TAC biosensors for researchers, clinicians, and individuals to monitor naturalistic alcohol consumption and easily understand the results. Narrative This research program will advance mathematical models and methodological techniques to make it possible to obtain quantitative estimates of breath and blood alcohol concentration levels from the data produced by transdermal alcohol sensors. By making these methodological advancements available in software programs for use by non-mathematicians, the proposed study has the capability of widely enhancing the alcohol research community’s ability to investigate a variety of alcohol-related research topics that cannot be captured retrospectively or in laboratory settings, including naturalistic patterns of consumption, individual differences in response to alcohol, real-time drinking behavior and decisions, clinical intervention outcomes, and the prevention and treatment of alcoholism. More broadly, the software can be integrated with personal health monitoring systems for general public use and provide easily interpreted personalized alcohol consumption feedback.",Estimating BrAC/BAC from Transdermal Alcohol: Combining First-Principles Physiological Models with Machine-Learning to Create Software to Optimally Process and Quantitatively Interpret Biosensor Data,9426777,R01AA026368,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohols', 'Area', 'Area Under Curve', 'Assimilations', 'Biosensor', 'Blood alcohol level measurement', 'Calibration', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Concentration measurement', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diffuse', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Feedback', 'Galvanic Skin Response', 'Gender', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Technology', 'Heart Rate', 'Humidity', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Linear Models', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Physics', 'Physiological', 'Plug-in', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reading', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Running', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Skin', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Temperature', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Uncertainty', 'Weight', 'Work', 'alcohol measurement', 'alcohol research', 'alcohol response', 'alcoholism therapy', 'base', 'breath alcohol measurement', 'data reduction', 'diaries', 'drinking', 'drinking behavior', 'improved', 'innovation', 'mHealth', 'mathematical methods', 'mathematical model', 'physiologic model', 'population based', 'portability', 'precision medicine', 'programs', 'sensor', 'software systems', 'time interval', 'time use', 'tool', 'unsupervised learning']",NIAAA,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,R01,2018,586877,0.18128072068629023
": Complex systems analysis of the impact of alcohol on bone in non-human primates PROJECT SUMMARY Understanding the impact of alcohol consumption on bone health is important because alcohol influences bone metabolism and over half of the adult population in the United States drinks alcoholic beverages. Low to moderate levels of alcohol consumption are generally associated with beneficial skeletal effects while chronic alcohol abuse predisposes individuals to bone fractures. The long-term goal of our research is to delineate the primary mechanisms mediating the divergent skeletal effects of low/moderate and heavy alcohol consumption. An appreciation of the precise effects and mechanisms of action of alcohol on bone metabolism is important because of the enormous economic, social and personal burden associated with poor bone health. Progress in understanding the actions of alcohol on bone metabolism are hampered by (1) the extreme difficulty in performing intervention studies in humans, (2) limitations of commonly used animal models, (3) failure to adequately consider alcohol’s effects on tissue and organ systems that impact bone, and (4) difficulty in accurately replicating human drinking behavior in animals. The studies proposed in this R01 application will overcome limitations of human and prior animal studies by using a non-human primate (monkey) model for voluntary alcohol consumption that mimics the full range of human drinking behavior. We will use linear regression models, multivariate linear regression models, machine learning, and systems analysis to establish the impact of pattern of alcohol consumption (none, light/moderate, binge, heavy and very heavy) on bone metabolism in rhesus (Macaca mulatta; n=105) and cynomolgus (Macaca fascicularis; n=86) macaques in the context of sex, age and alcohol-induced perturbations in tissue and organ systems that can influence bone. We will identify the latter perturbations by determining the effect of alcohol on specific protein (e.g., peptide hormones and cytokines) and small molecule (e.g., steroid hormones) effectors in blood. Our central hypothesis, based in part on our preliminary data in rats, macaques and humans, is that changes in the blood levels of bone-active hormones and cytokines, derived from several tissues/organs, in response to alcohol intake act in concert to modulate bone cell number and activity. To test our hypothesis, we propose the following two Specific Aims: Specific Aim 1: Define the correlative relationships between the quantity and pattern of alcohol consumption and bone in male and female macaques. Specific Aim 2: Define the correlative relationships among blood ethanol levels, key bone active hormones and cytokines, and biochemical markers of bone turnover in male and female macaques. At the completion of this project, we expect to have established that the magnitude of skeletal response to alcohol will correlate with changes in serum biochemical markers of bone turnover which, in turn, will correlate with changes in circulating levels of specific hormones and cytokines. The primary positive impact of our anticipated findings is identification of key underlying factors responsible for the complex, context-dependent actions of alcohol on bone metabolism. PROJECT NARRATIVE Alcohol is an important nonessential component of diet that has been implicated in having both positive and negative effects on the skeleton. The proposed studies will evaluate the impact of pattern of alcohol consumption (none, light/moderate, binge, heavy, and very heavy) on bone in a non-human primate model for voluntary drinking that mimics the full range of human drinking behavior.

"Toward a Generalized Framework and Flexible Software Environment for Power Analysis of Alcohol Treatment Randomized Controlled Trials PROJECT SUMMARY Pharmacological and behavioral treatments of alcohol use disorder are only useful to the extent that their effects are robust and reliable. A priori determination of statistical power is one of the most significant steps to maximizing scientific reliability; however, it has historically been largely overlooked in the health sciences. Alcohol researchers are increasingly utilizing complex statistical models (e.g., growth curves, mixture models, social networks); yet, accessible methods for sample size determination for all but the simplest statistical tests have not been broadly disseminated. Moreover, even for models in which software programs are readily available, scientists consistently express uncertainty regarding expected parameter estimates, prohibiting the utility of power analysis itself. As a result, many randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are likely not optimally designed to allow for conclusive statistical inference. The overall objective of this proposal is to close this gap by developing a generalized method for power analysis using a combination of established and innovative approaches that can be used to generate and test a vast array of models used in treatment research. This objective will be achieved by pursuing two specific aims: develop a flexible, user-friendly software interface for statistical power and sensitivity analysis (Aim 1); and develop a generalized framework for determining model parameter estimates (Aim 2). The proposal is innovative because the software interface will be grounded in state-of-the-art advancements in computational technology and human-computer interaction. In addition, the framework will be fortified by advances in generalizability-theory-based meta-analyses and guided walk and machine-learning-based simulation studies investigating the effects of uncertainty in individual model parameters on the likelihood of observing hypothesized effects. The software will include automated sensitivity analyses to identify parameters with the largest impact on power and will recommend starting parameters. Development and testing will be grounded in the naltrexone and cognitive behavioral therapy literatures. Their widespread use and diversity of methodological approaches make them ideal testbeds from which to generalize to other treatment domains. This research is synergistic with each of the goals within the NIAAA Strategic Plan (2017-2021). Perhaps most significantly, methodology and guidelines will be developed for designing RCTs that have sufficient precision to distinguish trajectories, mechanisms, heterogeneity, and specificity of treatment efficacy. These efforts will provide researchers with the required a priori information to execute studies that ensure the robustness of their results. The development of these tools for RCT design will have implications for all areas of alcohol treatment research, including in-the-moment risk behaviors, person- level (comorbid) characteristics, targeting underserved and vulnerable populations, and large-scale initiatives. As a result, this proposal will allow for more definitive identification of efficacious interventions and treatments of alcohol use disorder. PROJECT NARRATIVE NIH-funded research is critical to addressing the nearly 44% lifetime prevalence of alcohol use disorder and reducing the $224 billion in annual preventable costs associated with drinking; thus, it is imperative that conclusions drawn from alcohol treatment research be robust and reliable. A priori determination of statistical power is one of the most significant steps in maximizing valid statistical inferences; yet, it has been historically overlooked in the health sciences and few tools exist for ensuring its accurate estimation. This proposal will develop a generalized framework for determining starting parameters and a flexible and user-friendly software platform for conducting power analyses of a wide range of study designs utilized by alcohol treatment researchers, thereby improving the rigor, reproducibility, and transparency of health science research and enhancing the scientific integrity of clinical and public health initiatives based on such findings.",Toward a Generalized Framework and Flexible Software Environment for Power Analysis of Alcohol Treatment Randomized Controlled Trials,9643182,R01AA027264,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Alcohols', 'Area', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive Therapy', 'Collaborations', 'Comorbidity', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Development', 'Elements', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Ethics', 'Family', 'Family Study', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Growth', 'Guidelines', 'Health Sciences', 'Heterogeneity', 'Individual', 'Influentials', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Linear Regressions', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Naltrexone', 'National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism', 'Non-linear Models', 'Output', 'Pattern', 'Peer Review', 'Persons', 'Pharmacological Treatment', 'Pharmacology', 'Plant Roots', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Procedures', 'Public Health', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Registries', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk Behaviors', 'Sample Size', 'Scientist', 'Social Network', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Specificity', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Models', 'Strategic Planning', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Uncertainty', 'Underserved Population', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Walking', 'alcohol abuse therapy', 'alcohol use disorder', 'base', 'computer human interaction', 'cost', 'design', 'drinking', 'effective therapy', 'flexibility', 'health science research', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'journal article', 'model design', 'novel', 'open data', 'power analysis', 'programs', 'simulation', 'simulation game', 'syntax', 'theories', 'therapy design', 'tool', 'tool development', 'treatment effect', 'treatment trial', 'trial design', 'usability', 'user centered design', 'user friendly software', 'user-friendly', 'virtual', 'web app']",NIAAA,PURDUE UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,715938,0.10934925032215428
"Image Analysis of Neurofacial Effects of Prenatal Alcohol  Exposure Abstract As a constitutent component of CIFASD4, this project will focus on earlier detection of the neurofacial effects of prenatal alcohol exposure. Four topics of the Request for Application (RFA) will be targeted: a) improved FAS/FASD facial recognition through 3D photography and computer analyses in individuals of different age groups; b) the utility of prenatal ultrasound as a screening or diagnostic modality; c) 3D facial imaging during the neonatal period to detect more subtle facial features affected by prenatal alcohol exposure; d) innovative uses of technologies, including handheld devices with apps, to screen for dysmorphology. Previously, we have implemented methods and associated software for analyzing postnatal face shape for the detection of the effects of prenatal alcohol exposure. Although effective in their accuracy, they rely on the use of expensive and relatively clumsy 3D cameras for which not insignificant training is required. New methods of 2D image analysis are available, mobile device acquisition of 3D images is imminent and online recruitment to clinical research is becoming more common place. Finally, state-of-the-art machine learning methods are proving effective in large-scale analysis of ultrasound and MRI data. To accomplish our goals, we propose the following specific aims: 1. Automated screening of facial images for effects of prenatal alcohol exposure with potential for on-line and  mobile device use and integration of genetic, behavioral and cognitive data; 2. Fetal ultrasound analysis to detect facial, cranial and neural effects of prenatal alcohol exposure with  neonatal follow-up; 3. Algorithm and software development to improve current analysis of face-brain-alcohol interactions. Achieving aim 1 will dramatically impact access to validated facial screening for prenatal alcohol exposure. Successful demonstration of aim 2 will achieve the earliest possible diagnosis enabling further research on interventions but also anticipatory neonatal management. Progress in aim 3 will enhance face-brain morphometric analyses in collaboration with other CIFASD partners (U01:Parnell/Eberhart, U01:Wozniak). We will work collaboratively with consortium partners who will recruit subjects and provide facial and ultrasound images (U01: Chambers; U01: Coles; U01: Mattson; U01: Weinberg; U01: Wozniak). We will co- operate on the analysis of images arising from basic science partners focusing on the use of animal models. We will rely on research resources for validation of postnatal screening tools (R24 Dysmorphology - Jones) and online/app development and data management (R24 Informatics - Barnett). Project Narrative The goal of this project is to develop new methods for screening for the effects of prenatal alcohol exposure. It will exploit the wide availability and convenience of smartphone and tablet devices to detect the facial effects in children and adults and new ways of analyzing ultrasound images to detect facial and brain effects in the fetus. Our aim is to establish earlier detection so as to allow earlier intervention to improve outcome.",Image Analysis of Neurofacial Effects of Prenatal Alcohol  Exposure,9524811,U01AA014809,"['3D ultrasound', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Agreement', 'Alcohols', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Basic Science', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Caucasians', 'Cellular Phone', 'Cephalic', 'Child', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Color', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer software', 'Corpus Callosum', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Differential Diagnosis', 'Discrimination', 'Dysmorphology', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Evaluation', 'Face', 'Fetal Alcohol Exposure', 'Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder', 'Fetal alcohol effects', 'Fetus', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Intervention', 'Link', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Monoclonal Antibody R24', 'Neonatal', 'Nose', 'Photography', 'Pilot Projects', 'Pregnancy', 'Preparation', 'Printing', 'Request for Applications', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resources', 'Screening procedure', 'Shapes', 'Software Tools', 'Syndrome', 'Tablet Computer', 'Tablets', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Training', 'Ultrasonography', 'Validation', 'Weight', 'Work', 'age group', 'alcohol exposure', 'base', 'caudate nucleus', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'cohort', 'cost', 'data management', 'experience', 'fetal', 'follow-up', 'handheld equipment', 'handheld mobile device', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'maternal cigarette smoking', 'mouse model', 'neonatal period', 'novel', 'operation', 'postnatal', 'potential biomarker', 'prenatal', 'prenatal testing', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'screening', 'software development', 'tobacco exposure']",NIAAA,UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD,U01,2018,262337,0.0493466754548958
"NCANDA: DATA ANALYSIS RESOURCE PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT During young adulthood, drinking dramatically increases, with binge-level drinking peaking at age 22 and nearly half of individuals who drink report binge-level alcohol use. Frequent binge alcohol use during the protracted neuromaturation extending into the mid 20s may result in greater brain and cognitive effects than similar alcohol use in later adulthood. This application is in response to RFA-AA-17-005, Continuation of the National Consortium on Alcohol and Neurodevelopment in Adolescence (NCANDA) Data Analysis Resource (U24) to determine the predictors and effects of accelerated alcohol use in adolescence and young adulthood. NCANDA-2 will follow the initial cohort of 831 participants (ages 12-21 at first visit) from 5 collection sites and acquire the necessary data to advance our understanding of adolescent development and the effects of alcohol use on the adolescent and young adult brain using multimodal neuroimaging, cognitive testing, and behavioral assessment. The examination of alcohol consequences will focus on structural and functional maturation of brain areas that actively develop during adolescence, are involved in psychological regulation, respond to rewards, and appear vulnerable to deleterious effects of alcohol. With the additional longitudinal data provided by this renewal, we will determine the effects of alcohol exposure on the developmental trajectory of the adolescent human brain and identify preexisting psychobiological vulnerabilities that may put an adolescent or young adult at elevated risk for an alcohol use disorder. The Data Analysis Resource (DAR) will 1) oversee data collection with standardization and comparability across sites; 2) perform data analysis for core measures collected at each site; 3) facilitate across-site pooling and centralized data storage; 4) create a database across assessment modalities for efficient retrieval; 5) coordinate data and resource sharing; 6) harmonize data across sites; and 7) create and implement novel, multimodality analyses using machine learning to engage broad spectrum data. The DAR has 5 Specific Aims: Aim 1. Maintain standardized procedures for collection of neuroimaging, neuropsychological, and clinical  assessment data and harmonize with existing large-scale neurodevelopmental research efforts. Aim 2. Ensure across-site quality control for imaging and neuropsychological data acquisition. Aim 3. Maintain and advance informatics infrastructure for data submission, analysis, and distribution.  a) Maintain a database integrating the diverse and comprehensive data from all NCANDA sites.  b) Provide data to consortium PIs for hypothesis testing within and across experimental domains. Aim 4. Provide macrostructural, microstructural, and fMRI neuroimage processing and analysis. Aim 5. Develop and maintain a data sharing and distribution system for the scientific public. PROJECT NARRATIVE The Data Analysis Resource will provide analysis of longitudinal data provided by this renewal to determine the extent to which structural and functional deficits in neurodevelopmental maturation precede, are caused by, or are exacerbated by initiation of appreciable alcohol use in adolescence.",NCANDA: DATA ANALYSIS RESOURCE,9523393,U24AA021697,"['Abstinence', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adolescent Development', 'Adolescent and Young Adult', 'Adult', 'Adverse effects', 'Affective', 'Age', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohols', 'Area', 'Behavior assessment', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Clinical assessments', 'Cognitive', 'Collection', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Data Storage and Retrieval', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Dose', 'Ensure', 'Event', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Heart Rate', 'Heavy Drinking', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mental disorders', 'Modality', 'Neuropsychology', 'Parietal', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Procedures', 'Quality Control', 'Recovery', 'Regulation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resource Sharing', 'Resources', 'Retrieval', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Saccades', 'Sampling', 'Sex Characteristics', 'Site', 'Sleep', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Models', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Visit', 'alcohol consequences', 'alcohol effect', 'alcohol expectancy', 'alcohol exposure', 'alcohol measurement', 'alcohol risk', 'alcohol use disorder', 'binge drinking', 'cognitive development', 'cognitive performance', 'cognitive testing', 'cohort', 'data acquisition', 'data resource', 'data sharing', 'data submission', 'drinking', 'emerging adult', 'experience', 'externalizing behavior', 'follow-up', 'informatics infrastructure', 'information processing', 'longitudinal analysis', 'longitudinal design', 'multimodality', 'neural circuit', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'psychobiologic', 'psychologic', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sex', 'underage drinking', 'young adult']",NIAAA,SRI INTERNATIONAL,U24,2018,1117116,0.18779343613067226
"Alcohol consumption monitoring via a power-free wearable biosensor ABSTRACT: LogicInk will design and develop a discrete, low-cost, wearable alcohol-sensor that works via detection of ethanol in sweat and requires no power supply. The wearable device will let users better understand the impact of their drinking habits on their body, as reflected by alcohol concentration levels over time. These discrete, electronics-free wearables that resemble temporary tattoos will change color based on alcohol content in sweat. The color changes will be directly readable by the wearer requiring no additional equipment. In parallel, we will develop computer vision algorithms that will detect, record, and interpret the wearable’s colors in much greater detail for the user. These algorithms will serve as the basis for the development of a personalized mobile application that can track a users’ alcohol consumption over time.  Approximately 6.8% of adults and 20% of college students in the US have alcohol use disorder (AUD) and the economic burden of alcohol misuse is $249.0 billion. An alcohol-impaired driver is a factor in over a third of all traffic-related deaths. A significant problem with alcohol consumption is that drinkers’ recall of the amount consumed is poor, as is judgment regarding the degree of impairment. The LogicInk biosensor utilizes a novel concentration metric that grants users a better understanding of the impact of their drinking habits on their body, as reflected by approximated transdermal alcohol levels. Additionally, the optional coupling to a mobile phone application allows users to track and analyze values over time. A simple, accurate, and inexpensive method to approximate cumulative alcohol consumption is a promising strategy to raise alcohol consumption awareness across a wide user demographic.  The concentration of ethanol in sweat is highly correlated with blood alcohol concentrations (BACs) and has been used in many transdermal BAC devices. We will test the hypothesis that the biosensor can approximate blood alcohol levels and the amount of alcohol consumed since applying the sensor. We will have two aims in this proposal: Aim 1, Design and characterization of a cumulative alcohol biosensor, and Aim 2, Development and training of computer vision algorithms that will be used to track cumulative alcohol levels. PROJECT NARRATIVE: LogicInk is developing a discrete, low-cost, wearable alcohol-sensor that works via detection of ethanol in sweat and requires no power supply. Our wearable device will let users better understand the impact of their drinking habits on their body, as reflected by easily interpreted color changes correlated to blood alcohol concentration levels over time. Ultimately, we expect this device will result in users drinking more moderately, reducing the many adverse effects from excessive alcohol consumption.",Alcohol consumption monitoring via a power-free wearable biosensor,9608596,R43AA026242,"['Adult', 'Adverse effects', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohols', 'Algorithms', 'Awareness', 'Biosensor', 'Blood alcohol level measurement', 'Car Phone', 'Cause of Death', 'Cellular Phone', 'Cessation of life', 'Color', 'Colorimetry', 'Companions', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Coupled', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Economic Burden', 'Electronics', 'Equipment', 'Ethanol', 'Eye', 'Formulation', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Habits', 'Health', 'Heavy Drinking', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Judgment', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Light', 'Measures', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Optics', 'Output', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Power Sources', 'Reaction', 'Readability', 'Reproducibility', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Skin', 'Sweat', 'System', 'Tattooing', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States', 'Woman', 'Work', 'alcohol content', 'alcohol exposure', 'alcohol measurement', 'alcohol misuse', 'alcohol use disorder', 'base', 'cost', 'demographics', 'design', 'drinking', 'improved', 'man', 'men', 'mobile application', 'novel', 'prevent', 'sensor', 'skin color', 'theories', 'trend', 'university student', 'wearable device', 'young adult']",NIAAA,LOGICINK CORPORATION,R43,2018,223945,0.18733276028416432
"A Multisite Neurobehavioral Assessment of Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders Project Summary This request for a renewal of funding is in response to the NIH/NIAAA funding opportunity entitled, “Collaborative Initiative on Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (CIFASD)” (RFA-AA-17-007). The overarching aim of the current proposal is to develop, validate, and implement clinically novel and innovative measurement tools to accurately identify children who are affected by prenatal alcohol exposure. The proposed study is relevant to the overall objective of the CIFASD funding opportunity “to accelerate specific areas of research related to the translation of new or improved capabilities in FASD clinical case recognition.” This is critical need. While there has been a concerted research effort since the initial clinical delineation of fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS), understanding the full spectrum of effects of prenatal alcohol exposure remains incomplete, hindering effective intervention. Although individuals with prenatal alcohol exposure may experience significantly impairing functional difficulties, identification of these individuals is inadequate. High rates of missed diagnoses and misdiagnosis result in lost opportunities for intervention and misunderstanding of the etiology of observed difficulties. Development of accurate and specific identification tools will improve diagnostic capability and clinical decision-making regarding treatment. To this end, during previous funding periods we substantially enhanced the understanding of the specificity of effects of prenatal alcohol exposure to increase identification of alcohol-affected youth. Our hierarchical CIFASD Decision Tree, developed and validated on over 800 subjects, indicates that administration of just 4 measures can distinguish alcohol-affected youth from nonexposed controls with and without behavioral concerns or conditions with accuracy rates of >80%. While a significant step forward, the Decision Tree was developed and validated in a research sample with a high risk of alcohol effects. One aim of the current proposal is to develop and test an electronic version of the Decision Tree (the eTree) in lower risk, international, population-based, and clinic-based samples. Another aim of the proposal, in line with the specific RFA goal to use innovative technologies to screen for dysmorphology and/or neurobehavioral deficits to aid in the identification of alcohol-exposed individuals, is the development and implementation of the FASD Online Neurobehavioral Screen (FONS), a web-based neurobehavioral assessment tool for use with subjects recruited via a web portal (cf. Foroud U01). The FONS will measure domains known to be affected in FASD, including those represented in diagnostic criteria for neurobehavioral disorder associated with prenatal alcohol exposure (ND-PAE). The eTree and the FONS will be validated using laboratory-based in-person neuropsychological assessment of children with histories of prenatal alcohol exposure and non-exposed controls with and without behavioral concerns or conditions. The results of the proposed research will fulfill our research goals, improve recruitment, and most importantly accurately identify individuals affected by prenatal alcohol exposure, leading to improved clinical diagnosis and intervention. Project Narrative This project is directly relevant to public health concerns related to the effects of heavy prenatal alcohol exposure and improved identification of alcohol-affected individuals with novel electronic data collection techniques. Improved identification methods and delineation of features related to alcohol-exposure will ultimately lead to improved treatment and help alleviate the public health burden associated with prenatal alcohol exposure.",A Multisite Neurobehavioral Assessment of Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders,9524819,U01AA014834,"['Affect', 'Age', 'Alcohols', 'Area', 'Assessment tool', 'Behavioral', 'California', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Decision Trees', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dysmorphology', 'Ensure', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Face', 'Fetal Alcohol Exposure', 'Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder', 'Fetal Alcohol Syndrome', 'Fetal alcohol effects', 'Funding', 'Funding Opportunities', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Individual', 'International', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Minnesota', 'National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism', 'Neuropsychology', 'Online Systems', 'Outpatients', 'Persons', 'Prevalence', 'Psychiatry', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Screening procedure', 'Self-Administered', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'Standardization', 'Students', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translations', 'Ukraine', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Work', 'Youth', 'alcohol effect', 'alcohol exposure', 'base', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinical decision-making', 'cohort', 'effective intervention', 'electronic data', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'first grade', 'functional disability', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'innovative technologies', 'mobile application', 'neurobehavioral', 'neurobehavioral disorder', 'novel', 'population based', 'recruit', 'response', 'tool', 'web portal']",NIAAA,SAN DIEGO STATE UNIVERSITY,U01,2018,361787,0.21320680852487478
"Big data analytics for the evaluation of whole genome sequence and transcriptome data in alcohol research PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Large-scale U.S. epidemiological studies demonstrate that alcohol use disorders are highly prevalent, highly co-morbid with other psychiatric disorders, disabling, and often go untreated. Compared with other U.S. ethnic groups, Native Americans have the highest rates of alcohol and other drug dependence, and it is associated with particularly significant disability and mortality. Thus studies that identify specific genetic risk factors for alcohol use disorders in the general U.S. population, and especially in Native Americans, are of high public health importance. Alcohol use disorders are complex genetic diseases sensitive to environmental conditions that require complex data strategies to uncover the underlying risk factors. Although recent years have seen significant advancement in our understanding in the biology and genetics of the disorders, exactly how these factors interact in an individual to confer risk or protection from alcohol use disorders is still unclear. Further, the genetic factors identified in the human genome thus far by conventional methods appear to only explain a very small fraction of the overall heritability for the disorders.  The overall objective of this research program is to identify the complex genetic and genomic factors that affect susceptibility to alcohol use disorders and related comorbidities through novel and innovative quantitative methods and big data analytics. The proposed study will utilize whole-genome sequence (WGS) data from a unique high-risk Native American population and a European American population along with gene expression data of alcoholic human brains. The project will develop methodology to analyze WGS data with unique relevance to alcohol research. Selected multivariate, graphical, and dimension-reduction modeling tools will be used in combination with mixed models suitable for genomic data with both population and family structures to dissect polygenic basis for alcohol use disorders and shared genetic risk factors for alcohol use disorders and comorbid disorders. Mixture models and clustering methods will be employed to uncover heterogeneous genetic influences. Differential genetic effects at various levels of heterogeneity will be tested with rigorous statistical methods. The project will identify population and ancestry-specific genetic risk factors and shared risk factors across populations and determine their differential influences on susceptibility to alcohol use disorders. Endophenotypes will also be investigated to help identify unique risk factors for alcohol use disorder traits. The project will further identify alcohol- and addiction-relevant pathways and networks that are differentially expressed in alcoholic brains, and establish directions of causations by combining gene expression data with WGS data, and applying instrumental variable approaches. Finally, an integrated system approach will be taken by further leveraging epigenomic maps and annotation databases in the public domain to build predictive and potentially causal models aimed at more “personalized” prevention and intervention for alcohol use disorders in specific high-risk groups and individuals. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Alcohol use disorders are prevalent, frequently co-occur with other psychiatric disorders, are disabling and often go untreated. Identifying specific genetic risk factors for alcohol use disorders in the general U.S. population, and especially in high risk ethnic groups such as Native Americans, will lead to more personalized thus more effective prevention and intervention for alcoholism in these populations.",Big data analytics for the evaluation of whole genome sequence and transcriptome data in alcohol research,9534472,K25AA025095,"['Affect', 'Alcohol dependence', 'Alcoholism', 'Alcohols', 'American', 'Autopsy', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Big Data', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Communities', 'Comorbidity', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Drug Addiction', 'Ethnic group', 'Etiology', 'European', 'Evaluation', 'Family Study', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Heritability', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Individual', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mental disorders', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Native Americans', 'New South Wales', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Domains', 'Public Health', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Randomized', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'San Francisco', 'Siblings', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'System', 'Testing', 'Variant', 'addiction', 'alcohol and other drug', 'alcohol intervention', 'alcohol research', 'alcohol use disorder', 'base', 'causal model', 'cohort', 'differential expression', 'disability', 'endophenotype', 'epidemiology study', 'epigenomics', 'family structure', 'genetic risk factor', 'genome wide association study', 'genomic data', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'individualized prevention', 'innovation', 'mortality', 'non-alcoholic', 'novel', 'pleiotropism', 'predictive modeling', 'problem drinker', 'programs', 'risk sharing', 'statistics', 'tissue resource', 'tool', 'trait', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptomics', 'whole genome']",NIAAA,SCRIPPS RESEARCH INSTITUTE,K25,2018,161460,0.14100521124354576
"A Saliva Based Kit for the Epigenetic Assessment of Heavy Alcohol Intake Heavy alcohol use is common, yet avoidable cause of death, disability and human suffering. These adverse outcomes are potentially avoidable if heavy alcohol use is spotted early. However, current screening methods for chronic alcohol consumption capture alcohol usage only in the hours prior to testing or rely on insensitive, non-specific protein assays. In a recent highly successful Phase II project, using DNA from whole blood, we demonstrated that a combination of just two methylation sensitive droplet digital PCR (MSddPCR) assays could quite accurately identify subjects with recent heavy alcohol consumption. Since then, we have continued to advance those findings and have developed additional, even more powerful MSddPCR assays and refined our processes to only require the DNA found in a single drop of blood. In conjunction with our ethics and marketing team, we are now in the process of rolling this product nationwide.  However, a significant barrier to a more universal implementation of this disruptive technology is the requirement for blood. Conceivably, a test that could use the DNA from saliva could circumvent patient concerns about the discomfort of a needle or lancet stick. In addition, it would enable both non-medically oriented alcohol treatment programs and telemedicine oriented treatment programs to more easily assess client response to treatment. This will be particularly critical for treatment of alcoholism in the elderly, who are often unable or unwilling to travel to alcohol treatment facilities.  In this Phase I proposal, we intend to take the next steps to the creation of a saliva DNA screening test for heavy alcohol consumption. Already, we have collected and prepared saliva DNA on 150 subjects recently admitted to alcohol treatment and 150 age, gender and ethnicity matched controls. In addition, we have also developed an MSddPCR assay that can adjust for cellular heterogeneity in the saliva DNA.  In this application, we will use these resources to whether MSddPCR assessments of saliva DNA can also be used to detect heavy alcohol consumption. Specifically, in Aim 1, we will determine methylation status at 4 CpG loci with high predictive power for detecting alcohol consumption and one locus whose information content can be used to correct for cellular admixture in saliva. Then, in Aim 2, we will conduct a series of quality assessment of the saliva DNA. Finally, in Aim 3, we will analyze the data from our 4 highly predictive loci, correcting when necessary for cellular admixture, to determine an algorithm capable of predicting heavy alcohol use status. In addition, we will analyze the quality control measures to identify those saliva DNA samples which give unreliable. As a result of this project, we will produce a set of MSddPCR assays and a quality control metric for a rigorous multisite Phase II test of this “bloodless” NextGen product. Narrative Current diagnostic approaches for the assessment of heavy alcohol use normally use blood. However, many patients do not like to have their blood drawn or are cared for in a healthcare setting in which blood cannot be obtained. In this project, we will adapt our recently discovered DNA methylation based techniques to see if they can use saliva DNA instead of whole blood DNA.",A Saliva Based Kit for the Epigenetic Assessment of Heavy Alcohol Intake,9680049,R43AA027423,"['Abstinence', 'Admixture', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcoholism', 'Alcohols', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Area Under Curve', 'Automobile Driving', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Assay', 'Blood', 'Blood specimen', 'CLIA certified', 'Caring', 'Cause of Death', 'Chronic', 'Client', 'Consumption', 'DNA', 'DNA Methylation', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Drops', 'Economics', 'Elderly', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Ethics', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Forensic Medicine', 'Gender', 'Gene Dosage', 'Goals', 'Government', 'Hand', 'Health Personnel', 'Heavy Drinking', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Intellectual Property', 'International', 'International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision (ICD-10)', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Marketing', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'Needles', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Quality Control', 'RNase P', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Resources', 'Saliva', 'Sampling', 'Security', 'Series', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Telemedicine', 'Testing', 'Transportation', 'Travel', 'Whole Blood', 'adverse outcome', 'alcohol abuse therapy', 'alcohol monitoring', 'alcohol use disorder', 'alcoholism therapy', 'base', 'chronic alcohol ingestion', 'digital', 'disability', 'health care settings', 'human DNA', 'improved', 'interest', 'next generation', 'phase 2 testing', 'product development', 'screening', 'social', 'technology validation', 'treatment program', 'treatment response']",NIAAA,"BEHAVIORAL DIAGNOSTICS, INC.",R43,2018,223260,0.1526232789964095
"Administrative Core of the CIFASD Project Summary/Abstract The Collaborative Initiative on Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (CIFASD) is a multidisciplinary, international consortium of research projects and resource cores charged with improving prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of FASD. The Administrative Resource Core of the CIFASD (AdminC) has led this consortium since it was first established in 2003 and plays a critical leadership role in the coordination of research efforts and ensuring progress toward consortium goals. CIFASD addresses issues related to prenatal alcohol exposure across the lifespan, using a range of interrelated clinical and preclinical research approaches. This iteration of the consortium consists of multiple collaborative components including four resource U24 cores (AdminC, Dysmorphology, Informatics, and Outreach/Dissemination), nine U01 research projects (clinical, basic science, and/or translational) and two exploratory/developmental UH2 projects. One goal of the CIFASD is to improve identification of individuals who have been affected by prenatal alcohol exposure. This will be accomplished by assessing biomarkers, such as immune and miRNA profiles, and by using neuroimaging techniques that may be more sensitive to subtle pathology seen in individuals who do not meet the diagnostic criteria for FAS. In addition, CIFASD will develop novel tools, such as 3D facial and neurobehavioral screening, which can be assessed remotely and made more universally accessible through eHealth. The use of telemedicine will also provide access to more detailed dysmorphology evaluations. Another goal is to identify risk and resiliency factors, including genetic influences that will help with understanding the mechanisms of alcohol's damaging effects and also lead to more targeted interventions. A third goal is to better understand the effects of prenatal alcohol exposure on consequences across the lifespan, including adulthood. Finally, an intervention for improving outcomes will be modified to a mobile platform, so that it can reach larger populations of individuals with FASD and their families. Collectively, these projects have the potential for moving the FASD field forward, improving the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of FASD and serving a wide audience with the technologies available in eHealth. The Specific Aims of the AdminC are to: 1) Provide scientific and administrative direction, leadership and oversight to CIFASD; 2) Facilitate communication among the various projects and the dissemination of results; 3) Assist with data management strategies; 4) Provide annual evaluations of progress; and 5) Provide assistance to projects with implementing eHealth technology. The AdminC provides the foundation for the interactive and supportive framework of CIFASD by establishing regular communications with all members through monthly conference calls and biannual meetings; leading the Steering Committee in the establishment and implementation of CIFASD priorities and policies; supporting the Science Advisory Board with its evaluations of progress on each component as well as the overall mission of CIFASD; as well as serving as the liaison between the consortium's project scientists and its NIAAA advisors. Project Narrative The consequences resulting from prenatal alcohol exposure are wide-ranging and a major and costly public health problem. The goal of the CIFASD consortium is to enhance the identification and treatment of FASD utilizing a multidisciplinary approach consisting of both basic science and clinical research. The collaborations among research projects will allow CIFASD to improve the diagnosis and treatment of FASD, moving the field forward in ways that could not be easily achieved by individual projects.",Administrative Core of the CIFASD,9524807,U24AA014811,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Alcohols', 'Animal Experimentation', 'Animal Model', 'Archives', 'Basic Science', 'Behavior', 'Behavior assessment', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain imaging', 'Cellular Phone', 'Charge', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Decision Trees', 'Developing Countries', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dysmorphology', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Face', 'Family', 'Fetal Alcohol Exposure', 'Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder', 'Fetal alcohol effects', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Screening', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Human', 'Image', 'Immune', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Information Dissemination', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'MicroRNAs', 'Mission', 'Modality', 'National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Pattern', 'Physical assessment', 'Play', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Progress Reports', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Publications', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resource Allocation', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Schedule', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Screening procedure', 'Tablets', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Telemedicine', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Uncertainty', 'Woman', 'Work', 'base', 'behavioral health', 'behavioral study', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive testing', 'cohort', 'cost', 'cytokine', 'data management', 'diagnostic screening', 'drinking', 'eHealth', 'epidemiology study', 'fetal', 'forging', 'health care service', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'meetings', 'member', 'mobile computing', 'multidisciplinary', 'neurobehavioral', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'outreach', 'pre-clinical research', 'program dissemination', 'recruit', 'repository', 'resilience', 'screening', 'symposium', 'tool', 'web site']",NIAAA,SAN DIEGO STATE UNIVERSITY,U24,2018,428830,0.15664405541295742
"Sex Differences in Alcohol-Related Neurotoxicity During Adolescence ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Adolescence is a time of dramatic development, much of which varies as a function of sex. Also during this time, alcohol use becomes very common. Likely due to heightened plasticity, the adolescent brain is particularly susceptible to the neurotoxic effects of alcohol. While studies have separately documented cross- sectional sex differences in the effects of alcohol on the adolescent brain and hormonal influences on normative adolescent brain development, to fully understand sex-specific adolescent risk and resilience for alcoholism, multimodal prospective longitudinal studies are crucial. To that end, during this funding period, we will assess an additional 120 healthy non-alcohol/drug using 14-16-year-old youth using functional neuroimaging during working memory and decision making, resting state functional neuroimaging, diffusion tensor imaging, neurocognitive assessment, mood/behavior/personality assessment, and serum hormone assays. Together with over 200 youth assessed during the first funding period of the project, all youth will be quarterly monitore for changes in alcohol/drug use, and youth who emerge into heavy alcohol use (as well as a matched non-using control) will be re-assessed at two time points following initiation of heavy drinking behavior. Using a multi-modal longitudinal design, we aim to better understand sex-specific effects of heavy alcohol use on adolescent brain functioning and connectivity, as well as identify premorbid sex-specific neurobiological risk phenotypes that are predictive of problem drinking during adolescence and young adulthood. Further, we will explore moderating variables, such timing and frequency of alcohol and other drug use, as well as the role of gonadal steroids on sex-specific developmental trajectories. Disentangling sex- specific risk for and consequences of alcohol use during adolescence, in relation to normative brain development, and determining which effects may be hormonally influenced, will move the field closer to more personalized prevention and intervention strategies aimed at male and female youth. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The present study seeks to longitudinally examine sex-specific alcohol effects on the adolescent brain and identify sex-specific neurobiological risk markers that are predictive of high levels of drinking during adolescence and young adulthood.

"Consequences of Adolescent Alcohol Use on Brain Development DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This revised R01 A1 proposal (AA022493), ""Consequences of Adolescent Alcohol Use on Brain Development"", responds to the need to understand the impact of initiating alcohol consumption on adolescent brain maturation. We have teamed with the Center for Adolescent Substance Abuse Research (CeASAR) and Boston Children's Hospital to implement an innovative strategy that combines multiple neuroimaging and neuropsychological approaches to identify neurodevelopmental vulnerabilities associated with early and escalating alcohol use during adolescence. Adolescents will be recruited from general pediatrician offices and adolescent medicine clinics comprising the New England Partnership for Substance Abuse Research (NEPSAR), a practice-based research network of primary care offices. Adolescents will be enrolled into the study prior to the initiation of alcoho use or other drug use, and examined longitudinally, at baseline (13-14 yrs old) and again at two annual follow-up visits. To provide a comprehensive longitudinal profile of brain function, structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), and task and resting state blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) will be paired with magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) to measure GABA and glutamate levels in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and medial temporal lobe (MTL, containing hippocampus). In addition, arterial spin labeling (ASL) will be used to measure quantitative perfusion, which will be used to calibrate the magnitude of BOLD fMRI signal changes during response inhibition and spatial memory fMRI tasks. Magnetic resonance measures will be integrated with measures from clinical assessments and an extensive neuropsychological battery, designed to detect and further characterize developmental changes and the influence of adolescent alcohol use. The incorporation of complementary multi-modal measures of brain function and neuroplasticity could offer valuable insight into the dynamic processes of brain maturation and help identify neural signatures associated with the onset and escalation of alcohol use, which will provide a foundation for informing prevention and intervention efforts aimed at reducing adolescent alcohol consumption. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This longitudinal, multi-modal study of adolescents during the critical period of brain maturation, and during a time that overlaps with the onset of alcohol initiation, will help elucidate milestones of healthy adolescent brain development and identify neural signatures associated with the onset and escalation of alcohol use.",Consequences of Adolescent Alcohol Use on Brain Development,9482394,R01AA022493,"['Adolescent', 'Adolescent Medicine', 'Age', 'Age of Onset', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Alcohols', 'Anisotropy', 'Anterior', 'Behavior assessment', 'Boston', 'Brain', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical assessments', 'Cognitive', 'Core-Binding Factor', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Drug usage', 'Enrollment', 'Failure', 'Female', 'Foundations', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Glutamates', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Hyperactive behavior', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Mediating', 'Memory', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Neuronal Plasticity', 'Neuropsychology', 'New England', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Performance', 'Perfusion', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Primary Health Care', 'Process', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Spin Labels', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Task Performances', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Thinness', 'Time', 'Visit', 'adolescent alcohol and drug use', 'adolescent brain development', 'adolescent substance abuse', 'age related', 'alcohol use initiation', 'base', 'blood oxygen level dependent', 'cingulate cortex', 'critical period', 'design', 'early alcohol use', 'follow-up', 'gamma-Aminobutyric Acid', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'male', 'myelination', 'neuroimaging', 'pediatrician', 'practice-based research network', 'public health relevance', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sex', 'spatial memory', 'underage drinking', 'way finding', 'white matter']",NIAAA,MCLEAN HOSPITAL,R01,2018,428189,0.1309373825214733
"Tracking and Prediction of Early Brain-Face Biomarkers of Prenatal Alcohol Exposure from Neonates to Children Maternal substance use disorders are a substantial public health concern and the neurological consequences of prenatal exposure are a major threat to the long-term health of offspring. Globally, prevalence of Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS) and Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD) is between 2-7 and 20-50 per 1000, respectively. By contrast, in certain high-risk communities in South Africa, prevalence is reported to be as high as 63 and 155 per 1000, respectively. Though prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) is known to affect the central nervous system, to date, little data exists in respect of the impact of PAE in early childhood, before both higher-level brain networks are established and other potentially confounding post- natal environmental influences have come into play. For neurodevelopmental disorders, studies have consistently shown that early intervention, based on detection and targeted interventions, leads to better long-term outcomes. We aim to address this precise gap in knowledge by imaging the brain and 3D face across the FASD continuum to investigate early biomarkers, trajectories and functional correlates of PAE in a cohort followed prospectively from birth to age 6 years. Data: Our cohort includes a well characterized subsample of children (PAE and healthy controls) enrolled in the Drakenstein Child Health Study in Cape Town, South Africa, who have been scanned as neonates and at 2-3 years of age. Preliminary published data shows highly significant relationships between PAE and regional gray and white matter changes, already discernible in newborns, well before the age FASD is typically diagnosed. An additional longitudinal assessment at 6-years will yield a unique FASD sample with 3 distinct time points (infants, toddlers and children), allowing characterization of brain and face morphology and brain structure and function in this previously understudied early developmental period. This proposal addresses fundamental gaps concerning the presence, timing and regional specificity of altered brain morphology and structural and functional connectivity in association with the effects of PAE on the developing brain from birth to 6 years, and the relationships with facial dysmorphology. The research team has successfully gathered data from the proposed cohort as neonates and at 2–3 years of age. The benefits of extending this research to a subsequent imaging time-point, with a larger range of developmental and neurobehavioral assessments, provides an unprecedented opportunity to determine longitudinal effects of PAE on the trajectory of the developing brain in these critical early years, the links between neural and face predictors of PAE and the long-term clinical significance of these findings. This research will illuminate early neurodevelopmental mechanisms leading to subsequent behavioral and neurological disturbances, which may allow opportunities for targeting interventions when brain plasticity is still relatively fluid. This project might also lead to new strategies for early diagnosis using both face and brain biomarkers. Project Narrative Fetal exposure of the brain to alcohol can trigger brain abnormalities that unfold over a lifetime with severe consequences both for the affected individual and for society at large. To date, these brain abnormalities and associated deficits and behaviors have mostly been studied in late childhood or later, with very few studies following the consequences of well documented fetal alcohol exposure as they develop in the same individual across time in early childhood when the brain is most responsive to potential treatments. This project will extend an ongoing study of children with fetal alcohol exposure, already characterized as newborns and at age 2-3 to add assessments of the brain and behavior at age 6 and will explore alcohol-induced facial abnormalities as a complementary predictor of brain problems. !",Tracking and Prediction of Early Brain-Face Biomarkers of Prenatal Alcohol Exposure from Neonates to Children,9576322,R01AA026834,"['2 year old', '3 year old', '6 year old', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alcohols', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Cellular Phone', 'Child', 'Child Health', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Dysmorphology', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Emotional', 'Enrollment', 'Face', 'Fetal Alcohol Exposure', 'Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder', 'Fetal Alcohol Syndrome', 'Fetal alcohol effects', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Gestational Age', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Link', 'Liquid substance', 'Longevity', 'Longitudinal cohort', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Neonatal', 'Neuraxis', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neurologic', 'Newborn Infant', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Population', 'Pregnancy', 'Prevalence', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Severities', 'Shapes', 'Societies', 'South Africa', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Thalamic structure', 'Time', 'Toddler', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'alcohol exposure', 'antenatal', 'base', 'brain abnormalities', 'brain behavior', 'brain morphology', 'clinically significant', 'cohort', 'connectome', 'cost', 'deep neural network', 'design', 'early childhood', 'early detection biomarkers', 'efficacy testing', 'fetal diagnosis', 'gray matter', 'high dimensionality', 'high risk', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'maternal alcohol use', 'maternal cigarette smoking', 'maternal depression', 'multimodality', 'neonatal brain', 'neonate', 'neurobehavioral', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'offspring', 'prenatal exposure', 'prospective', 'relating to nervous system', 'shape analysis', 'statistics', 'white matter', 'white matter change']",NIAAA,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2018,237359,0.11813813535674438
"Neural Correlates of Emotion Regulation in Youth at Risk for Alcoholism Project Summary/Abstract According to the latest estimates, over 1 in 7 Americans will develop an Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD) over the course of their lifetime, and alcohol consumption is involved in nearly 4% of deaths worldwide. Thus, AUDs represent a significant public health concern. Currently, the best pharmacotherapies for AUDs require the treatment of 10 patients to observe 1 patient reduce drinking to healthy levels. For this reason, one appealing option is to identify at-risk individuals before they become heavy drinkers; for instance a family history of alcoholism is currently among the best predictors of AUD. Adolescence presents an ideal period to study these factors as it precedes the onset of AUDs but is also a time when there is a rapid increase in consumption. We have recently shown that neuroimaging measures can be used to predict clinically meaningful outcomes (e.g. relapse), suggesting it would also be possible to develop neuroimaging as a predictor of onset of heavy drinking in adolescents. Developing predictive tools to identify adolescents likely to progress to heavy drinking would offer the opportunity for early intervention and could potentially reduce the progression to AUD. Substantial evidence suggests that primary motives for problematic drinking are to enhance positive valence and reduce negative valence emotions. Further, substance use disorders are associated with altered activity in the insula, ventral striatum, amygdala, and anterior cingulate cortex when processing potential rewards and aversive outcomes. We hypothesize that individuals at risk for AUDs will show heightened response to aversive stimuli in the anterior insula and amygdala and heightened response to rewarding stimuli in the ventral striatum and anterior cingulate cortex. We further hypothesize that they will exhibit diminished functional connectivity between reward, salience, and executive control networks. To test this, we will recruit 70 adolescents aged 18–20. Half will be have a biological parent with an AUD. The other half will be a control group matched on current drinking levels, age, gender, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status. All participants will undergo a functional MRI scan with a resting state run and a run during a modified version of the monetary incentive delay task that includes the risk of hearing an aversive sound (i.e. a loud scream). All participants will be followed for 6 months after the scan to determine levels of drinking. This study will provide both mechanistic information on risk for AUD as well as a tool to identify adolescents at greatest risk prior to the onset of problem drinking. This information could help provide personalized information about risk that may maximize likelihood of AUD prevention. In addition to the research goals described above, this is a training proposal that is designed to facilitate the transition of the primary investigator, Dr. Joshua Gowin, from mentored post-doctoral research fellow to independent, tenure-track research faculty at an academic institution. The mentored phase of the proposal will use a multifaceted training plan to improve Dr. Gowin’s knowledge base as well as his research and professional skillsets. Specifically, Dr. Gowin will learn new techniques in resting state functional connectivity analysis and in the cognitive neuroscience of emotion regulation. In addition to this scientific training, Dr. Gowin will gain experience management, teaching, and data presentation. To achieve these goals, Dr. Gowin has assembled a team of advisors from the intra- and extramural community with expertise in these areas to guide his training and development. This committee will include Dr. Vijay Ramchandani-NIAAA, Dr. Monique Ernst-NIMH, Dr. Elliot Stein-NIDA, and Dr. Susan Tapert-UCSD (see letters of support). The skills that will be developed during the mentored phase will position Dr. Gowin for success as he applies for an independent position and establishes his own research program. Project Narrative  Alcohol use disorders will affect over one in 10 Americans over the course of their lifetime. The early identification of individuals at greatest risk may provide opportunities to educate or provide services that mitigate individual risk. Therefore, identifying risk factors for alcohol use disorders is an important goal for researchers. One emerging target for research involves using functional MRI to study brain systems that contribute to risk. This project will explore the neural correlates of positive and negative valence emotional processing and how they contribute to risk for the development of alcohol use disorders. Better understanding of these neural processes could inform us about how alcohol use disorders emerge and, importantly, how we might prevent them.",Neural Correlates of Emotion Regulation in Youth at Risk for Alcoholism,9752706,R00AA024778,"['Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alcohol abuse', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcoholic beverage heavy drinker', 'Alcoholism', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anterior', 'Area', 'Aversive Stimulus', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Consumption', 'Control Groups', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Development', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Extramural Activities', 'Family', 'Family history of', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Hearing', 'Heavy Drinking', 'Individual', 'Institution', 'Insula of Reil', 'Learning', 'Letters', 'Loudness', 'Machine Learning', 'Matched Group', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism', 'Negative Valence', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Personality', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phase', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Positive Valence', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Predictive Value', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Questionnaires', 'Recording of previous events', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Review Literature', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Services', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Stimulus', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'System', 'Targeted Research', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Ventral Striatum', 'Youth', 'aged', 'alcohol risk', 'alcohol use disorder', 'base', 'career', 'cingulate cortex', 'clinical predictors', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'design', 'disorder prevention', 'disorder risk', 'drinking', 'drinking behavior', 'emotion regulation', 'executive function', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'faculty research', 'financial incentive', 'follow-up', 'functional MRI scan', 'high risk', 'improved', 'knowledge base', 'negative affect', 'neural correlate', 'neuroimaging', 'positive emotional state', 'predicting response', 'predictive tools', 'prevent', 'programs', 'recruit', 'relapse prediction', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'skills', 'sound', 'success', 'tenure track', 'tool', 'underage drinking']",NIAAA,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,R00,2018,249000,0.06135314680650983
"3/3 Alcohol Research Consortium in HIV – Intervention Research Arm (ARCH-IRA) Alcohol Use Disorders (AUDs) and hazardous drinking are the fourth leading cause of preventable death in the US and are responsible for 10% of all deaths among working age adults. Among Persons Living with HIV/AIDS (PLWH), heavy alcohol use is up to twice the rate in the general population. Few people engage in behavioral alcohol treatment and alcohol pharmacotherapies are not routinely used as part of alcohol treatment, despite the known efficacy of these interventions. PLWH engaged in treatment for their HIV disease have regular contact with a medical provider and are treated in a medical home model in which all medical services are delivered within HIV clinics, but few HIV providers feel comfortable treating AUDs. During our initial funding period, we implemented routine alcohol screening, developed a computerized brief intervention (CBI), and conducted provider training on alcohol pharmacotherapies. However, while we found a strong impact from routine screening with CBI for reducing alcohol use, few providers prescribed alcohol pharmacotherapy, despite this specialized training, with most indicating continued discomfort and lack of knowledge for use of pharmacotherapy. Algorithms are used routinely to guide providers in treatment selection for many different disorders that are not within their specialty such as diabetes management, obesity, arthritis, and other disorders. In addition, we tested the use of provider algorithms for the treatment of depression and smoking with PLWH and demonstrated increased utilization of these medications. For this renewal, we are proposing an implementation science test of using an algorithm that will build upon our success with CBI and integrate alcohol pharmacotherapies and other behavioral therapies within routine treatment. A decision-tree algorithm that provides more intensive treatments, including alcohol pharmacotherapies, that is also responsive to comorbidities such as depressive or anxiety symptoms will be tested in three HIV clinics across CFAR Network of Integrated Clinical Systems (CNICS). Primary outcomes include reduced alcohol consumption and frequency, improved HIV outcomes, and improvement in comorbid conditions. We will also examine provider, staff, patient, and clinic-level facilitators and barriers to implementation of this algorithm in routine clinical care. Successful implementation of this treatment approach would have considerable impact on reducing AUDs among PLWH and could be integrated within existing electronic health record systems for a sustainable model of alcohol treatment delivery to other HIV clinics. Hazardous alcohol use is the fourth leading cause of preventable death in the United States and is up to twice as high among PLWH. Algorithms have been developed to increase the efficacy of the treatment of chronic diseases with tremendous success but have never been empirically tested to aid in alcohol use disorders (AUDs). We propose to test an algorithm developed to aid providers in selecting behavioral and pharmacotherapy for the treatment of AUDs for PLWH engaged in care.",3/3 Alcohol Research Consortium in HIV – Intervention Research Arm (ARCH-IRA),9564774,U01AA020802,"['AIDS/HIV problem', 'Achievement', 'Adherence', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Alcohol abuse', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohols', 'Algorithms', 'Anxiety', 'Appointment', 'Area', 'Arthritis', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinic', 'Clinic Visits', 'Clinical', 'Comorbidity', 'Computers', 'Counseling', 'Decision Aid', 'Decision Trees', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Drug Use Disorder', 'Drug usage', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Eligibility Determination', 'Enrollment', 'Evidence based treatment', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'General Population', 'Geography', 'HIV', 'Heavy Drinking', 'Hepatitis C virus', 'Home environment', 'Hypertension', 'Incentives', 'Individual', 'Intervention Studies', 'Knowledge', 'Maintenance', 'Medical', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Outcomes Assessments', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Population', 'Provider', 'Recurrence', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Resources', 'Risk Factors', 'Selection for Treatments', 'Services', 'Severities', 'Site', 'Smoking', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Visit', 'alcohol abuse therapy', 'alcohol misuse', 'alcohol research', 'alcohol screening', 'alcohol services', 'alcohol use disorder', 'anxiety symptoms', 'arm', 'base', 'binge drinking', 'brief alcohol intervention', 'brief intervention', 'care providers', 'clinical care', 'computerized', 'consumption measures', 'depressive symptoms', 'diabetes management', 'drinking', 'evidence base', 'hazardous drinking', 'implementation research', 'implementation science', 'improved', 'medical specialties', 'modifiable risk', 'mortality', 'motivational enhancement therapy', 'novel', 'preventable death', 'primary outcome', 'reduced alcohol use', 'routine screening', 'smoking cessation', 'success', 'transmission process', 'treatment effect', 'treatment response', 'treatment strategy']",NIAAA,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,U01,2018,369768,0.15589576624188314
"Multi-modal connectivity methods for the validation of Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder diagnostic criteria Project Summary: FASD is a serious public health crisis with 80,000 to 120,000 U.S. pregnancies per year at high risk. FASD diagnostic clinics are very sparse, difficult to sustain because of diagnostic complexity, unable to meet demand, and plagued by disagreement about diagnostic criteria. A recent comparison of five FASD diagnostic systems acknowledged that the lack of objective biomarkers for prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) contributes to disagreement in the field. The goal of the proposed work is to develop and refine neuroimaging methods capable of identifying subtle neurodevelopmental abnormalities in PAE. A critical component of this project will be to apply these refined neuroimaging “biomarkers” to examine the validity and performance of the most commonly-used FASD diagnostic criteria (alcohol exposure, dysmorphology, growth, and cognition). The proposed project will push the development of imaging methods and will also include an examination of the sensitivity and specificity of current diagnostic factors. The aims are: 1) perform a comprehensive characterization of the FASD “connectome” using state-of- the-art Human Connectome Project (HCP) methods in children with PAE, 2) evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of FASD diagnostic criteria to provide objective evaluation of FASD criteria (which remain in flux), 3) characterize relationships between connectomics and cognitive functioning, & 4) examine the developmental course of functional connectivity, white matter connectivity, cortical gyrification, and intra-cortical myelin. Participants will undergo longitudinal re-assessment at 15-months to match the new HCP-development paradigm (HCP-D) to allow for comparison to a large normative dataset being collected in Minnesota as part of the HCP-D project. We will capitalize on the developments spawned from the $40 million HCP and will benefit from evaluating the brains of children with PAE against the backdrop of a very large HCP normative dataset (n=1300). The proposed study will examine 45 participants with PAE and 45 matched controls, ages 8-16, all of whom will be evaluated by the CIFASD dysmorphology project. Participants will undergo MRI scans at the University of Minnesota's Center for Magnetic Resonance Research (CMRR) at baseline and again 15 months later. The imaging protocol, which contains very high resolution structural, diffusion- weighted, and fMRI scans will evaluate cortical gyrification, intra-cortical myelin, white matter connectivity, and functional connectivity. Data from the HCP-D project will be used as secondary “normative” comparison dataset. We expect to find a number of subtle neurodevelopmental abnormalities in PAE that have not previously been observed and we will characterize individuals with these metrics. Individual identification of neurodevelopmental anomalies will then allow us to probe the screening properties of commonly used FASD diagnostic criteria and to test the performance of Dr. Mattson's Decision Tree model for rapidly identifying children with developmental effects of PAE. The study will have direct implications for FASD clinical practice and public policies as it will provide objective data about the relative advantages and disadvantages of individual diagnostic elements and it will allow for comparisons of competing FASD diagnostic systems. The proposed project aims to use the most advanced MRI brain imaging techniques available to address a highly practical problem faced by clinicians and public health officials: the lack of consensus about diagnostic criteria for Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD) and the challenges of identifying individuals who are affected by prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) but do not have the physical characteristics upon which a diagnosis can be made. The proposed study will identify subtle brain anomalies in children with PAE with a level of sensitivity not previously attainable. The study will push forward our understanding of how PAE negatively affects the efficiency of the brain's networks. In addition, the study will use these brain imaging results to further refine the diagnostic criteria such that more children will be able to be properly identified as having a neurodevelopmental disorder as a result of PAE.",Multi-modal connectivity methods for the validation of Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder diagnostic criteria,9524815,U01AA026102,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Animals', 'Attention', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Categories', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Consensus', 'Control Groups', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Trees', 'Development', 'Developmental Course', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Factor', 'Disadvantaged', 'Dysmorphology', 'Elements', 'Evaluation', 'Executive Dysfunction', 'Face', 'Fetal Alcohol Exposure', 'Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder', 'Fetal alcohol effects', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'MRI Scans', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Minnesota', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Myelin', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neurodevelopmental Impairment', 'Neurosciences', 'Participant', 'Performance', 'Predictive Value', 'Pregnancy', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Proxy', 'Psychometrics', 'Public Health', 'Public Policy', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Resource Sharing', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Site', 'Structural defect', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Work', 'alcohol exposure', 'clinical diagnostics', 'clinical practice', 'clinically relevant', 'cognitive function', 'connectome', 'diffusion weighted', 'executive function', 'functional MRI scan', 'high risk', 'imaging modality', 'longitudinal analysis', 'longitudinal dataset', 'multidisciplinary', 'negative affect', 'neurobehavioral disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroimaging marker', 'performance tests', 'prisma', 'processing speed', 'screening', 'white matter']",NIAAA,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,U01,2018,333476,0.08368520905072079
"Targeting corticostriatal synchrony with deep brain stimulation to reduce alcohol drinking No abstract available Project Narrative Alcohol use disorder (AUD) affects approximately 15 million adults in the United States with a particular need for new therapeutic options in the treatment resistant population. Brain network dysregulation is implicated in AUD, specifically dysregulated corticostriatal synchrony, and this proposal will uncover the relationship between corticostriatal synchrony induced by deep brain stimulation (DBS) and reduced alcohol drinking in an animal model.

"A Machine Learning Approach for Inferring Alcohol Intoxication Levels from Gait Data Almost a quarter of the population aged 18 years and older reports binge drinking in the last month. Excessive alcohol consumption is associated with significant health and psychosocial consequences. Despite these high rates of problematic drinking, the majority (85%-90%) of individuals believe they can control drinking behavior on their own. Self-monitoring of drinking is key to behavior change, yet recent approaches utilizing mobile technology to collect real-time data have been limited by participant burden, poor compliance, and inaccuracy. Gait analysis, is one of the most reliable way to determine intoxication in humans. We developed AlcoGait, a smartphone-based alcohol tracking technology that passively infers level of drinking from gait impairment. In the current study, we will continue to refine AlcoGait's machine learning algorithms to passively analyze gait and trunk sway data in order to accurately determine gait impairment associated with elevated BrAC levels, particularly .08 g%. While the use of smartphone technology to conduct gait analysis has been employed with various patient populations, it has yet to be utilized for assessing gait in the context of alcohol intoxication. We will administer alcohol to 250 participants in a laboratory setting. We will collect gait and trunk sway data from the smartphone's accelerometer and gyroscope at preset breath alcohol concentration (BrAC) levels up to the legal limit of .08g%. In Stage 1 (technology preparation), we will program the AlcoGait 2.0 smartphone application to passively gather and export both accelerometer and gyroscope data (gait information) based on the first 10 participants. In Stage 2 (data gathering, analysis and machine learning), the next 190 participants will serve as a “training set,” providing input data for AlcoGait 2.0; these data will allow for the comparison of 4 classifiers types (machine-learning methodologies) that infer BrAC levels associated with impairment, particularly with .08 g%, using gait and trunk sway data. In Stage 3, the best performing classifier as determined using the training set will be programmed into the final AlcoGait 2.0 app and validated with an additional 50 participants completing the alcohol administration laboratory study (“validation set”). AlcoGait 2.0's ability to accurately associate gait impairment with legal intoxication would represent a great advance over other smartphone applications that require the user to manually record and track amount, time, and types of alcohol consumption. With our app's focus on motor impairment, we see our primary users as those who, despite subjective perceptions or counting drinks, are unable to estimate their BrAC accurately but would want to know if they are too impaired to drive. This technology could be used preventively to alert drinkers of impairment and intoxication in real time, mitigating negative consequences. Passive smartphone-based sensing technologies present minimal burden to users and can have ubiquitous impact as smartphones are now widely owned across all ages, ethnicities, and socioeconomic groups. Project Narrative Almost a quarter of the population aged 18 years and older reports binge drinking in the last month. Despite these high rates of problematic drinking, the majority of individuals do not receive formal alcohol treatment, often because they believe they can control drinking behavior on their own. Self-monitoring of drinking is key to behavior change, yet recent approaches utilizing mobile technology to collect real-time data have been limited by participant burden, poor compliance, and inaccuracy. Smartphone technology, leveraging the long-studied connection between alcohol intoxication and gait impairment, allows alcohol use self-monitoring to enter a new era. Such technology, as pioneered in our phone app Alcogait, where gait is passively recorded during usual activities, could be used preventively to alert drinkers when they are passing various blood alcohol concentrations, and when they are legally intoxicated in real time based on gait impairment.",A Machine Learning Approach for Inferring Alcohol Intoxication Levels from Gait Data,9307339,R21AA025193,"['18 year old', 'Accelerometer', 'Address', 'Age', 'Agreement', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcoholic Intoxication', 'Alcohols', 'Algorithms', 'Awareness', 'Behavioral', 'Blood alcohol level measurement', 'Cellular Phone', 'Classification', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Future', 'Gait', 'Health', 'Heavy Drinking', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intoxication', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Laboratory Study', 'Learning', 'Legal', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Monitor', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Perception', 'Persons', 'Phonation', 'Population', 'Preparation', 'Preventive', 'Reporting', 'Sample Size', 'Self-control as a personality trait', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Supervision', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Visit', 'Walking', 'Work', 'alcohol abuse therapy', 'alcohol content', 'base', 'behavior change', 'binge drinking', 'breath alcohol measurement', 'brief intervention', 'design', 'drinking', 'drinking behavior', 'experimental study', 'forest', 'gait examination', 'impaired driving performance', 'improved', 'mobile computing', 'motor impairment', 'patient population', 'programs', 'psychosocial', 'socioeconomics']",NIAAA,"BUTLER HOSPITAL (PROVIDENCE, RI)",R21,2017,228107,0.15548969172173605
"Using the Lumme system to improve real-time blood alcohol detection PROJECT SUMMARY  There is a critical need to develop non-invasive technologies to monitor blood alcohol levels in real time. Such technology would advance research assessing drinking in the natural environment, clinical platforms intervening in real-time, and justice applications. Currently developed technology, transdermal alcohol sensors (TAS), passively detect alcohol intoxication by continuously testing for alcohol excreted in sweat. While such technology provides continuous monitoring of alcohol consumption, there are several significant shortcomings that limit its utility in research and clinical contexts. Limitations include lack of temporal resolution (i.e., delay between drinking and sweat detection), poor sensitivity of drinking episodes that do not meet binge criteria, and lack of information about drinking topography.  In response to PAR-16-410, we propose to pair our Lumme Inc behavioral tracking platform with a TAS device to improve the detection of real-time drinking behavior. The Lumme system combines the use of existing commercial hardware (smartwatch and smartphone) to assess drinking behavior in real time. The Lumme system uses inertial measurement units to record the movement of a person’s arm in three dimensional space with accelerometers and gyroscope contained in a smartwatch. Arm movements associated with drinking are distinctive, and can be accurately captured with a machine learning algorithm. The combined Lumme/TAS system complements one another’s strengths by providing detailed drinking data that can be linked to subsequent increases in blood alcohol content (BAC). The combined system will be able to accurately track drinking variables of interest to researchers and clinicians (e.g., start/end of drinking, length of drinking episode, rate of drinking, activity while drinking, social networks while drinking, location of drinking, and resulting BAC). Additionally, the gesture data can remotely capture low level drinking episodes that are undetected by existing TAS systems. We currently have a funded SBIR from NCI to develop and validate a smoking cessation platform using the Lumme system.  For the current application, we will propose a Phase I study to establish the feasibility and initial validity of using the combined Lumme/TAS system for tracking alcohol use behavior in real time. We plan to video record ad-libitum drinking behavior in heavy drinkers fitted with both a TAS system (BACtrack Skyn) and our Lumme system. The data collected in the clinical setting will act as ground truth which will be used to train our machine learning algorithm that will be sensitive to (i) how drinking gestures may change as blood alcohol levels rise (ii) how gestures may be affected by type of alcohol and the drinking vessel.  To our knowledge, the Lumme system would be the first system to remotely detect drinking gestures using a machine learning algorithm. In addition to improving real-time BAC detection technology the Lumme system could be also developed to deliver just-in-time interventions for problem drinking. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Alcohol use results in 88,000 annual deaths in the US and has an annual economic burden on $249 billion.

"Patient Engagement Alcohol Risk Reduction System (PEARRS) PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Over a quarter of primary care patients in the United States can be classified as unhealthy drinkers because their alcohol use conveys a high risk of health and social consequences. Unfortunately, unhealthy drinking is under-recognized in spite of the existence of valid screening tools. Even when unhealthy drinking is recognized, barriers such as provider discomfort, shortage of time, and stigma can inhibit appropriate care.  The objective of this proposal is to develop and test a new product to support detection and management of unhealthy drinking in medical settings. The Patient Engagement Alcohol Risk Reduction System (PEARRS) will improve clinical practice by combining existing proprietary software with two novel components. The first uses modern machine learning techniques and widely available pre-existing patient data (such as routine lab test results) to build an algorithm that will identify patients likely to be unhealthy drinkers. Publicly available national survey data will be used to develop a prediction model that will then be tested with a clinical data set. The second component is a data system (database, mobile app and related software) that interacts with the patient, providing proven behavior change interventions such as goal setting, self-monitoring, and feedback, while simultaneously providing decision support to primary care providers. Iterative software development approaches will be used to create an app with a simple user interface and reporting functions.  PEARRS will provide a sophisticated tool for managing unhealthy alcohol use that will enable better quality of care, treatment outcomes, and cost savings.  AIM 1: To develop an algorithm to identify adults at elevated risk for unhealthy drinking  based on pre-existing objective laboratory tests.  AIM 2: To develop a prototype data system to actively engage patients and providers and  support evidence-based self-guided behavior change.  PEARRS addresses an unmet need for a low-cost method to reduce the clinical, social and financial burden of unhealthy alcohol use and will improve upon the status quo because laboratory markers will be used as screeners instead of self-report measures that are inconsistently used and can provoke resistance. Further, PEARRS will relieve providers of the need to perform a task they feel underprepared and unrewarded for.  The commercial applicability of this technological innovation is high because it is portable and relevant to a broad market of insurers, employers, accountable care organizations (ACOs) and others at risk for the consequences of unhealthy alcohol use. The impact PEARRS will have is substantial because it can overcome known barriers to providing alcohol evaluation and treatment services in general medical settings. PEARRS represents a fundamental shift in how unhealthy drinking is managed in medical settings. PROJECT NARRATIVE  In some people, alcohol consumption can cause or complicate medical problems, accidents, lost productivity and crime. Although effective methods exist to identify unhealthy drinkers and help them reduce their risks, they are not widely used. We propose using routine laboratory data to identify individuals whose drinking may put them at risk for health problems or complications, and a data system with mobile app to offer them evidence-based behavior change interventions.",Patient Engagement Alcohol Risk Reduction System (PEARRS),9407982,R41AA025297,"['Accidents', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohols', 'Algorithms', 'Biological Markers', 'Businesses', 'Caring', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Client', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Communication', 'Computer software', 'Cost Savings', 'Crime', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Evaluation', 'Familiarity', 'Feedback', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Individual', 'Information Systems', 'Insurance Carriers', 'Intelligence', 'Intervention', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Laboratories', 'Laboratory Markers', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Staff', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Practice Management', 'Primary Health Care', 'Process', 'Productivity', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Quality of Care', 'Randomized', 'Readiness', 'Reporting', 'Resistance', 'Risk', 'Self Management', 'Services', 'Small Business Technology Transfer Research', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Vermont', 'Work', 'alcohol misuse', 'alcohol monitoring', 'alcohol risk reduction', 'base', 'behavior change', 'brief intervention', 'clinical practice', 'cost', 'demographics', 'drinking', 'evidence base', 'high risk', 'improved', 'medical attention', 'mobile application', 'novel', 'population health', 'portability', 'primary care setting', 'productivity loss', 'prototype', 'screening', 'social', 'social stigma', 'software development', 'success', 'technological innovation', 'tool', 'user-friendly', 'web site']",NIAAA,"VERMEDX, INC.",R41,2017,150001,0.11484902755012774
": Complex systems analysis of the impact of alcohol on bone in non-human primates PROJECT SUMMARY Understanding the impact of alcohol consumption on bone health is important because alcohol influences bone metabolism and over half of the adult population in the United States drinks alcoholic beverages. Low to moderate levels of alcohol consumption are generally associated with beneficial skeletal effects while chronic alcohol abuse predisposes individuals to bone fractures. The long-term goal of our research is to delineate the primary mechanisms mediating the divergent skeletal effects of low/moderate and heavy alcohol consumption. An appreciation of the precise effects and mechanisms of action of alcohol on bone metabolism is important because of the enormous economic, social and personal burden associated with poor bone health. Progress in understanding the actions of alcohol on bone metabolism are hampered by (1) the extreme difficulty in performing intervention studies in humans, (2) limitations of commonly used animal models, (3) failure to adequately consider alcohol’s effects on tissue and organ systems that impact bone, and (4) difficulty in accurately replicating human drinking behavior in animals. The studies proposed in this R01 application will overcome limitations of human and prior animal studies by using a non-human primate (monkey) model for voluntary alcohol consumption that mimics the full range of human drinking behavior. We will use linear regression models, multivariate linear regression models, machine learning, and systems analysis to establish the impact of pattern of alcohol consumption (none, light/moderate, binge, heavy and very heavy) on bone metabolism in rhesus (Macaca mulatta; n=105) and cynomolgus (Macaca fascicularis; n=86) macaques in the context of sex, age and alcohol-induced perturbations in tissue and organ systems that can influence bone. We will identify the latter perturbations by determining the effect of alcohol on specific protein (e.g., peptide hormones and cytokines) and small molecule (e.g., steroid hormones) effectors in blood. Our central hypothesis, based in part on our preliminary data in rats, macaques and humans, is that changes in the blood levels of bone-active hormones and cytokines, derived from several tissues/organs, in response to alcohol intake act in concert to modulate bone cell number and activity. To test our hypothesis, we propose the following two Specific Aims: Specific Aim 1: Define the correlative relationships between the quantity and pattern of alcohol consumption and bone in male and female macaques. Specific Aim 2: Define the correlative relationships among blood ethanol levels, key bone active hormones and cytokines, and biochemical markers of bone turnover in male and female macaques. At the completion of this project, we expect to have established that the magnitude of skeletal response to alcohol will correlate with changes in serum biochemical markers of bone turnover which, in turn, will correlate with changes in circulating levels of specific hormones and cytokines. The primary positive impact of our anticipated findings is identification of key underlying factors responsible for the complex, context-dependent actions of alcohol on bone metabolism. PROJECT NARRATIVE Alcohol is an important nonessential component of diet that has been implicated in having both positive and negative effects on the skeleton. The proposed studies will evaluate the impact of pattern of alcohol consumption (none, light/moderate, binge, heavy, and very heavy) on bone in a non-human primate model for voluntary drinking that mimics the full range of human drinking behavior.

"Mediators and Moderators of a Neighborhood Experiment on Alcohol Use ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Excessive drinking in adolescence disrupts healthy development and leads to adverse social, economic and health consequences later in life. Although existing research focuses primarily on individual-level causes, neighborhood context is increasingly recognized as an upstream determinant of alcohol use. Yet since most prior neighborhood research on health has not been experimental, it is potentially biased, and weakens the foundation for policy translation. Our study proposes a secondary analysis of newly-available data from a social experiment of voluntary neighborhood relocation using housing vouchers in 5 cities (the Moving to Opportunity, MTO, Study), to test whether, how, and why random assignment of an offer to move to a low- poverty neighborhood over a 15 year period influenced the alcohol use, excessive drinking, and alcohol dependence of adolescents and their mothers. We will complement existing data with additional neighborhood- level data to enrich the dataset and test multilevel hypotheses. MTO is the only available large-scale study that has randomly assigned families to receive different neighborhood housing contexts, to support strong causal inferences of how early-life neighborhood context shapes alcohol use. When launched, MTO was one of the most promising policies to reverse the damaging effects of neighborhood poverty for minority families. But health researchers have had limited access to MTO data, compromising the scientific payoff of the $70+ million investment. Since residential mobility experiments like MTO are rare, expensive, and since MTO profoundly affected substance use, it is crucial to probe its effects. We propose new secondary data analyses with newly available 15 year follow-up data from this RCT, using novel methods to test mediation and moderation, applied to alcohol outcome measures that have not been examined prior. We apply innovative methods for assessing mediation (i.e., weight-based causal methods) and effect modification (i.e., machine learning techniques). Aside from the RCT design for strong causal inference of how early-life neighborhood changes influence excessive drinking, we also leverage one of the few longitudinal intervention designs sampling both mothers and their children, to illuminate familial transmission of drinking as it emerges in adolescence. Our R21 project builds on a productive, interdisciplinary team, experienced with the MTO study, and proposes 3 aims: to test how moving to a low-poverty neighborhood in the MTO experiment influenced excessive drinking and alcohol dependence; to examine if the MTO experimental effect on excessive drinking and alcohol dependence was less beneficial for more vulnerable families; to test whether effects of moving to a low-poverty neighborhood in MTO for excessive drinking and alcohol dependence were mediated by individual-level stress; family-level context; or neighborhood-level stress, alcohol availability, or alcohol norms. The results will enrich our understanding of neighborhood and family context as a cause of excessive drinking and alcohol use in adolescents and adults, and inform the next generation of alcohol prevention policy. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    This project will test mediation and moderation of a social experiment of housing and neighborhood relocation on alcohol use, excessive drinking, and alcohol dependence, among adolescents and their mothers, to probe whether, why, and among whom neighborhood context earlier in life is a cause of alcohol use across 15 years. This knowledge will inform the next generation of alcohol prevention policies. Because of its experimental design, results will inform causal pathways and potential intervention points, including during childhood, by which to reduce the population burden of alcohol use.",Mediators and Moderators of a Neighborhood Experiment on Alcohol Use,9212070,R21AA024530,"['Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Adverse effects', 'Affect', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohol dependence', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Alcohols', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Cities', 'Complement', 'Crime', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Compromising', 'Data Set', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Economics', 'Elements', 'Exhibits', 'Experimental Designs', 'Exposure to', 'Family', 'Female', 'Female Adolescents', 'Foundations', 'Fright', 'Health', 'Heavy Drinking', 'Household Heads', 'Housing', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Investments', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Low income', 'Machine Learning', 'Male Adolescents', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Mothers', 'Neighborhoods', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Poverty', 'Randomized', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Residential Mobility', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'Sampling', 'Shapes', 'Son', 'Stress', 'Subgroup', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Translations', 'Victimization', 'Weight', 'Youth', 'alcohol availability', 'alcohol prevention', 'base', 'boys', 'contextual factors', 'density of AOD outlets', 'design', 'drinking', 'early drinking', 'excessive drinking in adolescence', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'follow-up', 'girls', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'low socioeconomic status', 'lower income families', 'next generation', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'secondary analysis', 'social', 'therapy design', 'transmission process', 'underage drinking', 'volunteer', 'voucher']",NIAAA,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,R21,2017,183049,0.20985426182458147
"NCANDA: DATA ANALYSIS RESOURCE PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT During young adulthood, drinking dramatically increases, with binge-level drinking peaking at age 22 and nearly half of individuals who drink report binge-level alcohol use. Frequent binge alcohol use during the protracted neuromaturation extending into the mid 20s may result in greater brain and cognitive effects than similar alcohol use in later adulthood. This application is in response to RFA-AA-17-005, Continuation of the National Consortium on Alcohol and Neurodevelopment in Adolescence (NCANDA) Data Analysis Resource (U24) to determine the predictors and effects of accelerated alcohol use in adolescence and young adulthood. NCANDA-2 will follow the initial cohort of 831 participants (ages 12-21 at first visit) from 5 collection sites and acquire the necessary data to advance our understanding of adolescent development and the effects of alcohol use on the adolescent and young adult brain using multimodal neuroimaging, cognitive testing, and behavioral assessment. The examination of alcohol consequences will focus on structural and functional maturation of brain areas that actively develop during adolescence, are involved in psychological regulation, respond to rewards, and appear vulnerable to deleterious effects of alcohol. With the additional longitudinal data provided by this renewal, we will determine the effects of alcohol exposure on the developmental trajectory of the adolescent human brain and identify preexisting psychobiological vulnerabilities that may put an adolescent or young adult at elevated risk for an alcohol use disorder. The Data Analysis Resource (DAR) will 1) oversee data collection with standardization and comparability across sites; 2) perform data analysis for core measures collected at each site; 3) facilitate across-site pooling and centralized data storage; 4) create a database across assessment modalities for efficient retrieval; 5) coordinate data and resource sharing; 6) harmonize data across sites; and 7) create and implement novel, multimodality analyses using machine learning to engage broad spectrum data. The DAR has 5 Specific Aims: Aim 1. Maintain standardized procedures for collection of neuroimaging, neuropsychological, and clinical  assessment data and harmonize with existing large-scale neurodevelopmental research efforts. Aim 2.

"Image Analysis of Neurofacial Effects of Prenatal Alcohol  Exposure Abstract As a constitutent component of CIFASD4, this project will focus on earlier detection of the neurofacial effects of prenatal alcohol exposure. Four topics of the Request for Application (RFA) will be targeted: a) improved FAS/FASD facial recognition through 3D photography and computer analyses in individuals of different age groups; b) the utility of prenatal ultrasound as a screening or diagnostic modality; c) 3D facial imaging during the neonatal period to detect more subtle facial features affected by prenatal alcohol exposure; d) innovative uses of technologies, including handheld devices with apps, to screen for dysmorphology. Previously, we have implemented methods and associated software for analyzing postnatal face shape for the detection of the effects of prenatal alcohol exposure. Although effective in their accuracy, they rely on the use of expensive and relatively clumsy 3D cameras for which not insignificant training is required. New methods of 2D image analysis are available, mobile device acquisition of 3D images is imminent and online recruitment to clinical research is becoming more common place. Finally, state-of-the-art machine learning methods are proving effective in large-scale analysis of ultrasound and MRI data. To accomplish our goals, we propose the following specific aims: 1. Automated screening of facial images for effects of prenatal alcohol exposure with potential for on-line and  mobile device use and integration of genetic, behavioral and cognitive data; 2. Fetal ultrasound analysis to detect facial, cranial and neural effects of prenatal alcohol exposure with  neonatal follow-up; 3. Algorithm and software development to improve current analysis of face-brain-alcohol interactions. Achieving aim 1 will dramatically impact access to validated facial screening for prenatal alcohol exposure. Successful demonstration of aim 2 will achieve the earliest possible diagnosis enabling further research on interventions but also anticipatory neonatal management. Progress in aim 3 will enhance face-brain morphometric analyses in collaboration with other CIFASD partners (U01:Parnell/Eberhart, U01:Wozniak). We will work collaboratively with consortium partners who will recruit subjects and provide facial and ultrasound images (U01: Chambers; U01: Coles; U01: Mattson; U01: Weinberg; U01: Wozniak). We will co- operate on the analysis of images arising from basic science partners focusing on the use of animal models. We will rely on research resources for validation of postnatal screening tools (R24 Dysmorphology - Jones) and online/app development and data management (R24 Informatics - Barnett). Project Narrative The goal of this project is to develop new methods for screening for the effects of prenatal alcohol exposure. It will exploit the wide availability and convenience of smartphone and tablet devices to detect the facial effects in children and adults and new ways of analyzing ultrasound images to detect facial and brain effects in the fetus. Our aim is to establish earlier detection so as to allow earlier intervention to improve outcome.",Image Analysis of Neurofacial Effects of Prenatal Alcohol  Exposure,9391198,U01AA014809,"['3D ultrasound', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Agreement', 'Alcohols', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Basic Science', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Caucasians', 'Cellular Phone', 'Cephalic', 'Child', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Color', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer software', 'Corpus Callosum', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Differential Diagnosis', 'Discrimination', 'Dysmorphology', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Evaluation', 'Face', 'Fetal Alcohol Exposure', 'Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder', 'Fetal alcohol effects', 'Fetus', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Intervention', 'Link', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Monoclonal Antibody R24', 'Neonatal', 'Nose', 'Photography', 'Pilot Projects', 'Pregnancy', 'Preparation', 'Printing', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Request for Applications', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resources', 'Shapes', 'Software Tools', 'Syndrome', 'Tablet Computer', 'Tablets', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Training', 'Ultrasonography', 'Validation', 'Weight', 'Work', 'age group', 'alcohol exposure', 'base', 'caudate nucleus', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'cohort', 'cost', 'data management', 'experience', 'fetal', 'follow-up', 'handheld equipment', 'handheld mobile device', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'maternal cigarette smoking', 'mouse model', 'novel', 'operation', 'postnatal', 'potential biomarker', 'prenatal', 'relating to nervous system', 'screening', 'software development', 'tobacco exposure', 'tool']",NIAAA,UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD,U01,2017,288909,0.0493466754548958
"A Multisite Neurobehavioral Assessment of Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders Project Summary This request for a renewal of funding is in response to the NIH/NIAAA funding opportunity entitled, “Collaborative Initiative on Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (CIFASD)” (RFA-AA-17-007). The overarching aim of the current proposal is to develop, validate, and implement clinically novel and innovative measurement tools to accurately identify children who are affected by prenatal alcohol exposure. The proposed study is relevant to the overall objective of the CIFASD funding opportunity “to accelerate specific areas of research related to the translation of new or improved capabilities in FASD clinical case recognition.” This is critical need. While there has been a concerted research effort since the initial clinical delineation of fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS), understanding the full spectrum of effects of prenatal alcohol exposure remains incomplete, hindering effective intervention. Although individuals with prenatal alcohol exposure may experience significantly impairing functional difficulties, identification of these individuals is inadequate. High rates of missed diagnoses and misdiagnosis result in lost opportunities for intervention and misunderstanding of the etiology of observed difficulties. Development of accurate and specific identification tools will improve diagnostic capability and clinical decision-making regarding treatment. To this end, during previous funding periods we substantially enhanced the understanding of the specificity of effects of prenatal alcohol exposure to increase identification of alcohol-affected youth. Our hierarchical CIFASD Decision Tree, developed and validated on over 800 subjects, indicates that administration of just 4 measures can distinguish alcohol-affected youth from nonexposed controls with and without behavioral concerns or conditions with accuracy rates of >80%. While a significant step forward, the Decision Tree was developed and validated in a research sample with a high risk of alcohol effects. One aim of the current proposal is to develop and test an electronic version of the Decision Tree (the eTree) in lower risk, international, population-based, and clinic-based samples. Another aim of the proposal, in line with the specific RFA goal to use innovative technologies to screen for dysmorphology and/or neurobehavioral deficits to aid in the identification of alcohol-exposed individuals, is the development and implementation of the FASD Online Neurobehavioral Screen (FONS), a web-based neurobehavioral assessment tool for use with subjects recruited via a web portal (cf. Foroud U01). The FONS will measure domains known to be affected in FASD, including those represented in diagnostic criteria for neurobehavioral disorder associated with prenatal alcohol exposure (ND-PAE). The eTree and the FONS will be validated using laboratory-based in-person neuropsychological assessment of children with histories of prenatal alcohol exposure and non-exposed controls with and without behavioral concerns or conditions. The results of the proposed research will fulfill our research goals, improve recruitment, and most importantly accurately identify individuals affected by prenatal alcohol exposure, leading to improved clinical diagnosis and intervention. Project Narrative This project is directly relevant to public health concerns related to the effects of heavy prenatal alcohol exposure and improved identification of alcohol-affected individuals with novel electronic data collection techniques. Improved identification methods and delineation of features related to alcohol-exposure will ultimately lead to improved treatment and help alleviate the public health burden associated with prenatal alcohol exposure.",A Multisite Neurobehavioral Assessment of Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders,9391516,U01AA014834,"['Affect', 'Age', 'Alcohols', 'Area', 'Assessment tool', 'Behavioral', 'California', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Decision Trees', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dysmorphology', 'Ensure', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Face', 'Fetal Alcohol Exposure', 'Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder', 'Fetal Alcohol Syndrome', 'Fetal alcohol effects', 'Funding', 'Funding Opportunities', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Individual', 'International', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Minnesota', 'National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism', 'Neuropsychology', 'Online Systems', 'Outpatients', 'Persons', 'Prevalence', 'Psychiatry', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Self-Administered', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'Standardization', 'Students', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translations', 'Ukraine', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Work', 'Youth', 'alcohol effect', 'alcohol exposure', 'base', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinical decision-making', 'cohort', 'effective intervention', 'electronic data', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'first grade', 'functional disability', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'innovative technologies', 'mobile application', 'neurobehavioral', 'neurobehavioral disorder', 'novel', 'population based', 'response', 'screening', 'tool', 'web portal']",NIAAA,SAN DIEGO STATE UNIVERSITY,U01,2017,379702,0.21320680852487478
"Big data analytics for the evaluation of whole genome sequence and transcriptome data in alcohol research PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Large-scale U.S. epidemiological studies demonstrate that alcohol use disorders are highly prevalent, highly co-morbid with other psychiatric disorders, disabling, and often go untreated. Compared with other U.S. ethnic groups, Native Americans have the highest rates of alcohol and other drug dependence, and it is associated with particularly significant disability and mortality. Thus studies that identify specific genetic risk factors for alcohol use disorders in the general U.S. population, and especially in Native Americans, are of high public health importance. Alcohol use disorders are complex genetic diseases sensitive to environmental conditions that require complex data strategies to uncover the underlying risk factors. Although recent years have seen significant advancement in our understanding in the biology and genetics of the disorders, exactly how these factors interact in an individual to confer risk or protection from alcohol use disorders is still unclear. Further, the genetic factors identified in the human genome thus far by conventional methods appear to only explain a very small fraction of the overall heritability for the disorders.  The overall objective of this research program is to identify the complex genetic and genomic factors that affect susceptibility to alcohol use disorders and related comorbidities through novel and innovative quantitative methods and big data analytics. The proposed study will utilize whole-genome sequence (WGS) data from a unique high-risk Native American population and a European American population along with gene expression data of alcoholic human brains. The project will develop methodology to analyze WGS data with unique relevance to alcohol research. Selected multivariate, graphical, and dimension-reduction modeling tools will be used in combination with mixed models suitable for genomic data with both population and family structures to dissect polygenic basis for alcohol use disorders and shared genetic risk factors for alcohol use disorders and comorbid disorders. Mixture models and clustering methods will be employed to uncover heterogeneous genetic influences. Differential genetic effects at various levels of heterogeneity will be tested with rigorous statistical methods. The project will identify population and ancestry-specific genetic risk factors and shared risk factors across populations and determine their differential influences on susceptibility to alcohol use disorders. Endophenotypes will also be investigated to help identify unique risk factors for alcohol use disorder traits. The project will further identify alcohol- and addiction-relevant pathways and networks that are differentially expressed in alcoholic brains, and establish directions of causations by combining gene expression data with WGS data, and applying instrumental variable approaches. Finally, an integrated system approach will be taken by further leveraging epigenomic maps and annotation databases in the public domain to build predictive and potentially causal models aimed at more “personalized” prevention and intervention for alcohol use disorders in specific high-risk groups and individuals. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Alcohol use disorders are prevalent, frequently co-occur with other psychiatric disorders, are disabling and often go untreated. Identifying specific genetic risk factors for alcohol use disorders in the general U.S. population, and especially in high risk ethnic groups such as Native Americans, will lead to more personalized thus more effective prevention and intervention for alcoholism in these populations.",Big data analytics for the evaluation of whole genome sequence and transcriptome data in alcohol research,9321946,K25AA025095,"['Affect', 'Alcohol dependence', 'Alcoholism', 'Alcohols', 'American', 'Autopsy', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Big Data', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Communities', 'Comorbidity', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Drug Addiction', 'Ethnic group', 'Etiology', 'European', 'Evaluation', 'Family Study', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Hereditary Disease', 'Heritability', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Individual', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mental disorders', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Native Americans', 'New South Wales', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Domains', 'Public Health', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Randomized', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'San Francisco', 'Siblings', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'System', 'Testing', 'Variant', 'addiction', 'alcohol and other drug', 'alcohol intervention', 'alcohol research', 'alcohol use disorder', 'base', 'causal model', 'cohort', 'differential expression', 'disability', 'endophenotype', 'epidemiology study', 'epigenomics', 'family structure', 'genetic risk factor', 'genome wide association study', 'genomic data', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'individualized prevention', 'innovation', 'mortality', 'non-alcoholic', 'novel', 'pleiotropism', 'predictive modeling', 'problem drinker', 'programs', 'risk sharing', 'statistics', 'tissue resource', 'tool', 'trait', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptomics', 'whole genome']",NIAAA,SCRIPPS RESEARCH INSTITUTE,K25,2017,161460,0.14100521124354576
"Sex Differences in Alcohol-Related Neurotoxicity During Adolescence ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Adolescence is a time of dramatic development, much of which varies as a function of sex. Also during this time, alcohol use becomes very common. Likely due to heightened plasticity, the adolescent brain is particularly susceptible to the neurotoxic effects of alcohol. While studies have separately documented cross- sectional sex differences in the effects of alcohol on the adolescent brain and hormonal influences on normative adolescent brain development, to fully understand sex-specific adolescent risk and resilience for alcoholism, multimodal prospective longitudinal studies are crucial. To that end, during this funding period, we will assess an additional 120 healthy non-alcohol/drug using 14-16-year-old youth using functional neuroimaging during working memory and decision making, resting state functional neuroimaging, diffusion tensor imaging, neurocognitive assessment, mood/behavior/personality assessment, and serum hormone assays. Together with over 200 youth assessed during the first funding period of the project, all youth will be quarterly monitore for changes in alcohol/drug use, and youth who emerge into heavy alcohol use (as well as a matched non-using control) will be re-assessed at two time points following initiation of heavy drinking behavior. Using a multi-modal longitudinal design, we aim to better understand sex-specific effects of heavy alcohol use on adolescent brain functioning and connectivity, as well as identify premorbid sex-specific neurobiological risk phenotypes that are predictive of problem drinking during adolescence and young adulthood. Further, we will explore moderating variables, such timing and frequency of alcohol and other drug use, as well as the role of gonadal steroids on sex-specific developmental trajectories. Disentangling sex- specific risk for and consequences of alcohol use during adolescence, in relation to normative brain development, and determining which effects may be hormonally influenced, will move the field closer to more personalized prevention and intervention strategies aimed at male and female youth. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The present study seeks to longitudinally examine sex-specific alcohol effects on the adolescent brain and identify sex-specific neurobiological risk markers that are predictive of high levels of drinking during adolescence and young adulthood. Understanding sex-specific risk for and consequences of alcohol use during adolescence is a crucial step toward developing more informed prevention and treatment strategies.",Sex Differences in Alcohol-Related Neurotoxicity During Adolescence,9281601,R01AA017664,"['16 year old', 'Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Alcohol abuse', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcoholism', 'Alcohols', 'Anisotropy', 'Appetitive Behavior', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Assay', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data Collection', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Drug usage', 'Emotional', 'Estradiol', 'Female', 'Fiber', 'Financial compensation', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Glare', 'Gonadal Steroid Hormones', 'Heavy Drinking', 'Hormonal', 'Hormones', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Longitudinal prospective study', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Male Adolescents', 'Mediating', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Moods', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurocognitive', 'Parietal', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Personality', 'Personality Assessment', 'Phenotype', 'Prevention strategy', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Prospective Studies', 'Reporting', 'Rest', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Risk Marker', 'Role', 'Serum', 'Sex Characteristics', 'Sex Functioning', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Testosterone', 'Time', 'Youth', 'adolescent brain development', 'alcohol and other drug', 'alcohol consequences', 'alcohol effect', 'base', 'binge drinking', 'brain behavior', 'cognitive change', 'cohort', 'drinking', 'drinking behavior', 'emotional behavior', 'heavy drinking during adolescence', 'improved', 'individualized prevention', 'longitudinal design', 'male', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'neurotoxic', 'neurotoxicity', 'personalized intervention', 'predictive marker', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'resilience', 'response', 'sex', 'treatment strategy', 'underage drinking', 'young adult']",NIAAA,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,R01,2017,441965,0.1843430899563411
"Consequences of Adolescent Alcohol Use on Brain Development DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This revised R01 A1 proposal (AA022493), ""Consequences of Adolescent Alcohol Use on Brain Development"", responds to the need to understand the impact of initiating alcohol consumption on adolescent brain maturation. We have teamed with the Center for Adolescent Substance Abuse Research (CeASAR) and Boston Children's Hospital to implement an innovative strategy that combines multiple neuroimaging and neuropsychological approaches to identify neurodevelopmental vulnerabilities associated with early and escalating alcohol use during adolescence. Adolescents will be recruited from general pediatrician offices and adolescent medicine clinics comprising the New England Partnership for Substance Abuse Research (NEPSAR), a practice-based research network of primary care offices. Adolescents will be enrolled into the study prior to the initiation of alcoho use or other drug use, and examined longitudinally, at baseline (13-14 yrs old) and again at two annual follow-up visits. To provide a comprehensive longitudinal profile of brain function, structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), and task and resting state blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) will be paired with magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) to measure GABA and glutamate levels in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and medial temporal lobe (MTL, containing hippocampus). In addition, arterial spin labeling (ASL) will be used to measure quantitative perfusion, which will be used to calibrate the magnitude of BOLD fMRI signal changes during response inhibition and spatial memory fMRI tasks. Magnetic resonance measures will be integrated with measures from clinical assessments and an extensive neuropsychological battery, designed to detect and further characterize developmental changes and the influence of adolescent alcohol use. The incorporation of complementary multi-modal measures of brain function and neuroplasticity could offer valuable insight into the dynamic processes of brain maturation and help identify neural signatures associated with the onset and escalation of alcohol use, which will provide a foundation for informing prevention and intervention efforts aimed at reducing adolescent alcohol consumption. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This longitudinal, multi-modal study of adolescents during the critical period of brain maturation, and during a time that overlaps with the onset of alcohol initiation, will help elucidate milestones of healthy adolescent brain development and identify neural signatures associated with the onset and escalation of alcohol use.",Consequences of Adolescent Alcohol Use on Brain Development,9269497,R01AA022493,"['Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adolescent Medicine', 'Age', 'Age of Onset', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Anisotropy', 'Anterior', 'Behavior assessment', 'Boston', 'Brain', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical assessments', 'Cognitive', 'Core-Binding Factor', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Drug usage', 'Enrollment', 'Failure', 'Female', 'Foundations', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Glutamates', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Hyperactive behavior', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Mediating', 'Memory', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Neuronal Plasticity', 'Neuropsychology', 'New England', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Performance', 'Perfusion', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Primary Health Care', 'Process', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Spin Labels', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Task Performances', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Thinness', 'Time', 'Visit', 'adolescent alcohol', 'adolescent brain development', 'adolescent substance abuse', 'age related', 'alcohol use initiation', 'base', 'blood oxygen level dependent', 'cingulate cortex', 'critical period', 'design', 'early alcohol use', 'follow-up', 'gamma-Aminobutyric Acid', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'male', 'myelination', 'neuroimaging', 'pediatrician', 'practice-based research network', 'public health relevance', 'reduce adolescent alcohol', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sex', 'spatial memory', 'underage drinking', 'way finding', 'white matter']",NIAAA,MCLEAN HOSPITAL,R01,2017,493698,0.1309373825214733
"Administrative Core of the CIFASD Project Summary/Abstract The Collaborative Initiative on Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (CIFASD) is a multidisciplinary, international consortium of research projects and resource cores charged with improving prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of FASD. The Administrative Resource Core of the CIFASD (AdminC) has led this consortium since it was first established in 2003 and plays a critical leadership role in the coordination of research efforts and ensuring progress toward consortium goals. CIFASD addresses issues related to prenatal alcohol exposure across the lifespan, using a range of interrelated clinical and preclinical research approaches. This iteration of the consortium consists of multiple collaborative components including four resource U24 cores (AdminC, Dysmorphology, Informatics, and Outreach/Dissemination), nine U01 research projects (clinical, basic science, and/or translational) and two exploratory/developmental UH2 projects. One goal of the CIFASD is to improve identification of individuals who have been affected by prenatal alcohol exposure. This will be accomplished by assessing biomarkers, such as immune and miRNA profiles, and by using neuroimaging techniques that may be more sensitive to subtle pathology seen in individuals who do not meet the diagnostic criteria for FAS. In addition, CIFASD will develop novel tools, such as 3D facial and neurobehavioral screening, which can be assessed remotely and made more universally accessible through eHealth. The use of telemedicine will also provide access to more detailed dysmorphology evaluations. Another goal is to identify risk and resiliency factors, including genetic influences that will help with understanding the mechanisms of alcohol's damaging effects and also lead to more targeted interventions. A third goal is to better understand the effects of prenatal alcohol exposure on consequences across the lifespan, including adulthood. Finally, an intervention for improving outcomes will be modified to a mobile platform, so that it can reach larger populations of individuals with FASD and their families. Collectively, these projects have the potential for moving the FASD field forward, improving the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of FASD and serving a wide audience with the technologies available in eHealth. The Specific Aims of the AdminC are to: 1) Provide scientific and administrative direction, leadership and oversight to CIFASD; 2) Facilitate communication among the various projects and the dissemination of results; 3) Assist with data management strategies; 4) Provide annual evaluations of progress; and 5) Provide assistance to projects with implementing eHealth technology. The AdminC provides the foundation for the interactive and supportive framework of CIFASD by establishing regular communications with all members through monthly conference calls and biannual meetings; leading the Steering Committee in the establishment and implementation of CIFASD priorities and policies; supporting the Science Advisory Board with its evaluations of progress on each component as well as the overall mission of CIFASD; as well as serving as the liaison between the consortium's project scientists and its NIAAA advisors. Project Narrative The consequences resulting from prenatal alcohol exposure are wide-ranging and a major and costly public health problem. The goal of the CIFASD consortium is to enhance the identification and treatment of FASD utilizing a multidisciplinary approach consisting of both basic science and clinical research. The collaborations among research projects will allow CIFASD to improve the diagnosis and treatment of FASD, moving the field forward in ways that could not be easily achieved by individual projects.",Administrative Core of the CIFASD,9390289,U24AA014811,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Alcohols', 'Animal Experimentation', 'Animal Model', 'Archives', 'Basic Science', 'Behavior', 'Behavior assessment', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain imaging', 'Cellular Phone', 'Charge', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Decision Trees', 'Developing Countries', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dysmorphology', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Face', 'Family', 'Fetal Alcohol Exposure', 'Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder', 'Fetal alcohol effects', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Screening', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Human', 'Image', 'Immune', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Information Dissemination', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'MicroRNAs', 'Mission', 'Modality', 'National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Pattern', 'Physical assessment', 'Play', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Progress Reports', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Publications', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resource Allocation', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Schedule', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Tablets', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Telemedicine', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Uncertainty', 'Woman', 'Work', 'alcohol exposure', 'base', 'behavioral health', 'behavioral study', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive testing', 'cohort', 'cost', 'cytokine', 'data management', 'diagnostic screening', 'drinking', 'eHealth', 'epidemiology study', 'fetal', 'forging', 'health care service', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'meetings', 'member', 'mobile computing', 'multidisciplinary', 'neurobehavioral', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'outreach', 'pre-clinical research', 'program dissemination', 'repository', 'resilience', 'screening', 'symposium', 'tool', 'web site']",NIAAA,SAN DIEGO STATE UNIVERSITY,U24,2017,401580,0.15664405541295742
"3/3 Alcohol Research Consortium in HIV – Intervention Research Arm (ARCH-IRA) Alcohol Use Disorders (AUDs) and hazardous drinking are the fourth leading cause of preventable death in the US and are responsible for 10% of all deaths among working age adults. Among Persons Living with HIV/AIDS (PLWH), heavy alcohol use is up to twice the rate in the general population. Few people engage in behavioral alcohol treatment and alcohol pharmacotherapies are not routinely used as part of alcohol treatment, despite the known efficacy of these interventions. PLWH engaged in treatment for their HIV disease have regular contact with a medical provider and are treated in a medical home model in which all medical services are delivered within HIV clinics, but few HIV providers feel comfortable treating AUDs. During our initial funding period, we implemented routine alcohol screening, developed a computerized brief intervention (CBI), and conducted provider training on alcohol pharmacotherapies. However, while we found a strong impact from routine screening with CBI for reducing alcohol use, few providers prescribed alcohol pharmacotherapy, despite this specialized training, with most indicating continued discomfort and lack of knowledge for use of pharmacotherapy. Algorithms are used routinely to guide providers in treatment selection for many different disorders that are not within their specialty such as diabetes management, obesity, arthritis, and other disorders. In addition, we tested the use of provider algorithms for the treatment of depression and smoking with PLWH and demonstrated increased utilization of these medications. For this renewal, we are proposing an implementation science test of using an algorithm that will build upon our success with CBI and integrate alcohol pharmacotherapies and other behavioral therapies within routine treatment. A decision-tree algorithm that provides more intensive treatments, including alcohol pharmacotherapies, that is also responsive to comorbidities such as depressive or anxiety symptoms will be tested in three HIV clinics across CFAR Network of Integrated Clinical Systems (CNICS). Primary outcomes include reduced alcohol consumption and frequency, improved HIV outcomes, and improvement in comorbid conditions. We will also examine provider, staff, patient, and clinic-level facilitators and barriers to implementation of this algorithm in routine clinical care. Successful implementation of this treatment approach would have considerable impact on reducing AUDs among PLWH and could be integrated within existing electronic health record systems for a sustainable model of alcohol treatment delivery to other HIV clinics. Hazardous alcohol use is the fourth leading cause of preventable death in the United States and is up to twice as high among PLWH. Algorithms have been developed to increase the efficacy of the treatment of chronic diseases with tremendous success but have never been empirically tested to aid in alcohol use disorders (AUDs).

"Multi-modal connectivity methods for the validation of Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder diagnostic criteria Project Summary: FASD is a serious public health crisis with 80,000 to 120,000 U.S. pregnancies per year at high risk. FASD diagnostic clinics are very sparse, difficult to sustain because of diagnostic complexity, unable to meet demand, and plagued by disagreement about diagnostic criteria. A recent comparison of five FASD diagnostic systems acknowledged that the lack of objective biomarkers for prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) contributes to disagreement in the field. The goal of the proposed work is to develop and refine neuroimaging methods capable of identifying subtle neurodevelopmental abnormalities in PAE. A critical component of this project will be to apply these refined neuroimaging “biomarkers” to examine the validity and performance of the most commonly-used FASD diagnostic criteria (alcohol exposure, dysmorphology, growth, and cognition). The proposed project will push the development of imaging methods and will also include an examination of the sensitivity and specificity of current diagnostic factors. The aims are: 1) perform a comprehensive characterization of the FASD “connectome” using state-of- the-art Human Connectome Project (HCP) methods in children with PAE, 2) evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of FASD diagnostic criteria to provide objective evaluation of FASD criteria (which remain in flux), 3) characterize relationships between connectomics and cognitive functioning, & 4) examine the developmental course of functional connectivity, white matter connectivity, cortical gyrification, and intra-cortical myelin. Participants will undergo longitudinal re-assessment at 15-months to match the new HCP-development paradigm (HCP-D) to allow for comparison to a large normative dataset being collected in Minnesota as part of the HCP-D project. We will capitalize on the developments spawned from the $40 million HCP and will benefit from evaluating the brains of children with PAE against the backdrop of a very large HCP normative dataset (n=1300). The proposed study will examine 45 participants with PAE and 45 matched controls, ages 8-16, all of whom will be evaluated by the CIFASD dysmorphology project. Participants will undergo MRI scans at the University of Minnesota's Center for Magnetic Resonance Research (CMRR) at baseline and again 15 months later. The imaging protocol, which contains very high resolution structural, diffusion- weighted, and fMRI scans will evaluate cortical gyrification, intra-cortical myelin, white matter connectivity, and functional connectivity. Data from the HCP-D project will be used as secondary “normative” comparison dataset. We expect to find a number of subtle neurodevelopmental abnormalities in PAE that have not previously been observed and we will characterize individuals with these metrics. Individual identification of neurodevelopmental anomalies will then allow us to probe the screening properties of commonly used FASD diagnostic criteria and to test the performance of Dr. Mattson's Decision Tree model for rapidly identifying children with developmental effects of PAE. The study will have direct implications for FASD clinical practice and public policies as it will provide objective data about the relative advantages and disadvantages of individual diagnostic elements and it will allow for comparisons of competing FASD diagnostic systems. The proposed project aims to use the most advanced MRI brain imaging techniques available to address a highly practical problem faced by clinicians and public health officials: the lack of consensus about diagnostic criteria for Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD) and the challenges of identifying individuals who are affected by prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) but do not have the physical characteristics upon which a diagnosis can be made. The proposed study will identify subtle brain anomalies in children with PAE with a level of sensitivity not previously attainable. The study will push forward our understanding of how PAE negatively affects the efficiency of the brain's networks. In addition, the study will use these brain imaging results to further refine the diagnostic criteria such that more children will be able to be properly identified as having a neurodevelopmental disorder as a result of PAE.",Multi-modal connectivity methods for the validation of Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder diagnostic criteria,9390704,U01AA026102,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Animals', 'Attention', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Categories', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Consensus', 'Control Groups', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Trees', 'Development', 'Developmental Course', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Factor', 'Disadvantaged', 'Dysmorphology', 'Elements', 'Evaluation', 'Executive Dysfunction', 'Face', 'Fetal Alcohol Exposure', 'Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder', 'Fetal alcohol effects', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'MRI Scans', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Minnesota', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Myelin', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neurodevelopmental Impairment', 'Neurosciences', 'Participant', 'Performance', 'Predictive Value', 'Pregnancy', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Proxy', 'Psychometrics', 'Public Health', 'Public Policy', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Resource Sharing', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Site', 'Structural defect', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Work', 'alcohol exposure', 'clinical diagnostics', 'clinical practice', 'clinically relevant', 'cognitive function', 'connectome', 'diffusion weighted', 'executive function', 'functional MRI scan', 'high risk', 'imaging modality', 'longitudinal analysis', 'longitudinal dataset', 'multidisciplinary', 'negative affect', 'neurobehavioral disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroimaging marker', 'performance tests', 'prisma', 'processing speed', 'screening', 'white matter']",NIAAA,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,U01,2017,337918,0.08368520905072079
"A diagnostic plasma protein panel for alcohol abuse DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Alcohol abuse and alcoholism remain significant societal problems. Unfortunately, treatment for and monitoring of harmful alcohol consumption is hampered by the lack of a highly accurate diagnostic test of alcohol drinking behavior. Our long-term goal for this research project is to develop biomarkers of alcohol abuse for use in at- risk populations. In particular, we have identified highly sensitive and specific plasma protein biomarkers using a well-controlled nonhuman primate model of alcohol abuse. We propose, in this application to translate these findings from the nonhuman primate into potential diagnostic tools for monitoring alcohol abuse in humans. This will be undertaken in collaboration with three clinical sites around the world. Specifically, we will obtain de- identified clinical samples from he Coatesville Veterans Affairs Medical Center, the Yale University School of Medicine, and the Institute for Health and Welfare of Finland (Helsinki, Finland). Studies associated with this research program will be divided into two specific aims. Specific aim 1 will validate a novel plasma biomarker panel in recovering alcoholics. In this aim, our clinical collaborators (from Yale and the Coatesville VAMC) will provide anonymous, within-subject longitudinal samples from subjects undergoing withdrawal and early abstinence (21 to 28 days) from abusive drinking as well as from the general population. These well-annotated samples will be used to refine the list of 27 biomarkers to identify the set that is most diagnostic of the human drinking phenotype and withdrawal/ abstinence. These experiments will employ a multiplex quantitative solution-phase immunoassay designed for human analytes (Myriad RBM DiscoveryMAP v1.0). As with all biomarker discovery projects, our primary emphasis will be on identifying a plasma protein analyte panel with high sensitivity and specificity. Specific aim 2 will then refine the plasma biomarker panel to permit diagnosis of hazardous drinking in a cross-sectional population from multiple sites. Within- subject assessment of drinking behavior (Aim #1) is much easier because the test does not compare differing baseline physiologies. Requirements for general population screening are much more stringent and will be assessed in samples from three independent sites (Yale University, Coatesville PA Veterans Administration Medical Center and the Finland National Institute for Health and Welfare). These sites provide a rich number of samples and drinking behaviors from which to draw experimental cohorts. In summary, we believe this work is innovative in that it capitalizes on new concepts in biomarker development through the identification of novel targets. The specific aims will build on preceding successes in the nonhuman primate model by characterization of human samples. All of the proposed studies will involve correlation with normal clinical and psychosocial assessments of alcohol consumption (AUDIT self-reports;  percentCDT, AST/ALT, GGT, etc.). In addition, because we are not using unitary biomarker measures, we will apply sophisticated biostatistical approaches (random forest, support vector machine, principle component analysis) to the data analysis. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: A shortcoming of current approaches to diagnosing and treating alcohol abuse and alcoholism is that we have no reliable, objective clinical markers of drinking behavior. We have identified and patented a panel of plasma proteins that accurately classify alcohol consumption levels in non-human primates and have also identified alcohol-induced changes in the plasma proteome common to both non-human primates and humans in a published pilot clinical study. The proposed project will translate these important findings into a refined human diagnostic in collaboration with an FDA-approved clinical partner (Myriad RBM). Therefore, these studies provide an opportunity to have a dramatic and immediate impact on our ability to address the unmet medical needs of alcohol abuse and alcoholism.",A diagnostic plasma protein panel for alcohol abuse,9035335,R01AA021661,"['Abstinence', 'Address', 'Admission activity', 'Alcohol abuse', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcoholism', 'Alcohols', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Markers', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Markers', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical assessments', 'Collaborations', 'Data Analyses', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'FDA approved', 'Finland', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heavy Drinking', 'Human', 'Immunoassay', 'Institutes', 'Kinetics', 'Laboratories', 'Legal patent', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physiology', 'Pilot Projects', 'Plasma', 'Plasma Proteins', 'Population', 'Populations at Risk', 'Predictive Value', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Proteomics', 'Psychosocial Assessment and Care', 'Publishing', 'Questionnaires', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recovery', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Series', 'Site', 'Social Welfare', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Translating', 'Typology', 'United States Department of Veterans Affairs', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Veterans', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Withdrawal', 'Work', 'alcohol research', 'biomarker development', 'biomarker discovery', 'biomarker panel', 'clinical research site', 'cohort', 'comparative', 'design', 'drinking', 'drinking behavior', 'forest', 'hazardous drinking', 'innovation', 'medical schools', 'named group', 'nonhuman primate', 'novel', 'problem drinker', 'programs', 'protein biomarkers', 'research study', 'screening', 'success', 'tool']",NIAAA,PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIV HERSHEY MED CTR,R01,2016,344250,0.13147888746531564
"How Cannabis Use Affects Alcohol Treatment Outcomes DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): ""How cannabis use affects alcohol treatment outcomes"" Introduction: While some suggest that cannabis use is related to increase drinking among individuals with alcohol use disorders (AUD), others have found that cannabis may substitute for alcohol and therefore reduce alcohol consumption among these individuals. However, no study has prospectively examined whether cannabis use is associated with increases or decreases in alcohol use in individuals in treatment for AUD. Primary aims: The primary aims of this study are to examine the effects of changes in cannabis use (i.e., increased vs. decreased use) during AUD treatment on post-treatment (immediately after treatment; one year, three years post-treatment) alcohol use and related problems. We will also investigate potential moderators (e.g., baseline dependence severity, social support) and mediators (e.g., alcohol cravings) of the relationship between cannabis use and AUD treatment outcomes. Preliminary analyses will also examine differences between those who use vs. do not use cannabis. Design: The proposed study is a secondary analysis of the two largest AUD treatment studies undertaken in the United States: the COMBINE Study and Project MATCH. Methods: Our sample consists of individuals with AUD who use cannabis but are not polysubstance dependent. Analyses will employ novel, highly sophisticated statistical methods, including Targeted Maximum Likelihood Estimation (TMLE) and Super Learner. TMLE and Super Learner use machine-learning and cross-validation to control for confounding and reduce bias; these features are particularly important because we are not able to randomize the cannabis use exposure and must control for selection factors. Hypotheses: We hypothesize that increased cannabis use during AUD treatment predicts increased drinking and related problems post- treatment compared to decreased cannabis use. We further hypothesize that high baseline alcohol use severity and low baseline social support worsen the negative effects of cannabis use on alcohol outcomes. Finally, we hypothesize that the effects of cannabis on alcohol use are mediated by increases in alcohol cravings. Innovation: This study will be the first to 1) quantify the long-term effects of cannabis use among individuals in treatment for AUD; 2) examine moderators of the effects of cannabis use on alcohol-related outcomes in individuals in treatment for AUD; and 3) assess mechanisms by which cannabis use affects alcohol-related outcomes in these individuals. Results will inform the clinical ambiguity regarding cannabis use and treatment for AUD, which is particularly timely given that the recent decriminalization of cannabis in several US states may increase the frequency or severity of cannabis use in this population. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This study uses advanced statistical methods to better understand how cannabis use among individuals recovering from alcohol use disorders affects drinking after treatment. Results will help alcohol treatment providers better understand the risks associated with cannabis use for people of varying demographics and substance use histories.",How Cannabis Use Affects Alcohol Treatment Outcomes,9136032,R21AA023039,"['Affect', 'Aftercare', 'Alcohol abuse', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohol dependence', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Alcohols', 'Anxiety', 'Behavioral', 'Caffeine', 'Cannabis', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Demographic Factors', 'Dependence', 'Documentation', 'Drug usage', 'Education', 'Employment', 'Epidemiology', 'Frequencies', 'Gender', 'Geographic state', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Heavy Drinking', 'Individual', 'Light', 'Long-Term Effects', 'Machine Learning', 'Marijuana', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Medical', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nicotine', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiological', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Qualifying', 'Quality of life', 'Randomized', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recovery', 'Reporting', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Severities', 'Social support', 'Staging', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statutes and Laws', 'Subgroup', 'Time', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States', 'Validation', 'alcohol abuse therapy', 'alcohol craving', 'alcohol related consequences', 'alcohol use disorder', 'anxiety symptoms', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'craving', 'demographics', 'design', 'drinking', 'functional outcomes', 'improved', 'innovation', 'marijuana decriminalization', 'marijuana use', 'marijuana user', 'novel', 'policy implication', 'psychosocial', 'trend']",NIAAA,PUBLIC HEALTH INSTITUTE,R21,2016,186326,0.17934174655478738
"Mediators and Moderators of a Neighborhood Experiment on Alcohol Use ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Excessive drinking in adolescence disrupts healthy development and leads to adverse social, economic and health consequences later in life. Although existing research focuses primarily on individual-level causes, neighborhood context is increasingly recognized as an upstream determinant of alcohol use. Yet since most prior neighborhood research on health has not been experimental, it is potentially biased, and weakens the foundation for policy translation. Our study proposes a secondary analysis of newly-available data from a social experiment of voluntary neighborhood relocation using housing vouchers in 5 cities (the Moving to Opportunity, MTO, Study), to test whether, how, and why random assignment of an offer to move to a low- poverty neighborhood over a 15 year period influenced the alcohol use, excessive drinking, and alcohol dependence of adolescents and their mothers. We will complement existing data with additional neighborhood- level data to enrich the dataset and test multilevel hypotheses. MTO is the only available large-scale study that has randomly assigned families to receive different neighborhood housing contexts, to support strong causal inferences of how early-life neighborhood context shapes alcohol use. When launched, MTO was one of the most promising policies to reverse the damaging effects of neighborhood poverty for minority families. But health researchers have had limited access to MTO data, compromising the scientific payoff of the $70+ million investment. Since residential mobility experiments like MTO are rare, expensive, and since MTO profoundly affected substance use, it is crucial to probe its effects. We propose new secondary data analyses with newly available 15 year follow-up data from this RCT, using novel methods to test mediation and moderation, applied to alcohol outcome measures that have not been examined prior. We apply innovative methods for assessing mediation (i.e., weight-based causal methods) and effect modification (i.e., machine learning techniques). Aside from the RCT design for strong causal inference of how early-life neighborhood changes influence excessive drinking, we also leverage one of the few longitudinal intervention designs sampling both mothers and their children, to illuminate familial transmission of drinking as it emerges in adolescence. Our R21 project builds on a productive, interdisciplinary team, experienced with the MTO study, and proposes 3 aims: to test how moving to a low-poverty neighborhood in the MTO experiment influenced excessive drinking and alcohol dependence; to examine if the MTO experimental effect on excessive drinking and alcohol dependence was less beneficial for more vulnerable families; to test whether effects of moving to a low-poverty neighborhood in MTO for excessive drinking and alcohol dependence were mediated by individual-level stress; family-level context; or neighborhood-level stress, alcohol availability, or alcohol norms. The results will enrich our understanding of neighborhood and family context as a cause of excessive drinking and alcohol use in adolescents and adults, and inform the next generation of alcohol prevention policy.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    This project will test mediation and moderation of a social experiment of housing and neighborhood relocation on alcohol use, excessive drinking, and alcohol dependence, among adolescents and their mothers, to probe whether, why, and among whom neighborhood context earlier in life is a cause of alcohol use across 15 years. This knowledge will inform the next generation of alcohol prevention policies. Because of its experimental design, results will inform causal pathways and potential intervention points, including during childhood, by which to reduce the population burden of alcohol use.                ",Mediators and Moderators of a Neighborhood Experiment on Alcohol Use,9015709,R21AA024530,"['Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Adverse effects', 'Affect', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohol dependence', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Alcohols', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Cities', 'Complement', 'Crime', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Compromising', 'Data Set', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Exhibits', 'Experimental Designs', 'Exposure to', 'Family', 'Female', 'Female Adolescents', 'Foundations', 'Fright', 'Health', 'Heavy Drinking', 'Household Heads', 'Housing', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Investments', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Low income', 'Machine Learning', 'Male Adolescents', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Mothers', 'Neighborhoods', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Poverty', 'Randomized', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Residential Mobility', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'Sampling', 'Shapes', 'Son', 'Stress', 'Subgroup', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Translations', 'Victimization', 'Weight', 'Work', 'Youth', 'alcohol availability', 'alcohol prevention', 'base', 'boys', 'contextual factors', 'density of AOD outlets', 'design', 'drinking', 'excessive drinking in adolescence', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'girls', 'health economics', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'low socioeconomic status', 'next generation', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'social', 'therapy design', 'transmission process', 'underage drinking', 'volunteer', 'voucher']",NIAAA,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,R21,2016,233407,0.20985426182458147

"Big data analytics for the evaluation of whole genome sequence and transcriptome data in alcohol research PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Large-scale U.S. epidemiological studies demonstrate that alcohol use disorders are highly prevalent, highly co-morbid with other psychiatric disorders, disabling, and often go untreated. Compared with other U.S. ethnic groups, Native Americans have the highest rates of alcohol and other drug dependence, and it is associated with particularly significant disability and mortality. Thus studies that identify specific genetic risk factors for alcohol use disorders in the general U.S. population, and especially in Native Americans, are of high public health importance. Alcohol use disorders are complex genetic diseases sensitive to environmental conditions that require complex data strategies to uncover the underlying risk factors. Although recent years have seen significant advancement in our understanding in the biology and genetics of the disorders, exactly how these factors interact in an individual to confer risk or protection from alcohol use disorders is still unclear. Further, the genetic factors identified in the human genome thus far by conventional methods appear to only explain a very small fraction of the overall heritability for the disorders.  The overall objective of this research program is to identify the complex genetic and genomic factors that affect susceptibility to alcohol use disorders and related comorbidities through novel and innovative quantitative methods and big data analytics. The proposed study will utilize whole-genome sequence (WGS) data from a unique high-risk Native American population and a European American population along with gene expression data of alcoholic human brains. The project will develop methodology to analyze WGS data with unique relevance to alcohol research. Selected multivariate, graphical, and dimension-reduction modeling tools will be used in combination with mixed models suitable for genomic data with both population and family structures to dissect polygenic basis for alcohol use disorders and shared genetic risk factors for alcohol use disorders and comorbid disorders. Mixture models and clustering methods will be employed to uncover heterogeneous genetic influences. Differential genetic effects at various levels of heterogeneity will be tested with rigorous statistical methods. The project will identify population and ancestry-specific genetic risk factors and shared risk factors across populations and determine their differential influences on susceptibility to alcohol use disorders. Endophenotypes will also be investigated to help identify unique risk factors for alcohol use disorder traits. The project will further identify alcohol- and addiction-relevant pathways and networks that are differentially expressed in alcoholic brains, and establish directions of causations by combining gene expression data with WGS data, and applying instrumental variable approaches. Finally, an integrated system approach will be taken by further leveraging epigenomic maps and annotation databases in the public domain to build predictive and potentially causal models aimed at more “personalized” prevention and intervention for alcohol use disorders in specific high-risk groups and individuals. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Alcohol use disorders are prevalent, frequently co-occur with other psychiatric disorders, are disabling and often go untreated. Identifying specific genetic risk factors for alcohol use disorders in the general U.S. population, and especially in high risk ethnic groups such as Native Americans, will lead to more personalized thus more effective prevention and intervention for alcoholism in these populations.",Big data analytics for the evaluation of whole genome sequence and transcriptome data in alcohol research,9161317,K25AA025095,"['Accounting', 'Affect', 'Alcohol dependence', 'Alcoholism', 'American', 'Autopsy', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Big Data', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Communities', 'Comorbidity', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Drug Addiction', 'Epidemiologic Studies', 'Ethnic group', 'Etiology', 'European', 'Evaluation', 'Family Study', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Hereditary Disease', 'Heritability', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mental disorders', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Native Americans', 'New South Wales', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Domains', 'Public Health', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Randomized', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'San Francisco', 'Siblings', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'System', 'Testing', 'Variant', 'alcohol and other drug', 'alcohol research', 'alcohol use disorder', 'base', 'causal model', 'cohort', 'differential expression', 'disability', 'endophenotype', 'epigenomics', 'family structure', 'genetic risk factor', 'genome sequencing', 'genome wide association study', 'genomic data', 'high risk', 'individualized prevention', 'innovation', 'mortality', 'non-alcoholic', 'novel', 'pleiotropism', 'predictive modeling', 'problem drinker', 'programs', 'risk sharing', 'statistics', 'tissue resource', 'tool', 'trait', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptomics', 'whole genome']",NIAAA,SCRIPPS RESEARCH INSTITUTE,K25,2016,161460,0.14100521124354576
"The TEEN Study: The Impact of Adolescent Drinking on Connectivity in the Brain DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application describes the contribution of the OHSU site to the data collection efforts of the consortium entitled, Tracking Ethanol's Effects on Neurodevelopment (TEEN), and the specific focus of the OHSU site on examining how alcohol impacts functional connectivity in the developing brain and whether connectivity patterns can be used to predict risk for alcoholism. It is well-established that adolescence is a time of dramatic maturation in the brain, paralleled by improvements in executive abilities, social functioning, and emotional regulation. More recently, it has become appreciated that functional network dynamics of the brain, subserving these improvements, also dramatically change over the adolescent years. This period of heightened plasticity coincides with greater vulnerability to neurotoxic alcohol effects, such that heavy alcohol exposure during adolescence may result in disruption to normally occurring maturation of neural circuitry. To examine this question, the approach of the TEEN consortium will be to disproportionately recruit individuals who are at elevated risk for alcohol use, based on personality features. This approach was chosen to ensure sufficient numbers of individuals who will transition from no use to use within the duration of this project, and also ensures sufficient numbers of individuals who are already drinking thereby enabling cross-sectional comparisons to complement the longitudinal studies. Using a sequential cohort design, the TEEN consortium will recruit 750 youth, stratified across three age-ranges: 12-15 years, 15-18 years, and 18-21 years, with each site recruiting and following 150 youth. A standardized set of neuroimaging, cognitive, and clinical assessments will be included and administered at baseline and at three one-year follow-ups. The major aims of the OHSU site proposal are toward understanding the influence of alcohol on adolescent brain circuitry and at delineating risk-related abnormalities in developing adolescent brain networks using multi-modal integration. Understanding the neural phenotypes associated with increased risk for alcoholism and the potentially deleterious impact of alcohol on the neural connections in the adolescent brain could aid in the development of targeted strategies aimed at reducing adolescent alcohol drinking behaviors.

"Sex Differences in Alcohol-Related Neurotoxicity During Adolescence ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Adolescence is a time of dramatic development, much of which varies as a function of sex. Also during this time, alcohol use becomes very common. Likely due to heightened plasticity, the adolescent brain is particularly susceptible to the neurotoxic effects of alcohol. While studies have separately documented cross- sectional sex differences in the effects of alcohol on the adolescent brain and hormonal influences on normative adolescent brain development, to fully understand sex-specific adolescent risk and resilience for alcoholism, multimodal prospective longitudinal studies are crucial. To that end, during this funding period, we will assess an additional 120 healthy non-alcohol/drug using 14-16-year-old youth using functional neuroimaging during working memory and decision making, resting state functional neuroimaging, diffusion tensor imaging, neurocognitive assessment, mood/behavior/personality assessment, and serum hormone assays. Together with over 200 youth assessed during the first funding period of the project, all youth will be quarterly monitore for changes in alcohol/drug use, and youth who emerge into heavy alcohol use (as well as a matched non-using control) will be re-assessed at two time points following initiation of heavy drinking behavior. Using a multi-modal longitudinal design, we aim to better understand sex-specific effects of heavy alcohol use on adolescent brain functioning and connectivity, as well as identify premorbid sex-specific neurobiological risk phenotypes that are predictive of problem drinking during adolescence and young adulthood. Further, we will explore moderating variables, such timing and frequency of alcohol and other drug use, as well as the role of gonadal steroids on sex-specific developmental trajectories. Disentangling sex- specific risk for and consequences of alcohol use during adolescence, in relation to normative brain development, and determining which effects may be hormonally influenced, will move the field closer to more personalized prevention and intervention strategies aimed at male and female youth.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The present study seeks to longitudinally examine sex-specific alcohol effects on the adolescent brain and identify sex-specific neurobiological risk markers that are predictive of high levels of drinking during adolescence and young adulthood. Understanding sex-specific risk for and consequences of alcohol use during adolescence is a crucial step toward developing more informed prevention and treatment strategies.                ",Sex Differences in Alcohol-Related Neurotoxicity During Adolescence,9056323,R01AA017664,"['16 year old', 'Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Alcohol abuse', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcoholism', 'Alcohols', 'Anisotropy', 'Appetitive Behavior', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Assay', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data Collection', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Drug usage', 'Emotional', 'Estradiol', 'Exhibits', 'Female', 'Fiber', 'Financial compensation', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Glare', 'Gonadal Steroid Hormones', 'Heavy Drinking', 'Hormonal', 'Hormones', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Mediating', 'Modeling', 'Moods', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurocognitive', 'Parietal', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Personality', 'Personality Assessment', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Prevention strategy', 'Process', 'Prospective Studies', 'Reporting', 'Rest', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Risk Marker', 'Role', 'Serum', 'Sex Characteristics', 'Sex Functioning', 'Shapes', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Testosterone', 'Time', 'Youth', 'adolescent brain development', 'alcohol and other drug', 'alcohol consequences', 'alcohol effect', 'base', 'binge drinking', 'brain behavior', 'cognitive change', 'cohort', 'drinking', 'drinking behavior', 'heavy drinking during adolescence', 'improved', 'individualized prevention', 'longitudinal design', 'male', 'neuroimaging', 'neurotoxic', 'neurotoxicity', 'personalized intervention', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'resilience', 'response', 'sex', 'treatment strategy', 'underage drinking', 'young adult']",NIAAA,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,R01,2016,441285,0.1843430899563411
"Consequences of Adolescent Alcohol Use on Brain Development DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This revised R01 A1 proposal (AA022493), ""Consequences of Adolescent Alcohol Use on Brain Development"", responds to the need to understand the impact of initiating alcohol consumption on adolescent brain maturation. We have teamed with the Center for Adolescent Substance Abuse Research (CeASAR) and Boston Children's Hospital to implement an innovative strategy that combines multiple neuroimaging and neuropsychological approaches to identify neurodevelopmental vulnerabilities associated with early and escalating alcohol use during adolescence. Adolescents will be recruited from general pediatrician offices and adolescent medicine clinics comprising the New England Partnership for Substance Abuse Research (NEPSAR), a practice-based research network of primary care offices. Adolescents will be enrolled into the study prior to the initiation of alcoho use or other drug use, and examined longitudinally, at baseline (13-14 yrs old) and again at two annual follow-up visits. To provide a comprehensive longitudinal profile of brain function, structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), and task and resting state blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) will be paired with magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) to measure GABA and glutamate levels in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and medial temporal lobe (MTL, containing hippocampus). In addition, arterial spin labeling (ASL) will be used to measure quantitative perfusion, which will be used to calibrate the magnitude of BOLD fMRI signal changes during response inhibition and spatial memory fMRI tasks. Magnetic resonance measures will be integrated with measures from clinical assessments and an extensive neuropsychological battery, designed to detect and further characterize developmental changes and the influence of adolescent alcohol use. The incorporation of complementary multi-modal measures of brain function and neuroplasticity could offer valuable insight into the dynamic processes of brain maturation and help identify neural signatures associated with the onset and escalation of alcohol use, which will provide a foundation for informing prevention and intervention efforts aimed at reducing adolescent alcohol consumption. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This longitudinal, multi-modal study of adolescents during the critical period of brain maturation, and during a time that overlaps with the onset of alcohol initiation, will help elucidate milestones of healthy adolescent brain development and identify neural signatures associated with the onset and escalation of alcohol use.",Consequences of Adolescent Alcohol Use on Brain Development,9064026,R01AA022493,"['Adolescent', 'Adolescent Medicine', 'Age', 'Age of Onset', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Anisotropy', 'Anterior', 'Behavior assessment', 'Boston', 'Brain', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical assessments', 'Cognitive', 'Core-Binding Factor', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Drug usage', 'Enrollment', 'Failure', 'Female', 'Female Adolescents', 'Foundations', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Glutamates', 'Health', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Hyperactive behavior', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Male Adolescents', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Mediating', 'Memory', 'Modeling', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Neuronal Plasticity', 'New England', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Performance', 'Perfusion', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Primary Health Care', 'Process', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Spin Labels', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Task Performances', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Time', 'Visit', 'adolescent alcohol', 'adolescent brain development', 'adolescent substance abuse', 'age related', 'alcohol and other drug', 'alcohol use initiation', 'base', 'blood oxygen level dependent', 'cingulate cortex', 'critical period', 'design', 'early alcohol use', 'follow-up', 'gamma-Aminobutyric Acid', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'male', 'myelination', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropsychological', 'pediatrician', 'practice-based research network', 'reduce adolescent alcohol', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sex', 'spatial memory', 'underage drinking', 'way finding', 'white matter']",NIAAA,MCLEAN HOSPITAL,R01,2016,561937,0.1309373825214733
"3/3 Alcohol Research Consortium in HIV – Intervention Research Arm (ARCH-IRA) Alcohol Use Disorders (AUDs) and hazardous drinking are the fourth leading cause of preventable death in the US and are responsible for 10% of all deaths among working age adults. Among Persons Living with HIV/AIDS (PLWH), heavy alcohol use is up to twice the rate in the general population. Few people engage in behavioral alcohol treatment and alcohol pharmacotherapies are not routinely used as part of alcohol treatment, despite the known efficacy of these interventions. PLWH engaged in treatment for their HIV disease have regular contact with a medical provider and are treated in a medical home model in which all medical services are delivered within HIV clinics, but few HIV providers feel comfortable treating AUDs. During our initial funding period, we implemented routine alcohol screening, developed a computerized brief intervention (CBI), and conducted provider training on alcohol pharmacotherapies. However, while we found a strong impact from routine screening with CBI for reducing alcohol use, few providers prescribed alcohol pharmacotherapy, despite this specialized training, with most indicating continued discomfort and lack of knowledge for use of pharmacotherapy. Algorithms are used routinely to guide providers in treatment selection for many different disorders that are not within their specialty such as diabetes management, obesity, arthritis, and other disorders. In addition, we tested the use of provider algorithms for the treatment of depression and smoking with PLWH and demonstrated increased utilization of these medications. For this renewal, we are proposing an implementation science test of using an algorithm that will build upon our success with CBI and integrate alcohol pharmacotherapies and other behavioral therapies within routine treatment. A decision-tree algorithm that provides more intensive treatments, including alcohol pharmacotherapies, that is also responsive to comorbidities such as depressive or anxiety symptoms will be tested in three HIV clinics across CFAR Network of Integrated Clinical Systems (CNICS). Primary outcomes include reduced alcohol consumption and frequency, improved HIV outcomes, and improvement in comorbid conditions. We will also examine provider, staff, patient, and clinic-level facilitators and barriers to implementation of this algorithm in routine clinical care. Successful implementation of this treatment approach would have considerable impact on reducing AUDs among PLWH and could be integrated within existing electronic health record systems for a sustainable model of alcohol treatment delivery to other HIV clinics. Hazardous alcohol use is the fourth leading cause of preventable death in the United States and is up to twice as high among PLWH. Algorithms have been developed to increase the efficacy of the treatment of chronic diseases with tremendous success but have never been empirically tested to aid in alcohol use disorders (AUDs). We propose to test an algorithm developed to aid providers in selecting behavioral and pharmacotherapy for the treatment of AUDs for PLWH engaged in care.",3/3 Alcohol Research Consortium in HIV – Intervention Research Arm (ARCH-IRA),9205450,U01AA020802,"['AIDS/HIV problem', 'Achievement', 'Adherence', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Alcohol abuse', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohols', 'Algorithms', 'Anxiety', 'Appointment', 'Area', 'Arthritis', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinic', 'Clinic Visits', 'Clinical', 'Comorbidity', 'Computers', 'Counseling', 'Decision Trees', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Drug Use Disorder', 'Drug usage', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Electronics', 'Eligibility Determination', 'Enrollment', 'Evidence based treatment', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'General Population', 'HIV', 'Heavy Drinking', 'Hepatitis C virus', 'Home environment', 'Hypertension', 'Incentives', 'Individual', 'Intervention Studies', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Maintenance', 'Medical', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Outcomes Assessments', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Population', 'Primary Health Care', 'Provider', 'Recurrence', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Resources', 'Risk Factors', 'Selection for Treatments', 'Services', 'Severities', 'Site', 'Smoking', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Visit', 'Work', 'alcohol abuse therapy', 'alcohol misuse', 'alcohol research', 'alcohol screening', 'alcohol services', 'alcohol use disorder', 'anxiety symptoms', 'arm', 'base', 'binge drinking', 'brief alcohol intervention', 'brief intervention', 'clinical care', 'computerized', 'consumption measures', 'depressive symptoms', 'diabetes management', 'drinking', 'evidence base', 'hazardous drinking', 'implementation research', 'implementation science', 'improved', 'medical specialties', 'modifiable risk', 'mortality', 'motivational enhancement therapy', 'novel', 'primary outcome', 'reduced alcohol use', 'screening', 'smoking cessation', 'success', 'transmission process', 'treatment effect', 'treatment response', 'treatment strategy']",NIAAA,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,U01,2016,396390,0.15589576624188314
"A diagnostic plasma protein panel for alcohol abuse DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Alcohol abuse and alcoholism remain significant societal problems. Unfortunately, treatment for and monitoring of harmful alcohol consumption is hampered by the lack of a highly accurate diagnostic test of alcohol drinking behavior. Our long-term goal for this research project is to develop biomarkers of alcohol abuse for use in at- risk populations. In particular, we have identified highly sensitive and specific plasma protein biomarkers using a well-controlled nonhuman primate model of alcohol abuse. We propose, in this application to translate these findings from the nonhuman primate into potential diagnostic tools for monitoring alcohol abuse in humans. This will be undertaken in collaboration with three clinical sites around the world. Specifically, we will obtain de- identified clinical samples from he Coatesville Veterans Affairs Medical Center, the Yale University School of Medicine, and the Institute for Health and Welfare of Finland (Helsinki, Finland). Studies associated with this research program will be divided into two specific aims. Specific aim 1 will validate a novel plasma biomarker panel in recovering alcoholics. In this aim, our clinical collaborators (from Yale and the Coatesville VAMC) will provide anonymous, within-subject longitudinal samples from subjects undergoing withdrawal and early abstinence (21 to 28 days) from abusive drinking as well as from the general population. These well-annotated samples will be used to refine the list of 27 biomarkers to identify the set that is most diagnostic of the human drinking phenotype and withdrawal/ abstinence. These experiments will employ a multiplex quantitative solution-phase immunoassay designed for human analytes (Myriad RBM DiscoveryMAP v1.0). As with all biomarker discovery projects, our primary emphasis will be on identifying a plasma protein analyte panel with high sensitivity and specificity. Specific aim 2 will then refine the plasma biomarker panel to permit diagnosis of hazardous drinking in a cross-sectional population from multiple sites. Within- subject assessment of drinking behavior (Aim #1) is much easier because the test does not compare differing baseline physiologies. Requirements for general population screening are much more stringent and will be assessed in samples from three independent sites (Yale University, Coatesville PA Veterans Administration Medical Center and the Finland National Institute for Health and Welfare). These sites provide a rich number of samples and drinking behaviors from which to draw experimental cohorts. In summary, we believe this work is innovative in that it capitalizes on new concepts in biomarker development through the identification of novel targets. The specific aims will build on preceding successes in the nonhuman primate model by characterization of human samples. All of the proposed studies will involve correlation with normal clinical and psychosocial assessments of alcohol consumption (AUDIT self-reports;  percentCDT, AST/ALT, GGT, etc.). In addition, because we are not using unitary biomarker measures, we will apply sophisticated biostatistical approaches (random forest, support vector machine, principle component analysis) to the data analysis. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: A shortcoming of current approaches to diagnosing and treating alcohol abuse and alcoholism is that we have no reliable, objective clinical markers of drinking behavior. We have identified and patented a panel of plasma proteins that accurately classify alcohol consumption levels in non-human primates and have also identified alcohol-induced changes in the plasma proteome common to both non-human primates and humans in a published pilot clinical study. The proposed project will translate these important findings into a refined human diagnostic in collaboration with an FDA-approved clinical partner (Myriad RBM). Therefore, these studies provide an opportunity to have a dramatic and immediate impact on our ability to address the unmet medical needs of alcohol abuse and alcoholism.",A diagnostic plasma protein panel for alcohol abuse,8867957,R01AA021661,"['Abstinence', 'Address', 'Admission activity', 'Alcohol abuse', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcoholism', 'Alcohols', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Markers', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Markers', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical assessments', 'Collaborations', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'FDA approved', 'Finland', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heavy Drinking', 'Human', 'Immunoassay', 'Institutes', 'Kinetics', 'Laboratories', 'Legal patent', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physiology', 'Pilot Projects', 'Plasma', 'Plasma Proteins', 'Population', 'Populations at Risk', 'Predictive Value', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Proteomics', 'Psychosocial Assessment and Care', 'Publishing', 'Questionnaires', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recovery', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Series', 'Site', 'Social Welfare', 'Solutions', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Translating', 'Typology', 'United States Department of Veterans Affairs', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Veterans', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Withdrawal', 'Work', 'alcohol research', 'clinical research site', 'cohort', 'comparative', 'design', 'drinking', 'drinking behavior', 'forest', 'hazardous drinking', 'innovation', 'medical schools', 'named group', 'nonhuman primate', 'novel', 'problem drinker', 'programs', 'research study', 'screening', 'success', 'tool']",NIAAA,PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIV HERSHEY MED CTR,R01,2015,333922,0.13147888746531564
"How Cannabis Use Affects Alcohol Treatment Outcomes     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): ""How cannabis use affects alcohol treatment outcomes"" Introduction: While some suggest that cannabis use is related to increase drinking among individuals with alcohol use disorders (AUD), others have found that cannabis may substitute for alcohol and therefore reduce alcohol consumption among these individuals. However, no study has prospectively examined whether cannabis use is associated with increases or decreases in alcohol use in individuals in treatment for AUD. Primary aims: The primary aims of this study are to examine the effects of changes in cannabis use (i.e., increased vs. decreased use) during AUD treatment on post-treatment (immediately after treatment; one year, three years post-treatment) alcohol use and related problems. We will also investigate potential moderators (e.g., baseline dependence severity, social support) and mediators (e.g., alcohol cravings) of the relationship between cannabis use and AUD treatment outcomes. Preliminary analyses will also examine differences between those who use vs. do not use cannabis. Design: The proposed study is a secondary analysis of the two largest AUD treatment studies undertaken in the United States: the COMBINE Study and Project MATCH. Methods: Our sample consists of individuals with AUD who use cannabis but are not polysubstance dependent. Analyses will employ novel, highly sophisticated statistical methods, including Targeted Maximum Likelihood Estimation (TMLE) and Super Learner. TMLE and Super Learner use machine-learning and cross-validation to control for confounding and reduce bias; these features are particularly important because we are not able to randomize the cannabis use exposure and must control for selection factors. Hypotheses: We hypothesize that increased cannabis use during AUD treatment predicts increased drinking and related problems post- treatment compared to decreased cannabis use. We further hypothesize that high baseline alcohol use severity and low baseline social support worsen the negative effects of cannabis use on alcohol outcomes. Finally, we hypothesize that the effects of cannabis on alcohol use are mediated by increases in alcohol cravings. Innovation: This study will be the first to 1) quantify the long-term effects of cannabis use among individuals in treatment for AUD; 2) examine moderators of the effects of cannabis use on alcohol-related outcomes in individuals in treatment for AUD; and 3) assess mechanisms by which cannabis use affects alcohol-related outcomes in these individuals. Results will inform the clinical ambiguity regarding cannabis use and treatment for AUD, which is particularly timely given that the recent decriminalization of cannabis in several US states may increase the frequency or severity of cannabis use in this population.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This study uses advanced statistical methods to better understand how cannabis use among individuals recovering from alcohol use disorders affects drinking after treatment. Results will help alcohol treatment providers better understand the risks associated with cannabis use for people of varying demographics and substance use histories.                ",How Cannabis Use Affects Alcohol Treatment Outcomes,8822758,R21AA023039,"['Affect', 'Aftercare', 'Alcohol abuse', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohol dependence', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Alcohols', 'Anxiety', 'Behavioral', 'Caffeine', 'Cannabis', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Demographic Factors', 'Dependence', 'Documentation', 'Drug usage', 'Education', 'Employment', 'Epidemiology', 'Frequencies', 'Gender', 'Geographic state', 'Health Personnel', 'Heavy Drinking', 'Individual', 'Light', 'Long-Term Effects', 'Machine Learning', 'Marijuana', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Medical', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nicotine', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiological', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Qualifying', 'Quality of life', 'Randomized', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recovery', 'Reporting', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Severities', 'Social support', 'Staging', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statutes and Laws', 'Subgroup', 'Time', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States', 'Validation', 'alcohol abuse therapy', 'alcohol craving', 'alcohol related consequences', 'alcohol use disorder', 'anxiety symptoms', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'craving', 'demographics', 'design', 'drinking', 'functional outcomes', 'improved', 'innovation', 'marijuana decriminalization', 'marijuana use', 'marijuana user', 'novel', 'policy implication', 'psychosocial', 'public health relevance', 'trend']",NIAAA,PUBLIC HEALTH INSTITUTE,R21,2015,148642,0.17934174655478738

"The TEEN Study: The Impact of Adolescent Drinking on Connectivity in the Brain DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application describes the contribution of the OHSU site to the data collection efforts of the consortium entitled, Tracking Ethanol's Effects on Neurodevelopment (TEEN), and the specific focus of the OHSU site on examining how alcohol impacts functional connectivity in the developing brain and whether connectivity patterns can be used to predict risk for alcoholism. It is well-established that adolescence is a time of dramatic maturation in the brain, paralleled by improvements in executive abilities, social functioning, and emotional regulation. More recently, it has become appreciated that functional network dynamics of the brain, subserving these improvements, also dramatically change over the adolescent years. This period of heightened plasticity coincides with greater vulnerability to neurotoxic alcohol effects, such that heavy alcohol exposure during adolescence may result in disruption to normally occurring maturation of neural circuitry. To examine this question, the approach of the TEEN consortium will be to disproportionately recruit individuals who are at elevated risk for alcohol use, based on personality features. This approach was chosen to ensure sufficient numbers of individuals who will transition from no use to use within the duration of this project, and also ensures sufficient numbers of individuals who are already drinking thereby enabling cross-sectional comparisons to complement the longitudinal studies. Using a sequential cohort design, the TEEN consortium will recruit 750 youth, stratified across three age-ranges: 12-15 years, 15-18 years, and 18-21 years, with each site recruiting and following 150 youth. A standardized set of neuroimaging, cognitive, and clinical assessments will be included and administered at baseline and at three one-year follow-ups. The major aims of the OHSU site proposal are toward understanding the influence of alcohol on adolescent brain circuitry and at delineating risk-related abnormalities in developing adolescent brain networks using multi-modal integration. Understanding the neural phenotypes associated with increased risk for alcoholism and the potentially deleterious impact of alcohol on the neural connections in the adolescent brain could aid in the development of targeted strategies aimed at reducing adolescent alcohol drinking behaviors. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The present study seeks to investigate the effect of adolescent drinking on the functional connectivity of the brain and determine whether patterns of connectivity can predict risk for heavy alcohol consumption. Isolating the effects of alcohol use and identifying risk markers is necessary to develop specifically targeted prevention and intervention strategies for youth.",The TEEN Study: The Impact of Adolescent Drinking on Connectivity in the Brain,8868864,U01AA021691,"['Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Age', 'Alcohol abuse', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcoholism', 'Alcohols', 'Appetitive Behavior', 'Architecture', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical assessments', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Deltastab', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Ensure', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Exhibits', 'Family history of', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Graph', 'Health', 'Heavy Drinking', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Intervention', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Neurocognitive', 'Pattern', 'Personality', 'Phenotype', 'Prevention strategy', 'Property', 'Psychopathology', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Risk Marker', 'Role', 'Site', 'Social Behavior', 'Social Functioning', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Work', 'Youth', 'adolescent alcohol exposure', 'alcohol effect', 'base', 'brain circuitry', 'cognitive control', 'cohort', 'computerized data processing', 'density', 'design', 'drinking', 'drinking behavior', 'early onset', 'emotion regulation', 'emotional behavior', 'neural circuit', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuroimaging', 'neurotoxic', 'reduce adolescent alcohol', 'relating to nervous system', 'reward circuitry', 'segregation', 'theories', 'underage drinking']",NIAAA,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,U01,2015,542005,0.16912069031008944
"Microfluidics-Enabled High-Throughput Studies on Early Embryonic Development     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Prenatal alcohol exposure causes a range of developmental disorders that are commonly referred to as fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASDs). The most severe case of FASDs is known as fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) and is characterized by growth deficiencies, craniofacial malformations, and both structural and functional central nervous system (CNS) abnormalities. The combination of technological limitations that decrease experimental throughput and the inherent stochasticity of biological processes eliminate the ability to gain a quantitative understanding about the onset and progression of ethanol-related developmental disorders. As a result there is not much known mechanistically about how ethanol exposure manifests as FASDs. Here, we aim to develop a microfluidic-based system that enables high-throughput and high-content studies to elucidate the effects of ethanol exposure on embryogenesis. The model organism Drosophila melanogaster (Drosophila) has been shown to be a model of FASDs, because Drosophila exhibits similar phenotypical defects as humans when embryos are raised on ethanol solutions. It has yet to be seen how ethanol exposure affects developmental processes that occur during embryogenesis that lead to the wide ranging symptoms of FASDs. The technological gap that precedes this is a method that can robustly expose developing fly embryos to ethanol while also allowing high-throughput live imaging and data acquisition. The objective of this project is to develop enabling technologies for whole embryo imaging to uncover the mechanisms through which embryonic ethanol exposure affects morphogenesis and developmental patterning that ultimately lead to FASDs. In order to address the technological gap we are developing a microfluidic system that can culture and expose live Drosophila embryos to ethanol in a highly-parallelized manner. This system will also enable live imaging of embryogenesis, so that we can better understand how ethanol exposure affects morphogenesis. Furthermore, the microfluidic system will be integrated with tissue clearing techniques that will enable whole embryo imaging and thus allow us to visualize whole embryo gene expression patterns. In this study, we will study mutants of key enzymes to better elucidate their roles in FASD. Using this device, I aim to better our understanding about the physical and gene expression changes involved with FASDs. Microfluidic systems will be integrated with computer automation programs that will increase data acquisition rates. Data analysis will be streamlined through the development of computer vision algorithms that will help identify phenotypical changes associated with ethanol exposure that are non-obvious and likely to be missed by manual annotation. This project will not only enlarge the repertoire of tools available for developmental biology in general, but also will have significant impact on ethanol teratology.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The purpose of this project is to develop a high-throughput, microfluidics-based system for studying the physical and genetic origins of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASDs). The results of this project will greatly increase our understanding of how prenatal ethanol exposure affects early embryogenesis and elucidate the mechanism through which ethanol exposure results in a wide range of developmental defects.

"Consequences of Adolescent Alcohol Use on Brain Development DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This revised R01 A1 proposal (AA022493), ""Consequences of Adolescent Alcohol Use on Brain Development"", responds to the need to understand the impact of initiating alcohol consumption on adolescent brain maturation. We have teamed with the Center for Adolescent Substance Abuse Research (CeASAR) and Boston Children's Hospital to implement an innovative strategy that combines multiple neuroimaging and neuropsychological approaches to identify neurodevelopmental vulnerabilities associated with early and escalating alcohol use during adolescence. Adolescents will be recruited from general pediatrician offices and adolescent medicine clinics comprising the New England Partnership for Substance Abuse Research (NEPSAR), a practice-based research network of primary care offices. Adolescents will be enrolled into the study prior to the initiation of alcoho use or other drug use, and examined longitudinally, at baseline (13-14 yrs old) and again at two annual follow-up visits. To provide a comprehensive longitudinal profile of brain function, structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), and task and resting state blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) will be paired with magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) to measure GABA and glutamate levels in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and medial temporal lobe (MTL, containing hippocampus). In addition, arterial spin labeling (ASL) will be used to measure quantitative perfusion, which will be used to calibrate the magnitude of BOLD fMRI signal changes during response inhibition and spatial memory fMRI tasks. Magnetic resonance measures will be integrated with measures from clinical assessments and an extensive neuropsychological battery, designed to detect and further characterize developmental changes and the influence of adolescent alcohol use. The incorporation of complementary multi-modal measures of brain function and neuroplasticity could offer valuable insight into the dynamic processes of brain maturation and help identify neural signatures associated with the onset and escalation of alcohol use, which will provide a foundation for informing prevention and intervention efforts aimed at reducing adolescent alcohol consumption. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This longitudinal, multi-modal study of adolescents during the critical period of brain maturation, and during a time that overlaps with the onset of alcohol initiation, will help elucidate milestones of healthy adolescent brain development and identify neural signatures associated with the onset and escalation of alcohol use.",Consequences of Adolescent Alcohol Use on Brain Development,8921111,R01AA022493,"['Adolescent', 'Adolescent Medicine', 'Age', 'Age of Onset', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Anisotropy', 'Anterior', 'Behavior assessment', 'Boston', 'Brain', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical assessments', 'Cognitive', 'Core-Binding Factor', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Drug usage', 'Enrollment', 'Failure', 'Female', 'Female Adolescents', 'Foundations', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Glutamates', 'Health', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Hyperactive behavior', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Male Adolescents', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Mediating', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Neuronal Plasticity', 'New England', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Performance', 'Perfusion', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Primary Health Care', 'Process', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Spin Labels', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Task Performances', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Time', 'Visit', 'adolescent alcohol', 'adolescent brain development', 'adolescent substance abuse', 'age related', 'alcohol and other drug', 'alcohol use initiation', 'base', 'blood oxygen level dependent', 'cingulate cortex', 'critical period', 'design', 'early alcohol use', 'follow-up', 'gamma-Aminobutyric Acid', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'male', 'myelination', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropsychological', 'pediatrician', 'practice-based research network', 'reduce adolescent alcohol', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sex', 'spatial memory', 'underage drinking', 'way finding', 'white matter']",NIAAA,MCLEAN HOSPITAL,R01,2015,501515,0.1309373825214733
"A diagnostic plasma protein panel for alcohol abuse     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Alcohol abuse and alcoholism remain significant societal problems. Unfortunately, treatment for and monitoring of harmful alcohol consumption is hampered by the lack of a highly accurate diagnostic test of alcohol drinking behavior. Our long-term goal for this research project is to develop biomarkers of alcohol abuse for use in at- risk populations. In particular, we have identified highly sensitive and specific plasma protein biomarkers using a well-controlled nonhuman primate model of alcohol abuse. We propose, in this application to translate these findings from the nonhuman primate into potential diagnostic tools for monitoring alcohol abuse in humans. This will be undertaken in collaboration with three clinical sites around the world. Specifically, we will obtain de- identified clinical samples from he Coatesville Veterans Affairs Medical Center, the Yale University School of Medicine, and the Institute for Health and Welfare of Finland (Helsinki, Finland). Studies associated with this research program will be divided into two specific aims. Specific aim 1 will validate a novel plasma biomarker panel in recovering alcoholics. In this aim, our clinical collaborators (from Yale and the Coatesville VAMC) will provide anonymous, within-subject longitudinal samples from subjects undergoing withdrawal and early abstinence (21 to 28 days) from abusive drinking as well as from the general population. These well-annotated samples will be used to refine the list of 27 biomarkers to identify the set that is most diagnostic of the human drinking phenotype and withdrawal/ abstinence. These experiments will employ a multiplex quantitative solution-phase immunoassay designed for human analytes (Myriad RBM DiscoveryMAP v1.0). As with all biomarker discovery projects, our primary emphasis will be on identifying a plasma protein analyte panel with high sensitivity and specificity. Specific aim 2 will then refine the plasma biomarker panel to permit diagnosis of hazardous drinking in a cross-sectional population from multiple sites. Within- subject assessment of drinking behavior (Aim #1) is much easier because the test does not compare differing baseline physiologies. Requirements for general population screening are much more stringent and will be assessed in samples from three independent sites (Yale University, Coatesville PA Veterans Administration Medical Center and the Finland National Institute for Health and Welfare). These sites provide a rich number of samples and drinking behaviors from which to draw experimental cohorts. In summary, we believe this work is innovative in that it capitalizes on new concepts in biomarker development through the identification of novel targets. The specific aims will build on preceding successes in the nonhuman primate model by characterization of human samples. All of the proposed studies will involve correlation with normal clinical and psychosocial assessments of alcohol consumption (AUDIT self-reports;  percentCDT, AST/ALT, GGT, etc.). In addition, because we are not using unitary biomarker measures, we will apply sophisticated biostatistical approaches (random forest, support vector machine, principle component analysis) to the data analysis.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: A shortcoming of current approaches to diagnosing and treating alcohol abuse and alcoholism is that we have no reliable, objective clinical markers of drinking behavior. We have identified and patented a panel of plasma proteins that accurately classify alcohol consumption levels in non-human primates and have also identified alcohol-induced changes in the plasma proteome common to both non-human primates and humans in a published pilot clinical study. The proposed project will translate these important findings into a refined human diagnostic in collaboration with an FDA-approved clinical partner (Myriad RBM). Therefore, these studies provide an opportunity to have a dramatic and immediate impact on our ability to address the unmet medical needs of alcohol abuse and alcoholism.                ",A diagnostic plasma protein panel for alcohol abuse,8531534,R01AA021661,"['Abstinence', 'Address', 'Admission activity', 'Alcohol abuse', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcoholism', 'Alcohols', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Markers', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Markers', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical assessments', 'Collaborations', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'FDA approved', 'Finland', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heavy Drinking', 'Human', 'Immunoassay', 'Institutes', 'Kinetics', 'Laboratories', 'Legal patent', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physiology', 'Pilot Projects', 'Plasma', 'Plasma Proteins', 'Population', 'Populations at Risk', 'Predictive Value', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Proteomics', 'Psychosocial Assessment and Care', 'Publishing', 'Questionnaires', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recovery', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Series', 'Site', 'Social Welfare', 'Solutions', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Translating', 'Typology', 'United States Department of Veterans Affairs', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Veterans', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Withdrawal', 'Work', 'alcohol research', 'clinical research site', 'cohort', 'comparative', 'design', 'drinking', 'drinking behavior', 'forest', 'hazardous drinking', 'innovation', 'medical schools', 'named group', 'nonhuman primate', 'novel', 'problem drinker', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'screening', 'success', 'tool']",NIAAA,PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIV HERSHEY MED CTR,R01,2014,344250,0.13147888746531564

"Ambulatory assessment of alcohol use, mood dysregulation, and alcohol craving     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Excessive alcohol use has many negative health consequences, including higher risk of mortality. In addition, in 2006, the estimated economic cost of excessive drinking was $223.5 billion when the combined costs of lost productivity, health and health care, and crime are considered61. Despite unparalleled advances in technology over the last several decades, the clinical assessment of features and correlates of alcohol use disorders (and psychopathology more generally), still primarily relies on traditional paper-and-pencil questionnaires and face-to- face clinical interviews. However, these tried-and-true methods are limited in a number of ways, including total reliance on patients' retrospective self-report, the skill of the clinical interviewer, and the artificial setting of the assessment (te clinic consulting room). The present study proposes to use an innovative methodology, ambulatory assessment (AA) to describe and investigate alcohol use and dependence-related symptomatology (specifically, cue- reactivity/craving), and emotional dysregulation among psychiatric outpatients with disorders characterized by clinical significant emotional dysregulation problems (mood disorders, anxiety disorders, or borderline personality disorder) while in their natural environment. This ""real-world"" approach can shed light on the causes and correlates of alcohol dependence, and suggest improvements in treatment approaches.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Excessive alcohol use is a major public health problem and incurs enormous costs to our society. By studying the subjective and physiological correlates of alcohol use, emotional dysregulation, and alcohol craving, this study will improve the conceptualization and assessment of alcohol use disorder (AUD), facilitate research on the causes and correlates of alcohol dependence, and suggest improvements in treatment approaches.

"The TEEN Study: The Impact of Adolescent Drinking on Connectivity in the Brain     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application describes the contribution of the OHSU site to the data collection efforts of the consortium entitled, Tracking Ethanol's Effects on Neurodevelopment (TEEN), and the specific focus of the OHSU site on examining how alcohol impacts functional connectivity in the developing brain and whether connectivity patterns can be used to predict risk for alcoholism. It is well-established that adolescence is a time of dramatic maturation in the brain, paralleled by improvements in executive abilities, social functioning, and emotional regulation. More recently, it has become appreciated that functional network dynamics of the brain, subserving these improvements, also dramatically change over the adolescent years. This period of heightened plasticity coincides with greater vulnerability to neurotoxic alcohol effects, such that heavy alcohol exposure during adolescence may result in disruption to normally occurring maturation of neural circuitry. To examine this question, the approach of the TEEN consortium will be to disproportionately recruit individuals who are at elevated risk for alcohol use, based on personality features. This approach was chosen to ensure sufficient numbers of individuals who will transition from no use to use within the duration of this project, and also ensures sufficient numbers of individuals who are already drinking thereby enabling cross-sectional comparisons to complement the longitudinal studies. Using a sequential cohort design, the TEEN consortium will recruit 750 youth, stratified across three age-ranges: 12-15 years, 15-18 years, and 18-21 years, with each site recruiting and following 150 youth. A standardized set of neuroimaging, cognitive, and clinical assessments will be included and administered at baseline and at three one-year follow-ups. The major aims of the OHSU site proposal are toward understanding the influence of alcohol on adolescent brain circuitry and at delineating risk-related abnormalities in developing adolescent brain networks using multi-modal integration. Understanding the neural phenotypes associated with increased risk for alcoholism and the potentially deleterious impact of alcohol on the neural connections in the adolescent brain could aid in the development of targeted strategies aimed at reducing adolescent alcohol drinking behaviors.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The present study seeks to investigate the effect of adolescent drinking on the functional connectivity of the brain and determine whether patterns of connectivity can predict risk for heavy alcohol consumption. Isolating the effects of alcohol use and identifying risk markers is necessary to develop specifically targeted prevention and intervention strategies for youth.            ",The TEEN Study: The Impact of Adolescent Drinking on Connectivity in the Brain,8692619,U01AA021691,"['Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Age', 'Alcohol abuse', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcoholism', 'Alcohols', 'Appetitive Behavior', 'Architecture', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical assessments', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Deltastab', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Emotional', 'Ensure', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Exhibits', 'Family history of', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Graph', 'Heavy Drinking', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Intervention', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Metric', 'Neurocognitive', 'Pattern', 'Personality', 'Phenotype', 'Prevention strategy', 'Property', 'Psychopathology', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Regulation', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Risk Marker', 'Role', 'Site', 'Social Functioning', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Work', 'Youth', 'adolescent alcohol exposure', 'alcohol effect', 'base', 'cognitive control', 'cohort', 'computerized data processing', 'density', 'design', 'drinking', 'drinking behavior', 'early onset', 'neural circuit', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuroimaging', 'neurotoxic', 'public health relevance', 'reduce adolescent alcohol', 'relating to nervous system', 'reward circuitry', 'segregation', 'social', 'theories', 'underage drinking']",NIAAA,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,U01,2014,557174,0.16912069031008944
"Microfluidics-Enabled High-Throughput Studies on Early Embryonic Development     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Prenatal alcohol exposure causes a range of developmental disorders that are commonly referred to as fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASDs). The most severe case of FASDs is known as fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) and is characterized by growth deficiencies, craniofacial malformations, and both structural and functional central nervous system (CNS) abnormalities. The combination of technological limitations that decrease experimental throughput and the inherent stochasticity of biological processes eliminate the ability to gain a quantitative understanding about the onset and progression of ethanol-related developmental disorders. As a result there is not much known mechanistically about how ethanol exposure manifests as FASDs. Here, we aim to develop a microfluidic-based system that enables high-throughput and high-content studies to elucidate the effects of ethanol exposure on embryogenesis. The model organism Drosophila melanogaster (Drosophila) has been shown to be a model of FASDs, because Drosophila exhibits similar phenotypical defects as humans when embryos are raised on ethanol solutions. It has yet to be seen how ethanol exposure affects developmental processes that occur during embryogenesis that lead to the wide ranging symptoms of FASDs. The technological gap that precedes this is a method that can robustly expose developing fly embryos to ethanol while also allowing high-throughput live imaging and data acquisition. The objective of this project is to develop enabling technologies for whole embryo imaging to uncover the mechanisms through which embryonic ethanol exposure affects morphogenesis and developmental patterning that ultimately lead to FASDs. In order to address the technological gap we are developing a microfluidic system that can culture and expose live Drosophila embryos to ethanol in a highly-parallelized manner. This system will also enable live imaging of embryogenesis, so that we can better understand how ethanol exposure affects morphogenesis. Furthermore, the microfluidic system will be integrated with tissue clearing techniques that will enable whole embryo imaging and thus allow us to visualize whole embryo gene expression patterns. In this study, we will study mutants of key enzymes to better elucidate their roles in FASD. Using this device, I aim to better our understanding about the physical and gene expression changes involved with FASDs. Microfluidic systems will be integrated with computer automation programs that will increase data acquisition rates. Data analysis will be streamlined through the development of computer vision algorithms that will help identify phenotypical changes associated with ethanol exposure that are non-obvious and likely to be missed by manual annotation. This project will not only enlarge the repertoire of tools available for developmental biology in general, but also will have significant impact on ethanol teratology.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The purpose of this project is to develop a high-throughput, microfluidics-based system for studying the physical and genetic origins of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASDs). The results of this project will greatly increase our understanding of how prenatal ethanol exposure affects early embryogenesis and elucidate the mechanism through which ethanol exposure results in a wide range of developmental defects. Insights gained from this project will lead to novel treatments to help reduce ethanol teratogenicity and prevent the onset of FASDs.             ",Microfluidics-Enabled High-Throughput Studies on Early Embryonic Development,8721107,F31AA023160,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Model', 'Automation', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Models', 'Biological Process', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Body Size', 'Chemicals', 'Chromosome abnormality', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computers', 'Congenital neurologic anomalies', 'Cues', 'Data Analyses', 'Defect', 'Development', 'Developmental Biology', 'Developmental Process', 'Devices', 'Dorsal', 'Drosophila genus', 'Drosophila melanogaster', 'Embryo', 'Embryonic Development', 'Engineering', 'Enzymes', 'Ethanol', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Exposure to', 'Fertilization', 'Fetal Alcohol Exposure', 'Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder', 'Fetal Alcohol Syndrome', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Screening', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Image', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Light', 'Literature', 'Manuals', 'Methods', 'Microfluidic Microchips', 'Microfluidics', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Abnormality', 'Morphogenesis', 'Nerve', 'Neuraxis', 'Optics', 'Organ', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Preclinical Drug Evaluation', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Quality of life', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Role', 'Solutions', 'Staging', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Teratogens', 'Teratology', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Vision', 'Work', 'alcohol effect', 'alcohol exposure', 'base', 'brain size', 'craniofacial', 'data acquisition', 'design', 'developmental disease', 'developmental genetics', 'fly', 'functional disability', 'gastrulation', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'malformation', 'miniaturize', 'mutant', 'nervous system development', 'neuroblast', 'novel', 'prenatal exposure', 'prevent', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'skills', 'synaptogenesis', 'tool']",NIAAA,GEORGIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,F31,2014,42676,0.097726373775866
"Consequences of Adolescent Alcohol Use on Brain Development     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This revised R01 A1 proposal (AA022493), ""Consequences of Adolescent Alcohol Use on Brain Development"", responds to the need to understand the impact of initiating alcohol consumption on adolescent brain maturation. We have teamed with the Center for Adolescent Substance Abuse Research (CeASAR) and Boston Children's Hospital to implement an innovative strategy that combines multiple neuroimaging and neuropsychological approaches to identify neurodevelopmental vulnerabilities associated with early and escalating alcohol use during adolescence. Adolescents will be recruited from general pediatrician offices and adolescent medicine clinics comprising the New England Partnership for Substance Abuse Research (NEPSAR), a practice-based research network of primary care offices. Adolescents will be enrolled into the study prior to the initiation of alcoho use or other drug use, and examined longitudinally, at baseline (13-14 yrs old) and again at two annual follow-up visits. To provide a comprehensive longitudinal profile of brain function, structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), and task and resting state blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) will be paired with magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) to measure GABA and glutamate levels in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and medial temporal lobe (MTL, containing hippocampus). In addition, arterial spin labeling (ASL) will be used to measure quantitative perfusion, which will be used to calibrate the magnitude of BOLD fMRI signal changes during response inhibition and spatial memory fMRI tasks. Magnetic resonance measures will be integrated with measures from clinical assessments and an extensive neuropsychological battery, designed to detect and further characterize developmental changes and the influence of adolescent alcohol use. The incorporation of complementary multi-modal measures of brain function and neuroplasticity could offer valuable insight into the dynamic processes of brain maturation and help identify neural signatures associated with the onset and escalation of alcohol use, which will provide a foundation for informing prevention and intervention efforts aimed at reducing adolescent alcohol consumption.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This longitudinal, multi-modal study of adolescents during the critical period of brain maturation, and during a time that overlaps with the onset of alcohol initiation, will help elucidate milestones of healthy adolescent brain development and identify neural signatures associated with the onset and escalation of alcohol use.                ",Consequences of Adolescent Alcohol Use on Brain Development,8723602,R01AA022493,"['Adolescent', 'Adolescent Medicine', 'Age', 'Age of Onset', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Anisotropy', 'Anterior', 'Behavior assessment', 'Boston', 'Brain', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical assessments', 'Cognitive', 'Core-Binding Factor', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Drug usage', 'Enrollment', 'Failure', 'Female', 'Female Adolescents', 'Foundations', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Glutamates', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Hyperactive behavior', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Male Adolescents', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Mediating', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Metric', 'Modeling', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Neuronal Plasticity', 'New England', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Performance', 'Perfusion', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Primary Health Care', 'Process', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Spin Labels', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Task Performances', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Time', 'Visit', 'adolescent alcohol', 'adolescent substance abuse', 'age related', 'alcohol and other drug', 'alcohol use initiation', 'base', 'blood oxygen level dependent', 'cingulate cortex', 'critical period', 'design', 'early alcohol use', 'follow-up', 'gamma-Aminobutyric Acid', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'male', 'myelination', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropsychological', 'pediatrician', 'practice-based research network', 'public health relevance', 'reduce adolescent alcohol', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sex', 'underage drinking', 'way finding', 'white matter']",NIAAA,MCLEAN HOSPITAL,R01,2014,547701,0.1309373825214733

"Ambulatory assessment of alcohol use, mood dysregulation, and alcohol craving     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Excessive alcohol use has many negative health consequences, including higher risk of mortality. In addition, in 2006, the estimated economic cost of excessive drinking was $223.5 billion when the combined costs of lost productivity, health and health care, and crime are considered61. Despite unparalleled advances in technology over the last several decades, the clinical assessment of features and correlates of alcohol use disorders (and psychopathology more generally), still primarily relies on traditional paper-and-pencil questionnaires and face-to- face clinical interviews. However, these tried-and-true methods are limited in a number of ways, including total reliance on patients' retrospective self-report, the skill of the clinical interviewer, and the artificial setting of the assessment (te clinic consulting room). The present study proposes to use an innovative methodology, ambulatory assessment (AA) to describe and investigate alcohol use and dependence-related symptomatology (specifically, cue- reactivity/craving), and emotional dysregulation among psychiatric outpatients with disorders characterized by clinical significant emotional dysregulation problems (mood disorders, anxiety disorders, or borderline personality disorder) while in their natural environment. This ""real-world"" approach can shed light on the causes and correlates of alcohol dependence, and suggest improvements in treatment approaches.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Excessive alcohol use is a major public health problem and incurs enormous costs to our society. By studying the subjective and physiological correlates of alcohol use, emotional dysregulation, and alcohol craving, this study will improve the conceptualization and assessment of alcohol use disorder (AUD), facilitate research on the causes and correlates of alcohol dependence, and suggest improvements in treatment approaches.                 ","Ambulatory assessment of alcohol use, mood dysregulation, and alcohol craving",8485376,R21AA022099,"['Affective', 'Alcohol abuse', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohol dependence', 'Alcoholic Beverages', 'Algorithms', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Borderline Personality Disorder', 'Cardiac', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Skills', 'Clinical assessments', 'Collection', 'Computer software', 'Consult', 'Crime', 'Data', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Disease', 'Electronics', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Environment', 'Equipment', 'Glosso-Sterandryl', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Heart Rate', 'Heavy Drinking', 'Hour', 'Individual', 'Interview', 'Interviewer', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Mood Disorders', 'Moods', 'Network-based', 'Outpatients', 'Paper', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Physiologic Monitoring', 'Physiological', 'Productivity', 'Psychopathology', 'Psychophysiology', 'Public Health', 'Questionnaires', 'Reliance', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Respiration', 'Sampling', 'Secure', 'Series', 'Societies', 'Statistical Models', 'Stimulus', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technology', 'Telephone', 'Time', 'Validity and Reliability', 'Video Recording', 'Wireless Technology', 'alcohol craving', 'alcohol use disorder', 'base', 'clinically significant', 'cost', 'craving', 'cue reactivity', 'data exchange', 'design', 'diaries', 'drinking', 'economic cost', 'experience', 'heart rate variability', 'high risk', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'interdisciplinary collaboration', 'monitoring device', 'mortality', 'negative mood', 'positive mood', 'public health relevance', 'respiratory', 'response', 'sensor']",NIAAA,UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI-COLUMBIA,R21,2013,207312,0.19013274199080654
"The TEEN Study: The Impact of Adolescent Drinking on Connectivity in the Brain     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application describes the contribution of the OHSU site to the data collection efforts of the consortium entitled, Tracking Ethanol's Effects on Neurodevelopment (TEEN), and the specific focus of the OHSU site on examining how alcohol impacts functional connectivity in the developing brain and whether connectivity patterns can be used to predict risk for alcoholism. It is well-established that adolescence is a time of dramatic maturation in the brain, paralleled by improvements in executive abilities, social functioning, and emotional regulation. More recently, it has become appreciated that functional network dynamics of the brain, subserving these improvements, also dramatically change over the adolescent years. This period of heightened plasticity coincides with greater vulnerability to neurotoxic alcohol effects, such that heavy alcohol exposure during adolescence may result in disruption to normally occurring maturation of neural circuitry. To examine this question, the approach of the TEEN consortium will be to disproportionately recruit individuals who are at elevated risk for alcohol use, based on personality features. This approach was chosen to ensure sufficient numbers of individuals who will transition from no use to use within the duration of this project, and also ensures sufficient numbers of individuals who are already drinking thereby enabling cross-sectional comparisons to complement the longitudinal studies. Using a sequential cohort design, the TEEN consortium will recruit 750 youth, stratified across three age-ranges: 12-15 years, 15-18 years, and 18-21 years, with each site recruiting and following 150 youth. A standardized set of neuroimaging, cognitive, and clinical assessments will be included and administered at baseline and at three one-year follow-ups. The major aims of the OHSU site proposal are toward understanding the influence of alcohol on adolescent brain circuitry and at delineating risk-related abnormalities in developing adolescent brain networks using multi-modal integration. Understanding the neural phenotypes associated with increased risk for alcoholism and the potentially deleterious impact of alcohol on the neural connections in the adolescent brain could aid in the development of targeted strategies aimed at reducing adolescent alcohol drinking behaviors.

"Mouse Model Neuro-Facial Dysmorphology: Tanslational and Treatment Studies    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) occurs in children born to women who drink alcohol heavily during pregnancy and is one of the leading non-hereditary causes of mental retardation in the Western World. It is estimated that the prevalence of FAS in the general U.S. population is between 0.5 and 2.0 per 1,000 births, while the undiagnosed population with variable facial and brain dysmorphology described as fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) is estimated to be 10 times higher. The difficulty in the diagnosis of FASD involves misdiagnosis due to the presence or absence of the typical facial dysmorphology in association with brain dysfunction. Accurate diagnosis is further complicated by the lack of information about the contribution of dose, frequency, and timing of alcohol exposure during pregnancy to variation in facial dysmorphology. In this project, a mouse model that models human consumption and is known to produce FAS-like features resulting from prenatal alcohol exposure, will be used to test the effects of differences in dose and timing of alcohol exposure on face and brain development. A combination of 3D imaging that includes Micro-video and micro-resonance imaging (MRI) will be used to capture the detailed facial structure, micro-computational tomography (Micro-CT) to capture the underlying facial bone, MRI for detailed brain dimensions, and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) for nerve fiber tracks in the fetal period. A novel computational program will be compiled to detect features specifically as function of alcohol exposure. The association and dissociation of facial and brain dysmorphology as a function of dose and timing of alcohol exposure will be analyzed to better inform the diagnosis of FAS/ FASD. These studies will be a collaboration sharing resources and methods and will be performed across both Basic and Clinical Science components in consortium effort. To date there is no cure for FAS/FASD, which is a life long ordeal from the birth. Experimental tests, using the above model and setting, of trophic peptides which have been known to prevent neurodegeneration in trials for Alzheimer Disease and protect cell death in embryonic stage, have been partially tested in the embryonic period to show protection against the alcohol-induced retardation. The new studies will test whether the trophic peptides can prevent alcohol-induced brain and facial dysmorphology as well as behavioral impairment known to occur in FAS.          n/a",Mouse Model Neuro-Facial Dysmorphology: Tanslational and Treatment Studies,8125102,U01AA017123,"['Adopted', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohols', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Basic Science', 'Birth', 'Blood alcohol level measurement', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'C57BL/6 Mouse', 'Cartilage', 'Cell Death', 'Child', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Collaborations', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer software', 'Computer-Assisted Image Analysis', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diet', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Dimensions', 'Dissociation', 'Dose', 'Dysmorphology', 'Early identification', 'Embryo', 'Evaluation', 'Experimental Animal Model', 'Face', 'Fetal Alcohol Exposure', 'Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder', 'Fetal Alcohol Syndrome', 'Fiber', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Gestational Age', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Length', 'Life', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental Retardation', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Mus', 'NAPVSIPQ peptide', 'Neonatal', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Nerve Fibers', 'Neurons', 'Oral', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Peptides', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Pregnancy', 'Prevalence', 'Principal Investigator', 'Resolution', 'Resource Sharing', 'Sampling', 'Sheep', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Skeleton', 'Source', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Vibrissae', 'Western World', 'Woman', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'alcohol effect', 'alcohol exposure', 'behavioral impairment', 'bone', 'brain volume', 'clinical application', 'craniofacial', 'digital imaging', 'drinking', 'face bone structure', 'fetal', 'improved', 'in utero', 'longitudinal design', 'morphometry', 'morris water maze', 'mouse model', 'neurobehavioral', 'neurochemistry', 'neuroimaging', 'neurotrophic factor', 'novel', 'peptide analog', 'postnatal', 'pregnant', 'prenatal', 'prevent', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'sensory cortex', 'tomography', 'translational study', 'young adult']",NIAAA,INDIANA UNIV-PURDUE UNIV AT INDIANAPOLIS,U01,2011,240069,0.08136793639075392
"Spectrum of and Nutritional Risk Factors for FASD in Russia and Ukraine    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD), first described in the U.S. in 1973 by Jones and Smith, encompasses a pattern of structural abnormalities, growth deficiency, and neurobehavioral impairment that occurs in the offspring of women who consume moderate to heavy amounts of alcohol in pregnancy. FASD is thought to represent the leading known preventable causes of neurobehavioral impairment in the U.S. and perhaps throughout the world. The proposed study offers the opportunity within the Collaborative Initiative on Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (CIFASD) consortium of projects to describe the spectrum of alcoholrelated effects, to identify risk factors that are antecedent to pregnancy outcome, to test within-pregnancy interventions, and also to test methods that will allow for earlier identification of alcohol-related birth outcomes. Specifically, the proposed research will utilize a prospective cohort study design involving pregnant women and their offspring recruited in Russia and Ukraine to address major gaps in knowledge about FASD by accomplishing the following specific aims: 1) to more fully delineate the complete range of expression of FASD in relation to specific quantities, patterns and gestational timing of alcohol exposure, and to evaluate the sensitivity of methods for earlier recognition of affected children; 2) to assess the contribution of maternal nutritional status in relation to physical and neurobehavioral outcomes associated with prenatal alcohol exposure, and to test the benefit of maternal second and third trimester supplementation with multinutrients with or without choline with respect to risk for FASD in the offspring; and 3) in collaboration with other CIFASD investigators, to provide a well-characterized sample of mothers/children with and without prenatal exposure to alcohol for testing of alternative and earlier methods of identifying affected children, including prenatal ultrasound and post-natal 3D facial imaging. The proposed research has public health relevance from the standpoint of providing an improved estimate of the magnitude and scope of alcoholrelated developmental problems in the context of specific quantities and patterns of prenatal alcohol exposure using standardized methods for assessment, and from the standpoint of developing and validating critically necessary clinical methods for improved and early recognition of affected children and testing the potential benefit of a reasonably applied prenatal intervention that may help ameliorate negative outcomes.          n/a",Spectrum of and Nutritional Risk Factors for FASD in Russia and Ukraine,8121650,U01AA014835,"['Address', 'Adolescent', 'Affect', 'Africa', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohol-Related Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Alcohols', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Basic Science', 'Behavioral', 'Binding Sites', 'Biology', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Choline', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Cohort Studies', 'Collaborations', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dietary Intervention', 'Drug Design', 'Dysmorphology', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Early treatment', 'Elements', 'Emotional', 'Ethanol', 'Ethnic group', 'Exposure to', 'Face', 'Fetal Alcohol Exposure', 'Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder', 'Fetal Alcohol Syndrome', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Growth', 'Human', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Informal Social Control', 'Informatics', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Language Development', 'Life', 'Los Angeles', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Mothers', 'Mus', 'Neonatal', 'Neural Cell Adhesion Molecule L1', 'Neurobiology', 'New Mexico', 'Nutritional', 'Nutritional status', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Population', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Outcome', 'Pregnant Women', 'Rattus', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Request for Applications', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Russia', 'Sampling', 'Schools', 'Second Pregnancy Trimester', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Sheep', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Sum', 'Supplementation', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Third Pregnancy Trimester', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Time', 'Toddler', 'Ukraine', 'Ultrasonography', 'Woman', 'Work', 'alcohol exposure', 'alcohol sensitivity', 'alcohol testing', 'analog', 'brain behavior', 'brain morphology', 'cognitive control', 'critical period', 'data integration', 'drinking', 'follow-up', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'in utero', 'infancy', 'literacy', 'mouse model', 'multidisciplinary', 'neurobehavioral', 'northern plains', 'novel', 'offspring', 'prenatal', 'prenatal exposure', 'prenatal intervention', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'reconstruction', 'social', 'three dimensional structure']",NIAAA,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",U01,2011,521526,0.18059053334079356

"Spectrum of and Nutritional Risk Factors for FASD in Russia and Ukraine    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD), first described in the U.S. in 1973 by Jones and Smith, encompasses a pattern of structural abnormalities, growth deficiency, and neurobehavioral impairment that occurs in the offspring of women who consume moderate to heavy amounts of alcohol in pregnancy.

"Translational Studies of FASD Using a Sheep Model-U01    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The main goals of this consortium are to identify sources of variation in fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) phenotypes (facial dysmorphology, structural brain damage and neurobehavioral functional deficits), to advance understanding of structure-function relationships, to improve diagnosis and early identification of FASD, and to develop early interventions that may limit adverse outcomes in at-risk pregnancies. Animal models are essential to those goals. This project proposes a novel sheep model that is especially well suited for experimental translational studies of FASD. In utero brain development in sheep matches human brain development relatively well, and prenatal binge alcohol exposure in sheep produces brain and behavioral effects consistent with FASD. There are two long-term objectives for this project. The first is to use the sheep model to compare the effects of binge-like alcohol exposure during the period of brain development comparable to that of the human first trimester (1st-trimester mode/) with similar binge-like exposure that extends over the stages of brain development encompassing all three human trimesters (3-trimester model). These studies evaluate phenotypic measures used in the diagnosis of fetal alcohol syndrome-growth, facial dysmorphology, and brain and behavioral development-using methods derived explicitly from and collaboratively linked directly to approaches applied in the human components of the consortium. These studies test the general hypothesis that more pervasive effects on brain and neurobehavioral development will result from binge exposure that continues after the first trimester. Aim 1 will evaluate growth, facial morphometry, and effects on in vivo brain regional volumes using structural magnetic resonance imaging. Aim 2 will assess neurobehavioral outcomes using eyeblink classical conditioning and spatial working memory. Aim 3 will assess neuroanatomical effects via neuronal counts in the cerebellum, hippocampal formation, and brainstem serotonin system. These studies are designed to inter-relate with and reciprocally inform four of the human projects [Facial Imaging (Foroud), Brain Imaging (Sowell), Neurobehavioral project (Mattson), and the Risk Factors/Nutrition project (Chambers)] and the two mouse basic science projects (Zhou; Sulik). The second objective (Aim 4) is to test the hypothesis that choline supplementation initiated periconceptually will attenuate the adverse effects of alcohol exposure in the 3-trimester sheep model. This study was designed with explicit and complementary collaboration with the choline-supplementation projects in rats [the basic science developmental project using rats (Thomas)] and in humans [Risk Factor/Nutrition project of Chambers/Keen]. This sheep model provides a unique opportunity to bridge the basic and clinical arms of the consortium more closely than has been achieved in the past.           n/a",Translational Studies of FASD Using a Sheep Model-U01,7906056,U01AA017120,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adverse effects', 'Affect', 'Africa', 'Age', 'Age-Months', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohol-Related Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Alcohols', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Attenuated', 'Basic Science', 'Behavioral', 'Binding Sites', 'Biology', 'Birth', 'Blinking', 'Brain', 'Brain Injuries', 'Brain Stem', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain region', 'Cells', 'Cerebellar Nuclei', 'Cerebellum', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Choline', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Complement', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dietary Intervention', 'Dose', 'Drug Design', 'Dysmorphology', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Early treatment', 'Elements', 'Emotional', 'Ethanol', 'Ethnic group', 'Experimental Animal Model', 'Face', 'Fetal Alcohol Exposure', 'Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder', 'Fetal Alcohol Syndrome', 'First Pregnancy Trimester', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Hippocampal Formation', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Informal Social Control', 'Informatics', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Language Development', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Link', 'Los Angeles', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Microcephaly', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Moscow', 'Mothers', 'Mus', 'Neonatal', 'Neural Cell Adhesion Molecule L1', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurons', 'New Mexico', 'Outcome', 'Partner in relationship', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Population', 'Pregnancy', 'Rattus', 'Recording of previous events', 'Request for Applications', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Rodent', 'Rodent Model', 'Role', 'Schools', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Serotonin', 'Severities', 'Sheep', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Source', 'Specificity', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Sum', 'Supplementation', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Time', 'Toddler', 'Ukraine', 'Ultrasonography', 'Variant', 'Woman', 'Work', 'adverse outcome', 'alcohol exposure', 'alcohol sensitivity', 'analog', 'arm', 'base', 'binge drinking', 'brain behavior', 'brain morphology', 'brain volume', 'classical conditioning', 'cognitive control', 'conditioning', 'critical period', 'data integration', 'dentate gyrus', 'design', 'drinking', 'fetal diagnosis', 'follow-up', 'granule cell', 'hippocampal pyramidal neuron', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'in utero', 'in vivo', 'infancy', 'literacy', 'morphometry', 'mouse model', 'multidisciplinary', 'neurobehavioral', 'neurobehavioral test', 'neuron loss', 'northern plains', 'novel', 'nutrition', 'offspring', 'postnatal', 'prenatal', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'research study', 'social', 'species difference', 'three dimensional structure', 'translational study']",NIAAA,TEXAS A&M AGRILIFE RESEARCH,U01,2010,272554,0.10403619346177251
"MAGNETIC RESONANCE AND DIFFUSION TENSOR IMAGING OF A MOUSE FASD MODEL U01 DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD), significant components of which are Central Nervous System (CMS) and craniofacial abnormalities, are a major public health problem. While eliminating FASD is the ultimate goal for both clinical and basic FASD research, we recognize that in the near future, adverse effects from prenatal ethanol exposure will persist. To better diagnose and treat affected individuals, a more complete understanding of the full spectrum of the ethanol-induced abnormalities is needed. The proposed investigations are designed to integrate with those of other consortium members in meeting this need. For this work, both high resolution Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), which can provide 29 micron (or less) isotropic scans and subsequent accurate 3-D reconstructions and segmental analyses, and Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI), which allows CMS fiber tract analyses, will be applied to the study of an FASD mouse model. Previous research utilizing this model has established critical exposure times that yield facial and CNS abnormalities that are consistent with full-blown Fetal Alcohol Syndrome, as well as other components of FASD. The proposed studies will employ this model and both acute and chronic ethanol treatment paradigms to test the overall hypothesis that in mice, ethanol induces structural abnormalities of the brain and face that are consistent with and informative for those in human FASD. To this end, utilizing MRI and DTI as high throughput screening platforms, we propose to address the following specific aims : 1) to provide comprehensive documentation and discovery of the ethanol-induced CNS dysmorphology that results from prenatal ethanol exposure at embryonic and early fetal stages of development; 2) to define the facial dysmorphology that results from prenatal ethanol exposure during embryonic and/or early fetal stages and to relate their character and severity to accompanying abnormalities of the brain; and 3) to identify regions other than the brain or face that may serve as diagnostic indicators of prenatal ethanol exposure. The results of the proposed studies will be compared to those of corresponding investigations by other consortium members. It is expected that the structural abnormalities of the brain and face that are induced by ethanol in mice will reflect the pattern of defects observed in children with FASD, will inform human diagnostic tests, and will provide new information that will be helpful in reducing the incidence of FASD. n/a",MAGNETIC RESONANCE AND DIFFUSION TENSOR IMAGING OF A MOUSE FASD MODEL U01,7900037,U01AA017124,"['3-Dimensional', 'A Mouse', 'Acoustic Nerve', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adverse effects', 'Affect', 'Africa', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohol-Related Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Alcohols', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Back', 'Basic Science', 'Behavioral', 'Binding Sites', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Cell Death', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Choline', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Complement', 'Consult', 'Craniofacial Abnormalities', 'Data', 'Data Files', 'Data Storage and Retrieval', 'Databases', 'Defect', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Diet', 'Dietary Intervention', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Dimensions', 'Disease model', 'Documentation', 'Dose', 'Drug Design', 'Dysmorphology', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Elements', 'Embryo', 'Embryonic Development', 'Emotional', 'Ethanol', 'Ethnic group', 'Face', 'Female', 'Fertilization', 'Fetal Alcohol Exposure', 'Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder', 'Fetal Alcohol Syndrome', 'Fetus', 'Fiber', 'First Pregnancy Trimester', 'Fostering', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Goals', 'Hearing Tests', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imagery', 'Incidence', 'Indiana', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Informal Social Control', 'Informatics', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Laboratory Animals', 'Labyrinth', 'Language', 'Language Development', 'Life', 'Liquid substance', 'Literature', 'Los Angeles', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Menstruation', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Moscow', 'Mothers', 'Mus', 'Nasal septum structure', 'Neonatal', 'Neural Cell Adhesion Molecule L1', 'Neuraxis', 'Neurobiology', 'New Mexico', 'Optic Nerve', 'Optics', 'Outcome', 'Partner in relationship', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Photography', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Population', 'Pregnancy', 'Prevention', 'Prosencephalon', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Rattus', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reproduction', 'Request for Applications', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Retrieval', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Schools', 'Screening procedure', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Severities', 'Sheep', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'Specimen', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'Sum', 'Supplementation', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Time', 'Toddler', 'Ukraine', 'Ultrasonography', 'Universities', 'Woman', 'Work', 'alcohol effect', 'alcohol exposure', 'alcohol sensitivity', 'analog', 'base', 'brain behavior', 'brain morphology', 'cognitive control', 'computer generated', 'craniofacial', 'critical period', 'data integration', 'design', 'dosage', 'drinking', 'fetal', 'follow-up', 'high throughput screening', 'human data', 'human subject', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'in utero', 'infancy', 'interest', 'intraperitoneal', 'literacy', 'malformation', 'meetings', 'member', 'membranous labyrinth', 'mouse model', 'multidisciplinary', 'neurobehavioral', 'northern plains', 'novel', 'offspring', 'prenatal', 'prenatal exposure', 'programs', 'prospective', 'reconstruction', 'response', 'sensory system', 'social', 'symposium', 'three dimensional structure', 'web site']",NIAAA,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,U01,2010,242586,0.07588709656822407
"Mouse Model Neuro-Facial Dysmorphology: Tanslational and Treatment Studies    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) occurs in children born to women who drink alcohol heavily during pregnancy and is one of the leading non-hereditary causes of mental retardation in the Western World. It is estimated that the prevalence of FAS in the general U.S. population is between 0.5 and 2.0 per 1,000 births, while the undiagnosed population with variable facial and brain dysmorphology described as fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) is estimated to be 10 times higher. The difficulty in the diagnosis of FASD involves misdiagnosis due to the presence or absence of the typical facial dysmorphology in association with brain dysfunction. Accurate diagnosis is further complicated by the lack of information about the contribution of dose, frequency, and timing of alcohol exposure during pregnancy to variation in facial dysmorphology. In this project, a mouse model that models human consumption and is known to produce FAS-like features resulting from prenatal alcohol exposure, will be used to test the effects of differences in dose and timing of alcohol exposure on face and brain development. A combination of 3D imaging that includes Micro-video and micro-resonance imaging (MRI) will be used to capture the detailed facial structure, micro-computational tomography (Micro-CT) to capture the underlying facial bone, MRI for detailed brain dimensions, and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) for nerve fiber tracks in the fetal period. A novel computational program will be compiled to detect features specifically as function of alcohol exposure. The association and dissociation of facial and brain dysmorphology as a function of dose and timing of alcohol exposure will be analyzed to better inform the diagnosis of FAS/ FASD. These studies will be a collaboration sharing resources and methods and will be performed across both Basic and Clinical Science components in consortium effort. To date there is no cure for FAS/FASD, which is a life long ordeal from the birth. Experimental tests, using the above model and setting, of trophic peptides which have been known to prevent neurodegeneration in trials for Alzheimer Disease and protect cell death in embryonic stage, have been partially tested in the embryonic period to show protection against the alcohol-induced retardation. The new studies will test whether the trophic peptides can prevent alcohol-induced brain and facial dysmorphology as well as behavioral impairment known to occur in FAS.          n/a",Mouse Model Neuro-Facial Dysmorphology: Tanslational and Treatment Studies,7905111,U01AA017123,"['Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adopted', 'Affect', 'Africa', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohol-Related Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Alcohols', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Basic Science', 'Behavioral', 'Binding Sites', 'Biology', 'Birth', 'Blood alcohol level measurement', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'C57BL/6 Mouse', 'Cartilage', 'Cell Death', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Choline', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Collaborations', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer software', 'Computer-Assisted Image Analysis', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diet', 'Dietary Intervention', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Dimensions', 'Dissociation', 'Dose', 'Drug Design', 'Dysmorphology', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Early treatment', 'Elements', 'Embryo', 'Emotional', 'Ethanol', 'Ethnic group', 'Evaluation', 'Experimental Animal Model', 'Face', 'Fetal Alcohol Exposure', 'Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder', 'Fetal Alcohol Syndrome', 'Fiber', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Gestational Age', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging technology', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Informal Social Control', 'Informatics', 'Inherited', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Language Development', 'Length', 'Life', 'Liquid substance', 'Los Angeles', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental Retardation', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Moscow', 'Mothers', 'Mus', 'NAPVSIPQ peptide', 'Neonatal', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Nerve Fibers', 'Neural Cell Adhesion Molecule L1', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurons', 'New Mexico', 'Oral', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Peptides', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Population', 'Pregnancy', 'Prevalence', 'Principal Investigator', 'Rattus', 'Recording of previous events', 'Request for Applications', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Resource Sharing', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Schools', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Sheep', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Skeleton', 'Source', 'Specificity', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'Sum', 'Supplementation', 'Surface', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Time', 'Toddler', 'Ukraine', 'Ultrasonography', 'Variant', 'Vibrissae', 'Western World', 'Woman', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'alcohol effect', 'alcohol exposure', 'alcohol sensitivity', 'analog', 'behavioral impairment', 'bone', 'brain behavior', 'brain morphology', 'brain volume', 'clinical application', 'cognitive control', 'craniofacial', 'critical period', 'data integration', 'digital imaging', 'drinking', 'face bone structure', 'fetal', 'follow-up', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'in utero', 'infancy', 'literacy', 'longitudinal design', 'morphometry', 'morris water maze', 'mouse model', 'multidisciplinary', 'neurobehavioral', 'neurochemistry', 'neuroimaging', 'neurotrophic factor', 'northern plains', 'novel', 'offspring', 'peptide analog', 'postnatal', 'pregnant', 'prenatal', 'prevent', 'programs', 'prospective', 'relating to nervous system', 'sensory cortex', 'social', 'tomography', 'translational study', 'young adult']",NIAAA,INDIANA UNIV-PURDUE UNIV AT INDIANAPOLIS,U01,2010,242494,0.08136793639075392
"Spectrum of and Nutritional Risk Factors for FASD in Russia and Ukraine    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD), first described in the U.S. in 1973 by Jones and Smith, encompasses a pattern of structural abnormalities, growth deficiency, and neurobehavioral impairment that occurs in the offspring of women who consume moderate to heavy amounts of alcohol in pregnancy. FASD is thought to represent the leading known preventable causes of neurobehavioral impairment in the U.S. and perhaps throughout the world. The proposed study offers the opportunity within the Collaborative Initiative on Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (CIFASD) consortium of projects to describe the spectrum of alcoholrelated effects, to identify risk factors that are antecedent to pregnancy outcome, to test within-pregnancy interventions, and also to test methods that will allow for earlier identification of alcohol-related birth outcomes. Specifically, the proposed research will utilize a prospective cohort study design involving pregnant women and their offspring recruited in Russia and Ukraine to address major gaps in knowledge about FASD by accomplishing the following specific aims: 1) to more fully delineate the complete range of expression of FASD in relation to specific quantities, patterns and gestational timing of alcohol exposure, and to evaluate the sensitivity of methods for earlier recognition of affected children; 2) to assess the contribution of maternal nutritional status in relation to physical and neurobehavioral outcomes associated with prenatal alcohol exposure, and to test the benefit of maternal second and third trimester supplementation with multinutrients with or without choline with respect to risk for FASD in the offspring; and 3) in collaboration with other CIFASD investigators, to provide a well-characterized sample of mothers/children with and without prenatal exposure to alcohol for testing of alternative and earlier methods of identifying affected children, including prenatal ultrasound and post-natal 3D facial imaging. The proposed research has public health relevance from the standpoint of providing an improved estimate of the magnitude and scope of alcoholrelated developmental problems in the context of specific quantities and patterns of prenatal alcohol exposure using standardized methods for assessment, and from the standpoint of developing and validating critically necessary clinical methods for improved and early recognition of affected children and testing the potential benefit of a reasonably applied prenatal intervention that may help ameliorate negative outcomes.          n/a",Spectrum of and Nutritional Risk Factors for FASD in Russia and Ukraine,7668663,U01AA014835,"['Address', 'Adolescent', 'Affect', 'Africa', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohol-Related Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Alcohols', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Basic Science', 'Behavioral', 'Binding Sites', 'Biology', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Choline', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Cohort Studies', 'Collaborations', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dietary Intervention', 'Drug Design', 'Dysmorphology', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Early treatment', 'Elements', 'Emotional', 'Ethanol', 'Ethnic group', 'Exposure to', 'Face', 'Fetal Alcohol Exposure', 'Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder', 'Fetal Alcohol Syndrome', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Growth', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Informal Social Control', 'Informatics', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Language Development', 'Life', 'Los Angeles', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Mothers', 'Mus', 'Neonatal', 'Neural Cell Adhesion Molecule L1', 'Neurobiology', 'New Mexico', 'Nutritional', 'Nutritional status', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Population', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Outcome', 'Pregnant Women', 'Rattus', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Request for Applications', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Russia', 'Sampling', 'Schools', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Sheep', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Sum', 'Supplementation', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Third Pregnancy Trimester', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Time', 'Toddler', 'Ukraine', 'Ultrasonography', 'Woman', 'Work', 'alcohol exposure', 'alcohol sensitivity', 'alcohol testing', 'analog', 'brain behavior', 'brain morphology', 'cognitive control', 'critical period', 'data integration', 'drinking', 'follow-up', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'in utero', 'infancy', 'literacy', 'mouse model', 'multidisciplinary', 'neurobehavioral', 'northern plains', 'novel', 'offspring', 'prenatal', 'prenatal exposure', 'prenatal intervention', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'reconstruction', 'social', 'three dimensional structure']",NIAAA,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",U01,2009,630076,0.18059053334079356
"A Multisite Neurobehavioral Assessment of Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This application is part of the competitive renewal for the ""Collaborative Initiative on Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (CIFASD)"" (Notice RFA-AA-03-004) to continue and expand the current multidisciplinary CIFASD. This RFA calls for, in part, research aimed at ""improved diagnosis"" and ""enhanced understanding of the domains of neurobehavioral impairment"" of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). Although 30 years of research have identified myriad deficits in individuals with FASD, most neuropsychological studies are plagued by the question of global dysfunction vs. a pattern of relative sparing and impaired function. Delineation of a neuropsychological profile has been the subject of much recent debate. Limited research, including the current CIFASD consortium, has examined if prenatal alcohol exposure results in general dysfunction or a more specific neurobehavioral profile of strengths and weaknesses. The primary aim of this project is to determine whether a neurobehavioral phenotype exists in children with fetal alcohol syndrome, whether the same phenotype exists in children with FASD who lack facial dysmorphology, and whether the phenotype can be used for differential diagnosis. Secondary aims, involving collaboration with other CIFASD projects and cores, are to determine the relationship between brain dysmorphology, facial dysmorphology, and neurobehavioral function. These aims are in keeping with the overall aims of the CIFASD, including enhanced understanding of the neurobehavioral phenotype and establishment of standardized diagnostic criteria and methods of assessment of FASD. A standard neurobehavioral protocol will be administered to four groups of children at six sites and will address the functional domains of executive function, working memory, verbal function, and psychological symptomatology. In addition to children with FASD and nonexposed controls, children with low IQ scores or ADHD will be included as contrast samples. Using this heterogeneous sample and multivariate statistical methods, neurobehavioral profile specific to FASD will be sought. In addition, participants will be assessed using methodology prescribed by the Dysmorphology Core and the facial and brain imaging projects of the CIFASD. Data from three broad domains (neurobehavior, dysmorphology, and brain morphology and function) will be analyzed both separately and together to address the main aim of the CIFASD: improving the diagnostic criteria for FASD. This project is directly relevant to public health concerns surrounding the effects of heavy prenatal alcohol exposure, improving diagnosis of alcohol-affected individuals, and defining the profile of neurobehavioral effects that are specific to FASD.

"Dysmorphology Core - U24    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Since 1973 when the specific pattern of malformation referred to as the Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS) was first delineated, it has become clear that prenatal alcohol exposure is associated with a broad spectrum of structural anomalies as well as neurobehavioral deficits now referred to as the Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD). However, the full range of structural anomalies in children prenatally exposed to alcohol is unknown and the incidence of specific anomalies or clusters of anomalies associated with specific patterns of prenatal alcohol consumption are poorly understood. Over the previous three years of the Consortium, the Dysmorphology Core has established a standard comprehensive protocol for physical evaluation of children in order to assure consistency in identification of the broad spectrum of features that constitute FASD at all sites. We propose to continue to support these activities throughout the renewal period in children during the first year of life at Consortium sites in prospective studies in Moscow Region, Russia, and Rivne, Ukraine as well as in older children in retrospective studies in Los Angeles, CA, San Diego, CA, Albuquerque, NM, the Northern Plains states, Atlanta, GA, and Cape Town, South Africa. Identification of large numbers of children at various ages with FAS as well as those with some features of the disorder but not enough to presently qualify them for that diagnosis (FASD), each of whom has received a standardized clinical examination, as well as neurobehavioral evaluation, neuroimaging studies, 3D photographs and, in the prospective studies, prenatal ultrasound studies, will provide the opportunity to address hypotheses regarding the relationship between FASD-related structural defects identified through the standard physical examination with complementary diagnostic methods that are being tested in other Consortium projects. The specific aims of this project are to assure consistency as well as accuracy in recognition of FASD at all CIFASD project sites where children are being evaluated; to delineate the full range of structural anomalies in children prenatally exposed to alcohol in order to determine the boundaries that encompass FASD in prospective as well as retrospective studies involved in the Consortium; to identify specific structural features or clusters of features that are predictive of or correlated with deficits in neurobehavioral development across developmental ages spanning from infancy to adolescence; to correlate the specific structural features or clusters of features identified on the CIFASD standard physical examination with alternative or complementary methods that are being tested in other CIFASD projects; and to better understand the extent to which structural features of FASD are related to specific defects in the development of the brain.          n/a",Dysmorphology Core - U24,7668725,U24AA014815,"['Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Affect', 'Africa', 'Age', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohol-Related Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Alcohols', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Basic Science', 'Behavioral', 'Binding Sites', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Choline', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Data', 'Defect', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Dietary Intervention', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Drug Design', 'Dysmorphology', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Elements', 'Emotional', 'Ethanol', 'Ethnic group', 'Evaluation', 'Exposure to', 'Face', 'Fetal Alcohol Exposure', 'Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder', 'Fetal Alcohol Syndrome', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Impairment', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Informal Social Control', 'Informatics', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Language Development', 'Life', 'Los Angeles', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Mexico', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Moscow', 'Mothers', 'Mus', 'Neonatal', 'Neural Cell Adhesion Molecule L1', 'Neurobiology', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Physical Examination', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Pregnancy', 'Prevalence', 'Prospective Studies', 'Protocols documentation', 'Qualifying', 'Rattus', 'Recording of previous events', 'Relative (related person)', 'Request for Applications', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Role', 'Russia', 'Schools', 'Science', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Sheep', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'South Africa', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Sum', 'Supplementation', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Time', 'Toddler', 'Training', 'Ukraine', 'Ultrasonography', 'Woman', 'Work', 'alcohol exposure', 'alcohol sensitivity', 'analog', 'brain behavior', 'brain morphology', 'cognitive control', 'critical period', 'data integration', 'drinking', 'fetal', 'follow-up', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'in utero', 'infancy', 'literacy', 'malformation', 'member', 'mouse model', 'multidisciplinary', 'neurobehavioral', 'neurobehavioral test', 'neuroimaging', 'northern plains', 'novel', 'offspring', 'pediatrician', 'prenatal', 'prospective', 'reconstruction', 'social', 'three dimensional structure']",NIAAA,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",U24,2009,162359,0.128149211349802
"Mapping the Brain, the Face and Neurocognitive Function in FASD (U01)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This new application is part of the competitive renewal for the ""Collaborative Initiative on Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (CIFASD)"". One of the overall goals of the entire CIFASD during this renewal period is to determine if innovative techniques can be used to identify brain alterations, neurobehavioral deficits and facial characteristics and relationships between these variables to help define prenatal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). To help address this overarching question, we will use quantitative brain mapping techniques with high-resolution structural and functional MRI collected both cross-sectionally and longitudinally from 80 FASD children evaluated across 3 multi-cultural data collection sites (San Diego, Los Angeles and Capetown, South Africa). While this brain imaging project can independently achieve some of the goals of the CIFASD by identifying brain structural and functional abnormalities across the broad spectrum of FASD, critically this funding opportunity will allow the assessment of relationships between the brain, neurocognitive deficits and facial dysmorphology through our active collaborations with the neurobehavioral project (Mattson PI), the facial imaging project (Foroud PI), and the dysmorphology core (Jones PI). Controlled animal studies are essential to determine timing and dosages of prenatal alcohol that result in FASD, but human imaging studies are essential to corroborate anatomical findings across species. Through our association with the UCLA Laboratory of Neuro Imaging, we have access to state-of-the-art brain mapping tools that allow the morphological evaluation of any brain structure that can be identified with MRI. Thus, we are in a unique position to allow findings in animal studies to drive hypothesis-based analyses in the human imaging data. The proposed longitudinal project will highlight how an integrated approach relating neurobehavioral, functional and structural brain imaging data, and measures of facial morphology might yield important new insights on the complex nature of brain-behavior interactions and how they are altered by prenatal alcohol exposure. To our knowledge, this will be the first study to undertake such challenges, and participation, in the CIFASD is essential to address our specific aims. Ultimately, as part of the CIFASD, this project will enhance the capability for definitive FASD diagnoses that, in turn, will help clinicians manage and treat neurobehavioral deficits and associated secondary disabilities.           n/a","Mapping the Brain, the Face and Neurocognitive Function in FASD (U01)",7668683,U01AA017122,"['Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adolescent Development', 'Affect', 'Africa', 'Age', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohol-Related Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Alcohols', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Arts', 'Basic Science', 'Behavioral', 'Binding Sites', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Brain Mapping', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain region', 'Calibration', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Choline', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Control Animal', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dietary Intervention', 'Disease', 'Disorder by Site', 'Dorsal', 'Drug Design', 'Dysmorphology', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Elements', 'Emotional', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Ethanol', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Ethnic group', 'Evaluation', 'Face', 'Fetal Alcohol Exposure', 'Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder', 'Fetal Alcohol Syndrome', 'Frequencies', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Funding Opportunities', 'Future', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Inferior', 'Informal Social Control', 'Informatics', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Language', 'Language Development', 'Lead', 'Length', 'Life', 'Los Angeles', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Moscow', 'Mothers', 'Mus', 'Nature', 'Neonatal', 'Neural Cell Adhesion Molecule L1', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurocognitive Deficit', 'New Mexico', 'Outcome', 'Parietal', 'Parietal Lobe', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Pregnancy', 'Productivity', 'Rattus', 'Recording of previous events', 'Relative (related person)', 'Request for Applications', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Scheme', 'Schools', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Shapes', 'Sheep', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'South Africa', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Sum', 'Supplementation', 'Surface', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Thick', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Time', 'Toddler', 'Ukraine', 'Ultrasonography', 'Verbal Learning', 'Visual', 'Woman', 'Work', 'alcohol exposure', 'alcohol sensitivity', 'analog', 'base', 'brain behavior', 'brain morphology', 'brain size', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive function', 'critical period', 'data integration', 'disability', 'dosage', 'drinking', 'follow-up', 'frontal lobe', 'gray matter', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'in utero', 'in vivo', 'infancy', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'literacy', 'mouse model', 'multidisciplinary', 'neurobehavioral', 'neurodevelopment', 'northern plains', 'novel', 'offspring', 'postnatal', 'prenatal', 'prenatal exposure', 'programs', 'prospective', 'reconstruction', 'relating to nervous system', 'social', 'three dimensional structure', 'tool']",NIAAA,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,U01,2009,488655,0.0803965167179602
"Translational Studies of FASD Using a Sheep Model-U01    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The main goals of this consortium are to identify sources of variation in fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) phenotypes (facial dysmorphology, structural brain damage and neurobehavioral functional deficits), to advance understanding of structure-function relationships, to improve diagnosis and early identification of FASD, and to develop early interventions that may limit adverse outcomes in at-risk pregnancies. Animal models are essential to those goals. This project proposes a novel sheep model that is especially well suited for experimental translational studies of FASD. In utero brain development in sheep matches human brain development relatively well, and prenatal binge alcohol exposure in sheep produces brain and behavioral effects consistent with FASD. There are two long-term objectives for this project. The first is to use the sheep model to compare the effects of binge-like alcohol exposure during the period of brain development comparable to that of the human first trimester (1st-trimester mode/) with similar binge-like exposure that extends over the stages of brain development encompassing all three human trimesters (3-trimester model). These studies evaluate phenotypic measures used in the diagnosis of fetal alcohol syndrome-growth, facial dysmorphology, and brain and behavioral development-using methods derived explicitly from and collaboratively linked directly to approaches applied in the human components of the consortium. These studies test the general hypothesis that more pervasive effects on brain and neurobehavioral development will result from binge exposure that continues after the first trimester. Aim 1 will evaluate growth, facial morphometry, and effects on in vivo brain regional volumes using structural magnetic resonance imaging. Aim 2 will assess neurobehavioral outcomes using eyeblink classical conditioning and spatial working memory. Aim 3 will assess neuroanatomical effects via neuronal counts in the cerebellum, hippocampal formation, and brainstem serotonin system. These studies are designed to inter-relate with and reciprocally inform four of the human projects [Facial Imaging (Foroud), Brain Imaging (Sowell), Neurobehavioral project (Mattson), and the Risk Factors/Nutrition project (Chambers)] and the two mouse basic science projects (Zhou; Sulik). The second objective (Aim 4) is to test the hypothesis that choline supplementation initiated periconceptually will attenuate the adverse effects of alcohol exposure in the 3-trimester sheep model. This study was designed with explicit and complementary collaboration with the choline-supplementation projects in rats [the basic science developmental project using rats (Thomas)] and in humans [Risk Factor/Nutrition project of Chambers/Keen]. This sheep model provides a unique opportunity to bridge the basic and clinical   arms of the consortium more closely than has been achieved in the past.           n/a",Translational Studies of FASD Using a Sheep Model-U01,7669196,U01AA017120,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adverse effects', 'Affect', 'Africa', 'Age', 'Age-Months', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohol-Related Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Alcohols', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Attenuated', 'Basic Science', 'Behavioral', 'Binding Sites', 'Biology', 'Birth', 'Blinking', 'Brain', 'Brain Injuries', 'Brain Stem', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain region', 'Cells', 'Cerebellar Nuclei', 'Cerebellum', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Choline', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Complement', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dietary Intervention', 'Dose', 'Drug Design', 'Dysmorphology', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Early treatment', 'Elements', 'Emotional', 'Ethanol', 'Ethnic group', 'Experimental Animal Model', 'Face', 'Fetal Alcohol Exposure', 'Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder', 'Fetal Alcohol Syndrome', 'First Pregnancy Trimester', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Hippocampal Formation', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Informal Social Control', 'Informatics', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Language Development', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Link', 'Los Angeles', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Microcephaly', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Moscow', 'Mothers', 'Mus', 'Neonatal', 'Neural Cell Adhesion Molecule L1', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurons', 'New Mexico', 'Outcome', 'Partner in relationship', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Population', 'Pregnancy', 'Rattus', 'Recording of previous events', 'Request for Applications', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Rodent', 'Rodent Model', 'Role', 'Schools', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Serotonin', 'Severities', 'Sheep', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Source', 'Specificity', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Sum', 'Supplementation', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Time', 'Toddler', 'Ukraine', 'Ultrasonography', 'Upper arm', 'Variant', 'Woman', 'Work', 'alcohol exposure', 'alcohol sensitivity', 'analog', 'base', 'binge drinking', 'brain behavior', 'brain morphology', 'brain volume', 'classical conditioning', 'cognitive control', 'conditioning', 'critical period', 'data integration', 'dentate gyrus', 'design', 'drinking', 'fetal diagnosis', 'follow-up', 'granule cell', 'hippocampal pyramidal neuron', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'in utero', 'in vivo', 'infancy', 'literacy', 'morphometry', 'mouse model', 'multidisciplinary', 'neurobehavioral', 'neurobehavioral test', 'neuron loss', 'northern plains', 'novel', 'nutrition', 'offspring', 'postnatal', 'prenatal', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'research study', 'social', 'species difference', 'three dimensional structure', 'translational study']",NIAAA,TEXAS A&M AGRILIFE RESEARCH,U01,2009,267924,0.10403619346177251
"MAGNETIC RESONANCE AND DIFFUSION TENSOR IMAGING OF A MOUSE FASD MODEL U01    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD), significant components of which are Central Nervous System (CMS) and craniofacial abnormalities, are a major public health problem. While eliminating FASD is the ultimate goal for both clinical and basic FASD research, we recognize that in the near future, adverse effects from prenatal ethanol exposure will persist. To better diagnose and treat affected individuals, a more complete understanding of the full spectrum of the ethanol-induced abnormalities is needed. The proposed investigations are designed to integrate with those of other consortium members in meeting this need. For this work, both high resolution Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), which can provide 29 micron (or less) isotropic scans and subsequent accurate 3-D reconstructions and segmental analyses, and Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI), which allows CMS fiber tract analyses, will be applied to the study of an FASD mouse model. Previous research utilizing this model has established critical exposure times that yield facial and CNS abnormalities that are consistent with full-blown Fetal Alcohol Syndrome, as well as other components of FASD. The proposed studies will employ this model and both acute and chronic ethanol treatment paradigms to test the overall hypothesis that in mice, ethanol induces structural abnormalities of the brain and face that are consistent with and informative for those in human FASD. To this end, utilizing MRI and DTI as high throughput screening platforms, we propose to address the following specific aims : 1) to provide comprehensive documentation and discovery of the ethanol-induced CNS dysmorphology that results from prenatal ethanol exposure at embryonic and early fetal stages of development; 2) to define the facial dysmorphology that results from prenatal ethanol exposure during embryonic and/or early fetal stages and to relate their character and severity to accompanying abnormalities of the brain; and 3) to identify regions other than the brain or face that may serve as diagnostic indicators of prenatal ethanol exposure. The results of the proposed studies will be compared to those of corresponding investigations by other consortium members. It is expected that the structural abnormalities of the brain and face that are induced by ethanol in mice will reflect the pattern of defects observed in children with FASD, will inform human diagnostic tests, and will provide new information that will be helpful in reducing the incidence of FASD.           n/a",MAGNETIC RESONANCE AND DIFFUSION TENSOR IMAGING OF A MOUSE FASD MODEL U01,7668689,U01AA017124,"['3-Dimensional', 'A Mouse', 'Acoustic Nerve', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adverse effects', 'Affect', 'Africa', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohol-Related Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Alcohols', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Back', 'Basic Science', 'Behavioral', 'Binding Sites', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Cell Death', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Choline', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Complement', 'Consult', 'Craniofacial Abnormalities', 'Data', 'Data Files', 'Data Storage and Retrieval', 'Databases', 'Defect', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Diet', 'Dietary Intervention', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Dimensions', 'Disease model', 'Documentation', 'Dose', 'Drug Design', 'Dysmorphology', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Elements', 'Embryo', 'Embryonic Development', 'Emotional', 'Ethanol', 'Ethnic group', 'Face', 'Female', 'Fertilization', 'Fetal Alcohol Exposure', 'Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder', 'Fetal Alcohol Syndrome', 'Fetus', 'Fiber', 'First Pregnancy Trimester', 'Fostering', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Goals', 'Hearing Tests', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imagery', 'Incidence', 'Indiana', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Informal Social Control', 'Informatics', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Laboratory Animals', 'Labyrinth', 'Language', 'Language Development', 'Life', 'Liquid substance', 'Literature', 'Los Angeles', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Menstruation', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Moscow', 'Mothers', 'Mus', 'Nasal septum structure', 'Neonatal', 'Neural Cell Adhesion Molecule L1', 'Neuraxis', 'Neurobiology', 'New Mexico', 'Optic Nerve', 'Optics', 'Outcome', 'Partner in relationship', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Photography', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Population', 'Pregnancy', 'Prevention', 'Prosencephalon', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Rattus', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reproduction', 'Request for Applications', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Retrieval', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Schools', 'Screening procedure', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Severities', 'Sheep', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'Specimen', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'Sum', 'Supplementation', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Time', 'Toddler', 'Ukraine', 'Ultrasonography', 'Universities', 'Woman', 'Work', 'alcohol effect', 'alcohol exposure', 'alcohol sensitivity', 'analog', 'base', 'brain behavior', 'brain morphology', 'cognitive control', 'computer generated', 'craniofacial', 'critical period', 'data integration', 'design', 'dosage', 'drinking', 'fetal', 'follow-up', 'high throughput screening', 'human data', 'human subject', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'in utero', 'infancy', 'interest', 'intraperitoneal', 'literacy', 'malformation', 'meetings', 'member', 'membranous labyrinth', 'mouse model', 'multidisciplinary', 'neurobehavioral', 'northern plains', 'novel', 'offspring', 'prenatal', 'prenatal exposure', 'programs', 'prospective', 'reconstruction', 'response', 'sensory system', 'social', 'symposium', 'three dimensional structure', 'web site']",NIAAA,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,U01,2009,237539,0.07588709656822407
"Mouse Model Neuro-Facial Dysmorphology: Tanslational and Treatment Studies    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) occurs in children born to women who drink alcohol heavily during pregnancy and is one of the leading non-hereditary causes of mental retardation in the Western World. It is estimated that the prevalence of FAS in the general U.S. population is between 0.5 and 2.0 per 1,000 births, while the undiagnosed population with variable facial and brain dysmorphology described as fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) is estimated to be 10 times higher. The difficulty in the diagnosis of FASD involves misdiagnosis due to the presence or absence of the typical facial dysmorphology in association with brain dysfunction. Accurate diagnosis is further complicated by the lack of information about the contribution of dose, frequency, and timing of alcohol exposure during pregnancy to variation in facial dysmorphology. In this project, a mouse model that models human consumption and is known to produce FAS-like features resulting from prenatal alcohol exposure, will be used to test the effects of differences in dose and timing of alcohol exposure on face and brain development. A combination of 3D imaging that includes Micro-video and micro-resonance imaging (MRI) will be used to capture the detailed facial structure, micro-computational tomography (Micro-CT) to capture the underlying facial bone, MRI for detailed brain dimensions, and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) for nerve fiber tracks in the fetal period. A novel computational program will be compiled to detect features specifically as function of alcohol exposure. The association and dissociation of facial and brain dysmorphology as a function of dose and timing of alcohol exposure will be analyzed to better inform the diagnosis of FAS/ FASD. These studies will be a collaboration sharing resources and methods and will be performed across both Basic and Clinical Science components in consortium effort. To date there is no cure for FAS/FASD, which is a life long ordeal from the birth. Experimental tests, using the above model and setting, of trophic peptides which have been known to prevent neurodegeneration in trials for Alzheimer Disease and protect cell death in embryonic stage, have been partially tested in the embryonic period to show protection against the alcohol-induced retardation. The new studies will test whether the trophic peptides can prevent alcohol-induced brain and facial dysmorphology as well as behavioral impairment known to occur in FAS.          n/a",Mouse Model Neuro-Facial Dysmorphology: Tanslational and Treatment Studies,7668687,U01AA017123,"['Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adopted', 'Affect', 'Africa', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohol-Related Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Alcohols', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Basic Science', 'Behavioral', 'Binding Sites', 'Biology', 'Birth', 'Blood alcohol level measurement', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'C57BL/6 Mouse', 'Cartilage', 'Cell Death', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Choline', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Collaborations', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer software', 'Computer-Assisted Image Analysis', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diet', 'Dietary Intervention', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Dimensions', 'Dissociation', 'Dose', 'Drug Design', 'Dysmorphology', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Early treatment', 'Elements', 'Embryo', 'Emotional', 'Ethanol', 'Ethnic group', 'Evaluation', 'Experimental Animal Model', 'Face', 'Fetal Alcohol Exposure', 'Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder', 'Fetal Alcohol Syndrome', 'Fiber', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Gestational Age', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging technology', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Informal Social Control', 'Informatics', 'Inherited', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Language Development', 'Length', 'Life', 'Liquid substance', 'Los Angeles', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental Retardation', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Moscow', 'Mothers', 'Mus', 'NAPVSIPQ peptide', 'Neonatal', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Nerve Fibers', 'Neural Cell Adhesion Molecule L1', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurons', 'New Mexico', 'Oral', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Peptides', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Population', 'Pregnancy', 'Prevalence', 'Principal Investigator', 'Rattus', 'Recording of previous events', 'Request for Applications', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Resource Sharing', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Schools', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Sheep', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Skeleton', 'Source', 'Specificity', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'Sum', 'Supplementation', 'Surface', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Time', 'Toddler', 'Ukraine', 'Ultrasonography', 'Variant', 'Vibrissae', 'Western World', 'Woman', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'alcohol effect', 'alcohol exposure', 'alcohol sensitivity', 'analog', 'behavioral impairment', 'bone', 'brain behavior', 'brain morphology', 'brain volume', 'clinical application', 'cognitive control', 'craniofacial', 'critical period', 'data integration', 'digital imaging', 'drinking', 'face bone structure', 'fetal', 'follow-up', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'in utero', 'infancy', 'literacy', 'longitudinal design', 'morphometry', 'morris water maze', 'mouse model', 'multidisciplinary', 'neurobehavioral', 'neurochemistry', 'neuroimaging', 'neurotrophic factor', 'northern plains', 'novel', 'offspring', 'peptide analog', 'postnatal', 'pregnant', 'prenatal', 'prevent', 'programs', 'prospective', 'relating to nervous system', 'sensory cortex', 'social', 'tomography', 'translational study', 'young adult']",NIAAA,INDIANA UNIV-PURDUE UNIV AT INDIANAPOLIS,U01,2009,237808,0.08136793639075392

"Dysmorphology Core - U24    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Since 1973 when the specific pattern of malformation referred to as the Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS) was first delineated, it has become clear that prenatal alcohol exposure is associated with a broad spectrum of structural anomalies as well as neurobehavioral deficits now referred to as the Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD). However, the full range of structural anomalies in children prenatally exposed to alcohol is unknown and the incidence of specific anomalies or clusters of anomalies associated with specific patterns of prenatal alcohol consumption are poorly understood. Over the previous three years of the Consortium, the Dysmorphology Core has established a standard comprehensive protocol for physical evaluation of children in order to assure consistency in identification of the broad spectrum of features that constitute FASD at all sites. We propose to continue to support these activities throughout the renewal period in children during the first year of life at Consortium sites in prospective studies in Moscow Region, Russia, and Rivne, Ukraine as well as in older children in retrospective studies in Los Angeles, CA, San Diego, CA, Albuquerque, NM, the Northern Plains states, Atlanta, GA, and Cape Town, South Africa. Identification of large numbers of children at various ages with FAS as well as those with some features of the disorder but not enough to presently qualify them for that diagnosis (FASD), each of whom has received a standardized clinical examination, as well as neurobehavioral evaluation, neuroimaging studies, 3D photographs and, in the prospective studies, prenatal ultrasound studies, will provide the opportunity to address hypotheses regarding the relationship between FASD-related structural defects identified through the standard physical examination with complementary diagnostic methods that are being tested in other Consortium projects. The specific aims of this project are to assure consistency as well as accuracy in recognition of FASD at all CIFASD project sites where children are being evaluated; to delineate the full range of structural anomalies in children prenatally exposed to alcohol in order to determine the boundaries that encompass FASD in prospective as well as retrospective studies involved in the Consortium; to identify specific structural features or clusters of features that are predictive of or correlated with deficits in neurobehavioral development across developmental ages spanning from infancy to adolescence; to correlate the specific structural features or clusters of features identified on the CIFASD standard physical examination with alternative or complementary methods that are being tested in other CIFASD projects; and to better understand the extent to which structural features of FASD are related to specific defects in the development of the brain.          n/a",Dysmorphology Core - U24,7502755,U24AA014815,"['Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Affect', 'Africa', 'Age', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohol-Related Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Alcohols', 'All Sites', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Basic Science', 'Behavioral', 'Binding Sites', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Choline', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Data', 'Defect', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Dietary Intervention', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Drug Design', 'Dysmorphology', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Elements', 'Emotional', 'Ethanol', 'Ethnic group', 'Evaluation', 'Exposure to', 'Face', 'Fetal Alcohol Exposure', 'Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder', 'Fetal Alcohol Syndrome', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Impairment', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Infant Development', 'Informal Social Control', 'Informatics', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Language Development', 'Life', 'Los Angeles', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Mexico', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Moscow', 'Mothers', 'Mus', 'Neonatal', 'Neural Cell Adhesion Molecule L1', 'Neurobiology', 'Numbers', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Physical Examination', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Pregnancy', 'Prevalence', 'Principal Investigator', 'Prospective Studies', 'Protocols documentation', 'Qualifying', 'Range', 'Rattus', 'Recording of previous events', 'Relative (related person)', 'Request for Applications', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Role', 'Russia', 'Schools', 'Science', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Sheep', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'South Africa', 'Specificity', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Structure', 'Sum', 'Supplementation', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Time', 'Toddler', 'Training', 'Ukraine', 'Ultrasonography', 'Woman', 'Work', 'alcohol exposure', 'alcohol sensitivity', 'analog', 'brain behavior', 'brain morphology', 'cognitive control', 'critical developmental period', 'data integration', 'drinking', 'fetal', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'in utero', 'infancy', 'literacy', 'malformation', 'member', 'mouse model', 'multidisciplinary', 'neurobehavioral', 'neurobehavioral test', 'neuroimaging', 'northern plains', 'novel', 'pediatrician', 'prenatal', 'programs', 'prospective', 'reconstruction', 'social', 'three dimensional structure']",NIAAA,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",U24,2008,159503,0.128149211349802
"A Multisite Neurobehavioral Assessment of Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This application is part of the competitive renewal for the ""Collaborative Initiative on Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (CIFASD)"" (Notice RFA-AA-03-004) to continue and expand the current multidisciplinary CIFASD. This RFA calls for, in part, research aimed at ""improved diagnosis"" and ""enhanced understanding of the domains of neurobehavioral impairment"" of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). Although 30 years of research have identified myriad deficits in individuals with FASD, most neuropsychological studies are plagued by the question of global dysfunction vs. a pattern of relative sparing and impaired function. Delineation of a neuropsychological profile has been the subject of much recent debate. Limited research, including the current CIFASD consortium, has examined if prenatal alcohol exposure results in general dysfunction or a more specific neurobehavioral profile of strengths and weaknesses. The primary aim of this project is to determine whether a neurobehavioral phenotype exists in children with fetal alcohol syndrome, whether the same phenotype exists in children with FASD who lack facial dysmorphology, and whether the phenotype can be used for differential diagnosis. Secondary aims, involving collaboration with other CIFASD projects and cores, are to determine the relationship between brain dysmorphology, facial dysmorphology, and neurobehavioral function. These aims are in keeping with the overall aims of the CIFASD, including enhanced understanding of the neurobehavioral phenotype and establishment of standardized diagnostic criteria and methods of assessment of FASD. A standard neurobehavioral protocol will be administered to four groups of children at six sites and will address the functional domains of executive function, working memory, verbal function, and psychological symptomatology. In addition to children with FASD and nonexposed controls, children with low IQ scores or ADHD will be included as contrast samples. Using this heterogeneous sample and multivariate statistical methods, neurobehavioral profile specific to FASD will be sought. In addition, participants will be assessed using methodology prescribed by the Dysmorphology Core and the facial and brain imaging projects of the CIFASD. Data from three broad domains (neurobehavior, dysmorphology, and brain morphology and function) will be analyzed both separately and together to address the main aim of the CIFASD: improving the diagnostic criteria for FASD. This project is directly relevant to public health concerns surrounding the effects of heavy prenatal alcohol exposure, improving diagnosis of alcohol-affected individuals, and defining the profile of neurobehavioral effects that are specific to FASD. Improved identification and delineation of these features will ultimately lead to improved treatment.           n/a",A Multisite Neurobehavioral Assessment of Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders,7502760,U01AA014834,"['Address', 'Adolescent', 'Affect', 'Africa', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohol-Related Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Alcohols', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Basic Science', 'Behavioral', 'Binding Sites', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Choline', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Condition', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dietary Intervention', 'Differential Diagnosis', 'Drug Design', 'Dysmorphology', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Elements', 'Emotional', 'Ensure', 'Ethanol', 'Ethnic group', 'Evaluation', 'Face', 'Fetal Alcohol Exposure', 'Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder', 'Fetal Alcohol Syndrome', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Infant Development', 'Informal Social Control', 'Informatics', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Language Development', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Los Angeles', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Moscow', 'Mothers', 'Mus', 'Neonatal', 'Neural Cell Adhesion Molecule L1', 'Neurobiology', 'Neuropsychological Tests', 'New Mexico', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Phenotype', 'Pilot Projects', 'Plague', 'Play', 'Population', 'Pregnancy', 'Principal Investigator', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Questionnaires', 'Rattus', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Relative (related person)', 'Request for Applications', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Schools', 'Score', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Sheep', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Sum', 'Supplementation', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Time', 'Toddler', 'Ukraine', 'Ultrasonography', 'Woman', 'Work', 'alcohol effect', 'alcohol exposure', 'alcohol sensitivity', 'analog', 'base', 'brain behavior', 'brain morphology', 'cognitive control', 'critical developmental period', 'data integration', 'drinking', 'executive function', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'in utero', 'infancy', 'literacy', 'mouse model', 'multidisciplinary', 'neurobehavior', 'neurobehavioral', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropsychological', 'northern plains', 'novel', 'prenatal', 'programs', 'prospective', 'psychologic', 'reconstruction', 'social', 'statistics', 'three dimensional structure', 'tool']",NIAAA,SAN DIEGO STATE UNIVERSITY,U01,2008,651718,0.14354219419901942
"Mapping the Brain, the Face and Neurocognitive Function in FASD (U01)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This new application is part of the competitive renewal for the ""Collaborative Initiative on Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (CIFASD)"". One of the overall goals of the entire CIFASD during this renewal period is to determine if innovative techniques can be used to identify brain alterations, neurobehavioral deficits and facial characteristics and relationships between these variables to help define prenatal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). To help address this overarching question, we will use quantitative brain mapping techniques with high-resolution structural and functional MRI collected both cross-sectionally and longitudinally from 80 FASD children evaluated across 3 multi-cultural data collection sites (San Diego, Los Angeles and Capetown, South Africa). While this brain imaging project can independently achieve some of the goals of the CIFASD by identifying brain structural and functional abnormalities across the broad spectrum of FASD, critically this funding opportunity will allow the assessment of relationships between the brain, neurocognitive deficits and facial dysmorphology through our active collaborations with the neurobehavioral project (Mattson PI), the facial imaging project (Foroud PI), and the dysmorphology core (Jones PI). Controlled animal studies are essential to determine timing and dosages of prenatal alcohol that result in FASD, but human imaging studies are essential to corroborate anatomical findings across species. Through our association with the UCLA Laboratory of Neuro Imaging, we have access to state-of-the-art brain mapping tools that allow the morphological evaluation of any brain structure that can be identified with MRI. Thus, we are in a unique position to allow findings in animal studies to drive hypothesis-based analyses in the human imaging data. The proposed longitudinal project will highlight how an integrated approach relating neurobehavioral, functional and structural brain imaging data, and measures of facial morphology might yield important new insights on the complex nature of brain-behavior interactions and how they are altered by prenatal alcohol exposure. To our knowledge, this will be the first study to undertake such challenges, and participation, in the CIFASD is essential to address our specific aims. Ultimately, as part of the CIFASD, this project will enhance the capability for definitive FASD diagnoses that, in turn, will help clinicians manage and treat neurobehavioral deficits and associated secondary disabilities.           n/a","Mapping the Brain, the Face and Neurocognitive Function in FASD (U01)",7502725,U01AA017122,"['Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adolescent Development', 'Affect', 'Africa', 'Age', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohol-Related Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Alcohols', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Arts', 'Basic Science', 'Behavioral', 'Binding Sites', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Brain Mapping', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain region', 'Calibration', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Choline', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Control Animal', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dietary Intervention', 'Disease', 'Disorder by Site', 'Dorsal', 'Drug Design', 'Dysmorphology', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Elements', 'Emotional', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Ethanol', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Ethnic group', 'Evaluation', 'Face', 'Fetal Alcohol Exposure', 'Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder', 'Fetal Alcohol Syndrome', 'Frequencies', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Funding Opportunities', 'Future', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Infant Development', 'Inferior', 'Informal Social Control', 'Informatics', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Language', 'Language Development', 'Lead', 'Length', 'Life', 'Los Angeles', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Moscow', 'Mothers', 'Mus', 'Nature', 'Neonatal', 'Neural Cell Adhesion Molecule L1', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurocognitive Deficit', 'New Mexico', 'Outcome', 'Parietal', 'Parietal Lobe', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Pregnancy', 'Principal Investigator', 'Productivity', 'Rattus', 'Recording of previous events', 'Relative (related person)', 'Request for Applications', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Scheme', 'Schools', 'Score', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Shapes', 'Sheep', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'South Africa', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Sum', 'Supplementation', 'Surface', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Thick', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Time', 'Toddler', 'Ukraine', 'Ultrasonography', 'Verbal Learning', 'Visual', 'Woman', 'Work', 'alcohol exposure', 'alcohol sensitivity', 'analog', 'base', 'brain behavior', 'brain morphology', 'brain size', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive function', 'critical developmental period', 'data integration', 'disability', 'dosage', 'drinking', 'follow-up', 'frontal lobe', 'gray matter', 'human study', 'improved', 'in utero', 'in vivo', 'infancy', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'literacy', 'mouse model', 'multidisciplinary', 'neurobehavioral', 'neurodevelopment', 'northern plains', 'novel', 'postnatal', 'prenatal', 'prenatal exposure', 'programs', 'prospective', 'reconstruction', 'relating to nervous system', 'social', 'three dimensional structure', 'tool']",NIAAA,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,U01,2008,474412,0.0803965167179602
"Translational Studies of FASD Using a Sheep Model-U01    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The main goals of this consortium are to identify sources of variation in fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) phenotypes (facial dysmorphology, structural brain damage and neurobehavioral functional deficits), to advance understanding of structure-function relationships, to improve diagnosis and early identification of FASD, and to develop early interventions that may limit adverse outcomes in at-risk pregnancies. Animal models are essential to those goals. This project proposes a novel sheep model that is especially well suited for experimental translational studies of FASD. In utero brain development in sheep matches human brain development relatively well, and prenatal binge alcohol exposure in sheep produces brain and behavioral effects consistent with FASD. There are two long-term objectives for this project. The first is to use the sheep model to compare the effects of binge-like alcohol exposure during the period of brain development comparable to that of the human first trimester (1st-trimester mode/) with similar binge-like exposure that extends over the stages of brain development encompassing all three human trimesters (3-trimester model). These studies evaluate phenotypic measures used in the diagnosis of fetal alcohol syndrome-growth, facial dysmorphology, and brain and behavioral development-using methods derived explicitly from and collaboratively linked directly to approaches applied in the human components of the consortium. These studies test the general hypothesis that more pervasive effects on brain and neurobehavioral development will result from binge exposure that continues after the first trimester. Aim 1 will evaluate growth, facial morphometry, and effects on in vivo brain regional volumes using structural magnetic resonance imaging. Aim 2 will assess neurobehavioral outcomes using eyeblink classical conditioning and spatial working memory. Aim 3 will assess neuroanatomical effects via neuronal counts in the cerebellum, hippocampal formation, and brainstem serotonin system. These studies are designed to inter-relate with and reciprocally inform four of the human projects [Facial Imaging (Foroud), Brain Imaging (Sowell), Neurobehavioral project (Mattson), and the Risk Factors/Nutrition project (Chambers)] and the two mouse basic science projects (Zhou; Sulik). The second objective (Aim 4) is to test the hypothesis that choline supplementation initiated periconceptually will attenuate the adverse effects of alcohol exposure in the 3-trimester sheep model. This study was designed with explicit and complementary collaboration with the choline-supplementation projects in rats [the basic science developmental project using rats (Thomas)] and in humans [Risk Factor/Nutrition project of Chambers/Keen]. This sheep model provides a unique opportunity to bridge the basic and clinical   arms of the consortium more closely than has been achieved in the past.           n/a",Translational Studies of FASD Using a Sheep Model-U01,7503981,U01AA017120,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adverse effects', 'Affect', 'Africa', 'Age', 'Age-Months', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohol-Related Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Alcohols', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Attenuated', 'Basic Science', 'Behavioral', 'Binding Sites', 'Biology', 'Birth', 'Blinking', 'Brain', 'Brain Injuries', 'Brain Stem', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain region', 'Cells', 'Cerebellar Nuclei', 'Cerebellum', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Choline', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Complement', 'Condition', 'Count', 'Data', 'Depth', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dietary Intervention', 'Dose', 'Drug Design', 'Dysmorphology', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Elements', 'Emotional', 'Ethanol', 'Ethnic group', 'Experimental Animal Model', 'Face', 'Fetal Alcohol Exposure', 'Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder', 'Fetal Alcohol Syndrome', 'First Pregnancy Trimester', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Hippocampal Formation', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Infant Development', 'Informal Social Control', 'Informatics', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Language Development', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Link', 'Los Angeles', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Microcephaly', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Moscow', 'Mothers', 'Mus', 'Neonatal', 'Neural Cell Adhesion Molecule L1', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurons', 'New Mexico', 'Numbers', 'Outcome', 'Partner in relationship', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Population', 'Pregnancy', 'Principal Investigator', 'Rattus', 'Recording of previous events', 'Request for Applications', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Rodent', 'Rodent Model', 'Role', 'Schools', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Serotonin', 'Severities', 'Sheep', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Source', 'Specificity', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Sum', 'Supplementation', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Time', 'Toddler', 'Ukraine', 'Ultrasonography', 'Upper arm', 'Variant', 'Woman', 'Work', 'alcohol exposure', 'alcohol sensitivity', 'analog', 'base', 'binge drinking', 'brain behavior', 'brain morphology', 'brain volume', 'classical conditioning', 'cognitive control', 'conditioning', 'critical developmental period', 'data integration', 'dentate gyrus', 'design', 'drinking', 'fetal diagnosis', 'follow-up', 'granule cell', 'hippocampal pyramidal neuron', 'improved', 'in utero', 'in vivo', 'infancy', 'literacy', 'morphometry', 'mouse model', 'multidisciplinary', 'neurobehavioral', 'neurobehavioral test', 'neuron loss', 'northern plains', 'novel', 'nutrition', 'postnatal', 'prenatal', 'prevent', 'programs', 'prospective', 'reconstruction', 'research study', 'social', 'species difference', 'three dimensional structure', 'translational study']",NIAAA,TEXAS A&M AGRILIFE RESEARCH,U01,2008,260772,0.10403619346177251
"MAGNETIC RESONANCE AND DIFFUSION TENSOR IMAGING OF A MOUSE FASD MODEL U01    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD), significant components of which are Central Nervous System (CMS) and craniofacial abnormalities, are a major public health problem. While eliminating FASD is the ultimate goal for both clinical and basic FASD research, we recognize that in the near future, adverse effects from prenatal ethanol exposure will persist. To better diagnose and treat affected individuals, a more complete understanding of the full spectrum of the ethanol-induced abnormalities is needed. The proposed investigations are designed to integrate with those of other consortium members in meeting this need. For this work, both high resolution Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), which can provide 29 micron (or less) isotropic scans and subsequent accurate 3-D reconstructions and segmental analyses, and Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI), which allows CMS fiber tract analyses, will be applied to the study of an FASD mouse model. Previous research utilizing this model has established critical exposure times that yield facial and CNS abnormalities that are consistent with full-blown Fetal Alcohol Syndrome, as well as other components of FASD. The proposed studies will employ this model and both acute and chronic ethanol treatment paradigms to test the overall hypothesis that in mice, ethanol induces structural abnormalities of the brain and face that are consistent with and informative for those in human FASD. To this end, utilizing MRI and DTI as high throughput screening platforms, we propose to address the following specific aims : 1) to provide comprehensive documentation and discovery of the ethanol-induced CNS dysmorphology that results from prenatal ethanol exposure at embryonic and early fetal stages of development; 2) to define the facial dysmorphology that results from prenatal ethanol exposure during embryonic and/or early fetal stages and to relate their character and severity to accompanying abnormalities of the brain; and 3) to identify regions other than the brain or face that may serve as diagnostic indicators of prenatal ethanol exposure. The results of the proposed studies will be compared to those of corresponding investigations by other consortium members. It is expected that the structural abnormalities of the brain and face that are induced by ethanol in mice will reflect the pattern of defects observed in children with FASD, will inform human diagnostic tests, and will provide new information that will be helpful in reducing the incidence of FASD.           n/a",MAGNETIC RESONANCE AND DIFFUSION TENSOR IMAGING OF A MOUSE FASD MODEL U01,7502729,U01AA017124,"['3-Dimensional', 'A Mouse', 'Acoustic Nerve', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adverse effects', 'Affect', 'Africa', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohol-Related Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Alcohols', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Back', 'Basic Science', 'Behavioral', 'Binding Sites', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Cell Death', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Choline', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Complement', 'Consult', 'Craniofacial Abnormalities', 'Data', 'Data Files', 'Data Storage and Retrieval', 'Databases', 'Defect', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Diet', 'Dietary Intervention', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Dimensions', 'Disease model', 'Documentation', 'Dose', 'Drug Design', 'Dysmorphology', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Elements', 'Embryo', 'Embryonic Development', 'Emotional', 'End Point', 'Ethanol', 'Ethnic group', 'Face', 'Female', 'Fertilization', 'Fetal Alcohol Exposure', 'Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder', 'Fetal Alcohol Syndrome', 'Fetus', 'Fiber', 'First Pregnancy Trimester', 'Fostering', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Goals', 'Hearing Tests', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imagery', 'Incidence', 'Indiana', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Infant Development', 'Informal Social Control', 'Informatics', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Laboratory Animals', 'Labyrinth', 'Language', 'Language Development', 'Life', 'Liquid substance', 'Literature', 'Los Angeles', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Menstruation', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Moscow', 'Mothers', 'Mus', 'Nasal septum structure', 'Neonatal', 'Neural Cell Adhesion Molecule L1', 'Neuraxis', 'Neurobiology', 'New Mexico', 'Optic Nerve', 'Optics', 'Outcome', 'Partner in relationship', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Phenotype', 'Photography', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Population', 'Pregnancy', 'Prevention', 'Principal Investigator', 'Prosencephalon', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Range', 'Rattus', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reproduction', 'Request for Applications', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Retrieval', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Schools', 'Screening procedure', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Severities', 'Sheep', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'Specimen', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'Sum', 'Supplementation', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Time', 'Toddler', 'Ukraine', 'Ultrasonography', 'Universities', 'Week', 'Woman', 'Work', 'alcohol effect', 'alcohol exposure', 'alcohol sensitivity', 'analog', 'base', 'brain behavior', 'brain morphology', 'cognitive control', 'computer generated', 'craniofacial', 'critical developmental period', 'data integration', 'day', 'design', 'dosage', 'drinking', 'fetal', 'follow-up', 'high throughput screening', 'human data', 'human study', 'human subject', 'improved', 'in utero', 'infancy', 'interest', 'intraperitoneal', 'literacy', 'malformation', 'member', 'membranous labyrinth', 'mouse model', 'multidisciplinary', 'neurobehavioral', 'northern plains', 'novel', 'prenatal', 'prenatal exposure', 'programs', 'prospective', 'reconstruction', 'response', 'sensory system', 'size', 'social', 'symposium', 'three dimensional structure']",NIAAA,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,U01,2008,234161,0.07588709656822407
"Spectrum of and Nutritional Risk Factors for FASD in Russia and Ukraine    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD), first described in the U.S. in 1973 by Jones and Smith, encompasses a pattern of structural abnormalities, growth deficiency, and neurobehavioral impairment that occurs in the offspring of women who consume moderate to heavy amounts of alcohol in pregnancy. FASD is thought to represent the leading known preventable causes of neurobehavioral impairment in the U.S. and perhaps throughout the world. The proposed study offers the opportunity within the Collaborative Initiative on Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (CIFASD) consortium of projects to describe the spectrum of alcoholrelated effects, to identify risk factors that are antecedent to pregnancy outcome, to test within-pregnancy interventions, and also to test methods that will allow for earlier identification of alcohol-related birth outcomes. Specifically, the proposed research will utilize a prospective cohort study design involving pregnant women and their offspring recruited in Russia and Ukraine to address major gaps in knowledge about FASD by accomplishing the following specific aims: 1) to more fully delineate the complete range of expression of FASD in relation to specific quantities, patterns and gestational timing of alcohol exposure, and to evaluate the sensitivity of methods for earlier recognition of affected children; 2) to assess the contribution of maternal nutritional status in relation to physical and neurobehavioral outcomes associated with prenatal alcohol exposure, and to test the benefit of maternal second and third trimester supplementation with multinutrients with or without choline with respect to risk for FASD in the offspring; and 3) in collaboration with other CIFASD investigators, to provide a well-characterized sample of mothers/children with and without prenatal exposure to alcohol for testing of alternative and earlier methods of identifying affected children, including prenatal ultrasound and post-natal 3D facial imaging. The proposed research has public health relevance from the standpoint of providing an improved estimate of the magnitude and scope of alcoholrelated developmental problems in the context of specific quantities and patterns of prenatal alcohol exposure using standardized methods for assessment, and from the standpoint of developing and validating critically necessary clinical methods for improved and early recognition of affected children and testing the potential benefit of a reasonably applied prenatal intervention that may help ameliorate negative outcomes.          n/a",Spectrum of and Nutritional Risk Factors for FASD in Russia and Ukraine,7502741,U01AA014835,"['Address', 'Adolescent', 'Affect', 'Africa', 'Age-Months', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohol-Related Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Alcohols', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Basic Science', 'Behavioral', 'Binding Sites', 'Biology', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Child health care', 'Choline', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Cohort Studies', 'Collaborations', 'Congenital Abnormality', 'Coordination and Collaboration', 'Data', 'Developed Countries', 'Developing Countries', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dietary Intervention', 'Documentation', 'Dose', 'Drug Design', 'Dysmorphology', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Economics', 'Elements', 'Emerging Technologies', 'Emotional', 'Ethanol', 'Ethnic group', 'Exposure to', 'Face', 'Fetal Alcohol Exposure', 'Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder', 'Fetal Alcohol Syndrome', 'Fetus', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Gender Role', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Gestational Age', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Heavy Drinking', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Infant Development', 'Informal Social Control', 'Informatics', 'Intake', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Trial', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Language Development', 'Life', 'Los Angeles', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Micronutrients', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Mothers', 'Mus', 'Neonatal', 'Neural Cell Adhesion Molecule L1', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurodevelopmental Deficit', 'New Mexico', 'Numbers', 'Nutrient', 'Nutritional', 'Nutritional status', 'Outcome', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Patient currently pregnant', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Population', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Outcome', 'Pregnancy Trimesters', 'Pregnant Women', 'Prevalence', 'Principal Investigator', 'Process', 'Prospective Studies', 'Public Health', 'Purpose', 'Range', 'Rate', 'Rattus', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Regulation', 'Relative (related person)', 'Reporting', 'Request for Applications', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Estimate', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Russia', 'Sampling', 'Schools', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Sheep', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'Spontaneous abortion', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Structure', 'Sudden infant death syndrome', 'Sum', 'Supplementation', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Thinking', 'Third Pregnancy Trimester', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Time', 'Toddler', 'Translational Research', 'Ukraine', 'Ultrasonography', 'Weight Gain', 'Woman', 'Work', 'World Health Organization', 'absorption', 'alcohol consumption during pregnancy', 'alcohol exposure', 'alcohol related problem', 'alcohol sensitivity', 'alcohol testing', 'analog', 'base', 'brain behavior', 'brain morphology', 'cognitive control', 'cohort', 'compare effectiveness', 'critical developmental period', 'data integration', 'drinking', 'fetal', 'follow-up', 'human subject', 'improved', 'in utero', 'infancy', 'literacy', 'mouse model', 'multidisciplinary', 'neurobehavior', 'neurobehavioral', 'northern plains', 'novel', 'performance site', 'postnatal', 'prenatal', 'prenatal exposure', 'prenatal intervention', 'processing speed', 'programs', 'prospective', 'reconstruction', 'skills', 'social', 'stillbirth', 'three dimensional structure']",NIAAA,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",U01,2008,690277,0.18059053334079356
"Mouse Model Neuro-Facial Dysmorphology: Tanslational and Treatment Studies    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) occurs in children born to women who drink alcohol heavily during pregnancy and is one of the leading non-hereditary causes of mental retardation in the Western World. It is estimated that the prevalence of FAS in the general U.S. population is between 0.5 and 2.0 per 1,000 births, while the undiagnosed population with variable facial and brain dysmorphology described as fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) is estimated to be 10 times higher. The difficulty in the diagnosis of FASD involves misdiagnosis due to the presence or absence of the typical facial dysmorphology in association with brain dysfunction. Accurate diagnosis is further complicated by the lack of information about the contribution of dose, frequency, and timing of alcohol exposure during pregnancy to variation in facial dysmorphology. In this project, a mouse model that models human consumption and is known to produce FAS-like features resulting from prenatal alcohol exposure, will be used to test the effects of differences in dose and timing of alcohol exposure on face and brain development. A combination of 3D imaging that includes Micro-video and micro-resonance imaging (MRI) will be used to capture the detailed facial structure, micro-computational tomography (Micro-CT) to capture the underlying facial bone, MRI for detailed brain dimensions, and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) for nerve fiber tracks in the fetal period. A novel computational program will be compiled to detect features specifically as function of alcohol exposure. The association and dissociation of facial and brain dysmorphology as a function of dose and timing of alcohol exposure will be analyzed to better inform the diagnosis of FAS/ FASD. These studies will be a collaboration sharing resources and methods and will be performed across both Basic and Clinical Science components in consortium effort. To date there is no cure for FAS/FASD, which is a life long ordeal from the birth. Experimental tests, using the above model and setting, of trophic peptides which have been known to prevent neurodegeneration in trials for Alzheimer Disease and protect cell death in embryonic stage, have been partially tested in the embryonic period to show protection against the alcohol-induced retardation. The new studies will test whether the trophic peptides can prevent alcohol-induced brain and facial dysmorphology as well as behavioral impairment known to occur in FAS.          n/a",Mouse Model Neuro-Facial Dysmorphology: Tanslational and Treatment Studies,7502713,U01AA017123,"['Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adopted', 'Affect', 'Africa', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohol-Related Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Alcohols', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Basic Science', 'Behavioral', 'Binding Sites', 'Biology', 'Birth', 'Blood alcohol level measurement', 'Bone and Cartilage Funding', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'C57BL/6 Mouse', 'CDKN1A gene', 'Cell Death', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Choline', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Collaborations', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer software', 'Computer-Assisted Image Analysis', 'Consumption', 'Count', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diet', 'Dietary Intervention', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Dimensions', 'Disruption', 'Dissociation', 'Dose', 'Drug Design', 'Dysmorphology', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Elements', 'Embryo', 'Emotional', 'Ethanol', 'Ethnic group', 'Evaluation', 'Experimental Animal Model', 'Face', 'Fetal Alcohol Exposure', 'Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder', 'Fetal Alcohol Syndrome', 'Fiber', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Gestational Age', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging technology', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Infant Development', 'Informal Social Control', 'Informatics', 'Inherited', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Language Development', 'Length', 'Life', 'Liquid substance', 'Los Angeles', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental Retardation', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Moscow', 'Mothers', 'Mus', 'NAPVSIPQ peptide', 'Neonatal', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Nerve Fibers', 'Neural Cell Adhesion Molecule L1', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurons', 'New Mexico', 'Oral', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient currently pregnant', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Peptides', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Population', 'Pregnancy', 'Prevalence', 'Principal Investigator', 'Rattus', 'Recording of previous events', 'Request for Applications', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Resource Sharing', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Schools', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Sheep', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Skeleton', 'Source', 'Specificity', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'Sum', 'Supplementation', 'Surface', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Time', 'Toddler', 'Ukraine', 'Ultrasonography', 'Variant', 'Vibrissae', 'Western World', 'Woman', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'alcohol effect', 'alcohol exposure', 'alcohol sensitivity', 'analog', 'brain behavior', 'brain morphology', 'brain volume', 'clinical application', 'cognitive control', 'craniofacial', 'critical developmental period', 'data integration', 'day', 'design', 'digital imaging', 'drinking', 'face bone structure', 'fetal', 'follow-up', 'human study', 'image reconstruction', 'improved', 'in utero', 'infancy', 'literacy', 'morphometry', 'morris water maze', 'mouse model', 'multidisciplinary', 'neurobehavioral', 'neurochemistry', 'neuroimaging', 'neurotrophic factor', 'northern plains', 'novel', 'oncoprotein p21', 'peptide analog', 'postnatal', 'prenatal', 'prevent', 'programs', 'prospective', 'relating to nervous system', 'sensory cortex', 'social', 'tomography', 'translational study', 'young adult']",NIAAA,INDIANA UNIV-PURDUE UNIV AT INDIANAPOLIS,U01,2008,235382,0.08136793639075392
"3D Facial Imaging in FASD (U01)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): During the past three years, members of the Facial Imaging Core have worked with the Consortium to apply novel methods to more effectively diagnose FAS using 3D images from an ethnically diverse sample. These data and their subsequent analyses were used to identify features which consistently and reliably distinguished individuals with a clinical diagnosis of FAS from controls. Based on the initial success of the 'Facial Imaging Core', we now propose an expanded series of aims to be part of a clinical project named '3D Facial Imaging in FASD'. Subsequent work proposed in this study will build on the lessons learned in this first phase of research and utilize improved technology and sampling procedures to extend the diagnostic utility of these novel techniques to a wider range of individuals with prenatal alcohol exposure or FASD. In collaboration with several clinical projects, we will collect a longitudinal, multi-ethnic sample of individuals prenatally exposed to alcohol. This sample will allow us to reliably separate the effects of ethnic variation and developmental age from those due to alcohol exposure. We will also continue to work with the basic science projects to ensure that results in the different species (human, mouse, sheep) are used to inform analyses in each project. The overarching goals of this project are to: Goal 1: improve understanding of the dysmorphic features in FAS and FASD; Goal 2: enhance the capability for definitive diagnosis of FAS and the broader spectrum of FASD at different stages of the lifespan; and Goal 3: establish whether there is a relationship between FAS and FASD dysmorphic features and the specific underlying impairments in brain function.           n/a",3D Facial Imaging in FASD (U01),7342564,U01AA014809,"['Address', 'Adolescent', 'Affect', 'Africa', 'Age', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohol-Related Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Alcohols', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Basic Science', 'Behavioral', 'Binding Sites', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Choline', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dietary Intervention', 'Drug Design', 'Dysmorphology', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Elements', 'Emotional', 'Ensure', 'Ethanol', 'Ethnic group', 'Face', 'Fetal Alcohol Exposure', 'Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder', 'Fetal Alcohol Syndrome', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Infant Development', 'Informal Social Control', 'Informatics', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Language Development', 'Lasers', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Longevity', 'Los Angeles', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Moscow', 'Mothers', 'Mus', 'Names', 'Neonatal', 'Neural Cell Adhesion Molecule L1', 'Neurobiology', 'New Mexico', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Pregnancy', 'Principal Investigator', 'Procedures', 'Range', 'Rattus', 'Recording of previous events', 'Request for Applications', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Schools', 'Scientist', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Series', 'Sheep', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'Sum', 'Supplementation', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Time', 'Toddler', 'Translating', 'Ukraine', 'Ultrasonography', 'Variant', 'Woman', 'Work', 'alcohol exposure', 'alcohol sensitivity', 'analog', 'base', 'brain behavior', 'brain morphology', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinically relevant', 'cognitive control', 'craniofacial', 'critical developmental period', 'data integration', 'disorder control', 'drinking', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'in utero', 'infancy', 'literacy', 'member', 'mouse model', 'multidisciplinary', 'neurobehavioral', 'northern plains', 'novel', 'prenatal', 'prenatal exposure', 'programs', 'prospective', 'reconstruction', 'social', 'success', 'three dimensional structure']",NIAAA,INDIANA UNIV-PURDUE UNIV AT INDIANAPOLIS,U01,2007,359361,0.05101493058823187
"Dysmorphology Core - U24    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Since 1973 when the specific pattern of malformation referred to as the Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS) was first delineated, it has become clear that prenatal alcohol exposure is associated with a broad spectrum of structural anomalies as well as neurobehavioral deficits now referred to as the Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD). However, the full range of structural anomalies in children prenatally exposed to alcohol is unknown and the incidence of specific anomalies or clusters of anomalies associated with specific patterns of prenatal alcohol consumption are poorly understood. Over the previous three years of the Consortium, the Dysmorphology Core has established a standard comprehensive protocol for physical evaluation of children in order to assure consistency in identification of the broad spectrum of features that constitute FASD at all sites. We propose to continue to support these activities throughout the renewal period in children during the first year of life at Consortium sites in prospective studies in Moscow Region, Russia, and Rivne, Ukraine as well as in older children in retrospective studies in Los Angeles, CA, San Diego, CA, Albuquerque, NM, the Northern Plains states, Atlanta, GA, and Cape Town, South Africa. Identification of large numbers of children at various ages with FAS as well as those with some features of the disorder but not enough to presently qualify them for that diagnosis (FASD), each of whom has received a standardized clinical examination, as well as neurobehavioral evaluation, neuroimaging studies, 3D photographs and, in the prospective studies, prenatal ultrasound studies, will provide the opportunity to address hypotheses regarding the relationship between FASD-related structural defects identified through the standard physical examination with complementary diagnostic methods that are being tested in other Consortium projects. The specific aims of this project are to assure consistency as well as accuracy in recognition of FASD at all CIFASD project sites where children are being evaluated; to delineate the full range of structural anomalies in children prenatally exposed to alcohol in order to determine the boundaries that encompass FASD in prospective as well as retrospective studies involved in the Consortium; to identify specific structural features or clusters of features that are predictive of or correlated with deficits in neurobehavioral development across developmental ages spanning from infancy to adolescence; to correlate the specific structural features or clusters of features identified on the CIFASD standard physical examination with alternative or complementary methods that are being tested in other CIFASD projects; and to better understand the extent to which structural features of FASD are related to specific defects in the development of the brain.          n/a",Dysmorphology Core - U24,7345662,U24AA014815,"['Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Affect', 'Africa', 'Age', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohol-Related Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Alcohols', 'All Sites', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Basic Science', 'Behavioral', 'Binding Sites', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Choline', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Data', 'Defect', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Dietary Intervention', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Drug Design', 'Dysmorphology', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Elements', 'Emotional', 'Ethanol', 'Ethnic group', 'Evaluation', 'Exposure to', 'Face', 'Fetal Alcohol Exposure', 'Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder', 'Fetal Alcohol Syndrome', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Impairment', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Infant Development', 'Informal Social Control', 'Informatics', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Language Development', 'Life', 'Los Angeles', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Mexico', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Moscow', 'Mothers', 'Mus', 'Neonatal', 'Neural Cell Adhesion Molecule L1', 'Neurobiology', 'Numbers', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Physical Examination', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Pregnancy', 'Prevalence', 'Principal Investigator', 'Prospective Studies', 'Protocols documentation', 'Qualifying', 'Range', 'Rattus', 'Recording of previous events', 'Relative (related person)', 'Request for Applications', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Role', 'Russia', 'Schools', 'Science', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Sheep', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'South Africa', 'Specificity', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Structure', 'Sum', 'Supplementation', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Time', 'Toddler', 'Training', 'Ukraine', 'Ultrasonography', 'Woman', 'Work', 'alcohol exposure', 'alcohol sensitivity', 'analog', 'brain behavior', 'brain morphology', 'cognitive control', 'critical developmental period', 'data integration', 'drinking', 'fetal', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'in utero', 'infancy', 'literacy', 'malformation', 'member', 'mouse model', 'multidisciplinary', 'neurobehavioral', 'neurobehavioral test', 'neuroimaging', 'northern plains', 'novel', 'pediatrician', 'prenatal', 'programs', 'prospective', 'reconstruction', 'social', 'three dimensional structure']",NIAAA,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA,U24,2007,153891,0.128149211349802
"A Multisite Neurobehavioral Assessment of Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This application is part of the competitive renewal for the ""Collaborative Initiative on Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (CIFASD)"" (Notice RFA-AA-03-004) to continue and expand the current multidisciplinary CIFASD. This RFA calls for, in part, research aimed at ""improved diagnosis"" and ""enhanced understanding of the domains of neurobehavioral impairment"" of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). Although 30 years of research have identified myriad deficits in individuals with FASD, most neuropsychological studies are plagued by the question of global dysfunction vs. a pattern of relative sparing and impaired function. Delineation of a neuropsychological profile has been the subject of much recent debate. Limited research, including the current CIFASD consortium, has examined if prenatal alcohol exposure results in general dysfunction or a more specific neurobehavioral profile of strengths and weaknesses. The primary aim of this project is to determine whether a neurobehavioral phenotype exists in children with fetal alcohol syndrome, whether the same phenotype exists in children with FASD who lack facial dysmorphology, and whether the phenotype can be used for differential diagnosis. Secondary aims, involving collaboration with other CIFASD projects and cores, are to determine the relationship between brain dysmorphology, facial dysmorphology, and neurobehavioral function. These aims are in keeping with the overall aims of the CIFASD, including enhanced understanding of the neurobehavioral phenotype and establishment of standardized diagnostic criteria and methods of assessment of FASD. A standard neurobehavioral protocol will be administered to four groups of children at six sites and will address the functional domains of executive function, working memory, verbal function, and psychological symptomatology. In addition to children with FASD and nonexposed controls, children with low IQ scores or ADHD will be included as contrast samples. Using this heterogeneous sample and multivariate statistical methods, neurobehavioral profile specific to FASD will be sought. In addition, participants will be assessed using methodology prescribed by the Dysmorphology Core and the facial and brain imaging projects of the CIFASD. Data from three broad domains (neurobehavior, dysmorphology, and brain morphology and function) will be analyzed both separately and together to address the main aim of the CIFASD: improving the diagnostic criteria for FASD. This project is directly relevant to public health concerns surrounding the effects of heavy prenatal alcohol exposure, improving diagnosis of alcohol-affected individuals, and defining the profile of neurobehavioral effects that are specific to FASD. Improved identification and delineation of these features will ultimately lead to improved treatment.           n/a",A Multisite Neurobehavioral Assessment of Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders,7343382,U01AA014834,"['Address', 'Adolescent', 'Affect', 'Africa', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohol-Related Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Alcohols', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Basic Science', 'Behavioral', 'Binding Sites', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Choline', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Condition', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dietary Intervention', 'Differential Diagnosis', 'Drug Design', 'Dysmorphology', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Elements', 'Emotional', 'Ensure', 'Ethanol', 'Ethnic group', 'Evaluation', 'Face', 'Fetal Alcohol Exposure', 'Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder', 'Fetal Alcohol Syndrome', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Infant Development', 'Informal Social Control', 'Informatics', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Language Development', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Los Angeles', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Moscow', 'Mothers', 'Mus', 'Neonatal', 'Neural Cell Adhesion Molecule L1', 'Neurobiology', 'Neuropsychological Tests', 'New Mexico', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Phenotype', 'Pilot Projects', 'Plague', 'Play', 'Population', 'Pregnancy', 'Principal Investigator', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Questionnaires', 'Rattus', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Relative (related person)', 'Request for Applications', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Schools', 'Score', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Sheep', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Sum', 'Supplementation', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Time', 'Toddler', 'Ukraine', 'Ultrasonography', 'Woman', 'Work', 'alcohol effect', 'alcohol exposure', 'alcohol sensitivity', 'analog', 'base', 'brain behavior', 'brain morphology', 'cognitive control', 'critical developmental period', 'data integration', 'drinking', 'executive function', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'in utero', 'infancy', 'literacy', 'mouse model', 'multidisciplinary', 'neurobehavior', 'neurobehavioral', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropsychological', 'northern plains', 'novel', 'prenatal', 'programs', 'prospective', 'psychologic', 'reconstruction', 'social', 'statistics', 'three dimensional structure', 'tool']",NIAAA,SAN DIEGO STATE UNIVERSITY,U01,2007,740297,0.14354219419901942
"Mapping the Brain, the Face and Neurocognitive Function in FASD (U01)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This new application is part of the competitive renewal for the ""Collaborative Initiative on Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (CIFASD)"". One of the overall goals of the entire CIFASD during this renewal period is to determine if innovative techniques can be used to identify brain alterations, neurobehavioral deficits and facial characteristics and relationships between these variables to help define prenatal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). To help address this overarching question, we will use quantitative brain mapping techniques with high-resolution structural and functional MRI collected both cross-sectionally and longitudinally from 80 FASD children evaluated across 3 multi-cultural data collection sites (San Diego, Los Angeles and Capetown, South Africa). While this brain imaging project can independently achieve some of the goals of the CIFASD by identifying brain structural and functional abnormalities across the broad spectrum of FASD, critically this funding opportunity will allow the assessment of relationships between the brain, neurocognitive deficits and facial dysmorphology through our active collaborations with the neurobehavioral project (Mattson PI), the facial imaging project (Foroud PI), and the dysmorphology core (Jones PI). Controlled animal studies are essential to determine timing and dosages of prenatal alcohol that result in FASD, but human imaging studies are essential to corroborate anatomical findings across species. Through our association with the UCLA Laboratory of Neuro Imaging, we have access to state-of-the-art brain mapping tools that allow the morphological evaluation of any brain structure that can be identified with MRI. Thus, we are in a unique position to allow findings in animal studies to drive hypothesis-based analyses in the human imaging data. The proposed longitudinal project will highlight how an integrated approach relating neurobehavioral, functional and structural brain imaging data, and measures of facial morphology might yield important new insights on the complex nature of brain-behavior interactions and how they are altered by prenatal alcohol exposure. To our knowledge, this will be the first study to undertake such challenges, and participation, in the CIFASD is essential to address our specific aims. Ultimately, as part of the CIFASD, this project will enhance the capability for definitive FASD diagnoses that, in turn, will help clinicians manage and treat neurobehavioral deficits and associated secondary disabilities.           n/a","Mapping the Brain, the Face and Neurocognitive Function in FASD (U01)",7343320,U01AA017122,"['Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adolescent Development', 'Affect', 'Africa', 'Age', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohol-Related Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Alcohols', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Arts', 'Basic Science', 'Behavioral', 'Binding Sites', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Brain Mapping', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain region', 'Calibration', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Choline', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Control Animal', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dietary Intervention', 'Disease', 'Disorder by Site', 'Dorsal', 'Drug Design', 'Dysmorphology', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Elements', 'Emotional', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Ethanol', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Ethnic group', 'Evaluation', 'Face', 'Fetal Alcohol Exposure', 'Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder', 'Fetal Alcohol Syndrome', 'Frequencies', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Funding Opportunities', 'Future', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Infant Development', 'Inferior', 'Informal Social Control', 'Informatics', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Language', 'Language Development', 'Lead', 'Length', 'Life', 'Los Angeles', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Moscow', 'Mothers', 'Mus', 'Nature', 'Neonatal', 'Neural Cell Adhesion Molecule L1', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurocognitive Deficit', 'New Mexico', 'Outcome', 'Parietal', 'Parietal Lobe', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Pregnancy', 'Principal Investigator', 'Productivity', 'Rattus', 'Recording of previous events', 'Relative (related person)', 'Request for Applications', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Scheme', 'Schools', 'Score', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Shapes', 'Sheep', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'South Africa', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Sum', 'Supplementation', 'Surface', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Thick', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Time', 'Toddler', 'Ukraine', 'Ultrasonography', 'Verbal Learning', 'Visual', 'Woman', 'Work', 'alcohol exposure', 'alcohol sensitivity', 'analog', 'base', 'brain behavior', 'brain morphology', 'brain size', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive function', 'critical developmental period', 'data integration', 'disability', 'dosage', 'drinking', 'follow-up', 'frontal lobe', 'gray matter', 'human study', 'improved', 'in utero', 'in vivo', 'infancy', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'literacy', 'mouse model', 'multidisciplinary', 'neurobehavioral', 'neurodevelopment', 'northern plains', 'novel', 'postnatal', 'prenatal', 'prenatal exposure', 'programs', 'prospective', 'reconstruction', 'relating to nervous system', 'social', 'three dimensional structure', 'tool']",NIAAA,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,U01,2007,496998,0.0803965167179602
"Translational Studies of FASD Using a Sheep Model-U01    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The main goals of this consortium are to identify sources of variation in fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) phenotypes (facial dysmorphology, structural brain damage and neurobehavioral functional deficits), to advance understanding of structure-function relationships, to improve diagnosis and early identification of FASD, and to develop early interventions that may limit adverse outcomes in at-risk pregnancies. Animal models are essential to those goals. This project proposes a novel sheep model that is especially well suited for experimental translational studies of FASD. In utero brain development in sheep matches human brain development relatively well, and prenatal binge alcohol exposure in sheep produces brain and behavioral effects consistent with FASD. There are two long-term objectives for this project. The first is to use the sheep model to compare the effects of binge-like alcohol exposure during the period of brain development comparable to that of the human first trimester (1st-trimester mode/) with similar binge-like exposure that extends over the stages of brain development encompassing all three human trimesters (3-trimester model). These studies evaluate phenotypic measures used in the diagnosis of fetal alcohol syndrome-growth, facial dysmorphology, and brain and behavioral development-using methods derived explicitly from and collaboratively linked directly to approaches applied in the human components of the consortium. These studies test the general hypothesis that more pervasive effects on brain and neurobehavioral development will result from binge exposure that continues after the first trimester. Aim 1 will evaluate growth, facial morphometry, and effects on in vivo brain regional volumes using structural magnetic resonance imaging. Aim 2 will assess neurobehavioral outcomes using eyeblink classical conditioning and spatial working memory. Aim 3 will assess neuroanatomical effects via neuronal counts in the cerebellum, hippocampal formation, and brainstem serotonin system. These studies are designed to inter-relate with and reciprocally inform four of the human projects [Facial Imaging (Foroud), Brain Imaging (Sowell), Neurobehavioral project (Mattson), and the Risk Factors/Nutrition project (Chambers)] and the two mouse basic science projects (Zhou; Sulik). The second objective (Aim 4) is to test the hypothesis that choline supplementation initiated periconceptually will attenuate the adverse effects of alcohol exposure in the 3-trimester sheep model. This study was designed with explicit and complementary collaboration with the choline-supplementation projects in rats [the basic science developmental project using rats (Thomas)] and in humans [Risk Factor/Nutrition project of Chambers/Keen].

"MAGNETIC RESONANCE AND DIFFUSION TENSOR IMAGING OF A MOUSE FASD MODEL U01    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD), significant components of which are Central Nervous System (CMS) and craniofacial abnormalities, are a major public health problem. While eliminating FASD is the ultimate goal for both clinical and basic FASD research, we recognize that in the near future, adverse effects from prenatal ethanol exposure will persist. To better diagnose and treat affected individuals, a more complete understanding of the full spectrum of the ethanol-induced abnormalities is needed. The proposed investigations are designed to integrate with those of other consortium members in meeting this need. For this work, both high resolution Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), which can provide 29 micron (or less) isotropic scans and subsequent accurate 3-D reconstructions and segmental analyses, and Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI), which allows CMS fiber tract analyses, will be applied to the study of an FASD mouse model. Previous research utilizing this model has established critical exposure times that yield facial and CNS abnormalities that are consistent with full-blown Fetal Alcohol Syndrome, as well as other components of FASD. The proposed studies will employ this model and both acute and chronic ethanol treatment paradigms to test the overall hypothesis that in mice, ethanol induces structural abnormalities of the brain and face that are consistent with and informative for those in human FASD. To this end, utilizing MRI and DTI as high throughput screening platforms, we propose to address the following specific aims : 1) to provide comprehensive documentation and discovery of the ethanol-induced CNS dysmorphology that results from prenatal ethanol exposure at embryonic and early fetal stages of development; 2) to define the facial dysmorphology that results from prenatal ethanol exposure during embryonic and/or early fetal stages and to relate their character and severity to accompanying abnormalities of the brain; and 3) to identify regions other than the brain or face that may serve as diagnostic indicators of prenatal ethanol exposure. The results of the proposed studies will be compared to those of corresponding investigations by other consortium members. It is expected that the structural abnormalities of the brain and face that are induced by ethanol in mice will reflect the pattern of defects observed in children with FASD, will inform human diagnostic tests, and will provide new information that will be helpful in reducing the incidence of FASD.           n/a",MAGNETIC RESONANCE AND DIFFUSION TENSOR IMAGING OF A MOUSE FASD MODEL U01,7343348,U01AA017124,"['3-Dimensional', 'A Mouse', 'Acoustic Nerve', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adverse effects', 'Affect', 'Africa', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohol-Related Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Alcohols', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Back', 'Basic Science', 'Behavioral', 'Binding Sites', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Cell Death', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Choline', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Complement', 'Consult', 'Craniofacial Abnormalities', 'Data', 'Data Files', 'Data Storage and Retrieval', 'Databases', 'Defect', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Diet', 'Dietary Intervention', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Dimensions', 'Disease model', 'Documentation', 'Dose', 'Drug Design', 'Dysmorphology', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Elements', 'Embryo', 'Embryonic Development', 'Emotional', 'End Point', 'Ethanol', 'Ethnic group', 'Face', 'Female', 'Fertilization', 'Fetal Alcohol Exposure', 'Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder', 'Fetal Alcohol Syndrome', 'Fetus', 'Fiber', 'First Pregnancy Trimester', 'Fostering', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Goals', 'Hearing Tests', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imagery', 'Incidence', 'Indiana', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Infant Development', 'Informal Social Control', 'Informatics', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Laboratory Animals', 'Labyrinth', 'Language', 'Language Development', 'Life', 'Liquid substance', 'Literature', 'Los Angeles', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Menstruation', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Moscow', 'Mothers', 'Mus', 'Nasal septum structure', 'Neonatal', 'Neural Cell Adhesion Molecule L1', 'Neuraxis', 'Neurobiology', 'New Mexico', 'Optic Nerve', 'Optics', 'Outcome', 'Partner in relationship', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Phenotype', 'Photography', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Population', 'Pregnancy', 'Prevention', 'Principal Investigator', 'Prosencephalon', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Range', 'Rattus', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reproduction', 'Request for Applications', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Retrieval', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Schools', 'Screening procedure', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Severities', 'Sheep', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'Specimen', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'Sum', 'Supplementation', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Time', 'Toddler', 'Ukraine', 'Ultrasonography', 'Universities', 'Week', 'Woman', 'Work', 'alcohol effect', 'alcohol exposure', 'alcohol sensitivity', 'analog', 'base', 'brain behavior', 'brain morphology', 'cognitive control', 'computer generated', 'craniofacial', 'critical developmental period', 'data integration', 'day', 'design', 'dosage', 'drinking', 'fetal', 'follow-up', 'high throughput screening', 'human data', 'human study', 'human subject', 'improved', 'in utero', 'infancy', 'interest', 'intraperitoneal', 'literacy', 'malformation', 'member', 'membranous labyrinth', 'mouse model', 'multidisciplinary', 'neurobehavioral', 'northern plains', 'novel', 'prenatal', 'prenatal exposure', 'programs', 'prospective', 'reconstruction', 'response', 'sensory system', 'size', 'social', 'symposium', 'three dimensional structure']",NIAAA,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,U01,2007,225000,0.07588709656822407
"Spectrum of and Nutritional Risk Factors for FASD in Russia and Ukraine    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD), first described in the U.S. in 1973 by Jones and Smith, encompasses a pattern of structural abnormalities, growth deficiency, and neurobehavioral impairment that occurs in the offspring of women who consume moderate to heavy amounts of alcohol in pregnancy. FASD is thought to represent the leading known preventable causes of neurobehavioral impairment in the U.S. and perhaps throughout the world. The proposed study offers the opportunity within the Collaborative Initiative on Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (CIFASD) consortium of projects to describe the spectrum of alcoholrelated effects, to identify risk factors that are antecedent to pregnancy outcome, to test within-pregnancy interventions, and also to test methods that will allow for earlier identification of alcohol-related birth outcomes. Specifically, the proposed research will utilize a prospective cohort study design involving pregnant women and their offspring recruited in Russia and Ukraine to address major gaps in knowledge about FASD by accomplishing the following specific aims: 1) to more fully delineate the complete range of expression of FASD in relation to specific quantities, patterns and gestational timing of alcohol exposure, and to evaluate the sensitivity of methods for earlier recognition of affected children; 2) to assess the contribution of maternal nutritional status in relation to physical and neurobehavioral outcomes associated with prenatal alcohol exposure, and to test the benefit of maternal second and third trimester supplementation with multinutrients with or without choline with respect to risk for FASD in the offspring; and 3) in collaboration with other CIFASD investigators, to provide a well-characterized sample of mothers/children with and without prenatal exposure to alcohol for testing of alternative and earlier methods of identifying affected children, including prenatal ultrasound and post-natal 3D facial imaging. The proposed research has public health relevance from the standpoint of providing an improved estimate of the magnitude and scope of alcoholrelated developmental problems in the context of specific quantities and patterns of prenatal alcohol exposure using standardized methods for assessment, and from the standpoint of developing and validating critically necessary clinical methods for improved and early recognition of affected children and testing the potential benefit of a reasonably applied prenatal intervention that may help ameliorate negative outcomes.          n/a",Spectrum of and Nutritional Risk Factors for FASD in Russia and Ukraine,7343353,U01AA014835,"['Address', 'Adolescent', 'Affect', 'Africa', 'Age-Months', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohol-Related Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Alcohols', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Basic Science', 'Behavioral', 'Binding Sites', 'Biology', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Child health care', 'Choline', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Cohort Studies', 'Collaborations', 'Congenital Abnormality', 'Coordination and Collaboration', 'Data', 'Developed Countries', 'Developing Countries', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dietary Intervention', 'Documentation', 'Dose', 'Drug Design', 'Dysmorphology', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Economics', 'Elements', 'Emerging Technologies', 'Emotional', 'Ethanol', 'Ethnic group', 'Exposure to', 'Face', 'Fetal Alcohol Exposure', 'Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder', 'Fetal Alcohol Syndrome', 'Fetus', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Gender Role', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Gestational Age', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Heavy Drinking', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Infant Development', 'Informal Social Control', 'Informatics', 'Intake', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Trial', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Language Development', 'Life', 'Los Angeles', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Micronutrients', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Mothers', 'Mus', 'Neonatal', 'Neural Cell Adhesion Molecule L1', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurodevelopmental Deficit', 'New Mexico', 'Numbers', 'Nutrient', 'Nutritional', 'Nutritional status', 'Outcome', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Patient currently pregnant', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Population', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Outcome', 'Pregnancy Trimesters', 'Pregnant Women', 'Prevalence', 'Principal Investigator', 'Process', 'Prospective Studies', 'Public Health', 'Purpose', 'Range', 'Rate', 'Rattus', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Regulation', 'Relative (related person)', 'Reporting', 'Request for Applications', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Estimate', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Russia', 'Sampling', 'Schools', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Sheep', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'Spontaneous abortion', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Structure', 'Sudden infant death syndrome', 'Sum', 'Supplementation', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Thinking', 'Third Pregnancy Trimester', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Time', 'Toddler', 'Translational Research', 'Ukraine', 'Ultrasonography', 'Weight Gain', 'Woman', 'Work', 'World Health Organization', 'absorption', 'alcohol consumption during pregnancy', 'alcohol exposure', 'alcohol related problem', 'alcohol sensitivity', 'alcohol testing', 'analog', 'base', 'brain behavior', 'brain morphology', 'cognitive control', 'cohort', 'compare effectiveness', 'critical developmental period', 'data integration', 'drinking', 'fetal', 'follow-up', 'human subject', 'improved', 'in utero', 'infancy', 'literacy', 'mouse model', 'multidisciplinary', 'neurobehavior', 'neurobehavioral', 'northern plains', 'novel', 'performance site', 'postnatal', 'prenatal', 'prenatal exposure', 'prenatal intervention', 'processing speed', 'programs', 'prospective', 'reconstruction', 'skills', 'social', 'stillbirth', 'three dimensional structure']",NIAAA,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA,U01,2007,656344,0.18059053334079356
"Mouse Model Neuro-Facial Dysmorphology: Tanslational and Treatment Studies    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) occurs in children born to women who drink alcohol heavily during pregnancy and is one of the leading non-hereditary causes of mental retardation in the Western World. It is estimated that the prevalence of FAS in the general U.S. population is between 0.5 and 2.0 per 1,000 births, while the undiagnosed population with variable facial and brain dysmorphology described as fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) is estimated to be 10 times higher. The difficulty in the diagnosis of FASD involves misdiagnosis due to the presence or absence of the typical facial dysmorphology in association with brain dysfunction. Accurate diagnosis is further complicated by the lack of information about the contribution of dose, frequency, and timing of alcohol exposure during pregnancy to variation in facial dysmorphology. In this project, a mouse model that models human consumption and is known to produce FAS-like features resulting from prenatal alcohol exposure, will be used to test the effects of differences in dose and timing of alcohol exposure on face and brain development. A combination of 3D imaging that includes Micro-video and micro-resonance imaging (MRI) will be used to capture the detailed facial structure, micro-computational tomography (Micro-CT) to capture the underlying facial bone, MRI for detailed brain dimensions, and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) for nerve fiber tracks in the fetal period. A novel computational program will be compiled to detect features specifically as function of alcohol exposure. The association and dissociation of facial and brain dysmorphology as a function of dose and timing of alcohol exposure will be analyzed to better inform the diagnosis of FAS/ FASD. These studies will be a collaboration sharing resources and methods and will be performed across both Basic and Clinical Science components in consortium effort. To date there is no cure for FAS/FASD, which is a life long ordeal from the birth. Experimental tests, using the above model and setting, of trophic peptides which have been known to prevent neurodegeneration in trials for Alzheimer Disease and protect cell death in embryonic stage, have been partially tested in the embryonic period to show protection against the alcohol-induced retardation. The new studies will test whether the trophic peptides can prevent alcohol-induced brain and facial dysmorphology as well as behavioral impairment known to occur in FAS.          n/a",Mouse Model Neuro-Facial Dysmorphology: Tanslational and Treatment Studies,7343333,U01AA017123,"['Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adopted', 'Affect', 'Africa', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohol-Related Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Alcohols', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Basic Science', 'Behavioral', 'Binding Sites', 'Biology', 'Birth', 'Blood alcohol level measurement', 'Bone and Cartilage Funding', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'C57BL/6 Mouse', 'CDKN1A gene', 'Cell Death', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Choline', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Collaborations', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer software', 'Computer-Assisted Image Analysis', 'Consumption', 'Count', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diet', 'Dietary Intervention', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Dimensions', 'Disruption', 'Dissociation', 'Dose', 'Drug Design', 'Dysmorphology', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Elements', 'Embryo', 'Emotional', 'Ethanol', 'Ethnic group', 'Evaluation', 'Experimental Animal Model', 'Face', 'Fetal Alcohol Exposure', 'Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder', 'Fetal Alcohol Syndrome', 'Fiber', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Gestational Age', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging technology', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Infant Development', 'Informal Social Control', 'Informatics', 'Inherited', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Language Development', 'Length', 'Life', 'Liquid substance', 'Los Angeles', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental Retardation', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Moscow', 'Mothers', 'Mus', 'NAPVSIPQ peptide', 'Neonatal', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Nerve Fibers', 'Neural Cell Adhesion Molecule L1', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurons', 'New Mexico', 'Oral', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient currently pregnant', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Peptides', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Population', 'Pregnancy', 'Prevalence', 'Principal Investigator', 'Rattus', 'Recording of previous events', 'Request for Applications', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Resource Sharing', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Schools', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Sheep', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Skeleton', 'Source', 'Specificity', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'Sum', 'Supplementation', 'Surface', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Time', 'Toddler', 'Ukraine', 'Ultrasonography', 'Variant', 'Vibrissae', 'Western World', 'Woman', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'alcohol effect', 'alcohol exposure', 'alcohol sensitivity', 'analog', 'brain behavior', 'brain morphology', 'brain volume', 'clinical application', 'cognitive control', 'craniofacial', 'critical developmental period', 'data integration', 'day', 'design', 'digital imaging', 'drinking', 'face bone structure', 'fetal', 'follow-up', 'human study', 'image reconstruction', 'improved', 'in utero', 'infancy', 'literacy', 'morphometry', 'morris water maze', 'mouse model', 'multidisciplinary', 'neurobehavioral', 'neurochemistry', 'neuroimaging', 'neurotrophic factor', 'northern plains', 'novel', 'oncoprotein p21', 'peptide analog', 'postnatal', 'prenatal', 'prevent', 'programs', 'prospective', 'relating to nervous system', 'sensory cortex', 'social', 'tomography', 'translational study', 'young adult']",NIAAA,INDIANA UNIV-PURDUE UNIV AT INDIANAPOLIS,U01,2007,224838,0.08136793639075392

"A PROACTIVE INDIVIDUALIZED PROGRAM FOR COLLEGE DRINKERS This proposed research will conduct a randomized trials to test an innovative and interactive and proactive secondary prevention program for college students to reduce high risk alcohol behaviors and minimize alcohol related problems. High volume episodic or ""binge"" drinking is a major problem on most college campuses. But most students do not perceive their high risk alcohol behaviors as problematic, and few are prepared to change those behaviors. Effective interventions are needed that can impact on an entire population of students at risk for alcohol problems.

"Applying Machine Learning in the Prediction and Identification of Children Affected by Prenatal Alcohol Exposure Project summary Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD), which are caused by prenatal alcohol exposure, occur in up to 5% of the population in the United States, and are associated with lifelong disability. There are multiple difficulties in obtaining an accurate diagnosis of FASD, including subtlety of physical features and heterogeneity in presentation. Consequently, FASD is grossly under-recognized, and the majority of affected children never receive a diagnosis. If FASD could be diagnosed earlier and with more reliability, many years of beneficial intervention would not be lost. The objective of this research is to apply machine learning to high-dimensional data in well-characterized data sets to predict or characterize children with FASD. The central hypothesis of this research is that the application of machine learning will accurately predict and recognize FASD compared with expert clinical diagnosis. To test this hypothesis, machine learning will be employed to: 1) characterize FASD based on the presence of non-cardinal malformations, 2) establish multivariate predictors of FASD in preschool aged children, and 3) identify diagnosis specific neurodevelopmental markers that distinguish alcohol related neurodevelopmental deficits from neurodevelopmental deficits without prenatal exposure. Two secondary data sources will be used in this proposal; a prospective study of 400 pregnant women and their offspring in Ukraine (half of whom consumed high amounts of alcohol) with full clinical evaluations for FASD, and a cross- sectional study of over 2,900 first grade children in four regions of the U.S., all with clinical FASD evaluations. Upon successful completion of the proposed research, the expected contribution is for more accurate prediction and recognition of children with FASD. The proposed research is innovative, as it represents a departure from current practice by incorporating machine learning techniques into predictive models of FASD. As a perinatal epidemiologist, I have a strong foundation in analytic techniques, and the advanced training in machine learning will further enhance these skills. Additionally, the disease-focused training in dysmorphology and neurodevelopment will provide a strong foundation to make significant contributions to the field of FASD research. Finally, training and mentoring in grant writing and the responsible conduct of research will provide a strong foundation to transition to an independent researcher. This proposed research builds on previous NIAAA funded research by my interdisciplinary mentoring team, who are all strongly supportive of this research and training plan. This seminal application of machine learning to FASD research will demonstrate its capacity to predict and identify affected children, ultimately leading to earlier intervention of children prenatally exposed to alcohol. Narrative Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) are common and result in lifelong disabilities; however, they are clini- cally difficult to identify, and the vast majority of children with FASD are undiagnosed or misdiagnosed. The proposed research will leverage recent advances in machine learning to better identify children with FASD. These advances would lead to earlier identification and intervention in the lives of children prenatally exposed to alcohol, which can improve their developmental outcomes.",Applying Machine Learning in the Prediction and Identification of Children Affected by Prenatal Alcohol Exposure,10018803,K01AA027811,"['Affect', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohols', 'Algorithms', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Consumption', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Dysmorphology', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Epidemiologist', 'Epidemiology', 'Evaluation', 'Fetal Alcohol Exposure', 'Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Growth', 'Heterogeneity', 'Infant', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism', 'Neurodevelopmental Deficit', 'Neuropsychology', 'Nursery Schools', 'Nutritional', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Perinatal', 'Population', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnant Women', 'Process', 'Prospective Studies', 'Provider', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Sampling', 'Seminal', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Ukraine', 'United States', 'Writing', 'accurate diagnosis', 'aged', 'alcohol exposure', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'disability', 'fetal diagnosis', 'first grade', 'improved', 'infancy', 'innovation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'malformation', 'multidimensional data', 'neurodevelopment', 'novel strategies', 'offspring', 'predictive modeling', 'prenatal', 'prenatal exposure', 'research clinical testing', 'responsible research conduct', 'skills', 'sociodemographics', 'success']",NIAAA,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",K01,2020,172808,0.11209409744176738
"Leveraging electronic health records to identify risky alcohol use prior to surgery Project Summary/Abstract Patients who consume more than two drinks a day prior to elective surgery are at increased risk of experiencing a myriad of surgical complications, readmissions, and prolonged hospital stays. Fortunately, short-term pre-operative abstinence from alcohol mitigates many surgical risks, and carefully timed interventions can prevent complications and alcohol withdrawal syndrome. However, implementation of pre- operative alcohol interventions requires accurate identification of patients with risky alcohol use at least four weeks prior to surgery. Pre-operative clinics frequently fail to screen for alcohol use or do so too close to the surgery date to allow time for intervention. Electronic health records (EHRs) offer an unprecedented amount of accessible clinical data that can be leveraged to identify risky alcohol use early in the surgical episode of care. Innovative methods are needed to identify data elements and create algorithms to capture risky alcohol use from structured and unstructured EHR data. Natural language processing (NLP) and other machine learning (ML)-based approaches are best suited to extract and analyze alcohol-related clinical narratives, and to synthesize heterogeneous alcohol-related data through computer-assisted methods. The proposed study will leverage EHR data to identify and characterize risky alcohol use among surgical patients to identify cohorts who could benefit from pre-operative alcohol intervention. The study aims are to: 1) develop an electronic, automated computable phenotype to classify risky alcohol use prior to surgery using NLP and ML; 2) validate the algorithm through prospective data collection; and 3) longitudinally evaluate the association between risky alcohol use phenotypes and adverse surgical outcomes including complications and hospital readmissions. Innovative applications of NLP and ML will support evaluation of unstructured EHR data (e.g. clinical notes) and will enable integration of heterogeneous alcohol use data to create the computable phenotype. The aims will be achieved through collaboration of experts in key clinical domains and advanced methodologies. This study will create and validate the first alcohol-specific phenotype-based algorithm for surgical patients, which will support future clinical applications and research into alcohol-related surgical interventions and health outcomes. Study outcomes are expected to have immediate value for identifying cohorts for future implementation research and lead to a new clinical tool for surgical clinics. Project Narrative Risky alcohol use is one of the most common risk factors for surgical complications among elective surgical patients. This study will develop an automated computable phenotype to classify risky alcohol use prior to surgery using electronic health record data, and longitudinally evaluate the association between risky alcohol use and adverse surgical outcomes. Accurate and early identification of patients is needed to implement critical pre-operative alcohol interventions.",Leveraging electronic health records to identify risky alcohol use prior to surgery,9953526,R21AA028315,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adverse event', 'Agreement', 'Alcohol abuse', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohol withdrawal syndrome', 'Alcohols', 'Algorithms', 'Biological Markers', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Community Health', 'Computer Assisted', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Element', 'Data Set', 'Early identification', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Expenditures', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'International Classification of Disease Codes', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Length of Stay', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Opioid', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Study', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Postoperative Period', 'Precision Health', 'Research', 'Research Support', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Severities', 'Structure', 'Surgical complication', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Work', 'alcohol abstinence', 'alcohol intervention', 'alcohol risk', 'alcohol screening', 'alcohol use disorder', 'base', 'care episode', 'clinical application', 'cohort', 'computable phenotypes', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'direct application', 'early alcohol use', 'experience', 'health care service', 'high risk', 'hospital readmission', 'implementation research', 'improved', 'innovation', 'knowledge base', 'longitudinal analysis', 'mortality', 'novel', 'phosphatidylethanol', 'predictive test', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'structured data', 'surgery outcome', 'surgical risk', 'tool', 'unstructured data']",NIAAA,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R21,2020,199125,0.15390949448724003
"Machine Learning for Computerized Surveillance of Tobacco and Alcohol Brands in Streamed Entertainment Media Consumption of cancer causing products (CCPs) is the root cause of many of the cancers and chronic diseases we aim to cure with translational medicine. Tobacco and alcohol consumption is a function of highly successful, coordinated global business models that promote consumption. The marketing of CCPs can be seen as a disease vector that drives CCP consumption and worthy of surveillance. The present project addresses the marketing of tobacco and alcohol to young people in the current media environment, in which youths increasingly stream their entertainment in a relatively commercial free environment. To address decreasing reach of traditional advertising, companies have sought to embed their brands in the entertainment itself. Alcohol companies actively seek entertainment placement deals. While cigarette companies have agreed not to pay for product placement, they may evade current restrictions by burying placements in the massive streamed entertainment environment. E-cigarette companies have no such restrictions and advertise on television. Youths obtain exposure to brands that spend more on advertising (e.g., Budweiser); these are also the most commonly consumed brands by youth. Product placement exposures may put adolescents at greater risk for CCP consumption. This study represents the first step in assessing that risk--to obtain infoveillance on CCP brand prevalence in streamed entertainment media. Aim 1 involves a partnership with machine learning researchers at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) to develop and validate a computer recognition system for major cigarette, e-cigarette, and alcohol brands in streamed entertainment media. Aim 1 relies on an existing, large Dartmouth media training library that includes detailed timing for tobacco and alcohol brands from over 2000 contemporary movies. JPL researchers will use the Dartmouth media library, combined with a large corpus of brand logos retrieved from the web, to train and validate an automated Video Content Coding (VCC) system that identifies content associated with key alcohol and tobacco brands. The VCC system will leverage recent techniques to construct robust object detection systems using Convolutional Neural Networks built on large image databases, along with text extraction methods to identify brand names in advertising logos. Second, we will deploy the automated recognition system on the Dartmouth computer cluster to assess the frequency of major cigarette, e-cigarette, and alcohol brand placements from a large sample of streamed/cable and movie entertainment. This proposal involves a unique multidisciplinary team of Dartmouth behavioral scientists and NASA machine learning scientists who will leverage new technologies to study a significant CCP marketing platform. The novel approach offers unprecedented opportunities to conduct surveillance on CCP marketing in large media samples. Our project will set the stage for future research on exposure to this type of marketing and its relation to CCP consumption in youths and lead to a better understanding of the risks CCP brand placements pose to health. Project Narrative This project addresses the potential exposure of youth to marketing of cancer causing products— tobacco and alcohol— in the popular commercial-free streaming environment, where products are embedded in the media itself through product placement. We will employ machine learning to develop an automated visual recognition system for major tobacco and alcohol brands and deploy that system to evaluate brand placement in a large sample of streamed entertainment from cable (e.g., HBO) and other (e.g., Netflix Originals) companies. This surveillance program will have the capability to monitor embedded marketing across many platforms and ultimately allow us to assess youth exposure to embedded brands and its relation with early onset of tobacco and alcohol use.",Machine Learning for Computerized Surveillance of Tobacco and Alcohol Brands in Streamed Entertainment Media,9928031,R01CA225845,"['Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adopted', 'Advertising', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcoholic Beverages', 'Alcohols', 'Attitude', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Businesses', 'Cancer Control', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Cigarette', 'Code', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communication', 'Communication Methods', 'Communication Research', 'Computers', 'Consumption', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Disease', 'Disease Vectors', 'Electronic cigarette', 'Environment', 'Epidemic', 'Exposure to', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heart Diseases', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Image', 'Immersion', 'Influenza', 'Internet', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Life Style', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Marketing', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Names', 'Perception', 'Plant Roots', 'Play', 'Prevalence', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scientific Inquiry', 'Scientist', 'Shapes', 'Smoking', 'Stream', 'Surveillance Program', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Television', 'Text', 'Time', 'Tobacco', 'Tobacco Surveillance', 'Tobacco use', 'Training', 'United States', 'United States National Aeronautics and Space Administration', 'Visual', 'Work', 'Youth', 'cancer risk', 'cohort', 'computer cluster', 'computerized', 'convolutional neural network', 'drinking', 'early onset', 'handheld mobile device', 'innovation', 'movie', 'movie exposure', 'multidisciplinary', 'new technology', 'novel strategies', 'programs', 'response', 'tobacco advertising', 'tobacco exposure', 'tobacco products', 'translational medicine']",NCI,DARTMOUTH COLLEGE,R01,2020,518620,0.06607829687661819
"SERVICES FOR SYNTHESIZING INFORMATION TO SUPPORT TREATMENTS FOR ALCOHOL USE DISORDER In response to PHS 2020-1,Topic 019 entitled, “Data Science Tools for Accelerating Alcohol Research”, Netrias and the Waggoner Center for Alcohol and Addiction Research (WCAAR) propose to develop ASSIST, a data science platform that will use deep learning to aid alcohol researchers in the discovery of drug targets clinically linked to Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD). ASSIST introduces a novel deep learning algorithm, the Deep Response Model, which is a data-driven approach to discover multi-target transcriptomic profiles clinically linked to AUD. These targets can then be used to identify new treatments that have the potential to reduce addiction to alcohol and prevent relapse. State-of-the-art bioinformatics techniques rely on enrichment analysis tools that utilize imprecise knowledgebases, curated from unrelated diseases and model systems, and only cover a fraction of genes for which annotation exists. This leads to a low success rate in the identification of targets clinically linked to AUD. Instead, ASSIST will take a data-driven approach to learn higher level mappings between genes and their impact on disease state directly from transcriptomic data. Netrias will develop computational tests that will measure the accuracy, robustness, and specificity of the discovered targets to AUD. ASSIST will then integrate with drug databases to identify treatments that will reverse the expression profiles of the discovered set of targets. n/a",SERVICES FOR SYNTHESIZING INFORMATION TO SUPPORT TREATMENTS FOR ALCOHOL USE DISORDER,10272788,5N94020C00002,"['Alcohols', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Models', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Drug Targeting', 'Expression Profiling', 'Genes', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Services', 'Specificity', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'addiction', 'alcohol abuse therapy', 'alcohol research', 'alcohol use disorder', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'knowledge base', 'novel', 'prevent', 'response', 'success', 'tool', 'transcriptomics']",NICHD,"NETRIAS, LLC",N43,2020,224865,0.12219432776302154
"Using Smartphone Assessments for Personalized Prediction of Problematic Alcohol Use PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Risky drinking, such as binge (5+/4+ drinks per 2-hour occasion for males/females) and high-intensity (2-3x the rates of binge) drinking, is highly prevalent among young adults and associated with severe acute and longer-term negative behavioral and health outcomes. However, given its prevalence, individuals who engage in such activities comprise a heterogeneous group. Researchers have had a hard time identifying the varied behavioral processes that are predictive of negative alcohol-related consequences and problematic trajectories across time. Predicting who will go on to develop lasting problems and whose risky alcohol use behavior is developmentally-limited is especially challenging. Part of the hindrance comes from the methods that are currently used to study this diverse behavior. In particular, researchers often use cross-sectional studies to look across individuals. While this has reaped invaluable knowledge regarding differences among individuals in their drinking patterns, it does not reveal the dynamic processes that contribute to maintaining such behaviors or make one more likely to have negative consequences. However, increasingly hypotheses pertain to these dynamic processes. This requires arriving at quantitative descriptions of individuals' emotional and behavioral processes. The science can move towards a more nuanced understanding of the varied mechanisms contributing to problematic alcohol use by arriving at valid descriptions of individual-level (i.e., personalized) processes. We propose to make advances towards personalized quantitative models in four ways: 1) develop an informed intensive longitudinal research design that enables acquisition of relevant variables across time on a daily basis and across the span of one year; 2) use innovative measurement technologies that enable objective assessment of contextual features related to drinking; 3) collect data using state-of-the-art phone applications that enable self-report and passive data collection where the user does not need to interface; and 4) implement cutting- edge machine learning algorithms that can reliably arrive at individual-level detection and predictive models that can be used as the foundation for future just-in-time adaptive interventions. We will accomplish this by enrolling N=300 young adult risky drinkers who will complete a 120-day ambulatory assessment protocol completing surveys on smartphones that are also equipped with passive sensors and applications, and then provide 4 waves of data on alcohol use and associated variables (e.g., consequences) over one year. In the end, our endeavors will create novel approaches to measuring and modeling behavioral processes related to high-risk drinking that capture the individuality of each participant. These endeavors will provide the framework for accurate detection and prediction of daily drinking and long-term problematic alcohol use trajectories that support future scientific and clinical efforts. PROJECT NARRATIVE Risky drinking behavior (i.e., episodic binge and high-intensity drinking), which peaks in young adulthood, is estimated to account for more than 40,000 deaths annually and over $167 Billion in economic costs in the United States. Young adult risky drinkers are a heterogeneous group, which makes them very difficult to study and to predict who will go on to develop lasting problems with alcohol use and alcohol use disorder. This research will implement cutting-edge machine learning techniques, and apply them to data collected from daily surveys and passive smartphone sensors in young adult risky drinkers to develop personalized models of problematic alcohol use.",Using Smartphone Assessments for Personalized Prediction of Problematic Alcohol Use,9973396,R01AA026879,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Alcohol abuse', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohols', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Control', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Model', 'Bluetooth', 'Cellular Phone', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Dangerousness', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Collection', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Ecological momentary assessment', 'Economics', 'Emotional', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Female', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Group Meetings', 'Health', 'Heavy Drinking', 'Hour', 'Individual', 'Individuality', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Motivation', 'National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Predictive Factor', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychological Models', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Series', 'Social Environment', 'Statistical Methods', 'Strategic Planning', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translating', 'United States', 'Vehicle crash', 'Violence', 'adaptive intervention', 'alcohol behavior', 'alcohol related consequences', 'alcohol research', 'alcohol use disorder', 'base', 'behavioral health', 'bench to bedside', 'binge drinking', 'craving', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'drinking', 'drinking behavior', 'economic cost', 'emotion regulation', 'falls', 'follow-up', 'high risk drinking', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'longitudinal analysis', 'machine learning algorithm', 'male', 'mortality', 'multitask', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'personalized medicine', 'personalized predictions', 'positive emotional state', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'psychologic', 'psychosocial', 'real time monitoring', 'recruit', 'sensor', 'social', 'social group', 'working group', 'young adult']",NIAAA,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2020,606423,0.13421105856070023
"Estimating BrAC/BAC from Transdermal Alcohol: Combining First-Principles Physiological Models with Machine-Learning to Create Software to Optimally Process and Quantitatively Interpret Biosensor Data Abstract Transdermal alcohol biosensors offer a promising method for unobtrusively collecting continuous alcohol levels in naturalistic settings over long periods of time. Devices are now available to reliably measure transdermal alcohol concentration (TAC), the amount of alcohol diffusing through the skin, but an often overlooked yet critical issue for making these biosensors valuable is that TAC does not consistently correlate with the easily interpretable measures of breath and blood alcohol concentrations (BrAC/BAC) across individuals, environmental conditions, and devices. The goal of this study is to produce software to convert TAC data into estimates of BrAC/BAC (eBrAC/eBAC). We will meet this goal by 1) developing mathematical models to produce quantitative eBrAC from TAC data, 2) examining alternative options for calibrating these models, 3) testing the model fits using varied types and amounts of very precise data, and 4) packaging the models into a comprehensive data assimilation software program. Specifically, we will enhance the fidelity of the models by integrating advanced physics/physiological-based models with statistical methods and data-driven machine- learning techniques. To reduce the burden currently required to calibrate the models for each individual, we will test a number of calibration procedures, including the replacement of the laboratory alcohol administration session with more varied drinking protocols as well as with population-based parameter estimates. We will test our models and protocols using detailed consumption data collected 1) on two of the investigators, 2) on 40 participants who will each participate in four controlled laboratory drinking sessions, and 3) on 40 participants who will each participate in a field trial and laboratory sessions. We will examine model fits across drinking patterns when using varying amounts of individualized alcohol data (e.g., breath analyzer, drink diary) to calibrate the models, and within and across individuals with differing characteristics (e.g., gender, weight) and under variable conditions (e.g., humidity, heart rate) that may affect model fit. We will create a data assimilation software system, the BrAC Estimator software, that incorporates all available data to produce the most accurate eBrAC measures. The software output will include the identification of drinking episodes, continuous eBrAC signal, and eBrAC summary scores (e.g., peak eBrAC, time of peak eBrAC, area under the drinking curve) with confidence bands. The software will be platform-portable to run alone or to be integrated into other mobile health technologies or precision medicine protocols. This proposal is innovative, technologically sophisticated, and feasible, and would result in the first tool to accomplish the TAC-eBrAC conversion, finally making it possible to obtain interpretable quantitative measurement of naturalistic alcohol consumption in the field. The anticipated result of this study is the expanded utility of TAC biosensors for researchers, clinicians, and individuals to monitor naturalistic alcohol consumption and easily understand the results. Narrative This research program will advance mathematical models and methodological techniques to make it possible to obtain quantitative estimates of breath and blood alcohol concentration levels from the data produced by transdermal alcohol sensors. By making these methodological advancements available in software programs for use by non-mathematicians, the proposed study has the capability of widely enhancing the alcohol research community’s ability to investigate a variety of alcohol-related research topics that cannot be captured retrospectively or in laboratory settings, including naturalistic patterns of consumption, individual differences in response to alcohol, real-time drinking behavior and decisions, clinical intervention outcomes, and the prevention and treatment of alcoholism. More broadly, the software can be integrated with personal health monitoring systems for general public use and provide easily interpreted personalized alcohol consumption feedback.",Estimating BrAC/BAC from Transdermal Alcohol: Combining First-Principles Physiological Models with Machine-Learning to Create Software to Optimally Process and Quantitatively Interpret Biosensor Data,9902264,R01AA026368,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohols', 'Area', 'Area Under Curve', 'Assimilations', 'Bacterial Artificial Chromosomes', 'Biosensor', 'Blood alcohol level measurement', 'Calibration', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Concentration measurement', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diffuse', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Feedback', 'Galvanic Skin Response', 'Gender', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Technology', 'Heart Rate', 'Humidity', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Linear Models', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Physics', 'Physiological', 'Plug-in', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reading', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Running', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Skin', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Temperature', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Uncertainty', 'Weight', 'Work', 'alcohol measurement', 'alcohol research', 'alcohol response', 'alcoholism therapy', 'base', 'breath alcohol measurement', 'data reduction', 'diaries', 'drinking', 'drinking behavior', 'improved', 'innovation', 'mHealth', 'mathematical methods', 'mathematical model', 'physiologic model', 'population based', 'portability', 'precision medicine', 'programs', 'sensor', 'software systems', 'supervised learning', 'time interval', 'time use', 'tool', 'unsupervised learning']",NIAAA,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,R01,2020,500910,0.18128072068629023
"Connectome-based prediction and neurodevelopmental trajectories of alcohol phenotypes across development Abstract Alcohol initiation at an early age is associated with numerous negative outcomes, including a significant increase in the risk of developing an alcohol-use disorder later in life. Vulnerability for early misuse and other problematic alcohol use behaviors have been linked to individual differences in brain function. However, few studies have sought to identify brain-based predictors (‘neuromarkers’) of alcohol use behaviors in youth. Identification of brain-based predictors of alcohol use behaviors in youth is essential for the development of more effective early prevention and intervention efforts. This proposal combines machine learning and longitudinal modeling approaches to 1) identify neural networks predictive of early alcohol initiation and misuse and 2) chart the developmental trajectories of these networks over time in a large sample of youth (N>3,000) using data from three unique, proprietary and completed datasets. Neural networks conferring vulnerability for alcohol use behaviors during adolescence will be identified using connectome-based predictive modeling (CPM). CPM is a machine-learning method of generating behavioral predictions from individual patterns of brain organization; i.e., functional connectivity matrices. Unlike traditional machine learning approaches, CPM is entirely data-driven and requires no a priori selection of brain regions or networks. As such, CPM is both a predictive tool and a method of identifying networks that underlie specific behaviors; i.e., neuromarkers. CPM has been successfully used to predict complex behaviors including future abstinence and other addiction-relevant phenotypes. This proposal will use CPM to identify neuromarkers of alcohol initiation and predict transitions to risky drinking in youth (AIM 1). Quantification of changes in brain function, e.g., growth curve trajectory analysis, is central to the characterization of developmental phenomena. Analyses of developmental trajectories can be used to identify particularly sensitive growth periods, detect variations that may signal risk, define modifiable targets, and monitor the impact of environment and interventions on development. While extant data indicate alcohol-related alterations in neural development, very few studies have assessed interactions between neurodevelopmental trajectories over time and alcohol-use behaviors. Developmental trajectories of identified networks in relation to alcohol use behaviors over time will be assessed using multilevel modeling (AIM 2). This proposal represents the first attempt to identify neural networks predictive of alcohol-initiation and risky drinking using a wholly data- driven, machine learning approach in a large sample of youth and does so using existing data. This is a critical step toward identifying a reliable predictor of alcohol initiation in youth and will shed light on individual difference factors representing vulnerability for misuse. Such predictors are needed to understand the developmental trajectories of alcohol phenotypes and to inform early risk models and preventative intervention efforts. Project Narrative: Alcohol is the most commonly used substance in youth, and earlier ages of alcohol initiation are associated with increased likelihoods of alcohol-use disorder later in life. This project will identify brain networks that predict alcohol initiation and misuse—and chart the developmental trajectories of those networks over time— using existing neuroimaging data from three unique longitudinal datasets (N>3,000). Identification of brain- based predictors of alcohol initiation and misuse will aid in the development of targeted prevention and intervention efforts to address alcohol problems in youth.",Connectome-based prediction and neurodevelopmental trajectories of alcohol phenotypes across development,9930509,R01AA027553,"['Abstinence', 'Addictive Behavior', 'Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Age', 'Alcohol Phenotype', 'Alcohol abuse', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Alcohols', 'Anatomy', 'Base of the Brain', 'Behavior', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Clinical', 'Cohort Studies', 'Complex', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'European', 'Female', 'Fingerprint', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Genetic study', 'Growth', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Intervention', 'Life', 'Light', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Names', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Resolution', 'Rest', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Risk-Taking', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Sex Differences', 'Signal Transduction', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Work', 'Youth', 'addiction', 'alcohol misuse', 'alcohol research', 'alcohol use disorder', 'alcohol use initiation', 'base', 'behavior prediction', 'brain research', 'connectome', 'connectome based predictive modeling', 'financial incentive', 'follow-up', 'hazardous drinking', 'high risk', 'high risk drinking', 'imaging study', 'insight', 'longitudinal dataset', 'machine learning method', 'male', 'multilevel analysis', 'multitask', 'neural network', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuroimaging', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive tools', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sex', 'theories', 'time use', 'university student', 'young adult']",NIAAA,YALE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,417706,0.1812101840907266
"Elucidating the role of alternative polyadenylation in alcohol related phenotypes using a novel trans-omics computational approach Alcohol consumption is an etiologic essential for the development of alcohol use disorder and many alcohol pathologies. Despite evidence that genetic variations contribute to alcohol consumption, the genetic architecture remains poorly characterized. In terms of the genetic component, individual susceptibility to complex traits such as alcohol consumption arise mainly from variation in gene regulation. It has become increasingly clear in recent years that alternative polyadenylation (APA) – a mechanism by which a single gene encodes multiple RNA isoforms with different polyadenylation (polyA) sites – is extensively used to modulate gene regulation. An improved understanding of the genetic causes of predisposition to alcohol-related problems will facilitate a precision medicine approach through better prevention, diagnosis, and treatment.  Yet shortcomings in current methods for concurrent APA identification and RNA transcript quantitation in high-throughput short read RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) studies have limited our ability to study its genetic contributions to alcohol-related phenotypes. To remedy this, a novel trans-omics method and related software will be developed here that can precisely identify expressed polyA sites and accurately quantify individual isoforms including APA transcripts from a sequenced RNA-Seq library. Specifically, a supervised machine learning algorithm will be built that utilizes both RNA-Seq data and DNA sequence indicators to predict the locations of expressed polyA sites (Aim 1). The “use-all-data” approach will identify and quantify APA isoforms present in the data with greater precision than current, one-dimensional omics techniques. Furthermore, the algorithm will be designed for integration into existing bioinformatics pipelines for quantitation along with other RNA species (Aim 2).  To determine the influence of APA on the genetic predisposition to alcohol consumption, a systems genetics approach will be applied to relate brain RNA expression of the APA isoforms and other RNA molecules, including protein-coding, long non-coding, and microRNA (miRNA) transcripts, to alcohol consumption measures in a two-bottle choice paradigm (Aim 3). From this approach, if and how APA influences gene networks and susceptibility to miRNA regulation, what genetic factors control APA, and how APA may influence alcohol consumption can be evaluated.  An extensive fellowship training plan and a team of mentors with diverse skillsets will be utilized to accomplish the multidisciplinary research project. The result of this training will be an alcohol researcher with not only the latest bioinformatics and computational skills but also the knowledge and experience to interpret, refine, and improve these models in the context of alcohol research. By following a training plan that incorporates the best of both disciplines, this proposal will be an example of a new type of alcohol researcher that can harness big data in a disease relevant way. Understanding the role of alternative polyadenylation (APA) in alcohol-related phenotypes and pathologies will provide important insights into biological mechanisms related to alcohol for improved diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of alcohol-related problems. The proposed research will study the association of APA with a predisposition for free-choice alcohol consumption using a novel trans-omics computational approach.",Elucidating the role of alternative polyadenylation in alcohol related phenotypes using a novel trans-omics computational approach,10073326,F31AA027430,"['3&apos', ' Untranslated Regions', 'Adopted', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohols', 'Algorithms', 'Alternative Splicing', 'Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis', 'Benchmarking', 'Big Data', 'Binding Sites', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Etiology', 'Exhibits', 'Fabry Disease', 'Facioscapulohumeral', 'Fellowship', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genetic Variation', 'Global Change', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heart Hypertrophy', 'Heterogeneity', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Human', 'Inbreeding', 'Individual', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Knowledge', 'Libraries', 'Location', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Metachromatic Leukodystrophy', 'Methods', 'MicroRNAs', 'Modeling', 'Muscle', 'Neurons', 'Nuclear Export', 'Oculopharyngeal Muscular Dystrophy', 'Pathology', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Polyadenylation', 'Predisposition', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Protein Isoforms', 'Proteins', 'RNA', 'RNA Sequences', 'Rattus', 'Recombinants', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Side', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Software Tools', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Transcript', 'Translations', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'alcohol prevention', 'alcohol related problem', 'alcohol research', 'alcohol use disorder', 'bioinformatics pipeline', 'bioinformatics tool', 'cohort', 'consumption measures', 'design', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic approach', 'genetic architecture', 'improved', 'insight', 'mRNA Stability', 'machine learning algorithm', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'novel', 'open source', 'personalized medicine', 'precision medicine', 'programs', 'skills', 'software development', 'supervised learning', 'tool', 'trait', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'treatment strategy', 'user-friendly']",NIAAA,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,F31,2020,26651,0.16756714843445866
"Developing a mobile alcohol biosensor platform for use in medication testing research PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT This mentored patient-oriented research career development award (K23) will enable Dr. Roberts to achieve his long-term career goal of becoming an independent clinical researcher working to develop pharmacotherapies for alcohol use disorder (AUD). This proposal outlines a 5-year training plan that supports a research program focused on developing a mobile biosensor platform for tracking medication effects on alcohol reactivity in ambulating outpatients. Training domains include 1) mobile biosensor assessment of alcohol use, 2) management and analysis of biosensor data, and 3) AUD pharmacotherapy development research. The training plan includes a strategic combination of mentor-led trainings; coursework in mobile health sensing, data science, statistics, bioethics, clinical research methods, and grant writing; attendance at relevant conferences and workshops; and collaboration with investigators conducting research in AUD pharmacotherapy development. The candidate will complete these training activities while completing a research program aimed at developing a mobile biosensor platform that can passively track alcohol consumption and deliver conditional assessments at key points during drinking episodes. In these preliminary studies, heavy drinkers with AUD will wear the mobile biosensors and receive alcohol in the laboratory. In Experiment 1, participants will receive two fixed doses of alcohol while wearing the biosensors and responding to prompted assessments. Goals of this experiment will be to 1) refine the machine-learning derived detection algorithms that will identify key points during drinking episodes and 2) evaluate the user experience and feasibility of delivering prompted assessments on a smartphone during drinking episodes. Experiment 2 will test the detection algorithms in a separate sample of freely behaving participants engaged in self-paced alcohol drinking. Results of these studies will serve as pilot data to support an R-mechanism application to develop a formal paradigm using the biosensor platform to track medication effects of alcohol use and reactivity in ambulating outpatients. Dr. Roberts has assembled an mentorship committee of leaders in the field. Dr. McKee (primary mentor) is a Professor of Psychiatry at the Yale University. She applies innovative laboratory paradigms to AUD pharmacotherapy development research, and she has several lines of research using mobile health biosensors to track substance use behavior. Dr. Ramchandani (primary co-mentor) is a clinical investigator and Chief of the Human Psychopharmacology Section at the NIAAA intramural research program. He will lead Dr. Roberts's training in alcohol pharmacokinetics. Drs. Gueorguieva, Petrakis, and Gerstein will serve as secondary mentors and contribute to Dr. Roberts's training in longitudinal data analysis, AUD pharmacotherapy clinical trials, and machine learning and data science, respectively. Drs. Miranda and Barnett will serve as external advisers and support Dr. Roberts's training in ambulatory assessment in the context of medication development research and transdermal alcohol detection, respectively. PROJECT NARRATIVE Alcohol use disorder is a potentially disabling disease with a large economic and health burden in the United States. This proposal furthers public health interests by providing important training opportunities to an early- career clinical investigator interested in developing medication to treat alcohol use disorder.

"Bringing real-time stress detection to scale: Development of a biosensor driven, stress detection classifier for smartwatches PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The goals of this mentored, patient-oriented, research career development award are two-fold: 1) Characterize the autonomic nervous system correlates of stress-reactivity, both in laboratory and ambulatory contexts in order to inform the development of a biosensor driven, stress-detection classifier algorithm that can run on commercially available smartwatches, and 2) establish the principal investigator as an independent researcher at Massachusetts General Hospital - Harvard Medical School. The specific aims of this research will be accomplished through an innovative study leveraging the strengths of traditional laboratory-based, psychophysiological research, and cutting-edge, in natura monitoring of stress and stress’ autonomic correlates using a combination of ecological momentary assessment of affect, and ambulatory electrocardiogram monitoring. This research will inform the development of a stress-detection algorithm that will run on commercially available smartwatches. The clinical and health applications for real-time stress detection are numerous, but this technology holds particular promise for individuals in early recovery from alcohol use disorder for whom unchecked stress heightens risk for alcohol use and engagement in other maladaptive coping behaviors. The smartwatch-embedded stress detection algorithm developed in this research will ultimately be linked to existing smartphone-based relapse prevention apps that will prompt patients with real-time coaching to mitigate alcohol use risk. Aims of the principal investigator’s career development and training plan include, 1) learning fundamental principles of machine learning with an emphasis on biosensor technologies, 2) gaining facility with Matlab programming, with an emphasis on signal analysis and psychophysiological model building, 3) broadening expertise in cardiovascular waveform and interval analysis with particular emphasis on artefact management, and 4) acquiring skills in the development and application of mHealth-based clinical interventions. These goals will be achieved through a training plan comprised of mentorship, formal coursework, seminars, conferences, and manuscript preparation. Knowledge gained via the training plan will be augmented by the research undertaken. Drs. John Kelly, Paolo Bonato, Gari Clifford, and Bettina Hoeppner will serve as mentors on this award, and will provide targeted expertise in machine learning approaches, Matlab programing, artefact management, and mHealth treatment development. Massachusetts General Hospital - Harvard Medical School provides an exceptional environment in which to conduct this training and research. By the end of the 5-year award period, the goals are to have a working stress-detection classifier algorithm ready for R01 testing, and for the principal investigator to be established as an independent investigator. This award is consistent with NIH's goal of increasing and maintaining a strong cohort of investigators to address the nation's clinical research needs. PROJECT NARRATIVE Alcohol use disorder carries tremendous personal and societal costs, and in spite of best clinical efforts, this disorder is characterized by very high relapse rates following treatment. There is a pressing need for novel interventions that prevent alcohol use relapse, and help individuals achieve sustained remission. This study will develop the algorithms that will enable the biosensors embedded in commercially available smartwatches to detect stress in real time using physiological measures of autonomic arousal, which will ultimately be used to trigger smartphone relapse prevention apps to prompt patients with real-time coaching to mitigate alcohol use relapse risk.","Bringing real-time stress detection to scale: Development of a biosensor driven, stress detection classifier for smartwatches",9891764,K23AA027577,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Algorithms', 'Arousal', 'Autonomic nervous system', 'Award', 'Awareness', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Biosensor', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cellular Phone', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Code', 'Cognitive', 'Complement', 'Coping Behavior', 'Custom', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Disease', 'Disease remission', 'Ecological momentary assessment', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'General Hospitals', 'Goals', 'Health Sciences', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuscripts', 'Massachusetts', 'Measures', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Mobile Health Application', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motivation', 'Notification', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Physiologic Monitoring', 'Physiological', 'Preparation', 'Principal Investigator', 'Psychophysiology', 'Recovery', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stress', 'Targeted Research', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'acute stress', 'alcohol risk', 'alcohol use disorder', 'base', 'career development', 'classification algorithm', 'classifier algorithm', 'clinical application', 'cohort', 'deter alcohol use', 'disorder later incidence prevention', 'early alcohol use', 'experience', 'fitness', 'health application', 'heart rate variability', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'mHealth', 'medical schools', 'medical specialties', 'model building', 'negative affect', 'novel', 'programs', 'real time monitoring', 'reduced alcohol use', 'relapse risk', 'skills', 'smart watch', 'smartphone Application', 'societal costs', 'stress management', 'stress reactivity', 'stress state', 'stressor', 'symposium', 'therapy development', 'time use', 'wearable sensor technology']",NIAAA,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,K23,2020,184140,0.08450650745829978
"Impact of the Coronavirus Pandemic on Alcohol Consumption and Mental Health in Young People PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT The COVID-19 pandemic, best characterized as a disaster, is unprecedented in its impact on individuals, societies, and the economy. Of special consideration is the effect of the pandemic on the psychological wellbeing and behavior of young people. Here, we propose leveraging the longitudinal, multi-site National Consortium on Alcohol and Neurodevelopment in Adolescence (NCANDA) study (2012-2022) to investigate changes in wellbeing and behaviors, with a focus on alcohol use in response to the pandemic, in an established sample of young people including moderate-heavy users and those at risk for alcohol use, and to identify risk and protective factors for distress in response to the pandemic. Using NCANDA, we are able to directly address research objectives of NOSI NOT-OD-20-097 to understand social, behavioral and economic impacts from containment and mitigation efforts implemented to reduce spread of the COVID-19 disease, as well as downstream health impacts including substance use/abuse, and to determine risk and resiliency factors and outcomes. Unlike most research in this area, NCANDA includes neurobiological data critical to complement clinical and self-report data in understanding the complex and dynamic interactions leading up to and following a disaster. Also, with its accelerated longitudinal design and current age of participants spanning 17-28 years old, NCANDA is uniquely powered to disentangle age and pandemic related effects, unlike traditional same-age cohort designs. We propose supplementing the NCANDA project with a brief COVID-19 survey about alcohol use, mood, and other behaviors during the pandemic as well as COVID-19 exposure and pandemic-related distress, administered to participants in June 2020. To track long-term effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, the survey will be re-administered in Winter 2020 and Summer 2021. By embedding this survey, time-linked to the pandemic, within the existing NCANDA dataset, we propose characterizing the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on alcohol use, mental health, and brain in young people (Aim 1) and to evaluate risk and resilience factors for COVID-19 pandemic-related distress (Aim 2). We propose using advanced analytics, including machine learning approaches, to identify a `signature' from the rich information captured by neuroimaging, clinical and self-report data prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, that predicts distress versus resilience in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic. A machine-learning approach embraces the complexity of the COVID-19 pandemic-related influence and takes advantage of the multi-domains within the NCANDA dataset. The analysis proposed in this supplement will offer valuable longitudinal data in a well-characterized sample of young people who are bridging developmental years into adulthood and that includes those at high risk for, or current heavy users of, alcohol. Such information can be used to guide public health and intervention strategies to benefit vulnerable young populations in the event of future disasters. PROJECT NARRATIVE The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, best characterized as a disaster, is expansive and includes unprecedented effects on the psychological wellbeing and behavior of youth. Here, we propose leveraging the longitudinal, multi-site National Consortium on Alcohol and Neurodevelopment in Adolescence (NCANDA) study to investigate changes in wellbeing and behaviors, with a focus on alcohol use in response to the pandemic, in an established sample of young people including moderate-heavy users and those at risk for alcohol use, and to use advanced machine learning approaches with neuroimaging and clinical data to identify risk and protective factors for distress in response to the pandemic.

"A Multisite Neurobehavioral Assessment of Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders Project Summary This request for a renewal of funding is in response to the NIH/NIAAA funding opportunity entitled, “Collaborative Initiative on Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (CIFASD)” (RFA-AA-17-007). The overarching aim of the current proposal is to develop, validate, and implement clinically novel and innovative measurement tools to accurately identify children who are affected by prenatal alcohol exposure. The proposed study is relevant to the overall objective of the CIFASD funding opportunity “to accelerate specific areas of research related to the translation of new or improved capabilities in FASD clinical case recognition.” This is critical need. While there has been a concerted research effort since the initial clinical delineation of fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS), understanding the full spectrum of effects of prenatal alcohol exposure remains incomplete, hindering effective intervention. Although individuals with prenatal alcohol exposure may experience significantly impairing functional difficulties, identification of these individuals is inadequate. High rates of missed diagnoses and misdiagnosis result in lost opportunities for intervention and misunderstanding of the etiology of observed difficulties. Development of accurate and specific identification tools will improve diagnostic capability and clinical decision-making regarding treatment. To this end, during previous funding periods we substantially enhanced the understanding of the specificity of effects of prenatal alcohol exposure to increase identification of alcohol-affected youth. Our hierarchical CIFASD Decision Tree, developed and validated on over 800 subjects, indicates that administration of just 4 measures can distinguish alcohol-affected youth from nonexposed controls with and without behavioral concerns or conditions with accuracy rates of >80%. While a significant step forward, the Decision Tree was developed and validated in a research sample with a high risk of alcohol effects. One aim of the current proposal is to develop and test an electronic version of the Decision Tree (the eTree) in lower risk, international, population-based, and clinic-based samples. Another aim of the proposal, in line with the specific RFA goal to use innovative technologies to screen for dysmorphology and/or neurobehavioral deficits to aid in the identification of alcohol-exposed individuals, is the development and implementation of the FASD Online Neurobehavioral Screen (FONS), a web-based neurobehavioral assessment tool for use with subjects recruited via a web portal (cf. Foroud U01). The FONS will measure domains known to be affected in FASD, including those represented in diagnostic criteria for neurobehavioral disorder associated with prenatal alcohol exposure (ND-PAE). The eTree and the FONS will be validated using laboratory-based in-person neuropsychological assessment of children with histories of prenatal alcohol exposure and non-exposed controls with and without behavioral concerns or conditions. The results of the proposed research will fulfill our research goals, improve recruitment, and most importantly accurately identify individuals affected by prenatal alcohol exposure, leading to improved clinical diagnosis and intervention.

"Alcohol Misuse: An Independent Risk Factor that Increases the Incidence and Severity of COVID-19 ABSTRACT The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has resulted in unprecedented morbidity and mortality. Risk factors like age, obesity, and comorbidity impact the rate of SARS-CoV-2 infection and severity of COVID- 19 leading to hospital ICU admission and death. Additional risk factors that promote exaggerated immune and inflammatory response to the virus leading to severe disease or death must exist. One such risk factor could be alcohol consumption because: (1) Alcohol is the most frequently used drug in the United States. (2) Patients hospitalized for pneumonia who have an alcohol use disorder (AUD) are at greater risk for developing Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) (the primary cause of death in COVID-19) than non-AUD patients; and (3) Alcohol negatively impacts function of the immune system and results in an inappropriate response to pathogens (a primary mechanism of severe COVID-19 and ARDS); and (4) Alcohol disrupts the intestinal microbiome (dysbiosis) and intestinal and lung barriers which can both further promote inflammation and contribute to ARDS. Accordingly, we hypothesize that alcohol misuse is an independent risk factor that increases the incidence and severity of COVID-19 by promoting exaggerated and dysregulated immune- inflammatory responses to SARS-CoV-2. We will leverage our COVID-19 data and biorepository at Rush University Medical Center (RUMC), which has tested over 22,000 patients (68% minority) with over 6000 patients testing positive, over 1000 hospitalized, over 600 critically ill. Currently, all patients arriving at RUMC are screened for alcohol use with AUDIT. Our COVID-19 biorepository has banked nasopharyngeal swabs, serum/plasma, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). We will address the following Specific Aims: Aim 1: Determine if alcohol use or misuse increases severity of COVID-19 and elucidate interactions with other risk factors. In this cross sectional study, we will use a machine learning classifier to determine if increased alcohol use/misuse are associated with more severe clinical presentation and poorer COVID-19 health outcomes (in 12,000 RUMC, 6000 COVID-19+) patients. Aim 2. Determine the impact of alcohol use and misuse on COVID-19 disease course and the impact of COVID-19 on alcohol consumption. In this longitudinal study, we will conduct longitudinal analysis of alcohol use in 6000 patients positive for COVID-19 to determine: (2a) if alcohol use/misuse is associated with slower recovery from COVID-19-associated symptoms. Aim 3. Determine if alcohol misuse results in exaggerated immune-inflammatory response to SARS-CoV-2 infection and more organ dysfunction in COVID-19 patients and explore the mechanisms. In this mechanistic Aim, we will compare COVID-19 patients with different disease severity to determine if alcohol misuse is associated with: (3a) altered immune/inflammatory response. (3b) disrupted intestinal barrier integrity. We will use machine learning and other advanced informatics approaches to investigate these Aims to discover new mechanisms for alcohol-COVID-19 interactions for prevention and therapeutic targets for COVID-19. NARRATIVE The COVID-19 pandemic has transformed and threatens our society. However we know very little about the underlying mechanisms and comorbidities that cause severe symptoms in some COVID-19 patients. Alcohol use has been shown to make the flu and other respiratory diseases worse and we think this may be true for COVID-19 and alcohol as well. This study will investigate if alcohol use makes COVID-19 worse and how.

"Image Analysis of Neurofacial Effects of Prenatal Alcohol  Exposure Abstract As a constitutent component of CIFASD4, this project will focus on earlier detection of the neurofacial effects of prenatal alcohol exposure. Four topics of the Request for Application (RFA) will be targeted: a) improved FAS/FASD facial recognition through 3D photography and computer analyses in individuals of different age groups; b) the utility of prenatal ultrasound as a screening or diagnostic modality; c) 3D facial imaging during the neonatal period to detect more subtle facial features affected by prenatal alcohol exposure; d) innovative uses of technologies, including handheld devices with apps, to screen for dysmorphology. Previously, we have implemented methods and associated software for analyzing postnatal face shape for the detection of the effects of prenatal alcohol exposure. Although effective in their accuracy, they rely on the use of expensive and relatively clumsy 3D cameras for which not insignificant training is required. New methods of 2D image analysis are available, mobile device acquisition of 3D images is imminent and online recruitment to clinical research is becoming more common place. Finally, state-of-the-art machine learning methods are proving effective in large-scale analysis of ultrasound and MRI data. To accomplish our goals, we propose the following specific aims: 1. Automated screening of facial images for effects of prenatal alcohol exposure with potential for on-line and  mobile device use and integration of genetic, behavioral and cognitive data; 2. Fetal ultrasound analysis to detect facial, cranial and neural effects of prenatal alcohol exposure with  neonatal follow-up; 3. Algorithm and software development to improve current analysis of face-brain-alcohol interactions. Achieving aim 1 will dramatically impact access to validated facial screening for prenatal alcohol exposure. Successful demonstration of aim 2 will achieve the earliest possible diagnosis enabling further research on interventions but also anticipatory neonatal management. Progress in aim 3 will enhance face-brain morphometric analyses in collaboration with other CIFASD partners (U01:Parnell/Eberhart, U01:Wozniak). We will work collaboratively with consortium partners who will recruit subjects and provide facial and ultrasound images (U01: Chambers; U01: Coles; U01: Mattson; U01: Weinberg; U01: Wozniak). We will co- operate on the analysis of images arising from basic science partners focusing on the use of animal models. We will rely on research resources for validation of postnatal screening tools (R24 Dysmorphology - Jones) and online/app development and data management (R24 Informatics - Barnett). Project Narrative The goal of this project is to develop new methods for screening for the effects of prenatal alcohol exposure. It will exploit the wide availability and convenience of smartphone and tablet devices to detect the facial effects in children and adults and new ways of analyzing ultrasound images to detect facial and brain effects in the fetus. Our aim is to establish earlier detection so as to allow earlier intervention to improve outcome.",Image Analysis of Neurofacial Effects of Prenatal Alcohol  Exposure,9927955,U01AA014809,"['3-Dimensional', '3D Print', '3D ultrasound', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Agreement', 'Alcohols', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Basic Science', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Caucasians', 'Cellular Phone', 'Cephalic', 'Child', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Color', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer software', 'Corpus Callosum', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Differential Diagnosis', 'Discrimination', 'Dysmorphology', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Evaluation', 'Face', 'Fetal Alcohol Exposure', 'Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder', 'Fetal alcohol effects', 'Fetus', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Intervention', 'Link', 'Location', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Monoclonal Antibody R24', 'Neonatal', 'Nose', 'Photography', 'Pilot Projects', 'Pregnancy', 'Preparation', 'Request for Applications', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resources', 'Screening procedure', 'Shapes', 'Software Tools', 'Syndrome', 'Tablet Computer', 'Tablets', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Training', 'Ultrasonography', 'Validation', 'Weight', 'Work', 'age group', 'alcohol exposure', 'algorithm development', 'automated image analysis', 'base', 'caudate nucleus', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'cohort', 'cost', 'data management', 'experience', 'fetal', 'follow-up', 'handheld equipment', 'handheld mobile device', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'machine learning method', 'maternal cigarette smoking', 'mouse model', 'neonatal period', 'novel', 'operation', 'postnatal', 'potential biomarker', 'prenatal', 'prenatal testing', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'screening', 'software development', 'tobacco exposure']",NIAAA,UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD,U01,2020,234498,0.0493466754548958
": Complex systems analysis of the impact of alcohol on bone in non-human primates PROJECT SUMMARY Understanding the impact of alcohol consumption on bone health is important because alcohol influences bone metabolism and over half of the adult population in the United States drinks alcoholic beverages. Low to moderate levels of alcohol consumption are generally associated with beneficial skeletal effects while chronic alcohol abuse predisposes individuals to bone fractures. The long-term goal of our research is to delineate the primary mechanisms mediating the divergent skeletal effects of low/moderate and heavy alcohol consumption. An appreciation of the precise effects and mechanisms of action of alcohol on bone metabolism is important because of the enormous economic, social and personal burden associated with poor bone health. Progress in understanding the actions of alcohol on bone metabolism are hampered by (1) the extreme difficulty in performing intervention studies in humans, (2) limitations of commonly used animal models, (3) failure to adequately consider alcohol’s effects on tissue and organ systems that impact bone, and (4) difficulty in accurately replicating human drinking behavior in animals. The studies proposed in this R01 application will overcome limitations of human and prior animal studies by using a non-human primate (monkey) model for voluntary alcohol consumption that mimics the full range of human drinking behavior. We will use linear regression models, multivariate linear regression models, machine learning, and systems analysis to establish the impact of pattern of alcohol consumption (none, light/moderate, binge, heavy and very heavy) on bone metabolism in rhesus (Macaca mulatta; n=105) and cynomolgus (Macaca fascicularis; n=86) macaques in the context of sex, age and alcohol-induced perturbations in tissue and organ systems that can influence bone. We will identify the latter perturbations by determining the effect of alcohol on specific protein (e.g., peptide hormones and cytokines) and small molecule (e.g., steroid hormones) effectors in blood. Our central hypothesis, based in part on our preliminary data in rats, macaques and humans, is that changes in the blood levels of bone-active hormones and cytokines, derived from several tissues/organs, in response to alcohol intake act in concert to modulate bone cell number and activity. To test our hypothesis, we propose the following two Specific Aims: Specific Aim 1: Define the correlative relationships between the quantity and pattern of alcohol consumption and bone in male and female macaques. Specific Aim 2: Define the correlative relationships among blood ethanol levels, key bone active hormones and cytokines, and biochemical markers of bone turnover in male and female macaques. At the completion of this project, we expect to have established that the magnitude of skeletal response to alcohol will correlate with changes in serum biochemical markers of bone turnover which, in turn, will correlate with changes in circulating levels of specific hormones and cytokines. The primary positive impact of our anticipated findings is identification of key underlying factors responsible for the complex, context-dependent actions of alcohol on bone metabolism. PROJECT NARRATIVE Alcohol is an important nonessential component of diet that has been implicated in having both positive and negative effects on the skeleton. The proposed studies will evaluate the impact of pattern of alcohol consumption (none, light/moderate, binge, heavy, and very heavy) on bone in a non-human primate model for voluntary drinking that mimics the full range of human drinking behavior.

"Toward a Generalized Framework and Flexible Software Environment for Power Analysis of Alcohol Treatment Randomized Controlled Trials PROJECT SUMMARY Pharmacological and behavioral treatments of alcohol use disorder are only useful to the extent that their effects are robust and reliable. A priori determination of statistical power is one of the most significant steps to maximizing scientific reliability; however, it has historically been largely overlooked in the health sciences. Alcohol researchers are increasingly utilizing complex statistical models (e.g., growth curves, mixture models, social networks); yet, accessible methods for sample size determination for all but the simplest statistical tests have not been broadly disseminated. Moreover, even for models in which software programs are readily available, scientists consistently express uncertainty regarding expected parameter estimates, prohibiting the utility of power analysis itself. As a result, many randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are likely not optimally designed to allow for conclusive statistical inference. The overall objective of this proposal is to close this gap by developing a generalized method for power analysis using a combination of established and innovative approaches that can be used to generate and test a vast array of models used in treatment research. This objective will be achieved by pursuing two specific aims: develop a flexible, user-friendly software interface for statistical power and sensitivity analysis (Aim 1); and develop a generalized framework for determining model parameter estimates (Aim 2). The proposal is innovative because the software interface will be grounded in state-of-the-art advancements in computational technology and human-computer interaction. In addition, the framework will be fortified by advances in generalizability-theory-based meta-analyses and guided walk and machine-learning-based simulation studies investigating the effects of uncertainty in individual model parameters on the likelihood of observing hypothesized effects. The software will include automated sensitivity analyses to identify parameters with the largest impact on power and will recommend starting parameters. Development and testing will be grounded in the naltrexone and cognitive behavioral therapy literatures. Their widespread use and diversity of methodological approaches make them ideal testbeds from which to generalize to other treatment domains. This research is synergistic with each of the goals within the NIAAA Strategic Plan (2017-2021). Perhaps most significantly, methodology and guidelines will be developed for designing RCTs that have sufficient precision to distinguish trajectories, mechanisms, heterogeneity, and specificity of treatment efficacy. These efforts will provide researchers with the required a priori information to execute studies that ensure the robustness of their results. The development of these tools for RCT design will have implications for all areas of alcohol treatment research, including in-the-moment risk behaviors, person- level (comorbid) characteristics, targeting underserved and vulnerable populations, and large-scale initiatives. As a result, this proposal will allow for more definitive identification of efficacious interventions and treatments of alcohol use disorder. PROJECT NARRATIVE NIH-funded research is critical to addressing the nearly 44% lifetime prevalence of alcohol use disorder and reducing the $224 billion in annual preventable costs associated with drinking; thus, it is imperative that conclusions drawn from alcohol treatment research be robust and reliable. A priori determination of statistical power is one of the most significant steps in maximizing valid statistical inferences; yet, it has been historically overlooked in the health sciences and few tools exist for ensuring its accurate estimation. This proposal will develop a generalized framework for determining starting parameters and a flexible and user-friendly software platform for conducting power analyses of a wide range of study designs utilized by alcohol treatment researchers, thereby improving the rigor, reproducibility, and transparency of health science research and enhancing the scientific integrity of clinical and public health initiatives based on such findings.",Toward a Generalized Framework and Flexible Software Environment for Power Analysis of Alcohol Treatment Randomized Controlled Trials,9999397,R01AA027264,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Alcohols', 'Area', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive Therapy', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Development', 'Elements', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Ethics', 'Family', 'Family Study', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Growth', 'Guidelines', 'Health Sciences', 'Heterogeneity', 'Individual', 'Influentials', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Linear Regressions', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Naltrexone', 'National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism', 'Non-linear Models', 'Output', 'Pattern', 'Peer Review', 'Persons', 'Pharmacological Treatment', 'Pharmacology', 'Plant Roots', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Procedures', 'Public Health', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk Behaviors', 'Sample Size', 'Scientist', 'Social Network', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Specificity', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Models', 'Strategic Planning', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Uncertainty', 'Underserved Population', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Walking', 'alcohol abuse therapy', 'alcohol use disorder', 'base', 'comorbidity', 'computer human interaction', 'cost', 'design', 'drinking', 'effective therapy', 'flexibility', 'health science research', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'journal article', 'model design', 'novel', 'online registry', 'open data', 'power analysis', 'programs', 'randomized controlled design', 'simulation', 'simulation game', 'syntax', 'theories', 'therapy design', 'tool', 'tool development', 'treatment effect', 'treatment research', 'treatment trial', 'trial design', 'usability', 'user centered design', 'user friendly software', 'user-friendly', 'virtual', 'web app']",NIAAA,PURDUE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,671748,0.10934925032215428
"NCANDA: DATA ANALYSIS RESOURCE PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT During young adulthood, drinking dramatically increases, with binge-level drinking peaking at age 22 and nearly half of individuals who drink report binge-level alcohol use. Frequent binge alcohol use during the protracted neuromaturation extending into the mid 20s may result in greater brain and cognitive effects than similar alcohol use in later adulthood. This application is in response to RFA-AA-17-005, Continuation of the National Consortium on Alcohol and Neurodevelopment in Adolescence (NCANDA) Data Analysis Resource (U24) to determine the predictors and effects of accelerated alcohol use in adolescence and young adulthood. NCANDA-2 will follow the initial cohort of 831 participants (ages 12-21 at first visit) from 5 collection sites and acquire the necessary data to advance our understanding of adolescent development and the effects of alcohol use on the adolescent and young adult brain using multimodal neuroimaging, cognitive testing, and behavioral assessment. The examination of alcohol consequences will focus on structural and functional maturation of brain areas that actively develop during adolescence, are involved in psychological regulation, respond to rewards, and appear vulnerable to deleterious effects of alcohol. With the additional longitudinal data provided by this renewal, we will determine the effects of alcohol exposure on the developmental trajectory of the adolescent human brain and identify preexisting psychobiological vulnerabilities that may put an adolescent or young adult at elevated risk for an alcohol use disorder. The Data Analysis Resource (DAR) will 1) oversee data collection with standardization and comparability across sites; 2) perform data analysis for core measures collected at each site; 3) facilitate across-site pooling and centralized data storage; 4) create a database across assessment modalities for efficient retrieval; 5) coordinate data and resource sharing; 6) harmonize data across sites; and 7) create and implement novel, multimodality analyses using machine learning to engage broad spectrum data. The DAR has 5 Specific Aims: Aim 1. Maintain standardized procedures for collection of neuroimaging, neuropsychological, and clinical  assessment data and harmonize with existing large-scale neurodevelopmental research efforts. Aim 2. Ensure across-site quality control for imaging and neuropsychological data acquisition. Aim 3. Maintain and advance informatics infrastructure for data submission, analysis, and distribution.  a) Maintain a database integrating the diverse and comprehensive data from all NCANDA sites.  b) Provide data to consortium PIs for hypothesis testing within and across experimental domains. Aim 4. Provide macrostructural, microstructural, and fMRI neuroimage processing and analysis. Aim 5. Develop and maintain a data sharing and distribution system for the scientific public. PROJECT NARRATIVE The Data Analysis Resource will provide analysis of longitudinal data provided by this renewal to determine the extent to which structural and functional deficits in neurodevelopmental maturation precede, are caused by, or are exacerbated by initiation of appreciable alcohol use in adolescence.",NCANDA: DATA ANALYSIS RESOURCE,9961331,U24AA021697,"['Abstinence', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adolescent Development', 'Adolescent and Young Adult', 'Adult', 'Adverse effects', 'Affective', 'Age', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohols', 'Area', 'Behavior assessment', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Clinical assessments', 'Cognitive', 'Collection', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Data Storage and Retrieval', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Dose', 'Ensure', 'Event', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Heart Rate', 'Heavy Drinking', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mental disorders', 'Modality', 'Neuropsychology', 'Parietal', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Procedures', 'Quality Control', 'Recovery', 'Regulation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resource Sharing', 'Resources', 'Retrieval', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Saccades', 'Sampling', 'Sex Differences', 'Site', 'Sleep', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Models', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Visit', 'alcohol consequences', 'alcohol effect', 'alcohol expectancy', 'alcohol exposure', 'alcohol measurement', 'alcohol risk', 'alcohol use disorder', 'binge drinking', 'cognitive development', 'cognitive performance', 'cognitive testing', 'cohort', 'data acquisition', 'data harmonization', 'data sharing', 'data submission', 'drinking', 'emerging adult', 'experience', 'externalizing behavior', 'follow-up', 'informatics infrastructure', 'information processing', 'longitudinal analysis', 'longitudinal design', 'multimodality', 'neural circuit', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'psychobiologic', 'psychologic', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sex', 'underage drinking', 'young adult']",NIAAA,SRI INTERNATIONAL,U24,2020,1032001,0.18779343613067226
"Tracking and Prediction of Early Brain-Face Biomarkers of Prenatal Alcohol Exposure from Neonates to Children Maternal substance use disorders are a substantial public health concern and the neurological consequences of prenatal exposure are a major threat to the long-term health of offspring. Globally, prevalence of Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS) and Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD) is between 2-7 and 20-50 per 1000, respectively. By contrast, in certain high-risk communities in South Africa, prevalence is reported to be as high as 63 and 155 per 1000, respectively. Though prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) is known to affect the central nervous system, to date, little data exists in respect of the impact of PAE in early childhood, before both higher-level brain networks are established and other potentially confounding post- natal environmental influences have come into play. For neurodevelopmental disorders, studies have consistently shown that early intervention, based on detection and targeted interventions, leads to better long-term outcomes. We aim to address this precise gap in knowledge by imaging the brain and 3D face across the FASD continuum to investigate early biomarkers, trajectories and functional correlates of PAE in a cohort followed prospectively from birth to age 6 years. Data: Our cohort includes a well characterized subsample of children (PAE and healthy controls) enrolled in the Drakenstein Child Health Study in Cape Town, South Africa, who have been scanned as neonates and at 2-3 years of age. Preliminary published data shows highly significant relationships between PAE and regional gray and white matter changes, already discernible in newborns, well before the age FASD is typically diagnosed. An additional longitudinal assessment at 6-years will yield a unique FASD sample with 3 distinct time points (infants, toddlers and children), allowing characterization of brain and face morphology and brain structure and function in this previously understudied early developmental period. This proposal addresses fundamental gaps concerning the presence, timing and regional specificity of altered brain morphology and structural and functional connectivity in association with the effects of PAE on the developing brain from birth to 6 years, and the relationships with facial dysmorphology. The research team has successfully gathered data from the proposed cohort as neonates and at 2–3 years of age. The benefits of extending this research to a subsequent imaging time-point, with a larger range of developmental and neurobehavioral assessments, provides an unprecedented opportunity to determine longitudinal effects of PAE on the trajectory of the developing brain in these critical early years, the links between neural and face predictors of PAE and the long-term clinical significance of these findings. This research will illuminate early neurodevelopmental mechanisms leading to subsequent behavioral and neurological disturbances, which may allow opportunities for targeting interventions when brain plasticity is still relatively fluid. This project might also lead to new strategies for early diagnosis using both face and brain biomarkers. Project Narrative Fetal exposure of the brain to alcohol can trigger brain abnormalities that unfold over a lifetime with severe consequences both for the affected individual and for society at large. To date, these brain abnormalities and associated deficits and behaviors have mostly been studied in late childhood or later, with very few studies following the consequences of well documented fetal alcohol exposure as they develop in the same individual across time in early childhood when the brain is most responsive to potential treatments. This project will extend an ongoing study of children with fetal alcohol exposure, already characterized as newborns and at age 2-3 to add assessments of the brain and behavior at age 6 and will explore alcohol-induced facial abnormalities as a complementary predictor of brain problems. !",Tracking and Prediction of Early Brain-Face Biomarkers of Prenatal Alcohol Exposure from Neonates to Children,9969289,R01AA026834,"['2 year old', '3 year old', '3-Dimensional', '6 year old', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alcohols', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Cellular Phone', 'Child', 'Child Health', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Dysmorphology', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Emotional', 'Enrollment', 'Face', 'Fetal Alcohol Exposure', 'Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder', 'Fetal Alcohol Syndrome', 'Fetal alcohol effects', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Gestational Age', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Link', 'Liquid substance', 'Longevity', 'Longitudinal cohort', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Neonatal', 'Neuraxis', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neurologic', 'Newborn Infant', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Population', 'Pregnancy', 'Prevalence', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Severities', 'Shapes', 'Societies', 'South Africa', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Thalamic structure', 'Time', 'Toddler', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'alcohol exposure', 'antenatal', 'base', 'brain abnormalities', 'brain behavior', 'brain morphology', 'clinically significant', 'cohort', 'connectome', 'cost', 'data fusion', 'deep neural network', 'design', 'early childhood', 'early detection biomarkers', 'efficacy testing', 'fetal diagnosis', 'gray matter', 'high dimensionality', 'high risk', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'maternal alcohol use', 'maternal cigarette smoking', 'maternal depression', 'multimodality', 'neonatal brain', 'neonate', 'neurobehavioral', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'offspring', 'prenatal exposure', 'prospective', 'relating to nervous system', 'shape analysis', 'statistics', 'white matter', 'white matter change']",NIAAA,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2020,530736,0.11813813535674438
"3/3 Alcohol Research Consortium in HIV - Intervention Research Arm (ARCH-IRA) Alcohol Use Disorders (AUDs) and hazardous drinking are the fourth leading cause of preventable death in the US and are responsible for 10% of all deaths among working age adults. Among Persons Living with HIV/AIDS (PLWH), heavy alcohol use is up to twice the rate in the general population. Few people engage in behavioral alcohol treatment and alcohol pharmacotherapies are not routinely used as part of alcohol treatment, despite the known efficacy of these interventions. PLWH engaged in treatment for their HIV disease have regular contact with a medical provider and are treated in a medical home model in which all medical services are delivered within HIV clinics, but few HIV providers feel comfortable treating AUDs. During our initial funding period, we implemented routine alcohol screening, developed a computerized brief intervention (CBI), and conducted provider training on alcohol pharmacotherapies. However, while we found a strong impact from routine screening with CBI for reducing alcohol use, few providers prescribed alcohol pharmacotherapy, despite this specialized training, with most indicating continued discomfort and lack of knowledge for use of pharmacotherapy. Algorithms are used routinely to guide providers in treatment selection for many different disorders that are not within their specialty such as diabetes management, obesity, arthritis, and other disorders. In addition, we tested the use of provider algorithms for the treatment of depression and smoking with PLWH and demonstrated increased utilization of these medications. For this renewal, we are proposing an implementation science test of using an algorithm that will build upon our success with CBI and integrate alcohol pharmacotherapies and other behavioral therapies within routine treatment. A decision-tree algorithm that provides more intensive treatments, including alcohol pharmacotherapies, that is also responsive to comorbidities such as depressive or anxiety symptoms will be tested in three HIV clinics across CFAR Network of Integrated Clinical Systems (CNICS). Primary outcomes include reduced alcohol consumption and frequency, improved HIV outcomes, and improvement in comorbid conditions. We will also examine provider, staff, patient, and clinic-level facilitators and barriers to implementation of this algorithm in routine clinical care. Successful implementation of this treatment approach would have considerable impact on reducing AUDs among PLWH and could be integrated within existing electronic health record systems for a sustainable model of alcohol treatment delivery to other HIV clinics. Hazardous alcohol use is the fourth leading cause of preventable death in the United States and is up to twice as high among PLWH. Algorithms have been developed to increase the efficacy of the treatment of chronic diseases with tremendous success but have never been empirically tested to aid in alcohol use disorders (AUDs).

"Multi-modal connectivity methods for the validation of Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder diagnostic criteria Project Summary: FASD is a serious public health crisis with 80,000 to 120,000 U.S. pregnancies per year at high risk. FASD diagnostic clinics are very sparse, difficult to sustain because of diagnostic complexity, unable to meet demand, and plagued by disagreement about diagnostic criteria. A recent comparison of five FASD diagnostic systems acknowledged that the lack of objective biomarkers for prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) contributes to disagreement in the field. The goal of the proposed work is to develop and refine neuroimaging methods capable of identifying subtle neurodevelopmental abnormalities in PAE. A critical component of this project will be to apply these refined neuroimaging “biomarkers” to examine the validity and performance of the most commonly-used FASD diagnostic criteria (alcohol exposure, dysmorphology, growth, and cognition). The proposed project will push the development of imaging methods and will also include an examination of the sensitivity and specificity of current diagnostic factors. The aims are: 1) perform a comprehensive characterization of the FASD “connectome” using state-of- the-art Human Connectome Project (HCP) methods in children with PAE, 2) evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of FASD diagnostic criteria to provide objective evaluation of FASD criteria (which remain in flux), 3) characterize relationships between connectomics and cognitive functioning, & 4) examine the developmental course of functional connectivity, white matter connectivity, cortical gyrification, and intra-cortical myelin. Participants will undergo longitudinal re-assessment at 15-months to match the new HCP-development paradigm (HCP-D) to allow for comparison to a large normative dataset being collected in Minnesota as part of the HCP-D project. We will capitalize on the developments spawned from the $40 million HCP and will benefit from evaluating the brains of children with PAE against the backdrop of a very large HCP normative dataset (n=1300). The proposed study will examine 45 participants with PAE and 45 matched controls, ages 8-16, all of whom will be evaluated by the CIFASD dysmorphology project. Participants will undergo MRI scans at the University of Minnesota's Center for Magnetic Resonance Research (CMRR) at baseline and again 15 months later. The imaging protocol, which contains very high resolution structural, diffusion- weighted, and fMRI scans will evaluate cortical gyrification, intra-cortical myelin, white matter connectivity, and functional connectivity. Data from the HCP-D project will be used as secondary “normative” comparison dataset. We expect to find a number of subtle neurodevelopmental abnormalities in PAE that have not previously been observed and we will characterize individuals with these metrics. Individual identification of neurodevelopmental anomalies will then allow us to probe the screening properties of commonly used FASD diagnostic criteria and to test the performance of Dr. Mattson's Decision Tree model for rapidly identifying children with developmental effects of PAE. The study will have direct implications for FASD clinical practice and public policies as it will provide objective data about the relative advantages and disadvantages of individual diagnostic elements and it will allow for comparisons of competing FASD diagnostic systems. The proposed project aims to use the most advanced MRI brain imaging techniques available to address a highly practical problem faced by clinicians and public health officials: the lack of consensus about diagnostic criteria for Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD) and the challenges of identifying individuals who are affected by prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) but do not have the physical characteristics upon which a diagnosis can be made. The proposed study will identify subtle brain anomalies in children with PAE with a level of sensitivity not previously attainable. The study will push forward our understanding of how PAE negatively affects the efficiency of the brain's networks. In addition, the study will use these brain imaging results to further refine the diagnostic criteria such that more children will be able to be properly identified as having a neurodevelopmental disorder as a result of PAE.",Multi-modal connectivity methods for the validation of Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder diagnostic criteria,9940992,U01AA026102,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Animals', 'Attention', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Categories', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Consensus', 'Control Groups', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Trees', 'Development', 'Developmental Course', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Factor', 'Disadvantaged', 'Dysmorphology', 'Elements', 'Evaluation', 'Executive Dysfunction', 'Face', 'Fetal Alcohol Exposure', 'Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder', 'Fetal alcohol effects', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'MRI Scans', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Minnesota', 'Modeling', 'Myelin', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neurodevelopmental Impairment', 'Neurosciences', 'Participant', 'Performance', 'Predictive Value', 'Pregnancy', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Proxy', 'Psychometrics', 'Public Health', 'Public Policy', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Resource Sharing', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Site', 'Structural defect', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Work', 'alcohol exposure', 'clinical diagnostics', 'clinical practice', 'clinically relevant', 'cognitive function', 'connectome', 'diffusion weighted', 'executive function', 'functional MRI scan', 'high risk', 'imaging modality', 'longitudinal analysis', 'longitudinal dataset', 'multidisciplinary', 'multimodality', 'negative affect', 'neurobehavioral disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroimaging marker', 'performance tests', 'prisma', 'processing speed', 'screening', 'white matter']",NIAAA,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,U01,2020,344735,0.08368520905072079
"Can a Chatbot-delivered Alcohol Intervention Engage Users and Enhance Outcomes Over a Smartphone App? Development and Feasibility Testing of a StepAway 'Bot' PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT A wide gap exists between the number of individuals needing alcohol treatment and those actually receiving it. Many factors account for this gap, including stigma, treatment availability and affordability, and individuals wanting to solve their problems independently. Technologically-delivered interventions may dramatically increase the number of individuals who receive needed alcohol intervention services due to their ability to circumvent treatment barriers. Smartphones are the ideal devices to provide empirically-supported intervention assistance whenever and wherever it is needed. Our research team previously developed and tested a stand-alone, self-administered smartphone-based intervention system for alcohol use disorders that was based on empirically supported face-to-face treatments. This Location-Based Monitoring and Intervention for Alcohol Use Disorders (LBMI-A) system provided a progression through psychoeducational modules and in-the-moment interventions to reduce the likelihood of drinking. In a preliminary 6-week trial study, we contrasted the LBMI-A with a web-based intervention, the Drinker's Checkup (DCU) that was supplemented with bibliotherapy. While alcohol consumption was reduced by >50% in both interventions, only the LBMI-A produced a significant increase in percentage of days abstinent. Greater LBMI-A usage was associated with greater reductions in drinking. A revised and improved iPhone-based version, Step Away, has been developed and has been used by individuals downloading it from the iTunes App Store. Our Step Away usage data indicate that user engagement with modules that are not “pushed” to the user is relatively low, which is a problem that many health apps experience. A new method of delivering Step Away through an artificially intelligent chatbot will be developed in this study that holds potential for providing enhanced user engagement and effectiveness as it can reach out through a text interface to introduce new intervention steps and respond to the user with Step Away's in-the-moment help with having a craving, experiencing distress or needing social support. It could serve as a personal assistant that guides a user through a process of changing their drinking. This project will focus on developing a Step Away chatbot during the first phase of the study. We will also enhance the existing Step Away app's user interface for optimal usability. The second phase will entail performing a pilot study to determine if the Step Away chatbot has enhanced user engagement, intervention fidelity and outcome efficacy in comparison to the Step Away app among a group of problem drinkers. A control condition will consist of a minimal intervention; an assessment-only app. Participants will be interviewed to determine their perceptions of both interventions with a view towards understanding barriers to user engagement. Finally, this project will set the stage for a further, large-scale evaluation of Step Away, the content of which will be determined by the outcome of the pilot study. PROJECT NARRATIVE Smartphone-based alcohol interventions hold potential to bridge the wide gap between the number of individuals needing alcohol intervention and those actually receiving it, but more research is needed about their outcome efficacy and the optimal way to engage users in this new type of intervention. This study will continue to refine an empirically supported smartphone app (Step Away) and develop a similarly focused chatbot that will serve as a personal assistant to an individual interested in changing their drinking. We will also perform a pilot study that will compare user engagement and alcohol outcome variables across the two approaches.",Can a Chatbot-delivered Alcohol Intervention Engage Users and Enhance Outcomes Over a Smartphone App?

"Identification of fetal alcohol-affected children: Alterations in imprinted gene expression and methylation as biomarkers of neurobehavioral and growth impairment. Abstract Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) are the most common preventable cause of neurodevelopmental disabilities, with prevalence estimates of 3-10/1000 individuals in the US and up to 80/1000 in endemic communities. The promise of an increasing number of interventions tailored to prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE)-related neurobehavioral deficits is limited by diagnostic difficulties in clinical practice. Currently known biomarkers of exposure are neither sensitive nor specific for neurobehavioral deficits, in part because not all exposed children are affected. There is, therefore, a critical need for biomarkers of effect to identify affected children who would benefit from early, tailored therapeutic interventions. A growing body of literature has demonstrated alcohol-induced alterations in epigenetic programming as an important potential mechanism in FASD, suggesting that such alterations may serve as biomarkers of effect. Imprinted genes comprise a unique subset of epigenetically regulated genes that is sensitive to prenatal insults. There is considerable overlap between the neurobehavioral domains affected by FASD and those seen in experimental animal models of imprinted gene dysregulation, including learning, memory, and attachment. In a prenatally- recruited, prospective longitudinal cohort, we recently found that PAE was associated with alterations in placental level of expression of 11 of 93 expressed imprinted genes. Expression changes for five of these genes statistically mediated effects of alcohol on postnatal growth, identifying these alterations as biomarkers of fetal alcohol growth restriction. Given the remarkable overlap between the neurobehavioral domains affected in FASD and those affected by alteration of imprinted gene expression in animal models, alcohol-induced alterations in placental imprinted gene expression may also provide biomarkers for FASD neurocognitive deficits. Although most epigenetic marks are specific to tissue-type and timing of exposure, genomic imprinting maps and our pilot data indicate that markers of imprinted gene dysregulation identified in placental tissue may be detected in blood samples obtained at older ages. The aims of this study are: (1) To characterize the fetal alcohol-related imprintome signature in the placenta and in blood samples obtained at 6 yr; (2) To identify alterations in imprinted gene level of expression and ICR methylation that can serve as biomarkers of effect; (3) To validate findings in Aims 1 and 2 in blood samples from a 2nd, independent cohort. The data for this study will come from two prospective longitudinal cohorts recruited from the Cape Coloured community in Cape Town, South Africa, where the prevalence of FASD is among the highest in the world. Results from this study will make it possible to identify affected children who would benefit from early therapeutic interventions but would likely not be detected by current diagnostic tools. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Despite widespread public health advisories, alcohol use during pregnancy persists in the U.S. and worldwide, making fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) the most common preventable cause of neurodevelopmental delay. The promise of an ever-increasing number of interventions tailored to FASD deficits is limited by difficulties in identifying fetal alcohol-related facial dysmorphology in infancy and early childhood, when interventions are most effective, and in children with alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorder, in which neurodevelopmental impairment occurs in the absence of dysmorphic features. This proposal seeks to identify alterations in imprinted gene expression that can be used as biomarkers of adverse effect to identify infants and children with FASD who would benefit from therapeutic interventions but would probably not be detected by current diagnostic tools.",Identification of fetal alcohol-affected children: Alterations in imprinted gene expression and methylation as biomarkers of neurobehavioral and growth impairment.,10023145,R01AA027916,"['Adolescent', 'Adverse effects', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohol-Related Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Alcohols', 'Animal Model', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood specimen', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Cognitive', 'Color', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dysmorphology', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Experimental Animal Model', 'Face', 'Fetal Alcohol Exposure', 'Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder', 'Fetal Alcohol Syndrome', 'Gene Cluster', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genomic Imprinting', 'Growth', 'Growth Disorders', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Longitudinal cohort', 'Machine Learning', 'Malnutrition', 'Maps', 'Mediating', 'Memory', 'Methylation', 'Microcephaly', 'Neurocognitive Deficit', 'Neurodevelopmental Disability', 'Neurodevelopmental Impairment', 'Nursery Schools', 'Parents', 'Pattern', 'Placenta', 'Play', 'Pregnancy', 'Prevalence', 'Public Health', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'South Africa', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Tissues', 'Toxin', 'alcohol effect', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'early childhood', 'fetal', 'fetal diagnosis', 'gene function', 'imprint', 'infancy', 'neurobehavioral', 'novel', 'performance tests', 'postnatal', 'prenatal', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'recruit', 'targeted treatment', 'tool', 'trait', 'transcriptome', 'whole genome']",NIAAA,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2020,632755,0.0553868658535941
"Big data analytics for the evaluation of whole genome sequence and transcriptome data in alcohol research PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Large-scale U.S. epidemiological studies demonstrate that alcohol use disorders are highly prevalent, highly co-morbid with other psychiatric disorders, disabling, and often go untreated. Compared with other U.S. ethnic groups, Native Americans have the highest rates of alcohol and other drug dependence, and it is associated with particularly significant disability and mortality. Thus studies that identify specific genetic risk factors for alcohol use disorders in the general U.S. population, and especially in Native Americans, are of high public health importance. Alcohol use disorders are complex genetic diseases sensitive to environmental conditions that require complex data strategies to uncover the underlying risk factors. Although recent years have seen significant advancement in our understanding in the biology and genetics of the disorders, exactly how these factors interact in an individual to confer risk or protection from alcohol use disorders is still unclear. Further, the genetic factors identified in the human genome thus far by conventional methods appear to only explain a very small fraction of the overall heritability for the disorders.  The overall objective of this research program is to identify the complex genetic and genomic factors that affect susceptibility to alcohol use disorders and related comorbidities through novel and innovative quantitative methods and big data analytics. The proposed study will utilize whole-genome sequence (WGS) data from a unique high-risk Native American population and a European American population along with gene expression data of alcoholic human brains. The project will develop methodology to analyze WGS data with unique relevance to alcohol research. Selected multivariate, graphical, and dimension-reduction modeling tools will be used in combination with mixed models suitable for genomic data with both population and family structures to dissect polygenic basis for alcohol use disorders and shared genetic risk factors for alcohol use disorders and comorbid disorders. Mixture models and clustering methods will be employed to uncover heterogeneous genetic influences. Differential genetic effects at various levels of heterogeneity will be tested with rigorous statistical methods. The project will identify population and ancestry-specific genetic risk factors and shared risk factors across populations and determine their differential influences on susceptibility to alcohol use disorders. Endophenotypes will also be investigated to help identify unique risk factors for alcohol use disorder traits. The project will further identify alcohol- and addiction-relevant pathways and networks that are differentially expressed in alcoholic brains, and establish directions of causations by combining gene expression data with WGS data, and applying instrumental variable approaches. Finally, an integrated system approach will be taken by further leveraging epigenomic maps and annotation databases in the public domain to build predictive and potentially causal models aimed at more “personalized” prevention and intervention for alcohol use disorders in specific high-risk groups and individuals. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Alcohol use disorders are prevalent, frequently co-occur with other psychiatric disorders, are disabling and often go untreated. Identifying specific genetic risk factors for alcohol use disorders in the general U.S. population, and especially in high risk ethnic groups such as Native Americans, will lead to more personalized thus more effective prevention and intervention for alcoholism in these populations.",Big data analytics for the evaluation of whole genome sequence and transcriptome data in alcohol research,9981554,K25AA025095,"['Affect', 'Alcohol dependence', 'Alcoholism', 'Alcohols', 'American', 'Autopsy', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Big Data', 'Big Data Methods', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Drug Addiction', 'Ethnic group', 'Etiology', 'European', 'Evaluation', 'Family Study', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Hereditary Disease', 'Heritability', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Individual', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mental disorders', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Native Americans', 'New South Wales', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Domains', 'Public Health', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Randomized', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'San Francisco', 'Siblings', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'System', 'Testing', 'Variant', 'addiction', 'alcohol and other drug', 'alcohol intervention', 'alcohol research', 'alcohol use disorder', 'base', 'causal model', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'complex data ', 'differential expression', 'disability', 'endophenotype', 'epidemiology study', 'epigenomics', 'family structure', 'genetic risk factor', 'genome wide association study', 'genomic data', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'individualized prevention', 'innovation', 'mortality', 'non-alcoholic', 'novel', 'pleiotropism', 'predictive modeling', 'problem drinker', 'programs', 'risk sharing', 'statistics', 'tissue resource', 'tool', 'trait', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptomics', 'whole genome']",NIAAA,SCRIPPS RESEARCH INSTITUTE,K25,2020,161460,0.14100521124354576
"Sex Differences in Alcohol-Related Neurotoxicity During Adolescence ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Adolescence is a time of dramatic development, much of which varies as a function of sex. Also during this time, alcohol use becomes very common. Likely due to heightened plasticity, the adolescent brain is particularly susceptible to the neurotoxic effects of alcohol. While studies have separately documented cross- sectional sex differences in the effects of alcohol on the adolescent brain and hormonal influences on normative adolescent brain development, to fully understand sex-specific adolescent risk and resilience for alcoholism, multimodal prospective longitudinal studies are crucial. To that end, during this funding period, we will assess an additional 120 healthy non-alcohol/drug using 14-16-year-old youth using functional neuroimaging during working memory and decision making, resting state functional neuroimaging, diffusion tensor imaging, neurocognitive assessment, mood/behavior/personality assessment, and serum hormone assays. Together with over 200 youth assessed during the first funding period of the project, all youth will be quarterly monitore for changes in alcohol/drug use, and youth who emerge into heavy alcohol use (as well as a matched non-using control) will be re-assessed at two time points following initiation of heavy drinking behavior. Using a multi-modal longitudinal design, we aim to better understand sex-specific effects of heavy alcohol use on adolescent brain functioning and connectivity, as well as identify premorbid sex-specific neurobiological risk phenotypes that are predictive of problem drinking during adolescence and young adulthood. Further, we will explore moderating variables, such timing and frequency of alcohol and other drug use, as well as the role of gonadal steroids on sex-specific developmental trajectories. Disentangling sex- specific risk for and consequences of alcohol use during adolescence, in relation to normative brain development, and determining which effects may be hormonally influenced, will move the field closer to more personalized prevention and intervention strategies aimed at male and female youth. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The present study seeks to longitudinally examine sex-specific alcohol effects on the adolescent brain and identify sex-specific neurobiological risk markers that are predictive of high levels of drinking during adolescence and young adulthood. Understanding sex-specific risk for and consequences of alcohol use during adolescence is a crucial step toward developing more informed prevention and treatment strategies.",Sex Differences in Alcohol-Related Neurotoxicity During Adolescence,9939354,R01AA017664,"['16 year old', 'Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Alcohol abuse', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcoholism', 'Alcohols', 'Anisotropy', 'Appetitive Behavior', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Assay', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data Collection', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Drug usage', 'Emotional', 'Estradiol', 'Female', 'Fiber', 'Financial compensation', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Glare', 'Gonadal Steroid Hormones', 'Heavy Drinking', 'Hormonal', 'Hormones', 'Knowledge', 'Longitudinal prospective study', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Male Adolescents', 'Mediating', 'Modeling', 'Moods', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurocognitive', 'Parietal', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Personality', 'Personality Assessment', 'Phenotype', 'Prevention strategy', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Prospective Studies', 'Reporting', 'Rest', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Risk Marker', 'Role', 'Serum', 'Sex Differences', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Testosterone', 'Time', 'Youth', 'adolescent brain development', 'alcohol and other drug', 'alcohol consequences', 'alcohol effect', 'base', 'binge drinking', 'brain behavior', 'cognitive change', 'cohort', 'drinking', 'drinking behavior', 'emotional behavior', 'improved', 'individualized prevention', 'longitudinal design', 'male', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'neurotoxic', 'neurotoxicity', 'predictive marker', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'resilience', 'response', 'sex', 'treatment strategy', 'underage drinking', 'young adult']",NIAAA,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,397524,0.1843430899563411
"Administrative Core of the CIFASD Project Summary/Abstract The Collaborative Initiative on Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (CIFASD) is a multidisciplinary, international consortium of research projects and resource cores charged with improving prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of FASD. The Administrative Resource Core of the CIFASD (AdminC) has led this consortium since it was first established in 2003 and plays a critical leadership role in the coordination of research efforts and ensuring progress toward consortium goals. CIFASD addresses issues related to prenatal alcohol exposure across the lifespan, using a range of interrelated clinical and preclinical research approaches. This iteration of the consortium consists of multiple collaborative components including four resource U24 cores (AdminC, Dysmorphology, Informatics, and Outreach/Dissemination), nine U01 research projects (clinical, basic science, and/or translational) and two exploratory/developmental UH2 projects. One goal of the CIFASD is to improve identification of individuals who have been affected by prenatal alcohol exposure. This will be accomplished by assessing biomarkers, such as immune and miRNA profiles, and by using neuroimaging techniques that may be more sensitive to subtle pathology seen in individuals who do not meet the diagnostic criteria for FAS. In addition, CIFASD will develop novel tools, such as 3D facial and neurobehavioral screening, which can be assessed remotely and made more universally accessible through eHealth. The use of telemedicine will also provide access to more detailed dysmorphology evaluations. Another goal is to identify risk and resiliency factors, including genetic influences that will help with understanding the mechanisms of alcohol's damaging effects and also lead to more targeted interventions. A third goal is to better understand the effects of prenatal alcohol exposure on consequences across the lifespan, including adulthood. Finally, an intervention for improving outcomes will be modified to a mobile platform, so that it can reach larger populations of individuals with FASD and their families. Collectively, these projects have the potential for moving the FASD field forward, improving the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of FASD and serving a wide audience with the technologies available in eHealth. The Specific Aims of the AdminC are to: 1) Provide scientific and administrative direction, leadership and oversight to CIFASD; 2) Facilitate communication among the various projects and the dissemination of results; 3) Assist with data management strategies; 4) Provide annual evaluations of progress; and 5) Provide assistance to projects with implementing eHealth technology. The AdminC provides the foundation for the interactive and supportive framework of CIFASD by establishing regular communications with all members through monthly conference calls and biannual meetings; leading the Steering Committee in the establishment and implementation of CIFASD priorities and policies; supporting the Science Advisory Board with its evaluations of progress on each component as well as the overall mission of CIFASD; as well as serving as the liaison between the consortium's project scientists and its NIAAA advisors. Project Narrative The consequences resulting from prenatal alcohol exposure are wide-ranging and a major and costly public health problem. The goal of the CIFASD consortium is to enhance the identification and treatment of FASD utilizing a multidisciplinary approach consisting of both basic science and clinical research. The collaborations among research projects will allow CIFASD to improve the diagnosis and treatment of FASD, moving the field forward in ways that could not be easily achieved by individual projects.",Administrative Core of the CIFASD,9940986,U24AA014811,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Alcohols', 'Animal Experimentation', 'Animal Model', 'Archives', 'Basic Science', 'Behavior', 'Behavior assessment', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain imaging', 'Cellular Phone', 'Charge', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Decision Trees', 'Developing Countries', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dysmorphology', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Face', 'Family', 'Fetal Alcohol Exposure', 'Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder', 'Fetal alcohol effects', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Screening', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Human', 'Image', 'Immune', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Information Dissemination', 'Infrastructure', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'MicroRNAs', 'Mission', 'Modality', 'National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Pattern', 'Physical assessment', 'Play', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Progress Reports', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Publications', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resource Allocation', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Schedule', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Screening procedure', 'Tablets', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Telemedicine', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Uncertainty', 'Woman', 'Work', 'base', 'behavioral health', 'behavioral study', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive testing', 'cohort', 'cost', 'cytokine', 'data management', 'diagnostic screening', 'drinking', 'eHealth', 'epidemiology study', 'fetal', 'forging', 'health care service', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'meetings', 'member', 'mobile computing', 'multidisciplinary', 'neurobehavioral', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'outreach', 'pre-clinical research', 'program dissemination', 'recruit', 'repository', 'resilience', 'screening', 'symposium', 'tool', 'web site']",NIAAA,SAN DIEGO STATE UNIVERSITY,U24,2020,428830,0.15664405541295742
"Neural Correlates of Emotion Regulation in Youth at Risk for Alcoholism Project Summary/Abstract According to the latest estimates, over 1 in 7 Americans will develop an Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD) over the course of their lifetime, and alcohol consumption is involved in nearly 4% of deaths worldwide. Thus, AUDs represent a significant public health concern. Currently, the best pharmacotherapies for AUDs require the treatment of 10 patients to observe 1 patient reduce drinking to healthy levels. For this reason, one appealing option is to identify at-risk individuals before they become heavy drinkers; for instance a family history of alcoholism is currently among the best predictors of AUD. Adolescence presents an ideal period to study these factors as it precedes the onset of AUDs but is also a time when there is a rapid increase in consumption. We have recently shown that neuroimaging measures can be used to predict clinically meaningful outcomes (e.g. relapse), suggesting it would also be possible to develop neuroimaging as a predictor of onset of heavy drinking in adolescents. Developing predictive tools to identify adolescents likely to progress to heavy drinking would offer the opportunity for early intervention and could potentially reduce the progression to AUD. Substantial evidence suggests that primary motives for problematic drinking are to enhance positive valence and reduce negative valence emotions. Further, substance use disorders are associated with altered activity in the insula, ventral striatum, amygdala, and anterior cingulate cortex when processing potential rewards and aversive outcomes. We hypothesize that individuals at risk for AUDs will show heightened response to aversive stimuli in the anterior insula and amygdala and heightened response to rewarding stimuli in the ventral striatum and anterior cingulate cortex. We further hypothesize that they will exhibit diminished functional connectivity between reward, salience, and executive control networks. To test this, we will recruit 70 adolescents aged 18–20. Half will be have a biological parent with an AUD. The other half will be a control group matched on current drinking levels, age, gender, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status. All participants will undergo a functional MRI scan with a resting state run and a run during a modified version of the monetary incentive delay task that includes the risk of hearing an aversive sound (i.e. a loud scream). All participants will be followed for 6 months after the scan to determine levels of drinking. This study will provide both mechanistic information on risk for AUD as well as a tool to identify adolescents at greatest risk prior to the onset of problem drinking. This information could help provide personalized information about risk that may maximize likelihood of AUD prevention. In addition to the research goals described above, this is a training proposal that is designed to facilitate the transition of the primary investigator, Dr. Joshua Gowin, from mentored post-doctoral research fellow to independent, tenure-track research faculty at an academic institution. The mentored phase of the proposal will use a multifaceted training plan to improve Dr. Gowin’s knowledge base as well as his research and professional skillsets. Specifically, Dr. Gowin will learn new techniques in resting state functional connectivity analysis and in the cognitive neuroscience of emotion regulation. In addition to this scientific training, Dr. Gowin will gain experience management, teaching, and data presentation. To achieve these goals, Dr. Gowin has assembled a team of advisors from the intra- and extramural community with expertise in these areas to guide his training and development. This committee will include Dr. Vijay Ramchandani-NIAAA, Dr. Monique Ernst-NIMH, Dr. Elliot Stein-NIDA, and Dr. Susan Tapert-UCSD (see letters of support). The skills that will be developed during the mentored phase will position Dr. Gowin for success as he applies for an independent position and establishes his own research program. Project Narrative  Alcohol use disorders will affect over one in 10 Americans over the course of their lifetime. The early identification of individuals at greatest risk may provide opportunities to educate or provide services that mitigate individual risk. Therefore, identifying risk factors for alcohol use disorders is an important goal for researchers. One emerging target for research involves using functional MRI to study brain systems that contribute to risk. This project will explore the neural correlates of positive and negative valence emotional processing and how they contribute to risk for the development of alcohol use disorders. Better understanding of these neural processes could inform us about how alcohol use disorders emerge and, importantly, how we might prevent them.",Neural Correlates of Emotion Regulation in Youth at Risk for Alcoholism,10004489,R00AA024778,"['Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alcohol abuse', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcoholic beverage heavy drinker', 'Alcoholism', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anterior', 'Area', 'Aversive Stimulus', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Consumption', 'Control Groups', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Development', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Extramural Activities', 'Family', 'Family history of', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Hearing', 'Heavy Drinking', 'Individual', 'Institution', 'Insula of Reil', 'Learning', 'Letters', 'Loudness', 'Matched Group', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism', 'Negative Valence', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Personality', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phase', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Positive Valence', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Predictive Value', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Questionnaires', 'Recording of previous events', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Review Literature', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Services', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Stimulus', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'System', 'Targeted Research', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Ventral Striatum', 'Youth', 'aged', 'alcohol risk', 'alcohol use disorder', 'base', 'career', 'cingulate cortex', 'clinical predictors', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'design', 'disorder prevention', 'disorder risk', 'drinking', 'drinking behavior', 'emotion regulation', 'executive function', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'faculty research', 'financial incentive', 'follow-up', 'functional MRI scan', 'high risk', 'improved', 'knowledge base', 'machine learning algorithm', 'negative affect', 'neural correlate', 'neuroimaging', 'positive emotional state', 'predicting response', 'predictive tools', 'prevent', 'programs', 'recruit', 'relapse prediction', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'skills', 'sound', 'success', 'tenure track', 'tool', 'underage drinking']",NIAAA,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,R00,2020,249000,0.06135314680650983
