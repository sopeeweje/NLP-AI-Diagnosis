"Automated domain adaptation for clinical natural language processing Project Summary Automatic extraction of useful information from clinical texts enables new clinical research tasks and new technologies at the point of care. The natural language processing (NLP) systems that perform this extraction rely on supervised machine learning. The learning process uses manually labeled datasets that are limited in size and scope, and as a result, applying NLP systems to unseen datasets often results in severely degraded performance. Obtaining larger and broader datasets is unlikely due to the expense of the manual labeling process and the difficulty of sharing text data between multiple different institutions. Therefore, this project develops unsupervised domain adaptation algorithms to adapt NLP systems to new data. Domain adaptation describes the process of adapting a machine learning system to new data sources. The proposed methods are unsupervised in that they do not require manual labels for the new data. This project has three aims. The first aim makes use of multiple existing datasets for the same task to study the differences in domains, and uses this information to develop new domain adaptation algorithms. Evaluation uses standard machine learning metrics, and analysis of performance is tightly bounded by strong baselines from below and realistic upper bounds, both based on theoretical research on machine learning generalization. The second aim develops open source software tools to simplify the process of incorporating domain adaptation into clinical text processing workflows. This software will have input interfaces to connect to methods developed in Aim 1 and output interfaces to connect with Apache cTAKES, a widely used open- source NLP tool. Aim 3 tests these methods in an end-to-end use case, adverse drug event (ADE) extraction on a dataset of pediatric pulmonary hypertension notes. ADE extraction relies on multiple NLP systems, so this use case is able to show how broad improvements to NLP methods can improve downstream methods. This aim also creates new manual labels for the dataset for an end-to-end evaluation that directly measures how improvements to the NLP systems lead to improvement in ADE extraction. Project Narrative Software systems that use machine learning to understand clinical text often suffer severe performance loss when they are applied to new data that looks different than the data that they originally learned from. In this project, we develop and implement methods that allow these systems to automatically adapt to the characteristics of a new data source. We evaluate these methods on the clinical research task of adverse drug event detection, which relies on many different variables found in the text of electronic health records.",Automated domain adaptation for clinical natural language processing,9768545,R01LM012918,"['Adult', 'Adverse drug event', 'Algorithms', 'Apache', 'Area', 'Characteristics', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Clinical Research', 'Colon Carcinoma', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Conceptions', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Detection', 'Dimensions', 'Ecosystem', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Evaluation', 'Human', 'Institution', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Language', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Linguistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of brain', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Network-based', 'Output', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Process', 'Pulmonary Hypertension', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Research', 'Software Tools', 'Source', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Text', 'TimeLine', 'Training', 'Update', 'Vision', 'Work', 'base', 'case finding', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'method development', 'natural language', 'neural network', 'new technology', 'news', 'novel', 'open source', 'point of care', 'side effect', 'social media', 'software systems', 'statistics', 'supervised learning', 'tool', 'tumor', 'unsupervised learning']",NLM,BOSTON CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2019,383874,0.009911630723079833
"Temporal relation discovery for clinical text Project Summary / Abstract The current proposal continues the investigation on the topic of temporal relation extraction from the Electronic Medical Records (EMR) clinical narrative funded by the NLM since 2010 (Temporal Histories of Your Medical Events, or THYME; thyme.healthnlp.org). Through our efforts so far, we have defined the topic as an active area of research attracting attention across the world. Since its inception, the project has pushed the boundaries of this highly challenging task by investigating new computational methods within the context of the latest developments in the fields of natural language processing (NLP), machine learning (ML), artificial intelligence (AI) and biomedical informatics (BMI) resulting in 60+ publications/presentations. We have made our best performing methods available to the community open source as part of the Apache Clinical Text Analysis and Knowledge Extraction System (cTAKES; ctakes.apache.org). In 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018, we organized an international shared task (Clinical TempEval) on the topic under the umbrella of the highly prestigious SemEval, thus inviting the international community to work with our THYME data and improve on our results. Clinical TempEval has been highly successful with many participants each year, resulting in new discoveries and many publications. We have made all our data along with our gold standard annotations available to the community through the hNLP Center (center.healthnlp.org).  The underlying theme of this renewal is novel methods for combining explicit domain knowledge (linguistic, semantic, biomedical ontological, clinical), readily available unlabeled data (health-related social media, EMRs), and modern machine learning techniques (e.g. neural networks) for temporal relation extraction from the EMR clinical narrative. Therefore, our renewal proposes a novel and much needed exploration of this line of research:  Specific Aim 1: Develop computational models for novel rich semantic representations such as the Abstract Meaning Representations to encapsulate a single, coherent, full-document graphical representation of meaning for temporal relation extraction  Specific Aim 2: Develop computational methods to infuse domain knowledge (linguistic, semantic, biomedical ontological, clinical) into modern machine learning techniques such as NNs for temporal relation extraction – through input representations, pre-trained vectors, or architectures  Specific Aim 3: Develop novel methods for combining labeled and unlabeled data from various sources (EMR, health-related social media, newswire) for temporal relation extraction from the clinical narrative  Specific Aim 4: Apply the best performing methods for temporal relation extraction developed in SA1-3 to temporally sensitive phenotypes for direct translational sciences studies. Dissemination efforts through publications and open source releases into Apache cTAKES. Project Narrative Temporal relations are of prime importance in biomedicine as they are intrinsically linked to diseases, signs and symptoms, and treatments. Understanding the timeline of clinically relevant events is key to the next generation of translational research where the importance of generalizing over large amounts of data holds the promise of deciphering biomedical puzzles. The goal of our current proposal is to automatically discover temporal relations from clinical free text and structured EMR data and create an aggregated patient-level timeline.",Temporal relation discovery for clinical text,9735964,R01LM010090,"['Address', 'Apache', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Attention', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Encapsulated', 'Engineering', 'Event', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Image', 'International', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Knowledge Extraction', 'Label', 'Linguistics', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modernization', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Participant', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Publications', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Semantics', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Solid', 'Source', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Text', 'Thyme', 'Time', 'TimeLine', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Vision', 'Work', 'advanced disease', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'biomedical ontology', 'clinically relevant', 'cohesion', 'electronic data', 'electronic structure', 'epidemiology study', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'learning community', 'neural network', 'next generation', 'novel', 'open source', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'social media', 'symptom treatment', 'vector']",NLM,BOSTON CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2019,626851,-0.02375499766869215
"Leveraging Unlabeled and Pseudo Data for Clinical Information Extraction Project Summary/Abstract Electronic Health Records (EHRs) contain significant information that can benefit many downstream uses. However, most of this information is in unstructured narrative form and is inaccessible to computerized methods that rely on structured representations for exploring, retrieving, and presenting the information. Natural language processing (NLP) and information extraction (IE) open this trove of information to studies that would otherwise be without. Over the past decades, many IE systems have been developed. These systems have typically focused on one task at a time. In addition, most have studied only specific types of records, e.g., discharge summaries, and addressed their task on data from a single institution. Performances achieved by the state-of-the-art IE systems developed under these conditions ranged from 44% F-measure to 99% F-measure. This observed variation can be attributed to the nature of the tasks: some target entities like dates tend to be better represented in the data and also more rigidly stick to known patterns of expression as opposed to reasons for medication administration which are relatively sparse in the data and can show wider linguistic diversity. However, this may not be the only reason: the data used can also explain the performance variation. Narratives of EHRs vary in their style, format, and content going from one department to another, from one hospital to another. Even the same record type in two different hospitals can be very different in narrative style and pose different challenges for IE. Understanding IE performance therefore requires studies of multiple tasks on multiple record types that come from multiple institutions. One major bottleneck for evaluation of IE systems on such a large scale is annotation. The same bottleneck also limits system development. This proposal aims to address this bottleneck for both evaluation and development. It first generates a multi-institution corpus consisting of multiple record types from five institutions. It studies four different IE tasks that broadly represent IE in clinical records and can inform the field of IE as a whole: de-identification, clinical concept extraction, medication extraction, and adverse drug event extraction. Within the context of these IE tasks, the proposal then puts forward methods that learn from unlabeled or pseudo data that can help alleviate reliance on annotated data for development. It evaluates these methods both for performance and generalizability on multiple types of records from multiple institutions. As a result of these activities, this proposal generates de-identified data, annotations, methods, software, and machine learning models which it then makes available to the research community. Project Narrative Information extraction (IE) systems, i.e., natural language processing (NLP) systems that enable creation of accurate semantic representations of narratives, rely heavily on the availability of gold standard annotated corpora and vary significantly in their performance from task to task, and from data set to data set. We propose methods that augment gold standard data with unlabeled data that are more easily available, and pseudo data which can be derived from gold standard data. We study IE within the context of four tasks and evaluate IE systems enhanced with unlabeled and pseudo data for generalizability on a heterogeneous data set consisting of multiple record types from five institutions.",Leveraging Unlabeled and Pseudo Data for Clinical Information Extraction,9813134,R15LM013209,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Address', 'Adverse drug event', 'Affect', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Discipline of Nursing', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Engineering', 'Evaluation', 'Frequencies', 'Gold', 'Growth', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitals', 'Institution', 'Israel', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Linguistics', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Names', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Plant Roots', 'Procedures', 'Psychiatry', 'Publications', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Route', 'Sampling', 'Semantics', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Social Work', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Systems Development', 'Task Performances', 'Telephone', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Thinness', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Virginia', 'Washington', 'computerized', 'deep learning', 'dosage', 'field study', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'medication administration', 'novel', 'open source', 'response', 'supervised learning', 'tool']",NLM,GEORGE MASON UNIVERSITY,R15,2019,414798,-0.002897569243069205
"Semi-Automating Data Extraction for Systematic Reviews Summary ​Semi-Automating Data Extraction for Systematic Reviews (​Renewal) Evidence-based Medicine (EBM) aims to inform patient care using all available evidence. Realizing this aim in practice would require access to concise, comprehensive, and up-to-date structured summaries of the evidence relevant to a particular clinical question. Systematic reviews of biomedical literature aim to provide such summaries, and are a critical component of the EBM arsenal and modern medicine more generally. However, such reviews are extremely laborious to conduct. Furthermore, owing to the rapid expansion of the biomedical literature base, they tend to go out of date quickly as new evidence emerges. These factors hinder the practice of evidence-based care. In this renewal proposal, we seek to continue our ground-breaking efforts on developing, evaluating, and deploying novel machine learning (ML) and natural language processing (NLP) methods to automate or semi-automate the evidence synthesis process. This will extend our innovative and successful efforts developing RobotReviewer and related technologies under the current grant. Concretely, for this renewal we propose to move from extraction of clinically salient data elements from individual trials to synthesis of these elements across trials. Our first aim is to extend our ML and NLP models to produce (as one deliverable) a publicly available, continuously and automatically updated semi-structured evidence database, comprising extracted data for all evidence, both published and unpublished. Unpublished trials will be identified via trial registries. Taking this up-to-date evidence repository as a starting point, we then propose cutting-edge ML and NLP models that will generate first drafts of evidence syntheses, automatically. More specifically we propose novel neural cross-document summarization models that will capitalize on the semi-structured information automatically extracted by our existing models, in addition to article texts. These models will be deployed in a new version of RobotReviewer, called RobotReviewerLive, intended to be a prototype for “living” systematic reviews. To rigorously evaluate the practical utility of the proposed methodological innovations, we will pilot their use to support real, ongoing, exemplar living reviews. Semi-Automating Data Extraction for Systematic Reviews (​Renewal) Narrative We propose novel machine learning and natural language processing methods that will aid biomedical literature summarization and synthesis, and thereby support the conduct of evidence-based medicine (EBM). The proposed models and technologies will motivate core methodological innovations and support real-time, up-to-date, semi-automated biomedical evidence syntheses (“systematic reviews”). Such approaches are necessary if we are to have any hope of practicing evidence-based care in our era of information overload.",Semi-Automating Data Extraction for Systematic Reviews,9818711,R01LM012086,"['American', 'Automation', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Data Element', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Elements', 'Evaluation', 'Evidence Based Medicine', 'Evidence based practice', 'Feedback', 'Grant', 'Hybrids', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Internet', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Medical Informatics', 'Metadata', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modern Medicine', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Paper', 'Patient Care', 'Population Intervention', 'Process', 'PubMed', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Registries', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'Surveillance Methods', 'System', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Textbooks', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Update', 'Vision', 'Work', 'base', 'cardiovascular health', 'database structure', 'design', 'evidence base', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'natural language', 'neural network', 'novel', 'open source', 'programs', 'prospective', 'prototype', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'repository', 'search engine', 'study characteristics', 'study population', 'success', 'systematic review', 'tool', 'usability', 'working group']",NLM,NORTHEASTERN UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,320194,-0.010599128810799916
"Integrative data science approaches for rare disease discovery in health records ABSTRACT: There are nearly 7,000 diseases that have a prevalence of only one in 2,000 individuals or less. Yet, such rare diseases are estimated to collectively affect over 300 million people worldwide, representing a significant healthcare concern. Although rare diseases have predominantly genetic origins, nearly half of them do not manifest symptoms until adulthood and frequently confound discovery and diagnosis. Even in the case of early onset disorders, the sheer number of possible diagnoses can often overwhelm clinicians. As a result, rare diseases are often diagnosed with delay, misdiagnosed or even remain undiagnosed, not only disrupting patient lives but also hindering progress on our understanding of such diseases. Data science methods that mine large-scale retrospective health record data for phenotypic information will aid in timely and accurate diagnoses of rare diseases, especially when combined with additional data types, thus, having significant real- world impact. This proposal will integrate electronic health record (EHR) data sets with publicly available vocabularies and ontologies, and genomic data for the improved identification and characterization of patients with rare diseases, using approaches from machine learning, natural language processing (NLP) and basic bioinformatics. The work has three specific aims and will be carried out in two phases. During the mentored phase, the principal investigator (PI) will develop data-driven methods to extract standardized concepts related to rare diseases from clinical notes and infer the occurrence of each disease (Aim 1). He will also develop data science approaches to compare and contrast longitudinal patterns associated with patients' journeys through the healthcare system when seeking a diagnosis for a rare disease, and aid in clinical decision-making by leveraging these patterns (Aim 2). During the independent phase (Aim 3), computational methods will be developed for the integrated modeling and analysis of genotypic (from Aim 3) and phenotypic information (from Aims 1 and 2). Cohorts to be sequenced will cover diseases for which causal genes or disease definitions are unclear (discovery), as well as those for which these are well known (validation). This work will be carried out under the mentorship of four faculty members with complementary expertise in biomedical informatics, data science, NLP, and rare disease genomics at the University of Washington, the largest medical system in the Pacific Northwest (four million EHRs), world-renowned researchers in medical genetics, and a robust data science environment. In addition, under the direction of the mentoring team, the PI will complete advanced coursework, receive training in translational bioinformatics and clinical research informatics, submit manuscripts, and seek an independent research position. This proposal will yield preliminary results for subsequent studies on data-driven phenotyping and enable the realization of the PI's career goals by providing him with the necessary training to build on his machine learning and basic bioinformatics expertise to transition into an independent investigator in biomedical data science. PROJECT NARRATIVE Rare genetic diseases are estimated to affect the lives of 25 to 30 million Americans and their families, and present a significant economic burden on the healthcare system. Currently, our knowledge of the broad spectrum of the 7,000 observed rare diseases is limited to a few well-studied ones, hindering our ability to make correct and timely diagnoses. The objective of this study is to improve the identification of patients with rare diseases in healthcare systems by developing data science approaches that automatically recognize rare disease-related patterns in patient health records and correlate them with genomic data, thus, aiding in diagnosis and discovery.",Integrative data science approaches for rare disease discovery in health records,9645433,K99LM012992,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'American', 'Award', 'Basic Science', 'Behavioral', 'Bioinformatics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Clinical Research', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostics Research', 'Disease', 'Economic Burden', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Faculty', 'Family', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuscripts', 'Markov Chains', 'Medical', 'Medical Genetics', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Names', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Natural Language Processing pipeline', 'Ontology', 'Outcome', 'Pacific Northwest', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevalence', 'Principal Investigator', 'Rare Diseases', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Standardization', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Vocabulary', 'Washington', 'Work', 'accurate diagnosis', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'career', 'causal variant', 'clinical data warehouse', 'clinical decision-making', 'cohort', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'disease phenotype', 'early onset disorder', 'exome sequencing', 'gene discovery', 'genomic data', 'health care delivery', 'health data', 'health record', 'improved', 'member', 'multimodal data', 'novel', 'open source', 'phenotypic data', 'prototype', 'psychologic', 'rare condition', 'rare genetic disorder', 'recruit', 'skills', 'software development', 'support tools', 'tool', 'trait']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,K99,2019,92070,-0.022986688423103616
"SimTK: An Ecosystem for Data and Model Sharing in the Biomechanics Community Physics-based simulations provide a powerful framework for understanding biological form and function. They harmonize heterogeneous experimental data with real-world physical constraints, helping researchers understand biological systems as they engineer novel drugs, new diagnostics, medical devices, and surgical interventions. The rise in new sensors and simulation tools is generating an increasing amount of data, but this data is often inaccessible, preventing reuse and limiting scientific progress. In 2005, we launched SimTK, a website to develop and share biosimulation tools, models, and data, to address these issues. SimTK now supports 62,000+ researchers globally and 950+ projects. Members use it to meet their grants’ data sharing responsibilities; experiment with new ways of collaborating; and build communities around their datasets and tools. However, challenges remain: many researchers still do not share their digital assets due to the time needed to prepare, document, and maintain those assets, and since SimTK hosts a growing number of diverse digital assets, the site now also faces the challenge of making these assets discoverable and reusable. Thus, we propose a plan to extend SimTK and implement new solutions to promote scientific data sharing and reuse. First, we will maintain the reliable, user-friendly foundation upon which SimTK is built, continuing to provide the excellent support our members expect and supporting the site’s existing features for sharing and building communities. Second, we will implement methods to establish a culture of model and data sharing in the biomechanics community. We will encourage researchers to adopt new habits, making sharing part of their workflow, by enabling the software and systems they use to automatically upload models and data to SimTK via an application programming interface (API) and by recruiting leading researchers in the community to serve as beta testers and role models. Third, we will create tools to easily replicate and extend biomechanics simulations. Containers and cloud computing services allow researchers to capture and share a snapshot of their computing environment, enabling unprecedented fidelity in sharing. We will integrate these technologies into SimTK and provide custom, easy-to-use interfaces to replicate and extend simulation studies. Lastly, we will develop a metadata standard for models and data for the biomechanics community, increasing reusability and discoverability of the rich set of resources shared on SimTK. We will use the new standard on SimTK and fill in the metadata fields automatically using natural language processing and machine learning, minimizing the burden and inaccuracies of manual metadata entry. We will evaluate our success in achieving these aims by tracking the number of assets shared and the frequency they are used as a springboard to new research. These changes will accelerate biomechanics research and provide new tools to increase the reusability and impact of shared resources. By lowering barriers to data sharing in the biosimulation community, SimTK will continue to serve as a model for how to create national infrastructure for scientific subdisciplines. SimTK is a vibrant hub for the development and sharing of simulation software, data, and models of biological structures and processes. SimTK-based resources are being used to design medical devices and drugs, to generate new diagnostics, to create surgical interventions, and to provide insights into biology. The proposed enhancements to SimTK will accelerate progress in the field by lowering barriers to and standardizing data and model sharing, thus 1) increasing the quantity and also, importantly, the quality of resources that researchers share and 2) enabling others to reproduce and build on the wealth of past biomechanics research studies.",SimTK: An Ecosystem for Data and Model Sharing in the Biomechanics Community,9636581,R01GM124443,"['Achievement', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'Biology', 'Biomechanics', 'Biophysics', 'Cloud Computing', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Consumption', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Files', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Documentation', 'Ecosystem', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Explosion', 'Face', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Habits', 'Infrastructure', 'Letters', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Device', 'Medical Device Designs', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physics', 'Process', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resource Sharing', 'Resources', 'Security', 'Services', 'Site', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Update', 'Work', 'application programming interface', 'base', 'biological systems', 'biomechanical model', 'community building', 'complex biological systems', 'data access', 'data sharing', 'digital', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'insight', 'member', 'new technology', 'novel diagnostics', 'novel therapeutics', 'prevent', 'recruit', 'research study', 'response', 'role model', 'sensor', 'simulation', 'simulation software', 'software systems', 'success', 'tool', 'user-friendly', 'web site']",NIGMS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,489919,-0.0030457709672211094
"Ethical Considerations for Language Modeling within Brain-Computer Interfaces Project Summary Machine learning (ML) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) have the potential to transform communication for patients with neurodegenerative disease through personalized and real-time augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) devices. Individuals with severe communication impairments who can no longer control their daily conversations or participate in previous life roles want AAC devices. And they want them to work – to be reliable, effective, and fast. ML and NLP are emerging as promising tools to bridge current technology and next generation devices for individuals with the most severe speech and physical impairments, like the RSVP Keyboard™, a brain-computer interface (BCI) being developed by the parent grant. BCI systems for communication are referred to as AAC-BCIs. NLP efforts to combine large public data sets with private data sets, such as personal email messages, promise to give individuals with communication impairments their own personalized language models, models that are sufficiently robust to get closer to real-time communication. The focus on getting AAC-BCIs to work with machine learning, however, has led to a critical oversight in the field: an inadequate understanding of why individuals want next-generation devices and what trade-offs they are willing to make for faster and more personalized communication. The turn to ML brings this oversight into sharp relief. Individuals should provide input about the data sets used to construct their personal language models, but this raises important ethical questions about what individuals value, how they understand their identity, and what trade-offs they are willing to make relative to their personalized communication data. The goal of this supplement is to fill this gap in understanding so that researchers can implement ML into next generation AAC-BCI systems in a way that is sensitive to the ethical concerns of future users. There are four components to this ethics supplement: (1) to design a toolbox of ethics vignettes tailored to ethical concerns raised by both BCI communication and ML; (2) to administer monthly vignette-based online ethics surveys to individuals with severe communication impairments due to motor neuron disease (e.g., ALS) (n=25) or movement disorders (e.g., Parkinson's disease) (n=25); (3) to conduct semi-structured vignette-based interviews with individuals with pre- clinical or mild communication impairment due to motor neuron disease (n=10) or movement disorder (n=10). Components (2) and (3) will employ an iterative, parallel mixed-method approach. Trends in Likert-style online responses to ethics vignettes in the severe communication impairment cohort will be used to inform and modify the semi-structured interview prompts asked of the pre-clinical or mild impairment cohort. In parallel, themes emerging from direct content analysis of interviews will be used to refine online survey questions. Results of this iterative, mix-methods approach will be used (4) to outline a framework of core ethical domains and preliminary tools (vignettes and discussion prompts) that AAC-BCI researchers can use to assess ethical concerns while developing and iteratively refining communication technology for personalized language models. Project Narrative The populations of US citizens with severe speech and physical impairments secondary to neurodegenerative diseases are increasing as medical technologies advance and successfully support life. These individuals with limited to no movement could potentially contribute to their medical decision making, informed consent, and daily caregiving if they had faster, more reliable means that adapt to their best access methods in communication technologies. Bioethical issues about privacy, agency and identity must be included in technology development and implementation as the parent grant implements the translation of basic computer science and engineering into clinical care, supporting the proposed NIH Roadmap and public health initiatives.",Ethical Considerations for Language Modeling within Brain-Computer Interfaces,9929337,R01DC009834,"['Address', 'Administrative Supplement', 'Affect', 'Attention', 'Attitude', 'Augmentative and Alternative Communication', 'Award', 'Bioethical Issues', 'Bioethics', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Cognitive', 'Communication', 'Communication impairment', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Disease', 'Electroencephalography', 'Electronic Mail', 'Encapsulated', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Ethical Analysis', 'Ethical Issues', 'Ethics', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Home environment', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Informed Consent', 'Interview', 'Language', 'Letters', 'Life', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Locked-In Syndrome', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medical Technology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monkeys', 'Motor Neuron Disease', 'Movement', 'Movement Disorders', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neuromuscular Diseases', 'Oregon', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Participant', 'Patient advocacy', 'Patients', 'Population', 'Privacy', 'Privatization', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Research Personnel', 'Review Literature', 'Role', 'Secondary to', 'Self-Help Devices', 'Source', 'Speech', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Translational Research', 'Translations', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'User-Computer Interface', 'Voice', 'Work', 'advocacy organizations', 'base', 'brain computer interface', 'caregiving', 'clinical care', 'cohort', 'communication device', 'computer science', 'design', 'expectation', 'informant', 'neurophysiology', 'next generation', 'novel', 'parent grant', 'pre-clinical', 'recruit', 'research and development', 'response', 'signal processing', 'skills', 'spelling', 'technology development', 'technology validation', 'tool', 'trend', 'uptake']",NIDCD,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,153834,-0.029503050093448408
"Automated Knowledge Engineering Methods to Improve Consumers' Comprehension of their Health Records PROJECT SUMMARY  Today, more patients can access their health records online than ever before. However, clinical acronyms hinder patients' comprehension of their records and decrease the benefits of transparency. An automated system for expanding clinical acronyms should have major clinical significance and far-reaching consequences for improving patient-provider communication, shared decision-making, and health outcomes. Existing systems have limited power to expand clinical acronyms, primarily due to the lack of comprehensiveness (or generali- zability) of existing acronym sense inventories. Because developing comprehensive sense inventories is difficult, existing knowledge engineering methods have primarily focused on developing institution-specific sense inventories. Institution-specific sense inventories may not be generalizable to other geographical regions and medical specialties. Furthermore, developing an institution-specific sense inventory at every US healthcare organization is not feasible, especially without automated methods which currently do not exist.  I developed advanced knowledge engineering methods to overcome these limitations through the use of fully automated techniques to generalize existing sense inventories from different geographical regions and medical specialties. My methods leverage the extensive resources already devoted to developing institution- specific sense inventories in the U.S., and may help generalize existing sense inventories to institutions without the resources to develop them. Although promising, challenges remain with the optimization and evaluation of these methods. The objective of the proposed project is to use knowledge engineering to improve patients' comprehension of their health records, focusing specifically on clinical acronyms. In Aim 1, I will develop new knowledge engineering methods to facilitate the automated integration of sense inventories, using literature- based quality heuristics and a Siamese neural network to establish synonymy. I will evaluate these methods using multiple metrics to assess redundancy, quality, and coverage in two test corpora with over 17 million clinical notes. In Aim 2, I will evaluate whether the knowledge engineering methods improve comprehension of doctors' notes in 60 hospitalized patients with advanced heart failure. With success, I will create novel, automated knowledge engineering methods that can be directly applied to improve patient care. This research is in support of my mentored doctoral training at Columbia University Department of Biomedical Informatics (DBMI) under Drs.

"Open Health Natural Language Processing Collaboratory Project Summary One of the major barriers in leveraging Electronic Health Record (EHR) data for clinical and translational science is the prevalent use of unstructured or semi-structured clinical narratives for documenting clinical information. Natural Language Processing (NLP), which extracts structured information from narratives, has received great attention and has played a critical role in enabling secondary use of EHRs for clinical and translational research. As demonstrated by large scale efforts such as ACT (Accrual of patients for Clinical Trials), eMERGE, and PCORnet, using EHR data for research rests on the capabilities of a robust data and informatics infrastructure that allows the structuring of clinical narratives and supports the extraction of clinical information for downstream applications. Current successful NLP use cases often require a strong informatics team (with NLP experts) to work with clinicians to supply their domain knowledge and build customized NLP engines iteratively. This requires close collaboration between NLP experts and clinicians, not feasible at institutions with limited informatics support. Additionally, the usability, portability, and generalizability of the NLP systems are still limited, partially due to the lack of access to EHRs across institutions to train the systems. The limited availability of EHR data limits the training available to improve the workforce competence in clinical NLP. We aim to address the above challenges by extending our existing collaboration among multiple CTSA hubs on open health natural language processing (OHNLP) to share distributional information of NLP artifacts (i.e., words, n-grams, phrases, sentences, concept mentions, concepts, and text segments) acquired from real EHRs across multiple institutions. We will leverage the advanced privacy-preserving computing infrastructure of iDASH (integrating Data for Analysis, Anonymization, and SHaring) for privacy- preserving data analysis models and will partner with diverse communities including Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics (OHDSI), Precision Medicine Initiative (PMI), PCORnet, and Rare Diseases Clinical Research Network (RDCRN) to demonstrate the utility of NLP for translational research. This CTSA innovation award RFA provides us with a unique opportunity to address the challenges faced with clinical NLP and through strong partnership with multiple research communities and leadership roles of the research team in clinical NLP, we envision that the successful delivery of this project will broaden the utilization of clinical NLP across the research community. There are four aims planned: i) obtain PHI-suppressed NLP artifacts with retained distribution information across multiple institutions and assess the privacy risk of accessing PHI- suppressed artifacts, ii) generate a synthetic text corpus for exploratory analysis of clinical narratives and assess its utility in NLP tasks leveraging various NLP challenges, iii) develop privacy-preserving computational phenotyping models empowered with NLP, and iv) partner with diverse communities to demonstrate the utility of our project for translational research.

"A deep learning platform to evaluate the reliability of scientific claims by citation analysis. The opioid epidemic in the United States has been traced to a 1980 letter reporting in the prestigious New England Journal of Medicine that synthetic opioids are not addictive. A belated citation analysis led the journal to append this letter with a warning this letter has been “heavily and uncritically cited” as evidence that addiction is rare with opioid therapy.” This epidemic is but one example of how unreliable and uncritically cited scientific claims can affect public health, as studies from industry report that a substantial part of biomedical reports cannot be independently verified. Yet, there is no publicly available resource or indicator to determine how reliable a scientific claim is without becoming an expert on the subject or retaining one. The total citation count, the commonly used measure, is inherently a poor proxy for research quality because confirming and refuting citations are counted as equal, while the prestige of the journal is not a guarantee that a claim published there is true. The lack of indicators for the veracity of reported claims costs the public, businesses, and governments, billions of dollars per year. We have developed a prototype that automatically classifies statements citing a scientific claim into three classes: those that provide supporting or contradicting evidence, or merely mention the claim. This unique capability enables scite users to analyze the reliability of scientific claims at an unprecedented scale and speed, helping them to make better-informed decisions. The prototype has attracted potential customers among top biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, research institutions, academia, and academic publishers. We propose to conduct research that will refine scite into an MVP by optimizing prototype efficiency and accuracy until they reach feasible milestones, and will refine the product-market fit in our beachhead market, academic publishing, whose influence on the integrity and reliability of research is difficult to overestimate. We propose to develop a platform that can be used to evaluate the reliability of scientific claims. Our deep learning model, combined with a network of experts, automatically classifies citations as supporting, contradicting, or mentioning, allowing users to easily assess the veracity of scientific articles and consequently researchers. By introducing a system that can identify how a research article has been cited, not just how many times, we can assess research better than traditional analytical approaches, thus helping to improve public health by identifying and promoting reliable research and by increasing the return on public and private investment in research.",A deep learning platform to evaluate the reliability of scientific claims by citation analysis.,9885663,R44DA050155,"['Academia', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Architecture', 'Biotechnology', 'Businesses', 'Classification', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Epidemic', 'Government', 'Human', 'Industry', 'Institution', 'Investments', 'Journals', 'Letters', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Marketing', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'New England', 'Performance', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Phase', 'Privatization', 'Program Description', 'Proxy', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Readiness', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Sales', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Speed', 'System', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Traction', 'Training', 'United States', 'Vision', 'Visual system structure', 'addiction', 'commercialization', 'cost', 'dashboard', 'deep learning', 'design', 'improved', 'insight', 'interest', 'literature citation', 'opioid epidemic', 'opioid therapy', 'product development', 'programs', 'prototype', 'success', 'synthetic opioid', 'tool', 'user-friendly']",NIDA,"SCITE, INC.",R44,2019,206139,-0.003003929118265992
"Online Evidence of Withdrawal Self-Medication PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Withdrawal symptoms from opioid use can be severe and are major contributing factors to relapse and continuing misuse. Many opioid users are actively experimenting with “remedies” that can alleviate withdrawal, and they are discussing their effectiveness in blogs and forums. In this pilot study we will use Natural Language Processing (NLP) and human expertise to examine over 50,000 recent posts in two Reddit forums OpiatesRecovery and Opiates to assess systematically which remedies are being used, how they are being used, and what are the reported consequences of such self-help experimentation. We will create a curated database of user-reported “remedies.” Information will be semiautomatically extracted from the online, self-reported use of alternative treatments (i.e., other prescription drugs, over the counter medications, food supplements, activities such as meditation and yoga). A team of a pharmacologist, physician, and ethnographer will evaluate database entries to uncover (1) potential harm associated with uncontrolled and unsupervised experimentation, (2) potentially effective available treatments (e.g., traditional medicine), (3) potentially promising compound leads, and (4) patients' needs and issues that are most important to them. Aim 1. To assemble an extensive database of opioid withdrawal and remedy-associated terminology from posts on OpiatesRecovery and Opiates Reddit communities. NLP will be used to build a language model that understands how words are used in context (word2vec). Aim 2. To develop a dataset of instances of self-reported remedy use from Reddit and conduct a bipartite network analysis of remedies and users. Using NLP tools and the word embedding model we will develop an exclusive dataset containing extracted information associated with remedies targeting withdrawal and craving. This aim will use elements of artificial intelligence and close human supervision to extract remedies, including variations of spelling, from the texts. The result of this aim will be a remedy database that includes spelling variations and slang references and a network analysis linking remedies and users. Aim 3. To organize, aggregate, and systematically assess information from mentions of remedy use. Potential compounds and other remedies will be classified to provide an initial assessment of their potential relevance to the opioid treatment process. This process will require the most human oversight and assessment. Network analysis tools will be used to assess and identify the relationships between the types of remedies and potential therapeutic effect and will create the benchmarks for similar future studies.

"PREMIERE: A PREdictive Model Index and Exchange REpository The confluence of new machine learning (ML) data-driven approaches; increased computational power; and access to the wealth of electronic health records (EHRs) and other emergent types of data (e.g., omics, imaging, mHealth) are accelerating the development of biomedical predictive models. Such models range from traditional statistical approaches (e.g., regression) through to more advanced deep learning techniques (e.g., convolutional neural networks, CNNs), and span different tasks (e.g., biomarker/pathway discovery, diagnostic, prognostic). Two issues have become evident: 1) as there are no comprehensive standards to support the dissemination of these models, scientific reproducibility is problematic, given challenges in interpretation and implementation; and 2) as new models are put forth, methods to assess differences in performance, as well as insights into external validity (i.e., transportability), are necessary. Tools moving beyond the sharing of data and model “executables” are needed, capturing the (meta)data necessary to fully reproduce a model and its evaluation. The objective of this R01 is the development of an informatics standard supporting the requisite information for scientific reproducibility for statistical and ML-based biomedical predictive models; from this foundation, we then develop new computational approaches to compare models' performance. We begin by extending the current Predictive Model Markup Language (PMML) standard to fully characterize biomedical datasets and harmonize variable definitions; to elucidate the algorithms involved in model creation (e.g., data preprocessing, parameter estimation); and to explain the validation methodology. Importantly, models in this PMML format will become findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (i.e., following FAIR principles). We then propose novel meth- ods to compare and contrast predictive models, assessing transportability across datasets. While metrics exist for comparing models (e.g., c-statistics, calibration), often the required case-level information is not available to calculate these measures. We thus introduce an approach to simulate cases based on a model's reported da- taset statistics, enabling such calculations. Different levels of transportability are then assigned to the metrics, determining the extent to which a selected model is applicable to a given population/cohort (i.e., helping answer the question, can I use this published model with my own data?). We tie these efforts together in our proposed framework, the PREdictive Model Index & Exchange REpository (PREMIERE). We will develop an online portal and repository for model sharing around PREMIERE, and our efforts will include fostering a community of users to guide its development through workshops, model-thons, and other activities. To demonstrate these efforts, we will bootstrap PREMIERE with predictive models from a targeted domain (risk assessment in imaging-based lung cancer screening). Our efforts to evaluate these developments will engage a range of stakeholders (model developers, users) to inform the completeness of our standard; and biostatisticians and clinical experts to guide assessment of model transportability. PROGRAM NARRATIVE With growing access to information contained in the electronic health record and other data sources, the appli- cation of statistical and machine learning methods are generating more biomedical predictive models. However, there are significant challenges to reproducing these models for purposes of comparison and application in new environments/populations. This project develops informatics standards to facilitate the sharing and reproducibil- ity of these models, enabling a suite of comparative methods to evaluate model transportability.",PREMIERE: A PREdictive Model Index and Exchange REpository,9712304,R01EB027650,"['Access to Information', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Bayesian Network', 'Big Data', 'Biological Markers', 'Calibration', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Computational Biology', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Trees', 'Dermatology', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Ecosystem', 'Educational workshop', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'FAIR principles', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Informatics', 'Language', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Metadata', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Online Systems', 'Ophthalmology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Reproduction', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk Assessment', 'Source', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'bioimaging', 'biomarker discovery', 'case-based', 'cohort', 'collaborative environment', 'comparative', 'computer aided detection', 'convolutional neural network', 'data sharing', 'deep learning', 'design', 'experience', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'interoperability', 'learning network', 'learning strategy', 'lung basal segment', 'lung cancer screening', 'mHealth', 'model development', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'repository', 'software repository', 'statistics', 'stem', 'tool']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2019,657823,-0.010148074842803091
"National NLP Clinical Challenges (n2c2): Challenges in Natural Language Processing for Clinical Narratives Project Summary and Abstract Narratives of electronic health records (EHRs) contain useful information that is difficult to automatically extract, index, search, or interpret. Natural language processing (NLP) technologies can extract this information and convert it in to a structured format that is more readily accessible by computerized systems. However, the development of NLP systems is contingent on access to relevant data and EHRs are notoriously difficult to obtain because of privacy reasons. Despite the recent efforts to de-identify and release narrative EHRs for research, these data are still very rare. As a result, clinical NLP, as a field has lagged behind. To address this problem, since 2006, we organized thirteen shared tasks, accompanied with workshops and journal publications. Twelve of these shared tasks have focused on the development of clinical NLP systems and the remaining one on the usability of these systems. We have covered both depth and breadth in terms of shared tasks, preparing tasks that study cutting-edge NLP problems on a variety of EHR data from multiple institutions. Our shared tasks are the longest running series of clinical NLP shared tasks, with ever growing EHR data sets, tasks, and participation. Our most popular three data sets have been cited 495 (2010 data), 284 (2006 de-id data), and 274 (2009 data) times, respectively, representing hundreds of articles that have come out of these three data sets alone. Our goal in this proposal is to continue the efforts we started in 2006 under i2b2 shared task challenges (i2b2, NIH NLM U54LM008748, PI: Kohane and R13 LM011411, PI: Uzuner) to de-identify EHRs, annotate them with gold- standard annotations for clinical NLP tasks, and release them to the research community for the development and head-to-head comparison of clinical NLP systems, for the advancement of the state of the art. Continuing our efforts under National NLP Clinical Challenges (n2c2) based at the Health Data Science program of the newly established Department of Biomedical Informatics at Harvard Medical School, we aim to form partnerships with the community to grow the shared task efforts in several ways: (1) grow the available de-identified EHR data sets through partnerships that can contribute to the volume and variety of the data, and (2) grow the available gold-standard annotations in terms of depth and breadth of NLP tasks. Given these aims and partnerships, we plan to hold a series of shared tasks. We will complement these shared tasks with workshops that meet in conjunction with the Fall Symposium of the American Medical Informatics Association and with journal special issues so that advancement of the state of the art can be sped up and future generations can build on the past. Project Narrative We propose to organize a series of shared tasks, workshops, and journal publications for fostering the continuous development of clinical Natural Language Processing (NLP) technologies that can extract information from narratives of Electronic Health Records (EHRs). Our aim is to grow the annotated gold standard EHR data sets that are available to the research community through partnerships and to bring together clinical NLP researchers with informatics researchers for building collaborations. We will engage the community in shared tasks and disseminate the knowledge generated by these shared tasks through workshops and journal special issues for the advancement of the state of the art.",National NLP Clinical Challenges (n2c2): Challenges in Natural Language Processing for Clinical Narratives,9759499,R13LM013127,"['Access to Information', 'Address', 'American', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Community Developments', 'Complement', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Educational workshop', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Evaluation', 'Fostering', 'Future', 'Future Generations', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Grant', 'Growth', 'Hand', 'Head', 'Healthcare', 'Improve Access', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Institution', 'Israel', 'Journals', 'Knowledge', 'Measures', 'Medical Informatics', 'Medical center', 'Methodology', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Paper', 'Peer Review', 'Performance', 'Privacy', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Running', 'Series', 'Source', 'Structure', 'System', 'Systems Development', 'Targeted Research', 'Technology', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'clinical development', 'computerized', 'falls', 'head-to-head comparison', 'health data', 'indexing', 'medical schools', 'meetings', 'practical application', 'programs', 'symposium', 'usability', 'working group']",NLM,GEORGE MASON UNIVERSITY,R13,2019,20000,-0.010689689769780767
"Text Mining Pipeline to Accelerate Systematic Reviews in Evidence-Based Medicine We hypothesize that a flexible, configurable suite of automated informatics tools can reduce significantly the effort needed to generate systematic reviews while maintaining or even improving their quality. To test this hypothesis, we propose: Aim 1. To extend our research on automated RCT tagging to include additional study types and provide public resources. A) Machine learning models will be created that automatically assign probability estimates to three types of observational studies that are widely examined by systematic reviewers. B) The RCT and other taggers will be evaluated prospectively for newly published PubMed articles. C) All PubMed articles will be automatically tagged for RCT, cohort, case-control and cross-sectional studies and annotated in a public dataset linked to a public query interface. Users will also receive tags for articles from non-PubMed data sources on demand. Aim 2. To evaluate the performance and usability of our tools when used by systematic reviewers under field conditions. A) The tools will be customized and integrated to facilitate field evaluation. B) A three-stage evaluation: 1. Retrospective evaluation of Metta and RCT Tagger performance. 2. Real-time “shadowing”. 3. Prospective controlled study. Aim 3. To identify additional clinical trial articles, appearing after a published systematic review was completed, that are relevant to the review topic. Aim 4. To identify publications related to specific ClinicalTrials.gov registered trials. Aim 5. To develop and evaluate new machine learning methods and tools that will facilitate rapid evidence scoping for new systematic review topics. A) Methods will be developed for ranking articles with respect to their relevance to a proposed new systematic review topic. B) A scoping tool will be created that displays articles ranked by predicted relevance, tagged with study design attributes, sample sizes, and Cochrane risk of bias estimates. The proposed studies will advance the automation of early steps in the process of writing systematic reviews, and thereby enhance evidence-based medicine and the incorporation of best practices into clinical care. Project Narrative Systematic reviews are essential for determining which treatments and interventions are safe and effective.

"Leveraging Twitter to monitor nicotine and tobacco-related cancer communication Patterns in Twitter data have revolutionized understanding of public health events such as influenza outbreaks. While researchers have begun to examine messaging related to substance use on Twitter, this project will strengthen the use of Twitter as an infoveillance tool to more rigorously examine nicotine, tobacco, and cancer- related communication. Twitter is particularly suited to this work because its users are commonly adolescents, young adults, and racial and ethnic minorities, all of whom are at increased risk for nicotine and tobacco product (NTP) use and related health consequences. Additionally, due to the openness of the platform, searches are replicable and transparent, enabling large-scale systematic research. Therefore, our multidisciplinary team of experts in diverse relevant fields—including public health, behavioral science, computational linguistics, computer science, biomedical informatics, and information privacy and security—will build upon our previous research to develop and validate structured algorithms providing automated surveillance of Twitter’s multifaceted and continuously evolving information related to NTPs. First, we will qualitatively assess a stratified random sample of relevant NTP-related tweets for specific coded variables, such as the message’s primary sentiment and other key information of potential value (e.g., whether a message involves buying/selling, policy/law, and cancer-related communication). Tweets will be obtained directly from Twitter using software we developed that leverages a comprehensive list of Twitter-optimized search strings related to NTPs. Second, we will statistically determine what message characteristics (e.g., the presence of certain words, punctuation, and/or structures) are most strongly associated with each of the coded variables for each search string. Using this information, we will create specialized Machine Learning (ML) algorithms based on state-of-the-art methods from Natural Language Processing (NLP) to automatically assess and categorize future Twitter data. Third, we will use this information to provide automatic assessment of current and future streaming data. Time series analyses using seasonal Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Averages (ARIMA) will determine if there are significant changes over time in volume of messaging related to each specific coded variables of interest. Trends will be examined at the daily, weekly, and monthly level, because each of these levels is potentially valuable for intervention. To maximize the translational value of this project, we will partner with public health department stakeholders who are experts in streamlining dissemination of actionable trends data. In summary, this project will substantially advance our understanding of representations of NTPs on social media—as well as our ability to conduct automated surveillance and analysis of this content. This project will result in important and concrete deliverables, including open-source algorithms for future researchers and processes to quickly disseminate actionable data for tailoring community- level interventions. For this project, we gathered a team of public health researchers and computer scientists to leverage the power of Twitter as a novel surveillance tool to better understand communication about nicotine and tobacco products (NTPs) and related messages about cancer and cancer prevention. We will gather a random sample of Twitter messages (“tweets”) related to NTPs and examine them in depth and use this information to create specialized computer algorithms that can automatically categorize future Twitter data. Then, we will examine changes over time related to attitudes towards and interest in NTPs, as well as cancer-related discussion around various NTPs, which will dramatically improve our ability to better understand Twitter as a tool for this type of surveillance.",Leveraging Twitter to monitor nicotine and tobacco-related cancer communication,9656981,R01CA225773,"['Adolescent', 'Affect', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Algorithms', 'Attitude', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Cancer Control', 'Categories', 'Characteristics', 'Cigarette', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational Linguistics', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'County', 'Data', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Electronic cigarette', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Event', 'Food', 'Football game', 'Future', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Individual', 'Influenza A Virus, H1N1 Subtype', 'Intervention', 'Laws', 'Linguistics', 'Literature', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Marketing', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Names', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nicotine', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Policies', 'Privacy', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Public Opinion', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Retrieval', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Security', 'Specificity', 'Stream', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Time Series Analysis', 'Tobacco', 'Tobacco use', 'Tobacco-Related Carcinoma', 'Twitter', 'Work', 'automated analysis', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'cancer prevention', 'computer program', 'computer science', 'computerized tools', 'ethnic minority population', 'geographic difference', 'hookah', 'improved', 'influenza outbreak', 'interest', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'nicotine use', 'novel', 'open source', 'phrases', 'prospective', 'racial minority', 'social', 'social media', 'software development', 'statistics', 'time use', 'tobacco products', 'tool', 'trend', 'vaping', 'young adult']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2019,431185,-0.005555288505847998
"HERCULES: Exposome Research Center PROJECT SUMMARY: HERCULES The vision of the HERCULES P30 is to demonstrably advance the role of environmental health sciences in clinical and public health settings using the platform of the exposome. Healthcare and biomedical research have become increasingly genome-centric. While much of this is due to the impressive achievements in genomics, which have consistently outpaced gains in environmental health, it is our contention that a more persuasive case needs to be made for environmental factors. Science and intuition support the idea that the environment plays just as large of a role as genetics for the majority of diseases. The exposome, which embraces a strategy and scale similar to genomic research, is poised to elevate the environment in discussions of health and disease. We will continue to grow and enhance the environmental health science research portfolio at Emory through cutting-edge technologies and innovative data solutions. We will build upon the superb relationships we have built with the local community and continue to push the mission of NIEHS on campus and across the scientific landscape. Based on the extraordinary progress over our first three years, we propose to retain our theme to use exposome-related concepts and approaches to improve human health. This simple and unifying vision will continue to stimulate discovery, promote collaboration, and enhance communication through the following Specific Aims: Specific Aim 1. To marshal physical and intellectual resources to support exposome-related approaches (high-resolution metabolomics, analytical chemistry, systems biology, machine learning, bioinformatics, high-throughput toxicology, and spatial and temporal statistical models) through cores, pilot funding, mentoring, and research forums. Specific Aim 2. To make major contributions towards exposome and environmental health science research. Specific Aim 3. To provide career development activities around innovative and emerging concepts and approaches related to the exposome. Specific Aim 4.

"HERCULES: Exposome Research Center PROJECT SUMMARY: HERCULES The vision of the HERCULES P30 is to demonstrably advance the role of environmental health sciences in clinical and public health settings using the platform of the exposome. Healthcare and biomedical research have become increasingly genome-centric. While much of this is due to the impressive achievements in genomics, which have consistently outpaced gains in environmental health, it is our contention that a more persuasive case needs to be made for environmental factors. Science and intuition support the idea that the environment plays just as large of a role as genetics for the majority of diseases. The exposome, which embraces a strategy and scale similar to genomic research, is poised to elevate the environment in discussions of health and disease. We will continue to grow and enhance the environmental health science research portfolio at Emory through cutting-edge technologies and innovative data solutions. We will build upon the superb relationships we have built with the local community and continue to push the mission of NIEHS on campus and across the scientific landscape. Based on the extraordinary progress over our first three years, we propose to retain our theme to use exposome-related concepts and approaches to improve human health. This simple and unifying vision will continue to stimulate discovery, promote collaboration, and enhance communication through the following Specific Aims: Specific Aim 1. To marshal physical and intellectual resources to support exposome-related approaches (high-resolution metabolomics, analytical chemistry, systems biology, machine learning, bioinformatics, high-throughput toxicology, and spatial and temporal statistical models) through cores, pilot funding, mentoring, and research forums. Specific Aim 2. To make major contributions towards exposome and environmental health science research. Specific Aim 3. To provide career development activities around innovative and emerging concepts and approaches related to the exposome. Specific Aim 4. To enhance and expand existing relationships with community partners to resolve environmental health issues in the community using exposome principles. Specific Aim 5. To provide infrastructure and resources to facilitate rapid translation of novel scientific findings into the development of prevention and treatment strategies in humans.

"Big Data, Big Models, and Big Bias?: A decision making framework for vital rate estimates based on extrapolation Project Summary/Abstract The past decades have seen a flurry of methods that use extrapolation, smoothing, and other forms of information sharing to compensate for limited and incomplete data. In places without comprehensive vital registration or public health monitoring systems, extrapolation and information sharing techniques are particularly appealing, since there typically is simply not enough data available to produce estimates with sufficient temporal or spatial resolution to influence public health decision making. This proposal reframes uncertainty in extrapolated estimates of vital rates in terms of decision-making. A decision-making framework (i) is grounded in familiar language for policymakers and public health officials, (ii)characterizes consequential and inconsequential model decisions based on variability in outcomes, and (iii) in- corporates both extrapolation and sampling uncertainty. A cornerstone of this project is a novel collaboration with researchers and policymakers at the World Bank. Through this collaboration, we will pilot the proposed decision-making tools and conduct experiments with local and national policymakers in realistic settings. Project Narrative Predictions based on machine learning models are increasingly common inputs into decision making processes across scientific domains. In this proposal I develop and evaluate strategies for making public health decisions based on predicted vital rates, particularly in places without full coverage civil registration. Results from the project will improve strategies for allocating resources for disease surveillance and health monitoring in scarce resource settings.","Big Data, Big Models, and Big Bias?: A decision making framework for vital rate estimates based on extrapolation",9780910,DP2MH122405,"['Big Data', 'Collaborations', 'Consequentialism', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Disease Surveillance', 'Health', 'Language', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Outcome', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Uncertainty', 'World Bank', 'base', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'novel', 'tool']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,DP2,2019,2332500,-0.011659020728361847
"Mozak: Creating an Expert Community to accelerate neuronal reconstruction at scale Project Summary This project aims to leverage the best of both computational and human expertise in neuronal reconstruction towards the goal of accelerating global neuroscience discovery from internationally-sourced imaging data. We propose to create a cloud-based unified platform for converging 3-dimensional images of neurons onto a single analysis platform to (1) train and grow a new expert community of global reconstructors to work across the data from these groups, to (2) generate a community-sourced neuronal reconstruction database of open imaging data that can be incorporated into a 3-dimensional map of neuronal interconnectivity - onto which (3) novel annotations and more complex functional and molecular data can be overlaid. Our approach will evolve with the growing needs of the neuroscience community over time. To do this, in Aim One (Neuronal Reconstruction at Scale), we will test if the newly developed crowd-sourced game-based platform Mozak can develop a collective of new human experts at scale, capable of accelerating the rate of current reconstruction by at least an order of magnitude, at the same time as increasing the robustness, quality and unbiasedness of the final reconstructions. In Aim Two (Robust Multi-Purpose Annotation), we will enhance basic neuronal reconstruction by adding specific semantic annotation— including soma volume and morphological quantification, volumetric analysis, and ongoing features (e.g. dendritic spines, axonal varicosities) requested from the neuroscience community. Experienced and high-ranking members will be given the opportunity to advance through increasingly complex neurons into full arbor brain-wide neuronal projections and multiple clustered groups of neurons in localized circuits. Finally, in Aim 3 (Creation of a Research-Adaptive Data Repository), we aim to develop a database of neuronal images reconstructed using the Mozak interface that will directly serve the general and specific needs of different research groups. Our goal is to make this database dynamically adaptive — as new research questions will invariably bring new needs for additional annotations and cross-referencing with other data modalities. This highquality unbiased processing repository will also be perfectly suited for training sets for automated algorithms, and the generation of a 3-dimensional maps such as Allen Institute for Brain Science (AIBS) common coordinate framework. We expect that the computational reconstruction methods will further improve with the new large corpus of “gold standard” reconstructions. Collectively, the completion of these three aims will create an analysis suite as well as an online community of experts capable of performing in depth analysis of large-scale datasets that will significantly accelerate neuroscience research, enhance machine learning for reconstruction analysis, and create a common platform of baseline neuronal morphology data against which aberrantly functioning neurons can be analyzed. Project Narrative  This project will create a new central nexus point for neuronal reconstruction and semantic annotation (Mozak) that can be used by all research labs via an accessible online portal. We will develop a new cadre of neuronal reconstruction experts that will— in conjunction with automated tools that are enhanced by their work — drastically increase the volume, quality and robustness of neuron reconstructions and annotations. Mozak reconstructions will be shared with existing repositories and will be continually updated and re-annotated based on emerging needs of research - ensuring perpetual relevance, and allowing us to generate a platform to establish the range of “baseline” 3-dimensional readouts of neuronal morphology against which diseased or malfunctioning neurons can be analyzed and understood. 1",Mozak: Creating an Expert Community to accelerate neuronal reconstruction at scale,9775212,R01MH116247,"['3-Dimensional', 'Adopted', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Axon', 'Brain', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Dendritic Spines', 'Disease', 'Ensure', 'Future', 'Gap Junctions', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Guidelines', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging technology', 'Infrastructure', 'Institutes', 'International', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Molecular', 'Morphology', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Process', 'Research', 'Science', 'Semantics', 'Slice', 'Source', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Three-dimensional analysis', 'Time', 'Training', 'Update', 'Variant', 'Varicosity', 'Work', 'base', 'citizen science', 'cloud based', 'crowdsourcing', 'data warehouse', 'experience', 'improved', 'member', 'neuronal cell body', 'novel', 'online community', 'petabyte', 'programs', 'reconstruction', 'repository', 'tool', 'two-dimensional']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2019,628430,-0.012737093354871928
"Extended Methods and Software Development for Health NLP PROJECT SUMMARY There is a deluge of health-related texts in many genres, from the clinical narrative to newswire and social media. These texts are diverse in content, format, and style, and yet they represent complementary facets of biomedical and health knowledge. Natural Language Processing (NLP) holds much promise to extract, understand, and distill valuable information from these overwhelming large and complex streams of data, with the ultimate goal to advance biomedicine and impact the health and wellbeing of patients. There have been a number of success stories in various biomedical NLP applications, but the NLP methods investigated are usually tailored to one specific phenotype and one institution, thus reducing portability and scalability. Moreover, while there has been much work in the processing of clinical texts, other genres of health texts, like narratives and posts authored by health consumers and patients, are lacking solutions to marshal and make sense of the health information they contain. Robust NLP solutions that answer the needs of biomedicine and health in general have not been fully investigated yet. A unified, data-science approach to health NLP enables the exploration of methods and solutions unprecedented up to now.  Our vision is to unravel the information buried in the health narratives by advancing text-processing methods in a unified way across all the genres of texts. The crosscutting theme is the investigation of methods for health NLP (hNLP) made possible by big data, fused with health knowledge. Our proposal moves the field into exploring semi-supervised and fully unsupervised methods, which only succeed when very large amounts of data are leveraged and knowledge is injected into the methods with care. Our hNLP proposal also targets a key challenge of current hNLP research: the lack of shared software. We seek to provide a clearinghouse for software created under this proposal, and as such all developed tools will be disseminated. Starting from the data characteristics of health texts and information needs of stakeholders, we will develop and evaluate methods for information extraction, information understanding. We will translate our research into the publicly available NLP software platform cTAKES, through robust modules for extraction and understanding across all genres of health texts. We will also demonstrate impact of our methods and tools through several use cases, ranging from clinical point of care to public health, to translational and precision medicine, to participatory medicine. Finally, we will disseminate our work through community activities, such as challenges to advance the state of the art in health natural language processing. PROJECT NARRATIVE  There is a deluge of health texts. Natural Language Processing (NLP) holds much promise to unravel valuable information from these large data streams with the goal to advance medicine and the wellbeing of patients.

"Exploring the evolving relationship between tobacco, marijuana and e-cigarettes Abstract The relationship between marijuana, tobacco, and e-cigarettes is both rapidly changing and poorly understood, particularly in the light of recent federal and state-level regulatory changes governing the availability of e- cigarettes and marijuana products (respectively). In order to understand this changing landscape we need new, ﬂexible, and responsive research methods capable of rapidly providing insights into product initiation patterns, use patterns, and cessation strategies. Social media — here deﬁned as including internet discussion forums — provides a ready-made source of abundant, naturalistic, longitudinal, publicly accessible, ﬁrst-person narratives with which to understand health behaviours and attitudes. We propose to use a combination of qualitative methods and automated natural language processing techniques to investigate online discussion forums devoted to tobacco, marijuana, and e-cigarettes in order to understand user trajectories through the three product categories.

"Sci-Score, a tool suite to support Rigor and Transparency NIH and Journal Guidelines Project​ ​Summary While standards in reporting of scientific methods are absolutely critical to producing reproducible science, meeting such standards is tedious and difficult. Checklists and instructions are tough to follow often resulting in low and inconsistent compliance. Scientific journals and societies as well as the National Institutes of Health are now actively proposing general guidelines to address reproducibility issues, particularly in the reporting of methods,​ ​but​ ​the​ ​trickier​ ​part​ ​is​ ​to​ ​train​ ​the​ ​biomedical​ ​community​ ​to​ ​use​ ​these​ ​standards​ ​to​ ​effectively. To support new standards in methods reporting, especially the RRID standard for Rigor and Transparency of Key Biological Resources, we propose to build Sci-Score a text mining based tool suite to help authors meet the standard. Sci-Score will provide an automated check on compliance with the RRID standard already implemented by over 100 journals including Cell, Journal of Neuroscience, and eLife and other Rigor and transparency standards put forward by the NIH. The innovation behind Sci-score is the provision of a score, which can be obtained by individual investigators or journals. This score reflects an aspect of quality of methods reporting. We posit that the score will serve as a tool that investigators can use to compete with themselves​ ​and​ ​each​ ​other,​ ​the​ ​way​ ​they​ ​currently​ ​compete​ ​on​ ​metrics​ ​of​ ​popularity,​ ​i.e.,​ ​the​ ​H-index. In Phase I of this project and before, our group has successfully developed a text mining algorithm that can detect antibodies, cell lines, organisms and digital resources (all 4 RRID types) and has created a preliminary score. We propose to extend this approach to all research inputs, like chemicals and plasmids that are requested as part of Cell press’ STAR Methods (http://www.cell.com/star-methods)​. We also propose to build a set of algorithms to detect whether authors discuss the major sources of irreproducibility outlined by NIH, including investigator blinding, proper randomization and sufficient reporting of sex and other biological variables. Resource identification along with other quality metrics will be used to score the quality of scientific methods section text. If successful, the tool could be used by editors, reviewers, and investigators to improve the​ ​quality​ ​of​ ​the​ ​scientific​ ​paper. Our Phase II specific aims include 1) enhancing and hardening the core natural language processing pipelines to recognize a broader range of sentences in near real time; 2) building a set of modular tools that will be provided for different groups of users to take advantage of the text mining capability we develop in aim 1. At the end of Phase II, we should have a commercially viable product that will be able to be licensed to serve the needs​ ​of​ ​the​ ​publishers​ ​and​ ​the​ ​broader​ ​research​ ​community.

"Development of an Open-Source and Data-Driven Modeling Platform to Monitor and Forecast Disease Activity PROJECT SUMMARY Reliable and real-time municipality-level predictive modeling and forecasts of infectious disease activity have the potential to transform the way public health decision-makers design interventions such as information campaigns, preemptive/reactive vaccinations, and vector control, in the presence of health threats across the world. While the links between disease activity and factors such as: human mobility, climate and environmental factors, socio-economic determinants, and social media activity have long been known in the epidemic literature, few efforts have focused on the evident need of developing an open-source platform capable of leveraging multiple data sources, factors, and disparate modeling methodologies, across a large and heterogeneous nation to monitor and forecast disease transmission, over four geographic scales (nation, state, city, and municipal). The overall goal of this project is to develop such a platform. Our long-term goal is to investigate effective ways to incorporate the findings from multiple disparate studies on disease dynamics around the globe with local and global factors such as weather conditions, socio- economic status, satellite imagery and online human behavior, to develop an operational, robust, and real- time data-driven disease forecasting platform. The objective of this grant is to leverage the expertise of three complementary scientific research teams and a wealth of information from a diverse array of data sources to build a modeling platform capable of combining information to produce real-time short term disease forecasts at the local level. As part of this, we will evaluate the predictive power of disparate data streams and modeling approaches to monitor and forecast disease at multiple geographic scales--nation, state, city, and municipality--using Brazil as a test case. Additionally, we will use machine learning and mechanistic models to understand disease dynamics at multiple spatial scales, across a heterogeneous country such as Brazil. Our specific aims will (1) Assess the utility of individual data streams and modeling techniques for disease forecasting; (2) Fuse modeling techniques and data streams to improve accuracy and robustness at the four spatial scales; (3) Characterize the basic computational infrastructure necessary to build an operational disease forecasting platform; and (4) Validate our approach in a real-world setting. This contribution is significant because It will advance our scientific knowledge on the accuracy and limitations of disparate data streams and multiple modeling approaches when used to forecast disease transmission. Our efforts will help produce operational and systematic disease forecasts at a local level (city- and municipality-level). Moreover, we aim at building a new open-source computational platform for the epidemiological community to use as a knowledge discovery tool. Finally, we aim at developing this platform under the guidance of a Subject Matter Expert (SME) panel comprising of WHO, CDC, academics, and local and federal stakeholders within Brazil. The proposed approach is innovative because few efforts have focused on developing an open-source computational platform capable of combining disparate data sources and drivers, across a heterogeneous and large nation, into multiple modeling approaches to monitor and forecast disease transmission, over multiple geographic scales.. In addition, we propose to investigate how to best combine modeling approaches that have, to this date, been developed and interpreted independently, namely, traditional epidemiological mechanistic models and novel machine-learning predictive models, in order to produce accurate and robust real-time disease activity estimates and forecasts. Project Narrative The proposed research is of crucial importance to public health surveillance and preparedness communities because it seeks to identify effective ways to utilize previously disconnected results, that have pointed out links between disease spread and factors such as socio-economic status, local weather conditions, human mobility, social media activity, to build an open-source and data driven, modeling platform capable of extracting and disseminating information from disparate data sources, and complementary modeling approaches, to (1) Evaluate the predictive power of disparate data streams and modeling approaches to monitor and forecast disease at multiple geographic scales: nation, state, city, and municipality; (2) Fuse complementary modeling approaches that have been developed independently and oftentimes not used in conjunction; (3) produce real- time and short term forecasts of disease activity in multiple geographic scales across a heterogeneous and large nation like Brazil.",Development of an Open-Source and Data-Driven Modeling Platform to Monitor and Forecast Disease Activity,9789907,R01GM130668,"['Area', 'Assimilations', 'Beds', 'Behavior', 'Brazil', 'Burn injury', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Cities', 'Climate', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Dengue', 'Developing Countries', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Economics', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemic', 'Epidemiology', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'High Performance Computing', 'Human', 'Imagery', 'Individual', 'Influenza', 'Influenza B Virus', 'Infrastructure', 'Institution', 'Internet', 'Knowledge', 'Knowledge Discovery', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Municipalities', 'Population Surveillance', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Readiness', 'Research', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Stream', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Twitter', 'Vaccination', 'Vector-transmitted infectious disease', 'Water', 'Weather', 'Work', 'Zika Virus', 'base', 'chikungunya', 'climate variability', 'computational platform', 'computer infrastructure', 'digital', 'disease transmission', 'economic determinant', 'experience', 'flu', 'genomic data', 'improved', 'innovation', 'mathematical methods', 'novel', 'open data', 'open source', 'pathogen', 'pathogen genomics', 'predictive modeling', 'social', 'social media', 'sociodemographics', 'socioeconomics', 'spreading factor', 'therapy design', 'time use', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'trend', 'vector control', 'vector-borne']",NIGMS,BOSTON CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2019,366616,-0.0410086710836733
"Boston University CCCR OVERALL ABSTRACT The Boston University CCCR will serve as a central resource for clinical research focused mostly on the most common musculoskeletal disorders, osteoarthritis and gout and will also provide research resources for investigator based research in scleroderma, spondyloarthritis, musculoskeletal pain and osteoporosis. Center grant funding has supported 30-35 papers annually in peer reviewed journals, most in the leading arthritis journals and some in leading general medical journals. This center has trained many of the leading clinical researchers in rheumatology throughout the US and internationally, and many of these former trainees have active collaborations with the center. We will include a broad research community and a core group of faculty in this CCCR. The research community's ready access to core faculty and to the sophisticated research methods and assistance they provide will enhance the clinical and translational research of the community and will increase collaborative opportunities for the core faculty and the community. The CCCR updates BU's historical focus on epidemiologic methods to include new approaches to causal inference and adds new methods in machine learning and mobile health. The Research and Evaluation Support Core Unit (RESCU) is the focal point of this CCCR. A key feature is the weekly research (RESCU meetings in which ongoing and proposed research projects are critically evaluated. This feature ensures frequent interactions between clinician researchers, epidemiologists and biostatisticians who are the core members of the CCCR. The RESCU core unit has provided critical support for other Center grants related to rheumatic and arthritic disorders at Boston University, three current R01/U01's; five current NIH K awards (one K24, 3 K23's, one K01), an R03, an NIH trial planning grant (U34), and multiple ACR RRF awards. The overall goal of this center is to carry out and disseminate high-level clinical research informed both by state of the art clinical research methods and by clinical and biological scientific discoveries. Ultimately, we aim either to prevent the diseases we are studying or to improve the lives of those living with the diseases. NARRATIVE The Boston University Core Center for Clinical Research will provide broad clinical research methods expertise to a large multidisciplinary group of investigators whose research focuses on osteoarthritis and gout with a secondary emphasis on scleroderma, spondyloarthritis, osteoporosis and musculoskeletal pain. The group, which includes persons with backgrounds in rheumatology, physical therapy, epidemiology, biostatistics and  . behavioral science, meets weekly to critically review research projects and serves a broad research community with which it actively engages.

To optimize the safe use of DS, there remains a critical and unmet need for informatics methods to detect DSIs. Our rationale is that an innovative informatics framework to discover potential DSIs from the large scale of biomedical literature will enable a new line of research for targeted DSI validation and will also significantly narrow the range of DSIs that must be further explored.

"Biomedical Data Translator Technical Feasibility Assessment and Architecture Design New technologies afford the acquisition of dense “data clouds” of individual humans. However, heterogeneity, dimensionality and multi-scale nature of such data (genomes, transcriptomes, clinical variables, etc.) pose a new challenge: How can one query such dense data clouds of mixed data as an integrated set (as opposed to variable by variable) against multiple knowledge bases, and translate the joint molecular information into the clinical realm? Current lexical mapping and brute-force data mining seek to make heterogeneous data interoperable and accessible but their output is fragmented and requires expertise to assemble into coherent actionable information. We propose DeepTranslate, an innovative approach that incorporates the known actual physical organization of biological entities that are the substrate of pathogenesis into (i) networks (data graphs) and (ii) hierarchies of concepts that span the multiscale space from molecule to clinic. Organizing data sources along such natural structures will allow translation of burgeoning high-dimensional data sets into concepts familiar to clinicians, while capturing mechanistic relationships. DeepTranslate will take a hybrid approach to learn and organize its content from both (i) existing generic comprehensive knowledge sources (GO, KEGG, IDC, etc.) and (ii) newly measured instances of individual data clouds from two demonstration projects: (1) ISB’s Pioneer 100 and (2) St. Jude Lifetime cancer survivors. We will focus on diabetes as test case. These two studies cover a deep biological scale-space and thus can test the full extent of the multiscale capacity of DeepTranslate in a focused application. 1. TYPES OF RESEARCH QUESTION ENABLED. How can a clinician find out that the dozens of “out of range” variables observed in a patient’s data cloud, form a connected set with respect to pathophysiology pathways, from gene to clinical variable? How can the high-dimensional data of studies that measure for each individual 100+ data points of various types (“personal data clouds”) be analyzed as one set in an integrated fashion (as opposed to variable by variable) against existing knowledge bases and also be used to improve the databases? DeepTranslate addresses these two types of questions and thereby will accelerate translation of future personal data clouds into (A) care decisions and (B) hypotheses on new disease mechanisms / treatments, thereby benefiting providers as well as researchers. 2. USE OF EXPERTISE AND RESOURCES. • ISB: pioneer in personalized, big-data driven medicine (Demo Project 1); biomedical content expertise; multiscale omics and molecular pathogenesis, big data analysis, housing of databases for public access; query engine designs, GUI. • UCSD: leader in biomedical data integration; automated assembly of molecular and clinical data into hierarchical structures; translation between data types • U Montreal: biomedical database curation from literature and construction of gene/protein/drug interaction networks; machine learning, open resource database • St Jude CRH: Cancer monitoring Demo Project 2, cancer patient data analytics. 3. POTENTIAL DATA AND INFRASTRUCTURE CHALLENGES. (a) Existing comprehensive clinical data sources are not uniform and not explicitly based on biological networks; cross-mapping is being performed at NLM based on lexical relationships: HPO (phenotypes) vs. SNOMED CT (for EMR) vs. IDC or Merck Manual (for diseases). Careful selection of these sources in close collaboration with NLM is needed. (b) Existing molecular pathway databases are static, based on averages of heterogeneous non-stratified populations, while the newly measured high-dimensional data clouds are varied due to intra-individual temporal fluctuation and inter-individual variation. How this will affect building of ontotypes in our hybrid approach, and how large cohorts of data clouds must be to offer statistical power is yet to be determined. Our two Demonstration Projects with their uniquely deep (high-dimensional and multiscale) data in cohorts of limited but growing size are thus crucial first steps in a long journey of collective learning in the TRANSLATOR community. n/a",Biomedical Data Translator Technical Feasibility Assessment and Architecture Design,9853317,OT3TR002026,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Architecture', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'CRH gene', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cancer Survivor', 'Caring', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Drug Interactions', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Gene Proteins', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Graph', 'Heterogeneity', 'Housing', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Nature', 'Output', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Provider', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'SNOMED Clinical Terms', 'Saint Jude Children&apos', 's Research Hospital', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'base', 'cohort', 'data integration', 'data mining', 'design', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'inter-individual variation', 'interoperability', 'knowledge base', 'lexical', 'molecular assembly/self assembly', 'multidimensional data', 'new technology', 'transcriptome']",NCATS,INSTITUTE FOR SYSTEMS BIOLOGY,OT3,2019,855741,-0.03610528298404013
"Acquisition of a next-generation computing cluster We request funds to purchase our next-generation computing cluster to support computationally intensive NIH-funded research at Washington University in St. Louis. This system will become the foundation of the Center for High Performance Computing (CHPC) to support our active, diverse user community. It has been designed to meet our current and future computing needs. It adds additional capabilities to support emerging fields such as “Deep Learning”. The CHPC currently supports over 775 users from 300 different groups across 33 departments. 58 papers have cited the CHPC. The Center has a proven funding model and is economically sustainable. The Center has partnered with other University organizations to offer training workshops, not only on the use of the cluster, but also on introductory programming for users with no prior programming experience. If this proposal is funded, we will be able to continue to support this ever-growing diverse community of researchers. The proposed system would replace critical components including the management node, the login nodes, the storage, and upgrade the Infiniband networking. We would add substantial upgrades to our computing power with state-of-the-art processors, increased memory capacity for growing jobs, General Purpose Graphical Processing units (GPGPUs), and new capabilities for “Deep Learning”.

"Academy of Aphasia Research and Training Symposium PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The annual Academy of Aphasia meeting is the premier conference for researchers in the field of language processing and aphasia. Since the first meeting in 1963, this international meeting has brought together an interdisciplinary group of linguists, psychologists, neurologists, and speech-language pathologists to discuss the latest research in the field of aphasia, including theoretical, clinical, and rehabilitation aspects of this language disorder. The topics at the conference range widely but almost always cover all aspects of language processing including phonological processing, lexical-semantic processing, syntactic processing, orthographic processing, bilingualism, computational modeling, non-invasive and invasive brain imaging, language recovery, neuroplasticity, and rehabilitation. In this proposal, we aim to include two special initiatives that will take place during the annual academy of aphasia conference. The first initiative involves a formal mentoring program for young investigators entering the field of aphasia research. In this program, selected student/post-doctoral fellows from interdisciplinary backgrounds who are first authors at the conference are paired with a mentor. This mentor will provide specific feedback about the fellow's presentation and general mentorship to the fellow about research and academic careers. This program is currently occurring as part of the conference and has been growing at the annual meeting with very positive feedback. Additionally, a formal mentoring meeting will allow a structured format for discussion about a career in aphasia research. The second initiative will be a three hour seminar (New Frontiers in Aphasia Research) that covers the background and approach of a state of the art methodology (e.g., fNIRS, graph theoretical metric, machine learning approaches) that has an application to the study of aphasia. These workshops will be recorded and, consequently, uploaded to the academy website/youtube channel for dissemination to aphasia researchers and the public. This workshop will allow conference attendees to understand the conceptual and methodological aspect of a particular scientific approach that can be implemented in their study of aphasia. Given the highly interdisciplinary nature of aphasia research, these workshops will bridge the communication between aphasia researchers and scientists and experts who have developed new approaches to study the brain. This meeting already allows a valuable opportunity for cross-pollination of research ideas and will now provide a platform for the training the next generation of scientists interested in pursuing the nature of aphasia and associated language disorders in adults. PROJECT NARRATIVE Approximately 100,000 individuals suffer from aphasia each year. The academy of aphasia is an organization of clinicians, scientists and practitioners who study this communication disorder and develop interventions to treat individuals with aphasia. The members comprise a very interdisciplinary group of linguists, psychologists, speech and language clinicians, neurologists and neuroscientists. The annual academy of aphasia meeting is the premier venue to share state of the art methodologies for application in the study of aphasia to improve the research in the development of diagnosis and treatment approaches to alleviate aphasia. This conference is also the ideal venue to educate and train the next generation of aphasia researchers who are well trained from a theoretical, technical and clinical standpoint and are committed to expand the impact of research in aphasia.",Academy of Aphasia Research and Training Symposium,9731439,R13DC017375,"['Academy', 'Adult', 'Aphasia', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Chicago', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Committee Membership', 'Communication', 'Communication impairment', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Discipline', 'Educational workshop', 'Feedback', 'Fellowship', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Governing Board', 'Grant', 'Graph', 'Hour', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Language', 'Language Disorders', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Linguistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuscripts', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders', 'Nature', 'Neurologic', 'Neurologist', 'Neuronal Plasticity', 'Neurosciences', 'Non-aphasic', 'Orthography', 'Outcome', 'Pathologist', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Production', 'Psychologist', 'Psychology', 'Publishing', 'Reading', 'Recovery', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Support', 'Research Training', 'Rest', 'Retrieval', 'Scientist', 'Secure', 'Speech', 'Speech Pathologist', 'Speech Perception', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'Students', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training and Education', 'Transcranial magnetic stimulation', 'Travel', 'Videotape', 'Work', 'Writing', 'base', 'bilingualism', 'career', 'career networking', 'experience', 'frontier', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'interest', 'language processing', 'lexical', 'meetings', 'member', 'neuroimaging', 'next generation', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'outcome forecast', 'phonology', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'semantic processing', 'success', 'symposium', 'syntax', 'tenure track', 'web site']",NIDCD,BOSTON UNIVERSITY (CHARLES RIVER CAMPUS),R13,2019,39939,-0.03879690426050741
"Neuroscience Gateway to Enable Dissemination of Computational And Data Processing Tools And Software. Abstract (Proposal title: Neuroscience Gateway to Enable Dissemination of Computational and Data Processing Tools and Software.): This proposal presents a focused plan for expanding the capabilities of the Neuroscience Gateway (NSG) to meet the evolving needs of neuroscientists engaged in computationally intensive research. The NSG project began in 2012 with support from the NSF. Its initial goal was to catalyze progress in computational neuroscience by reducing technical and administrative barriers that neuroscientists faced in large scale modeling projects involving tools and software which require and run efficiently on high performance computing (HPC) resources. NSG's success is reflected in the facts that (1) its base of registered users has grown continually since it started operation in early 2013 (more than 800 at present), (2) every year the NSG team successfully acquires ever larger allocations of supercomputer time (recently more than 10,000,000 core hours/year) on academic HPC resources of the Extreme Science and Engineering Discovery (XSEDE – that coordinates NSF supercomputer centers) program by writing proposals that go through an extremely competitive peer review process, and (3) it has contributed to large number of publications and Ph.D thesis. In recent years experimentalists, cognitive neuroscientists and others have begun using NSG for brain image data processing, data analysis and machine learning. NSG now provides over 20 tools on HPC resources for modeling, simulation and data processing. While NSG is currently well used by the neuroscience community, there is increasing interest from that community in applying it to a wider range of tasks than originally conceived. For example, some are trying to use it as an environment for dissemination of lab-developed tools, even though NSG is not suitable for that use because of delays from the batch queue wait times of production HPC resources, and lack of features and resources for an interactive, graphical, and collaborative environment needed for tool development, benchmarking and testing. “Forced” use of NSG for development and dissemination makes NSG's operators a “person-in-the-middle” bottleneck in the process. Another issue is that newly developed data processing tools require high throughput computing (HTC) usage mode, as opposed to HPC, but currently NSG does not provide access to compute resources suitable for HTC. Additionally, data processing workflows require features such as the ability to transfer large size data, process shared data, and visualize output results, which are not currently available on NSG. The work we propose will enhance NSG by adding the features that it needs to be a suitable and efficient dissemination environment for lab-developed neuroscience tools to the broader neuroscience community. This will allow tool developers to disseminate their lab-developed tools on NSG taking advantage of the current functionalities that are being well served on NSG for the last six years such as a growing user base, an easy user interface, an open environment, the ability to access and run jobs on powerful compute resources, availability of free supercomputer time, a well-established training and outreach program, and a functioning user support system. All of these well-functioning features of NSG will make it an ideal environment for dissemination and use of lab-developed computational and data processing neuroscience tools. The Neuroscience Gateway (NSG) was first implemented to enable large scale computational modeling of brain cells and circuits used to study neural function in health and disease. This new project extends NSG's utility to support development, dissemination and use of new tools by the neuroscience community for analyzing enormous data sets produced by advanced experimental methods in neuroscience.",Neuroscience Gateway to Enable Dissemination of Computational And Data Processing Tools And Software.,9882822,U24EB029005,"['Behavioral', 'Benchmarking', 'Brain imaging', 'Cells', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Correlations', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Education', 'Education and Outreach', 'Educational workshop', 'Electroencephalography', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Foundations', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'High Performance Computing', 'Hour', 'Human Resources', 'Image', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurophysiology - biologic function', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Occupations', 'Output', 'Peer Review', 'Persons', 'Process', 'Production', 'Psychologist', 'Publications', 'Reaction Time', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Running', 'Science', 'Software Tools', 'Students', 'Support System', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Wait Time', 'Work', 'Workload', 'Writing', 'base', 'bioimaging', 'brain cell', 'collaborative environment', 'computational neuroscience', 'computerized data processing', 'computing resources', 'data sharing', 'image processing', 'interest', 'models and simulation', 'open data', 'operation', 'outreach program', 'programs', 'response', 'success', 'supercomputer', 'tool', 'tool development', 'trend', 'webinar']",NIBIB,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",U24,2019,390806,-0.006902014261094426
"New Jersey Alliance for Clinical Translational Science: NJ ACTS Coordinated by Rutgers Biomedical and Health Sciences (RBHS), the New Jersey Alliance for Clinical and Translational Science (NJ ACTS) comprises a consortium with Rutgers and Princeton Universities (PU), NJ Institute for Technology (NJIT), medical, nursing, dental and public health schools, hospitals, community health centers, outpatient practices, industry, policymakers and health information exchanges. All Alliance universities and affiliates have provided substantial resources and contributed to the planning, development and leadership of the consortium. With access to ~7 million people, NJ ACTS serves as a ‘natural laboratory’ for translational and clinical research. With a state population of ~9 million, New Jersey ranks 11th in the US, 1st in population density and higher than average in racial and ethnic diversity. Surprisingly, NJ has no CTSA Hub to coordinate translational and clinical research. Our CTSA Hub focuses on two overarching themes: the heterogeneity of disease pathogenesis and response to treatment, and the value of linking large clinical databases with interventional clinical investigations to identify cause-and-effect and predict therapeutic responses. NJ ACTS will provide: innovative approaches to link information from large databases and electronic health records to inform clinical trial design, execution and analysis; and novel platforms for biomarker discovery using fluorescence in situ hybridization and machine learning to identify unique neural signatures of chronic illness. NJ ACTS will access a large health system with significant member diversity; a rich legacy of community engagement and community-based research platforms; and proven approaches to enhance workforce development in clinical research. With a substantial investment in streamlining research administration and IRB practices at Rutgers and with the inception of NJ ACTS, there exists an unparalleled opportunity for logarithmic growth in clinical research in New Jersey. To build our capacity for participant and clinical interactions as a CTSA Hub, the newly established Trial Accelerator and Recruitment Office will coordinate feasibility assessment, implementation, recruitment, and evaluation of clinical studies. Additionally, our organization of five clinical research units into a cohesive network provides extraordinary expertise in strategic locations to enhance participant recruitment from diverse communities with a particular focus on: children; the elderly; those with serious mental illness or substance abuse issues; low-income individuals served by Medicaid; those with HIV/AIDS; and people of all ages who are minorities, underserved, and victims of health and environmental disparities. With a history of collaboration, partners and affiliates share unique skills, expertise, training and mentoring capabilities that will be greatly amplified within the infrastructure of a CTSA Hub. Princeton and NJIT, without medical schools or hospital affiliates, seeks collaboration with Rutgers to provide clinical research platforms; Rutgers seeks the PU and NJIT expertise in novel informatics platforms, expertise in natural language and ontology, machine learning and cognitive neurosciences. Together NJ ACTS will provide an alliance that will catalyze clinical research and training across New Jersey to improve population health and contribute to the CTSA Consortium. In this revised application, the overall themes remain unchanged but Cores leadership and direction has been markedly refined. Project Narrative The New Jersey Alliance for Clinical and Translational Science (NJ ACTS), as a member of the CTSA Consortium, unites Rutgers University, Princeton University, the New Jersey Institute of Technology, clinical, community and industry partners in a shared vision to make New Jersey a healthier state. Building on New Jersey’s already significant capabilities to promote and facilitate clinical and translational research, NJ ACTS will serve as a catalyst, inspiring new approaches to diagnose and manage disease, and fostering career development of the next generation of translational researchers, and promoting population health.",New Jersey Alliance for Clinical Translational Science: NJ ACTS,9831333,UL1TR003017,"['AIDS/HIV problem', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Asian Indian', 'Behavioral', 'Biometry', 'Child', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Cohort Studies', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Community Health Centers', 'Cuban', 'Databases', 'Dental', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Discipline of Nursing', 'Disease Management', 'Diverse Workforce', 'Elderly', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Evaluation', 'Fluorescent in Situ Hybridization', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Government', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act', 'Health Sciences', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Improve Access', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Informatics', 'Infrastructure', 'Institutes', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Investments', 'Laboratories', 'Leadership', 'Life Style', 'Link', 'Location', 'Longevity', 'Low income', 'Machine Learning', 'Medicaid', 'Medical', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Minority Groups', 'Mission', 'Muslim population group', 'New Jersey', 'Not Hispanic or Latino', 'Ontology', 'Oral health', 'Outpatients', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Perception', 'Population', 'Population Density', 'Precision therapeutics', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Public Health Schools', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Resources', 'School Nursing', 'Science', 'Solid', 'South Asian', 'Special Populations Research', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Universities', 'Vision', 'Workforce Development', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'biomarker discovery', 'career development', 'catalyst', 'clinical care', 'clinical investigation', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'cohesion', 'community based participatory research', 'disease heterogeneity', 'ethnic diversity', 'ethnic minority population', 'follower of religion Jewish', 'improved', 'industry partner', 'innovation', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'logarithm', 'medical schools', 'member', 'natural language', 'next generation', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'population health', 'programs', 'racial diversity', 'racial minority', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'research clinical testing', 'response', 'severe mental illness', 'skills', 'success', 'tool', 'translational scientist', 'treatment response', 'trial design']",NCATS,RUTGERS BIOMEDICAL/HEALTH SCIENCES-RBHS,UL1,2019,4776211,-0.008094456602500234
"Tracking Evolution and Spread of Viral Genomes by Geospatial Observation Error ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Tracking evolutionary changes in viral genomes and their spread often requires the use of data deposited in public databases such as GenBank, the Influenza Research Database (IRD), or the Virus Pathogen Resource (ViPR). GenBank provides an abundance of available viral sequence data for phylogeography. Sequences and their metadata can be downloaded and imported into software applications that generate phylogeographic trees and models for surveillance. IRD and ViPR are NIH/NIAID funded programs that import data from GenBank but contain additional data sources, visualization, and search tools for their users. Tracking evolutionary changes and spread also requires the geospatial assignment of taxa, which is often obtained from GenBank metadata. Unfortunately, geospatial metadata such as host location is often uncertain in GenBank entries, with only 36% containing a precise location such as a county, town, or region within a state. For example, information such as China or USA was indicated instead of Beijing or Bedford, NH. While town or county might be included in the corresponding journal article, this valuable information is not available for immediate use unless it is extracted and then linked back to the appropriate sequence. The goal of our work is to enable health agencies and other researchers to automatically generate phylogeographic models that incorporate enhanced geospatial data for better estimates of virus spread. This proposal focuses on developing and applying information extraction and statistical phylogeography approaches to enhance models that track evolutionary changes in viral genomes and their spread. We propose a framework that uses natural language processing (NLP) for the automatic extraction of relevant geospatial data from the literature, and assigns a confidence between such geospatial mentions and the GenBank record. We will then use these locations and the estimates as observation error in the creation of phylogeographic models of zoonotic virus spread. We hypothesize that a combined NLP-phylogeography infrastructure that produces models that include observation error in the geospatial assignment of taxa will be closer to a gold standard than phylogeographic models that do not include them. Our research will extend phylogeography and zoonotic surveillance by: creating a NLP infrastructure that will improve the level of detail of geospatial data for phylogeography of zoonotic viruses (Aim 1), develop phylogeographic models using the estimates from Aim 1 as observation error (Aim 2), and evaluating our approach by comparing the models it produces to models that do not account for observation error in the geospatial assignment of taxa (Aim 3). We will allow users to generate enhanced models and view results on a web portal accessible via a LinkOut feature from GenBank, IRD, and ViPR. The addition of more precise geospatial information in building such models could enable health agencies to better target areas that represent the greatest public health risk.

"A Multigenerational Longitudinal Panel for Aging Research Summary/Abstract This project will construct a Multigenerational Longitudinal Panel (IPUMS-MLP) of unprecedented scale and scope. Using cutting-edge automatic record linkage technology and drawing on complete count U.S. census data available from IPUMS for the period 1850 to 1940, the project will construct millions of individual life histories and trace millions of families over multiple generations. This infrastructure will provide the most comprehensive view of long-run changes in life-course dynamics available for any place in the world and will transform our understanding of processes of population aging. The work will require significant innovation and new technical infrastructure to accommodate the massive scale of the database. These data will allow investigators to directly observe changes in aging processes and life-course transitions during the period in which U.S. society was being transformed by industrialization, urbanization, immigration, demographic transition, and economic collapse. Investigators will be able to follow individuals over time to evaluate the impact of early-life conditions on later outcomes, trace life-course transitions into adulthood and old age, and observe family change over multiple generations. IPUMS-MLP will enrich existing aging surveys by providing data on multiple generations of forebears of survey respondents; likewise, it will enrich existing historical databases by enabling them to connect with descendants across multiple generations. Leveraging billions of dollars of federal investments in census data and transactional records from a variety of administrative sources, this project is a highly cost-effective use of scarce resources to develop shared infrastructure for research, education, and policy-making on health and aging. Project Narrative The proposed work is directly relevant to the core mission of the Population and Social Processes branch of NIA: the new data will advance fundamental knowledge about the causes and consequences of changes in health and well-being of the older population and will support research on the effects of public policies, social institutions, and environmental conditions on the health, well-being, and functioning of people, both over the life course and in their later years. For example, the data will enable examinations of the impact of lead exposure to late onset Alzheimer’s disease, the socioeconomic and health effects of early-life income support, intergenerational transmission of health and wellbeing over multiple generations, and the impact of early-life cognitive capacity on later-life health and economic outcomes.",A Multigenerational Longitudinal Panel for Aging Research,9769604,R01AG057679,"['Adult', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Big Data', 'Censuses', 'Characteristics', 'Communities', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Quality', 'Data Security', 'Databases', 'Demographic Transitions', 'Economics', 'Education', 'Elderly', 'Exposure to', 'Family', 'Family member', 'Future', 'Genealogy', 'Generations', 'Health', 'Household', 'Immigration', 'Income', 'Individual', 'Industrialization', 'Infrastructure', 'Institution', 'Investments', 'Knowledge', 'Late Onset Alzheimer Disease', 'Life', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Military Personnel', 'Mission', 'Names', 'Neighborhoods', 'Older Population', 'Outcome', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Persons', 'Policy Making', 'Population', 'Population Process', 'Process', 'Public Policy', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Support', 'Resources', 'Respondent', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Selection Bias', 'Social Processes', 'Social Security', 'Societies', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Urbanization', 'War', 'Weight', 'Woman', 'Work', 'aging population', 'base', 'cognitive capacity', 'cost effective', 'data integration', 'economic outcome', 'experience', 'health economics', 'improved', 'innovation', 'intergenerational', 'lead exposure', 'learning strategy', 'life history', 'longitudinal dataset', 'machine learning algorithm', 'novel', 'parallel processing', 'social', 'socioeconomics', 'tool', 'transmission process']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,R01,2019,681232,-0.02434227840371157
"Administrative Supplement to the OAIC Pepper Center Coordinating Center We wish to advantage of 2 new key opportunities that could significantly enhance achievement of the overall goals of the OIAC Coordinating Center (OAIC CC) and 2 key, unexpected administrative needs. Project 1) Develop, test and implement an innovative set of tools to perform Integrative Data Analysis (IDA) for combining and analyzing independent data sets across the OAIC network An over-arching goal of the OAIC CC is to build collaborations between OAICs that unlock synergy. Each of the OAICs has many small/medium-sized completed studies relevant to the OAIC theme, and that have measured key domains of physical function. Combining these studies could provide large, powerful databases for answering critical questions not possible with individual studies. However, this is currently not possible because different measurement instruments are often used across centers and across studies. This project overcomes this critical limitation by taking advantage of 2 newly available technologies and an ongoing study. IDA is a set of strategies in which two or more independent data sets which contain measures addressing similar domains but using different measurement instruments are combined into one and then statistically analyzed. The proposed project is timely because it leverages an ongoing clinical study to validate new procedures for harmonizing measures of physical and cognitive function across 20 Pepper center studies. The resources created by the project will significantly enhance collaboration across the OAIC program network, benefiting researchers at all OAICs, and can be disseminated to other NIA center programs. Project 2) Develop a robust, interactive database of OAIC Program accomplishments that will automatically be updated via an efficient, streamlined, electronic annual reporting process.  It is widely believed that the NIA-funded Pepper Center program has been highly productive. However, there is no means of assessing the overall effectiveness of the Pepper Center, or of ‘cataloging’ its impressive accomplishments. This project will take advantage of new open-source technology to efficiently develop a robust, comprehensive, searchable, interactive database of past accomplishments. It will also develop a streamlined electronic Annual Directory Report template, and link it to the new OAIC database so that it is automatically updated each year. Achieving the goals of this project will reduce administrative burden for sites, facilitate NIA review of performance of centers, and create an annually updated database of OAIC accomplishments, projects, publications, and outcomes, and facilitate collaborations between centers and investigators across NIA programs. This application also requests support for 2 key, unexpected administrative needs that have arisen: 1) Increase in funding amount for the annual OAIC CC Multi-center pilot project. 2) Support for additional Pepper Centers that will soon be added to the OAIC network. Relevance Statement for OAIC Coordinating Center Administrative Supplement The Coordinating Center of the OAIC coordinates the activities of all the individual centers in the NIA- funded, OAIC network; its over-arching goal is to build collaborations between the individual OAICs and thereby unlock synergy and enable projects that could not be undertaken by any single OAIC center. This administrative supplement application proposes 2 developmental projects that will significantly enhance the capabilities of the OAIC to achieve these goals and which takes advantage of newly available methods and technology. This also includes additional support for the possible increase in the number of Pepper Centers and an increase in the pilot award budget.",Administrative Supplement to the OAIC Pepper Center Coordinating Center,9961004,U24AG059624,"['Achievement', 'Address', 'Administrative Supplement', 'Aging', 'Annual Reports', 'Award', 'Budgets', 'Capsicum', 'Cataloging', 'Catalogs', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognition', 'Collaborations', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Directories', 'Effectiveness', 'Elderly', 'Equipment and supply inventories', 'Evaluation', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Individual', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Performance', 'Physical Function', 'Pilot Projects', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Psychometrics', 'Publications', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Site', 'Source', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Update', 'Walking', 'analytical method', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'cognitive function', 'cost effective', 'data modeling', 'forest', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'interest', 'lifestyle intervention', 'new technology', 'novel', 'open source', 'programs', 'recruit', 'response', 'synergism', 'theories', 'tool']",NIA,WAKE FOREST UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,U24,2019,149775,-0.0063282813946554965

"Clinic Interactions of a Brain-Computer Interface for Communication ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The promise of brain-computer interfaces (BCI) for communication is becoming a reality for individuals with severe speech and physical impairments (SSPI) who cannot rely on speech or writing to express themselves. While the majority of research efforts are devoted to technology development to address problems of stability, reliability and/or classification, clinical and behavioral challenges are becoming more apparent as individuals with SSPI and their family/care teams assess the systems during novice or long-term trials. The objective of the RSVP Keyboard(tm) BCI translational research team is to address the clinical challenges raised during functional BCI use with innovative engineering design, thereby enhancing the potential of this novel assistive technology. Four specific aims are proposed: (1) to develop a BCI Communication Application Suite (BCI-CAS) that offers a set of language modules to people with SSPI that can meet their language/literacy skills; (2) to develop improved statistical signal models for personalized feature extraction, artifact/interference handling, and robust, accurate intent evidence extraction from physiologic signals; (3) to develop improved language models and stimulus sequence optimization methods; and (4) to evaluate cognitive variables that affect learning and performance of the BCI-CAS. Five language modules are proposed that rely on a multimodal evidence fusion framework for model-based context-aware optimal intent inference: RSVP Keyboard(tm) generative spelling; RSVP texting; RSVP in-context typing; RSVP in-context icon typing; and binary yes/no responses with SSVEPs. Usability data on the current RSVP Keyboard(tm) and SSVEP system drive all proposed aims. Users select a language module, and the BCI system optimizes performance for each individual based on user adaptation, intent inference, and personalized language modeling. A unique simulation function drives individualization of system parameters. The robustness of the BCI customization efforts are evaluated continually by adults with SSPI and neurotypical controls in an iterative fashion. The effect of three intervention programs that address the cognitive construct of attention (process-specific attention training, mindfulness meditation training and novel stimulus presentations) will be implemented through hypothesis-driven single subject designs. Thirty participants, ages 21 years and older with SSPI will be included in home-based interventions. By measuring information transfer rate (ITR), user satisfaction, and intrinsic user factors, we will identify learning strategies that influence BCI sill acquisition and performance for adults with neurodegenerative or neurodevelopmental conditions. The translational teams include (1) signal processing (Erdogmus); (2) clinical neurophysiology (Oken); (3) natural language processing (Bedrick/Gorman); and (4) assistive technology (Fried-Oken). We continue to rely on a solid Bayesian foundation and theoretical frameworks: ICF disability classification (WHO, 2001), the AAC model of participation (Beukelman & Mirenda, 2013) and the Matching Person to Technology Model (Scherer, 2002). PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The populations of patients with severe speech and physical impairments secondary to neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative diseases are increasing as medical technologies advance and successfully support life. These individuals with limited to no movement could potentially contribute to their medical decision making, informed consent, and daily caregiving if they had faster, more reliable means to interface with communication systems. The BCI Communication Applications Suite is a hybrid brain-computer interface that is an innovative technological advance so that patients and their families can participate in daily activities and advocate for improvements in standard clinical care.

"Enhancing Infrastructure for Clinical and Translational Research to Address the Opioid Epidemic PROJECT SUMMARY Up-to-date information about non-fatal overdose emergency department (ED) encounters can provide critical information about the evolution of the opioid epidemic and response of the healthcare system and is an essential to planning of clinical trials to address the problems underlying this epidemic. Establishing a platform that delivers high positive predictive value for opioid-related overdose (OD) using a combination of coded and natural language terms in electronic health records (EHRs) is an essential step toward the large-scale surveillance necessary to evaluate the pragmatic effectiveness of numerous systemic and policy-based efforts and to create the infrastructure for large scale trials to reduce drug-related mortality and morbidity. However, to date, localized and federal efforts have been largely based on discrete ICD-10 code data or have had time lags of one-to-three years for more detailed data. Perhaps more Importantly, they have not had the capacity for planning and feasibility assessment for clinical and translational research at specific sites. We propose foundational work to create an inter-institutional research database and network focused on patients presenting to EDs with opioid-related OD. To create this network, we will extend previous work to develop: (1) an e-phenotype for case identification in the ED based on EHR data, and (2) combine this with a data dictionary and coded data extraction tools, and natural language processing (NLP) algorithms, to obtain additional data from EHRs; tools for primary capture of data during clinical care; and tools for integration of data on social determinants of health. This will allow for a more thorough characterization of individuals presenting to EDs with opioid-related OD including: demographics, comorbidities, OD agent and source, intentionality of the OD, ED treatment and discharge disposition. Through refinement and automation, the data extraction process will be extended to a set of pilot CTSA Accrual to Clinical Trials (ACT) Network sites and then potentially to other CTSA's nation-wide. This new functionality focuses on providing a platform to accelerate research. To accomplish this work, our Specific Aims are to: 1) Demonstrate the feasibility of extending the ACT Network data model and infrastructure to monitor the opioid epidemic using ED data, 2) Create a prototype opioid overdose monitoring and response network across participating institutions and a toolkit for other CTSA sites to join the network, and 3) Demonstrate potential usefulness of the network in monitoring the opioid epidemic and in planning clinical trials. This proposal is innovative as it aims to develop a feasible and effective near real time means of monitoring opioid-related OD presentation in EDs across the country to inform point-of-care service delivery, prevention and treatment intervention development and evaluation. Downstream, the application of project deliverables include dissemination of the replication toolkit to leverage the platform of the CTSAs and NIDA Clinical Trials Network to build capacity for timely surveillance of opioid-related OD to facilitate prevention and treatment research and intervention. PROJECT NARRATIVE Patients presenting with opioid-related overdose to hospital emergency departments represent a high-risk group for morbidity and mortality and a potential target for interventions to combat the opioid epidemic. This proposal is innovative as it aims to develop a feasible and effective inter-institutional research database and network focused on these patients. These tools will inform point-of-care service delivery, as well as enhance nationwide prevention and treatment interventions.",Enhancing Infrastructure for Clinical and Translational Research to Address the Opioid Epidemic,9821606,U01TR002628,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Automation', 'California', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Database', 'Clinical Trials Network', 'Clinical assessments', 'Code', 'Comorbidity', 'Country', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Dictionary', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Epidemic', 'Evaluation', 'Evolution', 'Fentanyl', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Resources', 'Health system', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heroin', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Institution', 'International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision (ICD-10)', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Trial', 'Investments', 'Kentucky', 'Laboratories', 'Modification', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Non-Prescription Drugs', 'Odds Ratio', 'Opiate Addiction', 'Opioid', 'Outcome Study', 'Overdose', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Policies', 'Predictive Value', 'Prevention', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Site', 'Source', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical care', 'clinical infrastructure', 'combat', 'data integration', 'data modeling', 'demographics', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'electronic data', 'fitness', 'high risk population', 'innovation', 'inter-institutional', 'mortality', 'natural language', 'opioid epidemic', 'opioid misuse', 'opioid overdose', 'opioid use disorder', 'overdose prevention', 'point of care', 'prescription opioid', 'prescription opioid misuse', 'prototype', 'response', 'service delivery', 'social', 'social health determinants', 'synthetic opioid', 'therapy design', 'therapy development', 'tool', 'translational study']",NCATS,MEDICAL UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA,U01,2019,778563,-0.018461985447007695
"COINSTAC: Decentralized, Scalable Analysis of Loosely Coupled Data The brain imaging community is greatly benefiting from extensive data sharing efforts currently underway. However, there is a significant gap in existing strategies which focus on anonymized, post-hoc sharing of either 1) full raw or preprocessed data [in the case of open studies] or 2) manually computed summary measures [such as hippocampal volume, in the case of closed (or not yet shared) studies] which we propose to address. Current approaches to data sharing often include significant logistical hurdles both for the investigator sharing the dat as well as for the individual requesting the data (e.g. often times multiple data sharing agreements and approvals are required from US and international institutions). This needs to change, so that the scientific community becomes a venue where data can be collected, managed, widely shared and analyzed while also opening up access to the (many) data sets which are not currently available (see recent overview on this from our group).    The large amount of existing data requires an approach that can analyze data in a distributed way while also leaving control of the source data with the individual investigator; this motivates  dynamic, decentralized way of approaching large scale analyses. We are proposing a peer-to-peer system called the Collaborative Informatics and Neuroimaging Suite Toolkit for Anonymous Computation (COINSTAC). The system will provide an independent, open, no-strings-attached tool that performs analysis on datasets distributed across different locations. Thus, the step of actually aggregating data can be avoided, while the strength of large-scale analyses can be retained. To achieve this, in Aim 1, the uniform data interfaces that we propose will make it easy to share and cooperate. Robust and novel quality assurance and replicability tools will also be incorporated. Collaboration and data sharing will be done through forming temporary (need and project-based) virtual clusters of studies performing automatically generated local computation on their respective data and aggregating statistics in global inference procedures. The communal organization will provide a continuous stream of large scale projects that can be formed and completed without the need of creating new rigid organizations or project-oriented storage vaults. In Aim 2, we develop, evaluate, and incorporate privacy-preserving algorithms to ensure that the data used are not re-identifiable even with multiple re-uses. We also will develop advanced distributed and privacy preserving approaches for several key multivariate families of algorithms (general linear model, matrix factorization [e.g. independent component analysis], classification) to estimate intrinsic networks and perform data fusion. Finally, in Aim 3, we will demonstrate the utility of this approach in a proof of concept study through distributed analyses of substance abuse datasets across national and international venues with multiple imaging modalities. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Hundreds of millions of dollars have been spent to collect human neuroimaging data for clinical and research purposes, many of which don't have data sharing agreements or collect sensitive data which are not easily shared, such as genetics. Opportunities for large scale aggregated analyses to infer health-relevant facts create new challenges in protecting the privacy of individuals' data. Open sharing of raw data, though desirable from the research perspective, and growing rapidly, is not a good solution for a large number of datasets which have additional privacy risks or IRB concerns. The COINSTAC solution we are proposing will capture this 'missing data' and allow for pooling of both open and 'closed' repositories by developing privacy preserving versions of widely-used algorithms and incorporating within an easy-to-use platform which enables distributed computation. In addition, COINSTAC will accelerate research on both open and closed data by offering a distributed computational solution for a large toolkit of widely used algorithms.","COINSTAC: Decentralized, Scalable Analysis of Loosely Coupled Data",9938885,R01DA040487,"['AODD relapse', 'Accounting', 'Address', 'Agreement', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Algorithms', 'Attention', 'Brain imaging', 'Classification', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Consent Forms', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Aggregation', 'Data Set', 'Decentralization', 'Development', 'Ensure', 'Family', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Markers', 'Health', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Institution', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'Intelligence', 'International', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Letters', 'Linear Models', 'Location', 'Logistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Movement', 'Paper', 'Plant Roots', 'Poaceae', 'Population', 'Privacy', 'Privatization', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Science', 'Site', 'Source', 'Stream', 'Substance abuse problem', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'base', 'commune', 'computational platform', 'computer framework', 'computing resources', 'connectome', 'cost', 'data anonymization', 'data sharing', 'distributed data', 'flexibility', 'imaging genetics', 'imaging modality', 'independent component analysis', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'open data', 'peer', 'preservation', 'public health relevance', 'quality assurance', 'repository', 'statistics', 'tool', 'virtual']",NIDA,GEORGIA STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,585151,0.010694713368020215
"Microdata for Analysis of Early Life Conditions, Health, and Population Project Summary This project will enhance and develop the only source of data that provides core information about work, education, income, and migration for the entire U.S. population. This unique resource allows us to observe today's late-life population when they were young. This allows a prospective view of the impact of early-life environments and socioeconomic status on health and well-being in later life. The massive database describes the characteristics of all 133 million persons who resided in the United States in 1940. The data have been available for only a brief period, but are already having a profound impact on scientific research. They are the primary data source for at least 19 sponsored projects, including nine funded by NIH and seven funded by NSF. Through May 2017, 104 investigators had produced 95 papers based on the data, including 22 articles, four books, three PhD dissertations, and 66 working papers. This project will improve the quality and usability of the database by correcting transcription errors; improving the coding, editing, and allocation of key variables; and introducing new data dissemination tools designed to simplify access to the data. The project will undertake three major activities to meet these objectives. 1. Incorporate new verified census information on name, age, sex, family relationship, race, marital status,  birthplace, and residence five years ago. 2. Improve coding, editing, and allocation for geographic variables, migration, occupation, and numerically-  coded variables such as income. 3. Apply new technologies to democratize access to the data through new data access tools and a virtual data  enclave for a restricted version of the data that contains names. This project is a highly cost-effective use of scarce resources to develop shared infrastructure for research, education, and policy-making on health and aging. The proposed improvement of data quality is urgent, and will provide a resource of unprecedented power for understanding the effects of public policies, social institutions, and environmental conditions on the health, well-being, and functioning of people, both over the life course and in their later years. Narrative This project will develop data for prospective analysis of the impact of early-life circumstances and environment on health outcomes in late life, including Alzheimer's disease. The proposed improvement of data quality is urgent, and will provide a resource of unprecedented power for understanding the effects of public policies, social institutions, and environmental conditions on the health, well-being, and functioning of people, both over the life course and in their later years. The proposed work is directly relevant to the core mission of the Population and Social Processes branch of NIA, since the data will allow us to observe today's late-life population when they were young.","Microdata for Analysis of Early Life Conditions, Health, and Population",9750600,R01AG041831,"['Age', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'American', 'Arbitration', 'Books', 'Censuses', 'Characteristics', 'Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints', 'Code', 'County', 'Data', 'Data Quality', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Demography', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Economics', 'Education', 'Elderly', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Family Relationship', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genealogy', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Geography', 'Handwriting', 'Health', 'Income', 'Institution', 'Investments', 'Journals', 'Life', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Marital Status', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Names', 'Occupational', 'Occupations', 'Outcome', 'Paper', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Persons', 'Policy Making', 'Population', 'Population Process', 'Privatization', 'Process', 'Public Policy', 'Publications', 'Race', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resources', 'Science', 'Social Processes', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Sociology', 'Source', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'arm', 'base', 'blind', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'data access', 'design', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'migration', 'new technology', 'prospective', 'residence', 'sex', 'social', 'tool', 'usability', 'virtual']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,R01,2019,650000,-0.02209650884058164

"Semantic Data Lake for Biomedical Research Capitalizing on the transformative opportunities afforded by the extremely large and ever-growing volume, velocity, and variety of biomedical data being continuously produced is a major challenge. The development and increasingly widespread adoption of several new technologies, including next generation genetic sequencing, electronic health records and clinical trials systems, and research data warehouses means that we are in the midst of a veritable explosion in data production. This in turn results in the migration of the bottleneck in scientific productivity into data management and interpretation: tools are urgently needed to assist cancer researchers in the assembly, integration, transformation, and analysis of these Big Data sets. In this project, we propose to develop the Semantic Data Lake for Biomedical Research (SDL-BR) system, a cluster-computing software environment that enables rapid data ingestion, multifaceted data modeling, logical and semantic querying and data transformation, and intelligent resource discovery. SDL-BR is based on the idea of a data lake, a distributed store that does not make any assumptions about the structure of incoming data, and that delays modeling decisions until data is to be used. This project adds to the data lake paradigm methods for semantic data modeling, integration, and querying, and for resource discovery based on learned relationships between users and data resources. The SDL-BR System is a distributed computing software solution that enables research institutions to manage, integrate, and make available large institutional data sets to researchers, and that permits users to generate data models specific to particular applications. It uses state of the art cluster computing, Semantic Web, and machine learning technologies to provide for rapid data ingestion, semantic modeling and querying, and search and discovery of data resources through a sophisticated, Web-based user interface.",Semantic Data Lake for Biomedical Research,9765194,R44CA206782,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Adoption', 'Area', 'Big Data', 'Biomedical Computing', 'Biomedical Research', 'Catalogs', 'Chronic Myeloid Leukemia', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collection', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Collection', 'Data Discovery', 'Data Quality', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Demographic Factors', 'Development', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Evaluation', 'Explosion', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Markers', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Ingestion', 'Institution', 'Intelligence', 'Knowledge', 'Knowledge Extraction', 'Legal', 'Legal patent', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Non-Small-Cell Lung Carcinoma', 'Online Systems', 'Ontology', 'Phase', 'Policies', 'Precision therapeutics', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Production', 'Productivity', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resources', 'Retrieval', 'Risk', 'Secure', 'Security', 'Semantics', 'Services', 'Source', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Vocabulary', 'Work', 'base', 'cancer therapy', 'clinical data warehouse', 'cluster computing', 'computer based Semantic Analysis', 'cost effective', 'data access', 'data exchange', 'data integration', 'data management', 'data modeling', 'data resource', 'data warehouse', 'design', 'disease heterogeneity', 'experience', 'genetic information', 'handheld mobile device', 'indexing', 'individualized medicine', 'melanoma', 'migration', 'natural language', 'new technology', 'next generation', 'novel', 'off-patent', 'precision medicine', 'prototype', 'success', 'systems research', 'targeted treatment', 'technology development', 'time use', 'tool']",NCI,"INFOTECH SOFT, INC.",R44,2019,238768,-0.037766474582902734
"Sequencing and Genotyping in Diverse Populations:  Who Wants What Back (and When)? PROJECT SUMMARY The North Coast Conference on Precision Medicine is a national annual mid-sized conference series held in Cleveland, Ohio. The conference series aims to serve as a venue for the continuing education and exchange of scientific ideas related to the rapidly evolving and highly interdisciplinary landscape that is precision medicine research. The topics for each conference coincide with the national conversation and research agenda set by national research programs focused on precision medicine. The 2018 conference is a symposium that will focus on issues related to return of genomic results both in clinical and research settings with an emphasis on diverse populations. The conference will be organized as a traditional format with invited speakers from among national experts for topics ranging from issues returning research results to culturally diverse participants and family members, inclusion of diverse patient and participant populations in the Clinical Sequencing Evidence- Generating Research (CSER) consortium and the Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine (TOPMed) Program, pharmacogenomics-guided dosing and race/ethnicity, strategies used to return results, among others. 2019 and beyond conference topics are being considered from previous symposia attendees and trends in precision medicine research. Odd-numbered year conferences include a workshop component that has previously covered outcome and exposure variable extraction from electronic health records. Future workshop topics being considered include integration of multiple ‘omics, drug response in different populations, pharmacogenomics clinical implementation, precision medicine in cancer, data sharing and informed consent, and the use of apps for recruitment, diagnosis, follow-up, and treatment. Our second major objective of this conference series is the promotion of diversity in the biomedical workforce. It is well-known that the pipeline from training to full professor for women in biomedical research is leaky whereas the pipeline for under-represented minorities is practically non-existent. Drawing from national and local sources, we vet women and under-represented minorities for every invited speaker opportunity, thereby providing valuable career currency and networking opportunities. We will also encourage women and under-represented minorities, particularly at the trainee level, to attend and participate in this conference series to spur interest in pursuing precision medicine research as a career. Overall, the North Coast Conference on Precision Medicine series is a valuable addition to the national conference landscape, and with its unique location and low cost to participants, will serve as an important educational opportunity as precision medicine research accelerates in earnest. PROJECT NARRATIVE The North Coast Conference on Precision Medicine is a yearly fall conference series in Cleveland, Ohio designed as a continuing education forum in the burgeoning area of precision medicine research. The conference brings together national experts on a host of topics ranging from bioethics to bioinformatics to biomedical informatics to speak and lead workshops on timely challenges posed in translating complex genomic and health data into clinical practice. The conference series also serves to promote diversity in the biomedical workforce.

"CORE CENTER FOR CLINICAL RESEACH IN TOTAL JOINT ARTHROPLASTY (CORE-TJA) ABSTRACT - OVERALL Total joint arthroplasty (TJA) is the most common and fastest growing surgery in the nation. There are currently more than 7 million Americans living with artificial joints. Despite the high surgery volume, the evidence base for TJA procedures, technologies and associated interventions are limited. Many surgical approaches and implant technologies in TJA are adopted based on theoretical grounds with limited clinical evidence. The wider TJA research community needs access to large, high quality and rich data sources and state-of-the-art clinical research standards and information technologies to overcome methodological and practical challenges in studies of surgical and nonsurgical interventions in TJA. The overarching goal of Mayo Core Center for Clinical Research in Total Joint Arthroplasty (CORE-TJA) is to facilitate innovative, methodologically rigorous and interdisciplinary clinical research that will directly improve TJA care and the outcomes. The CORE-TJA will serve as a disease (TJA) and theme-focused Center providing shared methodological expertise, education and data resources. The CORE-TJA will leverage big data resources for TJA research, provide customized methodology resources in epidemiology, biostatistics, health services research and medical informatics, and establish synergistic interactions around an integrated Core (American Joint Replacement Registry – AJRR). The Specific Aims of CORE-TJA are: (1) To provide administrative and scientific oversight of CORE-TJA activities (Administrative Core), (2) To provide integrated services, access to large databases and novel analytical methods for clinical research in TJA (Methodology Core); and (3) To meet the unique data needs of the TJA research community and to strengthen the national capacity for large-scale observational and interventional studies in TJA using national registry data (Resource Core).

"Washington University School of Medicine Undiagnosed Diseases Network Clinical Site 1.0 PROJECT SUMMARY The scientific premise of this application is that the individualized translational research process of the Undiagnosed Diseases Network (UDN) developed during Phase I is scalable and that its impact on patients, families, and disease discovery can be advanced and sustained by addition of a Clinical Site at Washington University School of Medicine (WUSM). WUSM represents a large academic medical center that is fully integrated with world-renowned basic science capabilities and demonstrated expertise in a gene first approach for patients with undiagnosed diseases. The highly collaborative clinical and biomedical research culture at WUSM promotes interactions within and across Departments, with institutional genomic, clinical, computational, and model system experts, and with colleagues regionally, nationally, and internationally. These interactions support recruitment, selection, evaluation, diagnosis discovery, and follow up of pediatric and adult patients with undiagnosed diseases through both established networks and individual referrals. Building on this infrastructure, WUSM faculty and staff will advance the success of the UDN in diagnosing and managing disease in undiagnosed patients by, first, using, refining, and improving protocols designed during Phase I of the UDN for comprehensive, timely clinical evaluations of 30 undiagnosed patients annually. Secondly, we will collect, securely store, and share standardized, high-quality clinical and laboratory data including genotyping, phenotyping, and documentation of environmental exposures and promote an integrated and collaborative community across the UDN and among laboratory and clinical investigators focused on defining the pathophysiology, cell biologic, and molecular mechanisms that cause these difficult to diagnose diseases. Thirdly, the WUSM UDN Clinical Site will propose a bioinformatics plan for leveraging institutional infrastructure and expertise to develop innovative strategies to improve discovery of pathogenic variants. Fourthly, the assessment, dissemination, outreach, and training plan will accelerate assessment and dissemination of data, protocols, consent materials, and methods, availability of educational and outreach materials for participants, clinicians, and other researchers, engagement of underrepresented minorities, and training for students, fellows, staff, and faculty in collaboration with WUSM’s Clinical and Translational Science Award infrastructure. Finally, WUSM will make a clear institutional commitment to maintain its Clinical Site, to adapt UDN Phase I practices for sustainability, to contribute to formation of a sustainable national UDN resource, and to adapt to unique needs and unexpected circumstances that may arise once Common Fund support ends in fiscal year 2022. 2.0 PROJECT NARRATIVE Undiagnosed diseases in children and adults represent frustrating and costly challenges for patients, families, physicians, and society. Building on established institutional infrastructure similar to the Undiagnosed Diseases Network (UDN), Washington University School of Medicine (WUSM) will establish a UDN Clinical Site to improve the level of diagnosis and care for patients with undiagnosed diseases, facilitate research into the etiology of undiagnosed diseases, and promote an integrated and collaborative community across multiple UDN Clinical Sites, Sequencing Cores, Model Organisms Screening Centers, and among laboratory and clinical investigators. Specifically, the WUSM UDN Clinical Site will annually recruit, select, evaluate, and follow 30 participants with disorders in any clinical specialty, adult and pediatric, provide comprehensive clinical evaluations that require <5 days and follow up, and participate in all UDN protocols, data management and sharing, and sustainability planning.",Washington University School of Medicine Undiagnosed Diseases Network Clinical Site,9789913,U01HG010215,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Accreditation', 'Adult', 'Animal Model', 'Basic Science', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biomedical Research', 'Businesses', 'Cells', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Clinical and Translational Science Awards', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computer Simulation', 'Consent', 'DNA Sequencing Facility', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Documentation', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Expert Systems', 'Faculty', 'Family', 'Family Physicians', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Genes', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Geographic Locations', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Institutes', 'International', 'Laboratories', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Network-based', 'Participant', 'Pathogenicity', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Phase I Clinical Trials', 'Phenotype', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Review Committee', 'Secure', 'Societies', 'Standardization', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Underrepresented Minority', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Washington', 'clinical practice', 'clinical research site', 'cost', 'data management', 'data sharing', 'deep learning', 'design', 'disease diagnosis', 'exome sequencing', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'genetic variant', 'genome sequencing', 'improved', 'innovation', 'medical schools', 'medical specialties', 'network models', 'operation', 'outreach', 'recruit', 'research clinical testing', 'screening', 'sequencing platform', 'student training', 'success', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NHGRI,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,U01,2019,750000,-0.0177562672915652
"Longitudinal and Intergenerational Determinants of Aging and Mortality ABSTRACT  Some of the most important open questions in aging relate to the impact of longitudinal and intergenerational factors. But documenting the role of early-life and intergenerational determinants of health and aging is limited by the dearth of large-scale micro-data containing this information. This is especially true for understudied populations such as women and minority groups.  Our research objective is to add critical information on cause of death to the new large-scale data resource, the Longitudinal, Intergenerational Family Electronic Micro-database (LIFE-M). Funded by the National Science Foundation, LIFE-M links millions of vital records (birth, marriage, and death certificates) to decennial censuses over four generations and 120 years for five states. LIFE-M is a representative sample of cohorts aging and dying in the last 25 years of the 20th century and includes crucial early-life and intergenerational information. Enhancing the LIFE-M with cause of death will facilitate path-breaking research on the relationship of longevity and cause of death with demographic, socio-economic, and early-life environmental factors for family networks across four generations.  We will achieve this objective by pursuing the following specific aims:  (1) We will use new “Smart Indexing” technology to digitize and cross-validate hand-written cause-of-death information;  (2) We will link digitized causes of death to the LIFE-M infrastructure and create extensive documentation for  this new variable for public use; and  (3) We will publicly release the cause-of-death variable and documentation with the LIFE-M dataset, meta-  data, and supporting documentation on ICPSR in 2020.  The proposed project will also have broader impacts. In addition to contributing a significant new data resource that can be added to Minnesota Population Center's historical linked censuses and the Census Longitudinal Infrastructure Project (CLIP), this project's methodological innovations in script digitization will enhance on-going and future data infrastructure initiatives. Both contributions promise to transform the research frontier in population health and aging in the United States. PROJECT NARRATIVE  This project contributes to public health knowledge by adding cause-of-death information to a new intergenerational and longitudinal dataset (LIFE-M). These data will allow much more research on the long- term determinants of health and aging, including a deeper understanding the intergenerational and early-life origins of later-life diseases and mortality in today's aging population.",Longitudinal and Intergenerational Determinants of Aging and Mortality,9691090,R01AG057704,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'American', 'Biogenesis', 'Birth', 'Birth Records', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cause of Death', 'Censuses', 'Cessation of life', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Complement', 'Cost Savings', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Death Certificates', 'Demography', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Documentation', 'Economics', 'Elderly', 'Enrollment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemiology', 'Exposure to', 'Family', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Hand', 'Handwriting', 'Health', 'Health Campaign', 'Health Resources', 'Health and Retirement Study', 'Hypertension', 'Image', 'Immigrant', 'Income', 'Individual', 'Inequality', 'Infant', 'Infrastructure', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Link', 'Longevity', 'Maiden Name', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Marriage', 'Medicare/Medicaid', 'Metadata', 'Methodology', 'Michigan', 'Minnesota', 'Minority Groups', 'Names', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Price', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Role', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Sanitation', 'Science', 'Subgroup', 'Surveys', 'Technology', 'Toxin', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Vaccines', 'Water', 'Woman', 'Women&apos', 's Group', 'aging population', 'base', 'cohort', 'convolutional neural network', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'data resource', 'early-life nutrition', 'ethnic minority population', 'frontier', 'health knowledge', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'intergenerational', 'longitudinal dataset', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mortality', 'panel study of income dynamics', 'population health', 'population survey', 'programs', 'racial and ethnic', 'response', 'socioeconomics', 'suicide rate']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2019,308553,-0.012761968065898998
"Natural language processing for characterizing psychopathology ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Convergent genetic and epidemiologic evidence suggests the importance of understanding psychiatric illness from a dimensional rather than solely a categorical perspective. The limitations of traditional diagnostic categories motivated a major NIMH-supported effort to identify measures of psychopathology that more closely align with underlying disease biology.  At present, however, the available large clinical data sets, whether health claims, registries, or electronic health records, do not include such dimensional measures. Even with the integration of structure clinician and patient-reported outcomes, generating such cohorts could require a decade or more. Moreover, coded data does not systematically capture clinically-important concepts such as health behaviors or stressors.  While such cohorts are developed, natural language processing can facilitate the application of existing electronic health records to enable precision medicine in psychiatry. Specifically, while traditional natural language tools focus on extracting individual terms, emerging methods including those in development by the investigators allow extraction of concepts and dimensions.  The present investigation proposes to develop a toolkit for natural language processing of narrative patient notes to extract measures of psychopathology, including estimated RDoC domains. In preliminary investigations in a large health system, these tools have demonstrated both face validity and predictive validity. This toolkit also allows extraction o complex concepts from narrative notes, such as stressors and health behaviors.  In the proposed study, these natural language processing tools will be applied to a large psychiatric inpatient data set as well as a large general medical inpatient data set, to derive measures of psychopathology and other topics. The resulting measures will then be used in combination with coded data to build regression and machine-learning-based models to predict clinical outcomes including length of hospital stay and risk of readmission. The models will then be validated in independent clinical cohorts.  By combining expertise in longitudinal clinical investigation, natural language processing, and machine learning, the proposed study brings together a team with the needed skills to develop a critical toolkit for understanding health records dimensionally The resulting models can be applied to facilitate investigation of dimensions of psychopathology and related topics, allowing stratification of clinical risk to enable development of targeted interventions. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Public health significance many aspects of psychiatric illness are not adequately captured by diagnostic codes.

"Automated domain adaptation for clinical natural language processing Project Summary Automatic extraction of useful information from clinical texts enables new clinical research tasks and new technologies at the point of care. The natural language processing (NLP) systems that perform this extraction rely on supervised machine learning. The learning process uses manually labeled datasets that are limited in size and scope, and as a result, applying NLP systems to unseen datasets often results in severely degraded performance. Obtaining larger and broader datasets is unlikely due to the expense of the manual labeling process and the difficulty of sharing text data between multiple different institutions. Therefore, this project develops unsupervised domain adaptation algorithms to adapt NLP systems to new data. Domain adaptation describes the process of adapting a machine learning system to new data sources. The proposed methods are unsupervised in that they do not require manual labels for the new data. This project has three aims. The first aim makes use of multiple existing datasets for the same task to study the differences in domains, and uses this information to develop new domain adaptation algorithms. Evaluation uses standard machine learning metrics, and analysis of performance is tightly bounded by strong baselines from below and realistic upper bounds, both based on theoretical research on machine learning generalization. The second aim develops open source software tools to simplify the process of incorporating domain adaptation into clinical text processing workflows. This software will have input interfaces to connect to methods developed in Aim 1 and output interfaces to connect with Apache cTAKES, a widely used open- source NLP tool. Aim 3 tests these methods in an end-to-end use case, adverse drug event (ADE) extraction on a dataset of pediatric pulmonary hypertension notes. ADE extraction relies on multiple NLP systems, so this use case is able to show how broad improvements to NLP methods can improve downstream methods. This aim also creates new manual labels for the dataset for an end-to-end evaluation that directly measures how improvements to the NLP systems lead to improvement in ADE extraction. Project Narrative Software systems that use machine learning to understand clinical text often suffer severe performance loss when they are applied to new data that looks different than the data that they originally learned from. In this project, we develop and implement methods that allow these systems to automatically adapt to the characteristics of a new data source. We evaluate these methods on the clinical research task of adverse drug event detection, which relies on many different variables found in the text of electronic health records.",Automated domain adaptation for clinical natural language processing,9579181,R01LM012918,"['Adult', 'Adverse drug event', 'Adverse effects', 'Algorithms', 'Apache', 'Area', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Characteristics', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Clinical Research', 'Colon Carcinoma', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Conceptions', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Detection', 'Dimensions', 'Ecosystem', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Evaluation', 'Human', 'Institution', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Language', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Linguistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of brain', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Network-based', 'Output', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Process', 'Pulmonary Hypertension', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Research', 'Software Tools', 'Source', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Testing', 'Text', 'TimeLine', 'Training', 'Update', 'Vision', 'Work', 'base', 'case finding', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'method development', 'natural language', 'new technology', 'news', 'novel', 'open source', 'point of care', 'social media', 'software systems', 'statistics', 'tool', 'tumor', 'unsupervised learning']",NLM,BOSTON CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2018,416066,0.009911630723079833
"Research and development of an open, extensible, web-based information extraction workbench for systematic review Project Summary  1 More than 4,000 systematic reviews are performed each year in the fields of environmental health and evidence-based  2 medicine, with each review requiring, on average, between six months to one year of effort to complete. One of the most  3 time consuming and repetitive aspects of this endeavor involves extraction of detailed information from a large number  4 of scientific documents. The specific data items extracted differ among disciplines, but within a given scientific domain,  5 certain data points are extracted repeatedly for each review conducted. Research on use of natural language processing  6 (NLP) for extracting individual data elements has shown that it has the potential to greatly reduce the laborious, time  7 intensive, and repetitive nature of this step. However, there is currently no integrated, automatic data extraction platform  8 that meets the needs of the systematic review community. We propose a web-based data extraction software platform  9 specifically designed for usage in the domain of systematic review. By combining multiple state-of-the-art data extraction 10 methods utilizing NLP, text mining and machine learning, into a single, unified user interface, we will thereby empower 11 the end-user with a powerful and novel tool for automating an otherwise arduous task. 12 The research we propose encompasses three specific aims: (1) develop new data extraction models using deep learning 13 and a new technique called “data programming”; (2) develop a web-based platform to semi-automate the process; (3) 14 design protocols and standards for packaging extraction models as software components and integrating work done by 15 other research groups and vendors. In the first aim, we will contribute novel data extraction modules designed and 16 trained specifically to extract data elements of interest to those conducting systematic reviews in the domain of 17 environmental health. For this research, we will employ state-of-the-art machine learning, NLP and text mining 18 methodologies to train and evaluate several novel extraction components. In our second aim, we will develop a web- 19 based workbench which will allow users to upload scientific documents for automated data extraction. Our system will 20 also be designed to allow for integration of data extraction approaches (components) from other research groups, thus 21 enabling end users to choose from a wide variety of advanced data extraction methodologies within one unified and 22 intuitive software environment. In our third aim, we will develop new protocols to standardize the inputs and outputs 23 for data extraction components. The resulting interface, which will enable seamless integration of third party extraction 24 components into the workbench, will also facilitate the incorporation of feedback from users such that extraction 25 components can be continuously improved based on real-time data. 26 Our overarching goal is to translate emerging semi-automated extraction technologies out of the lab and into practical 27 software and to bring to market both the software itself as well as several premium data extraction components. The 28 results of the research conducted for Aims 1-3 represent the first step in this direction and will provide the foundation for 29 future developments. These result will take us one step closer to the dream of creating “living systematic reviews,” which 30 are maintained using automated or semi-automated methods and updated regularly as new evidence becomes available. Project Narrative Systematic review is a formal process used widely in evidence-based medicine and environmental health research to identify, assess, and integrate the primary scientific literature with the goal of answering a specific, targeted question in pursuit of the current scientific consensus. By conducting research and development to build a flexible, extensible software system that automates the crucial and resource-intensive process of extracting key data elements from scientific documents, we will make an important contribution toward ongoing efforts to automate systematic review. These efforts will serve to make systematic reviews both more efficient to produce and less expensive to maintain, a result which will greatly accelerate the process by which scientific consensus is obtained in a variety of medical and health-related disciplines having great public significance.","Research and development of an open, extensible, web-based information extraction workbench for systematic review",9623091,R43ES029901,"['Communities', 'Computer software', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Element', 'Development', 'Discipline', 'Dreams', 'Environment', 'Environmental Health', 'Evidence Based Medicine', 'Feedback', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Individual', 'Internet', 'Intuition', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'One-Step dentin bonding system', 'Online Systems', 'Output', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Source', 'Standardization', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Update', 'Vendor', 'Work', 'artificial neural network', 'base', 'data integration', 'deep learning', 'design', 'evidence base', 'flexibility', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'model design', 'novel', 'research and development', 'software systems', 'systematic review', 'text searching', 'tool']",NIEHS,"SCIOME, LLC",R43,2018,225000,0.0028135672933732253
"SimTK: An Ecosystem for Data and Model Sharing in the Biomechanics Community Physics-based simulations provide a powerful framework for understanding biological form and function. They harmonize heterogeneous experimental data with real-world physical constraints, helping researchers understand biological systems as they engineer novel drugs, new diagnostics, medical devices, and surgical interventions. The rise in new sensors and simulation tools is generating an increasing amount of data, but this data is often inaccessible, preventing reuse and limiting scientific progress. In 2005, we launched SimTK, a website to develop and share biosimulation tools, models, and data, to address these issues. SimTK now supports 62,000+ researchers globally and 950+ projects. Members use it to meet their grants’ data sharing responsibilities; experiment with new ways of collaborating; and build communities around their datasets and tools. However, challenges remain: many researchers still do not share their digital assets due to the time needed to prepare, document, and maintain those assets, and since SimTK hosts a growing number of diverse digital assets, the site now also faces the challenge of making these assets discoverable and reusable. Thus, we propose a plan to extend SimTK and implement new solutions to promote scientific data sharing and reuse. First, we will maintain the reliable, user-friendly foundation upon which SimTK is built, continuing to provide the excellent support our members expect and supporting the site’s existing features for sharing and building communities. Second, we will implement methods to establish a culture of model and data sharing in the biomechanics community. We will encourage researchers to adopt new habits, making sharing part of their workflow, by enabling the software and systems they use to automatically upload models and data to SimTK via an application programming interface (API) and by recruiting leading researchers in the community to serve as beta testers and role models. Third, we will create tools to easily replicate and extend biomechanics simulations. Containers and cloud computing services allow researchers to capture and share a snapshot of their computing environment, enabling unprecedented fidelity in sharing. We will integrate these technologies into SimTK and provide custom, easy-to-use interfaces to replicate and extend simulation studies. Lastly, we will develop a metadata standard for models and data for the biomechanics community, increasing reusability and discoverability of the rich set of resources shared on SimTK. We will use the new standard on SimTK and fill in the metadata fields automatically using natural language processing and machine learning, minimizing the burden and inaccuracies of manual metadata entry. We will evaluate our success in achieving these aims by tracking the number of assets shared and the frequency they are used as a springboard to new research. These changes will accelerate biomechanics research and provide new tools to increase the reusability and impact of shared resources. By lowering barriers to data sharing in the biosimulation community, SimTK will continue to serve as a model for how to create national infrastructure for scientific subdisciplines. SimTK is a vibrant hub for the development and sharing of simulation software, data, and models of biological structures and processes. SimTK-based resources are being used to design medical devices and drugs, to generate new diagnostics, to create surgical interventions, and to provide insights into biology. The proposed enhancements to SimTK will accelerate progress in the field by lowering barriers to and standardizing data and model sharing, thus 1) increasing the quantity and also, importantly, the quality of resources that researchers share and 2) enabling others to reproduce and build on the wealth of past biomechanics research studies.",SimTK: An Ecosystem for Data and Model Sharing in the Biomechanics Community,9523638,R01GM124443,"['Achievement', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'Biology', 'Biomechanics', 'Biophysics', 'Cloud Computing', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Files', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Documentation', 'Ecosystem', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Explosion', 'Face', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Habits', 'Letters', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Device', 'Medical Device Designs', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physics', 'Process', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Resource Sharing', 'Resources', 'Security', 'Services', 'Site', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Update', 'Work', 'application programming interface', 'base', 'biological systems', 'biomechanical model', 'community building', 'complex biological systems', 'data access', 'data sharing', 'digital', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'insight', 'member', 'new technology', 'novel diagnostics', 'novel therapeutics', 'prevent', 'recruit', 'research study', 'response', 'role model', 'sensor', 'simulation', 'simulation software', 'software systems', 'success', 'tool', 'user-friendly', 'web site']",NIGMS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,478806,-0.0030457709672211094
"Leveraging Twitter to monitor nicotine and tobacco-related cancer communication Patterns in Twitter data have revolutionized understanding of public health events such as influenza outbreaks. While researchers have begun to examine messaging related to substance use on Twitter, this project will strengthen the use of Twitter as an infoveillance tool to more rigorously examine nicotine, tobacco, and cancer- related communication. Twitter is particularly suited to this work because its users are commonly adolescents, young adults, and racial and ethnic minorities, all of whom are at increased risk for nicotine and tobacco product (NTP) use and related health consequences. Additionally, due to the openness of the platform, searches are replicable and transparent, enabling large-scale systematic research. Therefore, our multidisciplinary team of experts in diverse relevant fields—including public health, behavioral science, computational linguistics, computer science, biomedical informatics, and information privacy and security—will build upon our previous research to develop and validate structured algorithms providing automated surveillance of Twitter’s multifaceted and continuously evolving information related to NTPs. First, we will qualitatively assess a stratified random sample of relevant NTP-related tweets for specific coded variables, such as the message’s primary sentiment and other key information of potential value (e.g., whether a message involves buying/selling, policy/law, and cancer-related communication). Tweets will be obtained directly from Twitter using software we developed that leverages a comprehensive list of Twitter-optimized search strings related to NTPs. Second, we will statistically determine what message characteristics (e.g., the presence of certain words, punctuation, and/or structures) are most strongly associated with each of the coded variables for each search string. Using this information, we will create specialized Machine Learning (ML) algorithms based on state-of-the-art methods from Natural Language Processing (NLP) to automatically assess and categorize future Twitter data. Third, we will use this information to provide automatic assessment of current and future streaming data. Time series analyses using seasonal Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Averages (ARIMA) will determine if there are significant changes over time in volume of messaging related to each specific coded variables of interest. Trends will be examined at the daily, weekly, and monthly level, because each of these levels is potentially valuable for intervention. To maximize the translational value of this project, we will partner with public health department stakeholders who are experts in streamlining dissemination of actionable trends data. In summary, this project will substantially advance our understanding of representations of NTPs on social media—as well as our ability to conduct automated surveillance and analysis of this content. This project will result in important and concrete deliverables, including open-source algorithms for future researchers and processes to quickly disseminate actionable data for tailoring community- level interventions. For this project, we gathered a team of public health researchers and computer scientists to leverage the power of Twitter as a novel surveillance tool to better understand communication about nicotine and tobacco products (NTPs) and related messages about cancer and cancer prevention. We will gather a random sample of Twitter messages (“tweets”) related to NTPs and examine them in depth and use this information to create specialized computer algorithms that can automatically categorize future Twitter data. Then, we will examine changes over time related to attitudes towards and interest in NTPs, as well as cancer-related discussion around various NTPs, which will dramatically improve our ability to better understand Twitter as a tool for this type of surveillance.",Leveraging Twitter to monitor nicotine and tobacco-related cancer communication,9503469,R01CA225773,"['Adolescent', 'Affect', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Algorithms', 'Attitude', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Cancer Control', 'Categories', 'Characteristics', 'Cigarette', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational Linguistics', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'County', 'Data', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Electronic cigarette', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Event', 'Food', 'Football game', 'Future', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Individual', 'Influenza A Virus, H1N1 Subtype', 'Intervention', 'Laws', 'Linguistics', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Marketing', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Names', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nicotine', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Policies', 'Privacy', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Public Opinion', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Retrieval', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Security', 'Specificity', 'Stream', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Time Series Analysis', 'Tobacco', 'Tobacco use', 'Tobacco-Related Carcinoma', 'Work', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'cancer prevention', 'computer program', 'computer science', 'computerized tools', 'ethnic minority population', 'geographic difference', 'hookah', 'improved', 'influenza outbreak', 'interest', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'nicotine use', 'novel', 'open source', 'phrases', 'prospective', 'racial and ethnic', 'racial minority', 'social', 'social media', 'software development', 'statistics', 'time use', 'tool', 'trend', 'vaping', 'young adult']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2018,505649,-0.005555288505847998
"Semi-Automating Data Extraction for Systematic Reviews ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Evidence-based medicine (EBM) looks to inform patient care with the totality of available relevant evidence. Systematic reviews are the cornerstone of EBM and are critical to modern healthcare, informing everything from national health policy to bedside decision-making. But conducting systematic reviews is extremely laborious (and hence expensive): producing a single review requires thousands of person-hours. Moreover, the exponential expansion of the biomedical literature base has imposed an unprecedented burden on reviewers, thus multiplying costs. Researchers can no longer keep up with the primary literature, and this hinders the practice of evidence-based care.      The long term aim of this work is to develop computational tools and methods that optimize the practice of EBM. The proposed work thus builds upon our previous successful efforts developing computational approaches that reduce the workload in EBM. More speciﬁcally, we aim to develop tools that semi-automate the laborious task of data extraction - identifying and extracting the information of interest (e.g., trial sample size, interventions and outcomes) from the free-texts of biomedical articles - via novel machine learning methods. Semi-automating this task will drastically reduce reviewer workload, thus enabling the practice of EBM in an age of information overload.      Previous efforts to automate data extraction from articles describing clinical trials have shown promise, but lack the accuracy and scope necessary for real-world use. These approaches have been impeded by the absence of a large corpus of annotated clinical trials, and by the difﬁculty of constructing models to automatically extract all of the variables necessary for synthesis. We describe methodological innovations to overcome these hurdles. First, to train our machine learning models we propose leveraging large existing databases that contain structured information about clinical trials, in lieu of the usual approach of collecting expensive manual annotations. Practically, this means we will be able to exploit a very large `pseudo-annotated' dataset that is an order of magnitude bigger than what has been used in previous efforts, thus substantially improving model performance. Our extensive preliminary work demonstrates the promise and feasibility of this approach. Second, we propose novel machine learning models appropriate for the tasks of article categorization and data extraction for EBM. These models will speciﬁcally be designed to perform extraction of multiple, correlated data elements of interest while simultaneously classifying articles into clinically salient categories useful for EBM.      We will rigorously evaluate the developed methods to assess their practical utility, speciﬁcally y comparing automated extraction accuracy to that achieved by trained systematic reviewers. And to make these methods useful to end-users (systematic reviewers), we will develop and evaluate open-source software and tools, including a web-based extraction tool that integrates our machine learning models to automatically extract information from uploaded articles (PDFs). We will conduct a user study to evaluate the utility and usability of this tool in practice. Public Health Narrative  We propose to develop computational methods and tools that make the practice of evidence-based medicine (EBM) more efﬁcient, speciﬁcally by semi-automating data extraction from the full-texts of articles describing clinical trials. Such tools would drastically reduce the workload currently involved in producing evidence syntheses, ultimately enabling evidence- based care in an era of information overload.",Semi-Automating Data Extraction for Systematic Reviews,9565646,R01LM012086,"['Age', 'Area', 'Beds', 'Caring', 'Categories', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Community Medicine', 'Complement', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Element', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Effectiveness of Interventions', 'Elements', 'Evidence Based Medicine', 'Evidence based practice', 'Exercise', 'Feedback', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Healthcare', 'Hour', 'Human Resources', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention', 'Letters', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Medical', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'National Health Policy', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Population Characteristics', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Sample Size', 'Services', 'Side', 'Software Tools', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'System', 'Text', 'Training', 'Work', 'Workload', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'cost efficient', 'data mining', 'design', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'member', 'novel', 'open source', 'process optimization', 'study characteristics', 'systematic review', 'tool', 'trial design', 'usability', 'web services', 'web-based tool']",NLM,NORTHEASTERN UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,293252,-0.00364210186346585
"Open Health Natural Language Processing Collaboratory Project Summary One of the major barriers in leveraging Electronic Health Record (EHR) data for clinical and translational science is the prevalent use of unstructured or semi-structured clinical narratives for documenting clinical information. Natural Language Processing (NLP), which extracts structured information from narratives, has received great attention and has played a critical role in enabling secondary use of EHRs for clinical and translational research. As demonstrated by large scale efforts such as ACT (Accrual of patients for Clinical Trials), eMERGE, and PCORnet, using EHR data for research rests on the capabilities of a robust data and informatics infrastructure that allows the structuring of clinical narratives and supports the extraction of clinical information for downstream applications. Current successful NLP use cases often require a strong informatics team (with NLP experts) to work with clinicians to supply their domain knowledge and build customized NLP engines iteratively. This requires close collaboration between NLP experts and clinicians, not feasible at institutions with limited informatics support. Additionally, the usability, portability, and generalizability of the NLP systems are still limited, partially due to the lack of access to EHRs across institutions to train the systems. The limited availability of EHR data limits the training available to improve the workforce competence in clinical NLP. We aim to address the above challenges by extending our existing collaboration among multiple CTSA hubs on open health natural language processing (OHNLP) to share distributional information of NLP artifacts (i.e., words, n-grams, phrases, sentences, concept mentions, concepts, and text segments) acquired from real EHRs across multiple institutions. We will leverage the advanced privacy-preserving computing infrastructure of iDASH (integrating Data for Analysis, Anonymization, and SHaring) for privacy- preserving data analysis models and will partner with diverse communities including Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics (OHDSI), Precision Medicine Initiative (PMI), PCORnet, and Rare Diseases Clinical Research Network (RDCRN) to demonstrate the utility of NLP for translational research. This CTSA innovation award RFA provides us with a unique opportunity to address the challenges faced with clinical NLP and through strong partnership with multiple research communities and leadership roles of the research team in clinical NLP, we envision that the successful delivery of this project will broaden the utilization of clinical NLP across the research community. There are four aims planned: i) obtain PHI-suppressed NLP artifacts with retained distribution information across multiple institutions and assess the privacy risk of accessing PHI- suppressed artifacts, ii) generate a synthetic text corpus for exploratory analysis of clinical narratives and assess its utility in NLP tasks leveraging various NLP challenges, iii) develop privacy-preserving computational phenotyping models empowered with NLP, and iv) partner with diverse communities to demonstrate the utility of our project for translational research.

"Semi-structured Information Retrieval in Clinical Text for Cohort Identification DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques have shown promise for extracting data from the free text of electronic health records (EHRs), but studies have consistently found that techniques do not readily generalize across application settings. Unfortunately, most of the focus in applying NLP to real use cases has remained on a paradigm of single, well-defined application settings, so that generalizability to unseen use cases remains implicitly unaddressed. We propose to explicitly account for unseen application settings by adopting an information retrieval (IR) perspective with the objective of patient-level cohort identification. To do so, we introduce layered language models, an IR framework that enables the reuse of NLP-produced artifacts. Our long term goal is to accelerate investigations of patient health and disease by providing robust, user- centric tools that are necessary to process, retrieve, and utilize the free text of EHRs. The main goal of this proposal is to accurately retrieve ad hoc, realistic cohorts from clinical text at Mayo Clinic and OHSU, establishing methods, resources, and evaluation for patient-level IR. We hypothesize that cohort identification can be addressed in a generalizable fashion by a new IR framework: layered language models. We will test this hypothesis through four specific aims. In Aim 1, we will make medical NLP artifacts searchable in our layered language IR framework. This involves storing and indexing the NLP artifacts, as well as using statistical language models to retrieve documents based on text and its associated NLP artifacts. In Aim 2, we deal with the practical setting of ad hoc cohort identification, moving to patient-level (rather than document-level) IR. To accurately handle patient cohorts in which qualifying evidence may be spread over multiple documents, we will develop and implement patient-level retrieval models that account for cross- document relational and temporal combinations of events. In Aim 3, we will construct parallel IR test collections using EHR data from two sites; a diverse set of cohort queries written by multiple people toward various clinical or epidemiological ends; and assessments of which patients are relevant to which queries at both sites. Finally, in Aim 4, we refine and evaluate patient-level layered language IR on the ad hoc cohort identification task, making comparisons across the users, queries, optimization metrics, and institutions. We will draw additional extrinsic comparisons with pre-existing techniques, e.g., for cohorts from the Electronic Medical Records and Genonmics network. The expected outcomes of the proposed work are: (i) An open-source cohort identification tool, usable by clinicians and epidemiologists, that makes principled use of NLP artifacts for unseen queries; ii) A parallel test collection for cohort identification, includig two intra-institutional document collections, diverse test topics and user-produced text queries, and patient-level judgments of relevance to each query; and (iii) Validation of the reusability of medical NLP via the task of retrieving patient cohorts.

Unfortunately, on top of lab tests, medications, and demographic information, there are observations that a physician writes down as text - which are difficult for a computer to understand.

"Using advanced natural language processing to facilitate documentation of meaningful use and quality payment compliance PROJECT SUMMARY The Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services Quality Payment Program is designed to motivate healthcare providers to adhere to best practices in clinical healthcare and patient safety. Unfortunately, extracting quality measures data from the clinical record is burdensome and as such, participation among clinical healthcare providers is suboptimal. Our aim is to develop a system to facilitate automatic extraction of quality data. This will reduce the burden of data collection and help remove the barrier to participation that keeps more providers from participating in the program. The proposed project, titled “Using advanced natural language processing to facilitate documentation of meaningful use and quality payment compliance”, aims to develop novel natural language processing methods to recognize key elements from the clinical notes to enable proper documentation of meaningful use and compliance with quality payment. We envision this to be an effective research partnership that leverages the complementary assets of SaferMD, a small business unit, and the University of Michigan, a non-profit research institution, to develop and evaluate a prototype tool to extract clinical quality measures data, and increase participation in the Quality Payment Program. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed project, titled “Using advanced natural language processing to facilitate documentation of meaningful use and quality payment compliance”, aims to develop novel natural language processing methods to recognize key elements from the clinical notes to enable proper documentation of meaningful use and compliance with quality payment. The project will develop algorithms to identify fields relevant for quality measures and develop tools to extract and analyze these data elements from large sets of radiology reports. Finally, the proposed work will initiate the extracted measures into existing quality service offerings by SaferMD. Successful completion of this project will advance the tools available for CMS clients to achieve higher adherence and compliance to the quality payment initiatives and help public health officials and policy developers advance the meaningful use of electronic health records.",Using advanced natural language processing to facilitate documentation of meaningful use and quality payment compliance,9677579,R41LM013050,"['Address', 'Adherence', 'Algorithms', 'Benchmarking', 'Businesses', 'Characteristics', 'Client', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Element', 'Data Quality', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Documentation', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Elements', 'Experimental Models', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health Personnel', 'Healthcare', 'Human', 'Incentives', 'Institution', 'Label', 'Leadership', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Names', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Policies', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Production', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Role', 'Running', 'Semantics', 'Services', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Telephone', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services', 'Universities', 'Work', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'clinically relevant', 'computerized data processing', 'dashboard', 'deep neural network', 'design', 'improved', 'interest', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'patient safety', 'payment', 'programs', 'prototype', 'success', 'technological innovation', 'tool']",NLM,"SAFERMED, LLC",R41,2018,149953,-0.015677942013271867
"Text Mining Pipeline to Accelerate Systematic Reviews in Evidence-Based Medicine We hypothesize that a flexible, configurable suite of automated informatics tools can reduce significantly the effort needed to generate systematic reviews while maintaining or even improving their quality. To test this hypothesis, we propose: Aim 1. To extend our research on automated RCT tagging to include additional study types and provide public resources. A) Machine learning models will be created that automatically assign probability estimates to three types of observational studies that are widely examined by systematic reviewers. B) The RCT and other taggers will be evaluated prospectively for newly published PubMed articles. C) All PubMed articles will be automatically tagged for RCT, cohort, case-control and cross-sectional studies and annotated in a public dataset linked to a public query interface. Users will also receive tags for articles from non-PubMed data sources on demand. Aim 2. To evaluate the performance and usability of our tools when used by systematic reviewers under field conditions. A) The tools will be customized and integrated to facilitate field evaluation. B) A three-stage evaluation: 1. Retrospective evaluation of Metta and RCT Tagger performance. 2. Real-time “shadowing”. 3. Prospective controlled study. Aim 3. To identify additional clinical trial articles, appearing after a published systematic review was completed, that are relevant to the review topic. Aim 4. To identify publications related to specific ClinicalTrials.gov registered trials. Aim 5. To develop and evaluate new machine learning methods and tools that will facilitate rapid evidence scoping for new systematic review topics. A) Methods will be developed for ranking articles with respect to their relevance to a proposed new systematic review topic. B) A scoping tool will be created that displays articles ranked by predicted relevance, tagged with study design attributes, sample sizes, and Cochrane risk of bias estimates. The proposed studies will advance the automation of early steps in the process of writing systematic reviews, and thereby enhance evidence-based medicine and the incorporation of best practices into clinical care. Project Narrative Systematic reviews are essential for determining which treatments and interventions are safe and effective. At present, systematic reviews are written largely by laborious manual methods.

"Evidence-based Strategy and Tool to Simplify Text for Patients and Consumers ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Lifespans continue to increase, chronic disease survival rates are drastically improved, and treatments are being discovered for a variety of illnesses. This rapidly changing scenario requires patients to participate in their recovery, understand written information and directions thereby calling upon patients to have increasingly more complex health literacy. However, time availability of practitioners or other resources to explain the required information has not increased to match. As a result, finding efficient means to improving patient health literacy is an increasingly important topic in healthcare. Increased health literacy may promote healthy lifestyle behaviors and increase access to health services by the population. It has been argued that for the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act to be successful, more effort is needed to increase the health literacy of millions of Americans. Similarly, the Healthy People 2020 statement by the Department of Health and Human Services identified improving health literacy (HC/HIT-1) as an important national goal. The broad- long term objectives of this project are to contribute to increasing the health literacy of patients and health information consumers and provide caregivers an evidence-based tool for simplifying text. The most commonly used tool for estimating the difficulty of text is the readability formula. They are not sufficient, however, because there is no evidence to support a connection between their use and decreases in difficulty. This problem is addressed by using modern resources and techniques for discovering traits that make health-related text difficult and developing a tool to guide the simplification of text. . There are four specific aims of this project: 1) Identify differentiating features of easy versus difficult texts, 2) Design a simplification strategy using computer algorithms, 3) Measure the impact of simplification on perceived and actual text difficulty with online participants and a representative community sample, 4) Create free, online software that incorporates proven features algorithmically. Corpus analysis will be conducted to compare easy and difficult texts with each other and discover lexical, grammatical, semantic, and composition and discourse features typical for each. Then, simplification algorithms will be designed and developed relying on rule-based techniques to leverage available resources, e.g., vocabularies, or on machine learning approaches for discovering the best combinations of features for simplification. A representative writer will simplify text by relying on the suggestios provided by an online that tool that uses simplification algorithms. The effect of simplification wll be tested in comprehensive user studies to evaluate the effect on both actual and perceived difficulty. Features successfully shown to decrease text difficulty will be incorporated in an onlie software program designed to reduce text difficulty. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Improving health literacy is an important national goal and necessary trait for a healthy population. Providing understandable information is critical but few tools exist to help write understandable text. We aim to discover features indicative of difficult text, design translation algorithms and create a free, online software tool for rewriting health-related text with demonstrated impact on perceived and actual text difficulty",Evidence-based Strategy and Tool to Simplify Text for Patients and Consumers,9521525,R01LM011975,"['Address', 'Advocate', 'Affect', 'Affordable Care Act', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Arizona', 'Behavior', 'Caregivers', 'Chronic Disease', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Comprehension', 'Computational Linguistics', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer software', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Data Set', 'Education', 'Education Projects', 'Ensure', 'Faculty', 'Feedback', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Promotion', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Health behavior', 'Health education', 'Healthcare', 'Healthy People 2020', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Informatics', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Modernization', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Readability', 'Reader', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Semantics', 'Software Tools', 'Survival Rate', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Translations', 'Underserved Population', 'United States Dept. of Health and Human Services', 'Universities', 'Vocabulary', 'Work', 'Writing', 'base', 'college', 'combat', 'community based participatory research', 'cost effective', 'design', 'evidence base', 'health literacy', 'healthy lifestyle', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'lexical', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'recruit', 'support tools', 'tool', 'trait', 'user-friendly', 'volunteer']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA,R01,2018,356845,-0.018124770981566105
"An Intelligent Concept Agent for Assisting with the Application of Metadata PROJECT ABSTRACT Biomedical investigators are generating increasing amounts of complex and diverse data. This data varies tremendously, from genome sequences through phenotypic measurements and imaging data. If researchers and data scientists can tap into this data effectively, then we can gain insights into disease mechanisms and how to tackle them. However, the main stumbling block is that it is increasingly hard to find and integrate the relevant datasets due to the lack of sufficient metadata. A researcher studying Crohn's disease may miss a crucial dataset on how certain microbial communities affect gut histology due to the lack of descriptive tags on the data. Currently, applying metadata is difficult, time-consuming and error prone due to the vast sea of confusing and overlapping standards for each datatype. Often specialized `data wranglers' are employed to apply metadata, but even these experts are hindered by lack of good tools. Here we propose to develop an intelligent agent that researchers and data wranglers can use to assist them apply metadata. The agent is based around a personalized dashboard of metadata elements that can be collected from multiple specialized portals, as well as sites such as Wikipedia. These elements can be coupled with classifiers that can be used to self-identify datasets to which they may be relevant, making the selection of appropriate vocabularies easier for researchers. We will deploy the system for a number of targeted use cases, including annotation of the National Center for Biomedical Information Bio-Samples repository, and annotation of images within the Figshare repository. Project Narrative Biomedical data is being generated at an increasing rate, and it is becoming increasingly difficult for researchers to be able to locate and effectively operate over this data, which has negative impacts on the rate of new discoveries. One solution is to attach metadata (data about data) onto all information generated in a research project, but application of metadata is currently difficult and time consuming due to the diverse range of standards on offer, typically requiring the expertise of trained data wranglers. Here we propose to develop an intelligent concept assistant that will allow researchers to generate and share sets of metadata elements relevant to their project, and will use machine learning techniques to automatically apply this to data.",An Intelligent Concept Agent for Assisting with the Application of Metadata,9545836,U01HG009453,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Area', 'Categories', 'Classification', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Coupled', 'Crohn&apos', 's disease', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Deposition', 'Disease', 'Distributed Systems', 'Ecosystem', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Fostering', 'Frustration', 'Genome', 'Histology', 'Human Microbiome', 'Image', 'Intelligence', 'Internet', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Logic', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Metadata', 'Ontology', 'Phenotype', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Sampling', 'Sea', 'Site', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Suggestion', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'Vision', 'Vocabulary', 'base', 'dashboard', 'deep learning', 'improved', 'insight', 'microbial community', 'peer', 'prospective', 'repository', 'social', 'tool', 'transcriptomics']",NHGRI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIF-LAWRENC BERKELEY LAB,U01,2018,569784,-0.03349555844102996
"The Center for Predictive Computational Phenotyping-1 Overall DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The biomedical sciences are being radically transformed by advances in our ability to monitor, record, store and integrate information characterizing human biology and health at scales that range from individual molecules to large populations of subjects. This wealth of information has the potential to substantially advance both our understanding of human biology and our ability to improve human health. Perhaps the most central and general approach for exploiting biomedical data is to use methods from machine learning and statistical modeling to infer predictive models. Such models take as input observable data representing some object of interest, and produce as output a prediction about a particular, unobservable property of the object. This approach has proven to be of high value for a wide range of biomedical tasks, but numerous significant challenges remain to be solved in order for the full potential of predictive modeling to be realized.  To address these challenges, we propose to establish The Center for Predictive Computational Phenotyping (CPCP). Our proposed center will focus on a broad range of problems that can be cast as computational phenotyping. Although some phenotypes are easily measured and interpreted, and are available in an accessible format, a wide range of scientifically and clinically important phenotypes do not satisfy these criteria. In such cases, computational phenotyping methods are required either to (i) extract a relevant  phenotype from a complex data source or collection of heterogeneous data sources, (ii) predict clinically  important phenotypes before they are exhibited, or (iii) do both in the same application. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  We will develop innovative new approaches and tools that are able to discover, and make crucial inferences with large data sets that include molecular profiles, medical images, electronic health records, population-level data, and various combinations of these and other data types. These approaches will significantly advance the state of the art in wide range of biological and clinical investigations, such as predicting which patients are most at risk for breast cancer, heart attacks and severe blood clots.",The Center for Predictive Computational Phenotyping-1 Overall,9478117,U54AI117924,"['Address', 'Biological', 'Blood coagulation', 'Breast Cancer Risk Factor', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Exhibits', 'General Population', 'Generations', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Greek', 'Health', 'Human', 'Human Biology', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Monitor', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Organism', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Property', 'Regulatory Element', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Statistical Algorithm', 'Statistical Models', 'Time', 'Training Activity', 'biomedical scientist', 'clinical investigation', 'clinical predictors', 'education research', 'graduate student', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'novel strategies', 'outcome forecast', 'predictive modeling', 'public health relevance', 'success', 'tool', 'treatment planning', 'undergraduate student']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,U54,2018,897471,-0.01935937022395556

"Mozak: Creating an Expert Community to accelerate neuronal reconstruction at scale Project Summary This project aims to leverage the best of both computational and human expertise in neuronal reconstruction towards the goal of accelerating global neuroscience discovery from internationally-sourced imaging data. We propose to create a cloud-based unified platform for converging 3-dimensional images of neurons onto a single analysis platform to (1) train and grow a new expert community of global reconstructors to work across the data from these groups, to (2) generate a community-sourced neuronal reconstruction database of open imaging data that can be incorporated into a 3-dimensional map of neuronal interconnectivity - onto which (3) novel annotations and more complex functional and molecular data can be overlaid. Our approach will evolve with the growing needs of the neuroscience community over time. To do this, in Aim One (Neuronal Reconstruction at Scale), we will test if the newly developed crowd-sourced game-based platform Mozak can develop a collective of new human experts at scale, capable of accelerating the rate of current reconstruction by at least an order of magnitude, at the same time as increasing the robustness, quality and unbiasedness of the final reconstructions. In Aim Two (Robust Multi-Purpose Annotation), we will enhance basic neuronal reconstruction by adding specific semantic annotation— including soma volume and morphological quantification, volumetric analysis, and ongoing features (e.g. dendritic spines, axonal varicosities) requested from the neuroscience community. Experienced and high-ranking members will be given the opportunity to advance through increasingly complex neurons into full arbor brain-wide neuronal projections and multiple clustered groups of neurons in localized circuits. Finally, in Aim 3 (Creation of a Research-Adaptive Data Repository), we aim to develop a database of neuronal images reconstructed using the Mozak interface that will directly serve the general and specific needs of different research groups. Our goal is to make this database dynamically adaptive — as new research questions will invariably bring new needs for additional annotations and cross-referencing with other data modalities. This highquality unbiased processing repository will also be perfectly suited for training sets for automated algorithms, and the generation of a 3-dimensional maps such as Allen Institute for Brain Science (AIBS) common coordinate framework. We expect that the computational reconstruction methods will further improve with the new large corpus of “gold standard” reconstructions. Collectively, the completion of these three aims will create an analysis suite as well as an online community of experts capable of performing in depth analysis of large-scale datasets that will significantly accelerate neuroscience research, enhance machine learning for reconstruction analysis, and create a common platform of baseline neuronal morphology data against which aberrantly functioning neurons can be analyzed. Project Narrative  This project will create a new central nexus point for neuronal reconstruction and semantic annotation (Mozak) that can be used by all research labs via an accessible online portal. We will develop a new cadre of neuronal reconstruction experts that will— in conjunction with automated tools that are enhanced by their work — drastically increase the volume, quality and robustness of neuron reconstructions and annotations. Mozak reconstructions will be shared with existing repositories and will be continually updated and re-annotated based on emerging needs of research - ensuring perpetual relevance, and allowing us to generate a platform to establish the range of “baseline” 3-dimensional readouts of neuronal morphology against which diseased or malfunctioning neurons can be analyzed and understood. 1",Mozak: Creating an Expert Community to accelerate neuronal reconstruction at scale,9594042,R01MH116247,"['3-Dimensional', 'Adopted', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Brain', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Dendritic Spines', 'Disease', 'Ensure', 'Future', 'Gap Junctions', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Guidelines', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging technology', 'Institutes', 'International', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Molecular', 'Morphology', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Process', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Science', 'Semantics', 'Slice', 'Source', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Three-dimensional analysis', 'Time', 'Training', 'Update', 'Variant', 'Varicosity', 'Work', 'base', 'citizen science', 'cloud based', 'crowdsourcing', 'data warehouse', 'experience', 'improved', 'member', 'neuronal cell body', 'novel', 'online community', 'petabyte', 'programs', 'reconstruction', 'repository', 'tool', 'two-dimensional']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2018,661507,-0.012737093354871928

"Extended Methods and Software Development for Health NLP PROJECT SUMMARY There is a deluge of health-related texts in many genres, from the clinical narrative to newswire and social media. These texts are diverse in content, format, and style, and yet they represent complementary facets of biomedical and health knowledge. Natural Language Processing (NLP) holds much promise to extract, understand, and distill valuable information from these overwhelming large and complex streams of data, with the ultimate goal to advance biomedicine and impact the health and wellbeing of patients. There have been a number of success stories in various biomedical NLP applications, but the NLP methods investigated are usually tailored to one specific phenotype and one institution, thus reducing portability and scalability. Moreover, while there has been much work in the processing of clinical texts, other genres of health texts, like narratives and posts authored by health consumers and patients, are lacking solutions to marshal and make sense of the health information they contain. Robust NLP solutions that answer the needs of biomedicine and health in general have not been fully investigated yet. A unified, data-science approach to health NLP enables the exploration of methods and solutions unprecedented up to now.  Our vision is to unravel the information buried in the health narratives by advancing text-processing methods in a unified way across all the genres of texts. The crosscutting theme is the investigation of methods for health NLP (hNLP) made possible by big data, fused with health knowledge. Our proposal moves the field into exploring semi-supervised and fully unsupervised methods, which only succeed when very large amounts of data are leveraged and knowledge is injected into the methods with care. Our hNLP proposal also targets a key challenge of current hNLP research: the lack of shared software. We seek to provide a clearinghouse for software created under this proposal, and as such all developed tools will be disseminated. Starting from the data characteristics of health texts and information needs of stakeholders, we will develop and evaluate methods for information extraction, information understanding. We will translate our research into the publicly available NLP software platform cTAKES, through robust modules for extraction and understanding across all genres of health texts. We will also demonstrate impact of our methods and tools through several use cases, ranging from clinical point of care to public health, to translational and precision medicine, to participatory medicine. Finally, we will disseminate our work through community activities, such as challenges to advance the state of the art in health natural language processing. PROJECT NARRATIVE  There is a deluge of health texts. Natural Language Processing (NLP) holds much promise to unravel valuable information from these large data streams with the goal to advance medicine and the wellbeing of patients. We will advance state-of-the-art NLP by designing robust, scalable methods that leverage health big data, demonstrating relevance on high-impact use cases, and disseminating NLP tools for the research community and public at large.",Extended Methods and Software Development for Health NLP,9421556,R01GM114355,"['Apache', 'Benchmarking', 'Big Data', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Event', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Information Resources', 'Institution', 'International', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Knowledge Extraction', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Marshal', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Names', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Ontology', 'Patients', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Phenotype', 'Philosophy', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Semantics', 'Solid', 'Standardization', 'Stream', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Terminology', 'Text', 'Translating', 'Translational Research', 'Vision', 'Work', 'commercialization', 'design', 'health knowledge', 'improved', 'information organization', 'method development', 'novel', 'point of care', 'portability', 'precision medicine', 'programs', 'social media', 'software development', 'success', 'syntax', 'tool', 'translational medicine']",NIGMS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2018,793522,-0.00334288139093422
"Exploring the evolving relationship between tobacco, marijuana and e-cigarettes Abstract The relationship between marijuana, tobacco, and e-cigarettes is both rapidly changing and poorly understood, particularly in the light of recent federal and state-level regulatory changes governing the availability of e- cigarettes and marijuana products (respectively). In order to understand this changing landscape we need new, ﬂexible, and responsive research methods capable of rapidly providing insights into product initiation patterns, use patterns, and cessation strategies.

"Development of an Open-Source and Data-Driven Modeling Platform to Monitor and Forecast Disease Activity PROJECT SUMMARY Reliable and real-time municipality-level predictive modeling and forecasts of infectious disease activity have the potential to transform the way public health decision-makers design interventions such as information campaigns, preemptive/reactive vaccinations, and vector control, in the presence of health threats across the world. While the links between disease activity and factors such as: human mobility, climate and environmental factors, socio-economic determinants, and social media activity have long been known in the epidemic literature, few efforts have focused on the evident need of developing an open-source platform capable of leveraging multiple data sources, factors, and disparate modeling methodologies, across a large and heterogeneous nation to monitor and forecast disease transmission, over four geographic scales (nation, state, city, and municipal). The overall goal of this project is to develop such a platform. Our long-term goal is to investigate effective ways to incorporate the findings from multiple disparate studies on disease dynamics around the globe with local and global factors such as weather conditions, socio- economic status, satellite imagery and online human behavior, to develop an operational, robust, and real- time data-driven disease forecasting platform. The objective of this grant is to leverage the expertise of three complementary scientific research teams and a wealth of information from a diverse array of data sources to build a modeling platform capable of combining information to produce real-time short term disease forecasts at the local level. As part of this, we will evaluate the predictive power of disparate data streams and modeling approaches to monitor and forecast disease at multiple geographic scales--nation, state, city, and municipality--using Brazil as a test case. Additionally, we will use machine learning and mechanistic models to understand disease dynamics at multiple spatial scales, across a heterogeneous country such as Brazil. Our specific aims will (1) Assess the utility of individual data streams and modeling techniques for disease forecasting; (2) Fuse modeling techniques and data streams to improve accuracy and robustness at the four spatial scales; (3) Characterize the basic computational infrastructure necessary to build an operational disease forecasting platform; and (4) Validate our approach in a real-world setting. This contribution is significant because It will advance our scientific knowledge on the accuracy and limitations of disparate data streams and multiple modeling approaches when used to forecast disease transmission. Our efforts will help produce operational and systematic disease forecasts at a local level (city- and municipality-level). Moreover, we aim at building a new open-source computational platform for the epidemiological community to use as a knowledge discovery tool. Finally, we aim at developing this platform under the guidance of a Subject Matter Expert (SME) panel comprising of WHO, CDC, academics, and local and federal stakeholders within Brazil. The proposed approach is innovative because few efforts have focused on developing an open-source computational platform capable of combining disparate data sources and drivers, across a heterogeneous and large nation, into multiple modeling approaches to monitor and forecast disease transmission, over multiple geographic scales.. In addition, we propose to investigate how to best combine modeling approaches that have, to this date, been developed and interpreted independently, namely, traditional epidemiological mechanistic models and novel machine-learning predictive models, in order to produce accurate and robust real-time disease activity estimates and forecasts. Project Narrative The proposed research is of crucial importance to public health surveillance and preparedness communities because it seeks to identify effective ways to utilize previously disconnected results, that have pointed out links between disease spread and factors such as socio-economic status, local weather conditions, human mobility, social media activity, to build an open-source and data driven, modeling platform capable of extracting and disseminating information from disparate data sources, and complementary modeling approaches, to (1) Evaluate the predictive power of disparate data streams and modeling approaches to monitor and forecast disease at multiple geographic scales: nation, state, city, and municipality; (2) Fuse complementary modeling approaches that have been developed independently and oftentimes not used in conjunction; (3) produce real- time and short term forecasts of disease activity in multiple geographic scales across a heterogeneous and large nation like Brazil.",Development of an Open-Source and Data-Driven Modeling Platform to Monitor and Forecast Disease Activity,9639469,R01GM130668,"['Area', 'Assimilations', 'Beds', 'Behavior', 'Brazil', 'Burn injury', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Cities', 'Climate', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Dengue', 'Developing Countries', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Economics', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemic', 'Epidemiology', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'High Performance Computing', 'Human', 'Imagery', 'Individual', 'Influenza', 'Influenza B Virus', 'Institution', 'Internet', 'Knowledge', 'Knowledge Discovery', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Municipalities', 'Population Surveillance', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Readiness', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Stream', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Vaccination', 'Vector-transmitted infectious disease', 'Water', 'Weather', 'Work', 'Zika Virus', 'base', 'chikungunya', 'climate variability', 'computer infrastructure', 'digital', 'disease transmission', 'experience', 'flu', 'genomic data', 'improved', 'innovation', 'mathematical methods', 'novel', 'open data', 'open source', 'pathogen', 'predictive modeling', 'social', 'social media', 'socioeconomics', 'spreading factor', 'therapy design', 'time use', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'trend', 'vector', 'vector control']",NIGMS,BOSTON CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2018,407175,-0.0410086710836733
"An Informatics Framework for Discovery and Ascertainment of Drug-Supplement Interactions Most U.S. adults (68%) take dietary supplements (DS) and there is increasing evidence of drug-supplement interactions (DSIs); our ability to readily identify interactions between DS with prescription medications is currently very limited. To optimize the safe use of DS, there remains a critical and unmet need for informatics methods to detect DSIs. Our rationale is that an innovative informatics framework to discover potential DSIs from the large scale of biomedical literature will enable a new line of research for targeted DSI validation and will also significantly narrow the range of DSIs that must be further explored. Our long-term goal is to use informatics approaches to enhance DSI clinical research and translate its findings to clinical practice ultimately via clinical decision support systems. The objective of this application is to develop an informatics framework to enable the discovery of DSIs by creating a DS terminology and mining scientific evidence from the biomedical literature. Towards these objectives, we propose the following specific aims: (1) Compile a comprehensive DS terminology using online resources; and (2) Discover potential DSIs from the biomedical literature. The successful accomplishment of this project will deliver a novel informatics paradigm and resources for identifying most clinically significant DSI signals and their biological mechanisms. This information is critical to subsequent efforts aimed at improving patient safety and efficacy of therapeutic interventions. The results from this study are imperative in order to achieve the ultimate goal of reducing an individual’s risk of potential DSIs.

"Academy of Aphasia Research and Training Symposium PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The annual Academy of Aphasia meeting is the premier conference for researchers in the field of language processing and aphasia. Since the first meeting in 1963, this international meeting has brought together an interdisciplinary group of linguists, psychologists, neurologists, and speech-language pathologists to discuss the latest research in the field of aphasia, including theoretical, clinical, and rehabilitation aspects of this language disorder. The topics at the conference range widely but almost always cover all aspects of language processing including phonological processing, lexical-semantic processing, syntactic processing, orthographic processing, bilingualism, computational modeling, non-invasive and invasive brain imaging, language recovery, neuroplasticity, and rehabilitation. In this proposal, we aim to include two special initiatives that will take place during the annual academy of aphasia conference. The first initiative involves a formal mentoring program for young investigators entering the field of aphasia research. In this program, selected student/post-doctoral fellows from interdisciplinary backgrounds who are first authors at the conference are paired with a mentor. This mentor will provide specific feedback about the fellow's presentation and general mentorship to the fellow about research and academic careers. This program is currently occurring as part of the conference and has been growing at the annual meeting with very positive feedback. Additionally, a formal mentoring meeting will allow a structured format for discussion about a career in aphasia research. The second initiative will be a three hour seminar (New Frontiers in Aphasia Research) that covers the background and approach of a state of the art methodology (e.g., fNIRS, graph theoretical metric, machine learning approaches) that has an application to the study of aphasia. These workshops will be recorded and, consequently, uploaded to the academy website/youtube channel for dissemination to aphasia researchers and the public. This workshop will allow conference attendees to understand the conceptual and methodological aspect of a particular scientific approach that can be implemented in their study of aphasia. Given the highly interdisciplinary nature of aphasia research, these workshops will bridge the communication between aphasia researchers and scientists and experts who have developed new approaches to study the brain. This meeting already allows a valuable opportunity for cross-pollination of research ideas and will now provide a platform for the training the next generation of scientists interested in pursuing the nature of aphasia and associated language disorders in adults. PROJECT NARRATIVE Approximately 100,000 individuals suffer from aphasia each year. The academy of aphasia is an organization of clinicians, scientists and practitioners who study this communication disorder and develop interventions to treat individuals with aphasia. The members comprise a very interdisciplinary group of linguists, psychologists, speech and language clinicians, neurologists and neuroscientists. The annual academy of aphasia meeting is the premier venue to share state of the art methodologies for application in the study of aphasia to improve the research in the development of diagnosis and treatment approaches to alleviate aphasia. This conference is also the ideal venue to educate and train the next generation of aphasia researchers who are well trained from a theoretical, technical and clinical standpoint and are committed to expand the impact of research in aphasia.",Academy of Aphasia Research and Training Symposium,9612777,R13DC017375,"['Academy', 'Adult', 'Aphasia', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Chicago', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Committee Membership', 'Communication', 'Communication impairment', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Discipline', 'Educational workshop', 'Feedback', 'Fellowship', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Governing Board', 'Grant', 'Graph', 'Hour', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Language', 'Language Disorders', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Linguistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuscripts', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders', 'Nature', 'Neurologic', 'Neurologist', 'Neuronal Plasticity', 'Neurosciences', 'Orthography', 'Outcome', 'Pathologist', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Production', 'Psychologist', 'Psychology', 'Publishing', 'Reading', 'Recovery', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Support', 'Research Training', 'Rest', 'Retrieval', 'Scientist', 'Secure', 'Speech', 'Speech Pathologist', 'Speech Perception', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'Students', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training and Education', 'Transcranial magnetic stimulation', 'Travel', 'Videotape', 'Work', 'Writing', 'base', 'bilingualism', 'career', 'career networking', 'experience', 'frontier', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'interest', 'language processing', 'lexical', 'meetings', 'member', 'neuroimaging', 'next generation', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'outcome forecast', 'phonology', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'semantic processing', 'success', 'symposium', 'syntax', 'tenure track', 'web site']",NIDCD,BOSTON UNIVERSITY (CHARLES RIVER CAMPUS),R13,2018,39939,-0.03879690426050741
"Sci-Score, a tool suite to support Rigor and Transparency NIH and Journal Guidelines Project​ ​Summary While standards in reporting of scientific methods are absolutely critical to producing reproducible science, meeting such standards is tedious and difficult. Checklists and instructions are tough to follow often resulting in low and inconsistent compliance. Scientific journals and societies as well as the National Institutes of Health are now actively proposing general guidelines to address reproducibility issues, particularly in the reporting of methods,​ ​but​ ​the​ ​trickier​ ​part​ ​is​ ​to​ ​train​ ​the​ ​biomedical​ ​community​ ​to​ ​use​ ​these​ ​standards​ ​to​ ​effectively. To support new standards in methods reporting, especially the RRID standard for Rigor and Transparency of Key Biological Resources, we propose to build Sci-Score a text mining based tool suite to help authors meet the standard. Sci-Score will provide an automated check on compliance with the RRID standard already implemented by over 100 journals including Cell, Journal of Neuroscience, and eLife and other Rigor and transparency standards put forward by the NIH. The innovation behind Sci-score is the provision of a score, which can be obtained by individual investigators or journals. This score reflects an aspect of quality of methods reporting. We posit that the score will serve as a tool that investigators can use to compete with themselves​ ​and​ ​each​ ​other,​ ​the​ ​way​ ​they​ ​currently​ ​compete​ ​on​ ​metrics​ ​of​ ​popularity,​ ​i.e.,​ ​the​ ​H-index. In Phase I of this project and before, our group has successfully developed a text mining algorithm that can detect antibodies, cell lines, organisms and digital resources (all 4 RRID types) and has created a preliminary score. We propose to extend this approach to all research inputs, like chemicals and plasmids that are requested as part of Cell press’ STAR Methods (http://www.cell.com/star-methods)​. We also propose to build a set of algorithms to detect whether authors discuss the major sources of irreproducibility outlined by NIH, including investigator blinding, proper randomization and sufficient reporting of sex and other biological variables. Resource identification along with other quality metrics will be used to score the quality of scientific methods section text. If successful, the tool could be used by editors, reviewers, and investigators to improve the​ ​quality​ ​of​ ​the​ ​scientific​ ​paper. Our Phase II specific aims include 1) enhancing and hardening the core natural language processing pipelines to recognize a broader range of sentences in near real time; 2) building a set of modular tools that will be provided for different groups of users to take advantage of the text mining capability we develop in aim 1. At the end of Phase II, we should have a commercially viable product that will be able to be licensed to serve the needs​ ​of​ ​the​ ​publishers​ ​and​ ​the​ ​broader​ ​research​ ​community.

"Tracking Evolution and Spread of Viral Genomes by Geospatial Observation Error ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Tracking evolutionary changes in viral genomes and their spread often requires the use of data deposited in public databases such as GenBank, the Influenza Research Database (IRD), or the Virus Pathogen Resource (ViPR). GenBank provides an abundance of available viral sequence data for phylogeography. Sequences and their metadata can be downloaded and imported into software applications that generate phylogeographic trees and models for surveillance. IRD and ViPR are NIH/NIAID funded programs that import data from GenBank but contain additional data sources, visualization, and search tools for their users. Tracking evolutionary changes and spread also requires the geospatial assignment of taxa, which is often obtained from GenBank metadata. Unfortunately, geospatial metadata such as host location is often uncertain in GenBank entries, with only 36% containing a precise location such as a county, town, or region within a state. For example, information such as China or USA was indicated instead of Beijing or Bedford, NH. While town or county might be included in the corresponding journal article, this valuable information is not available for immediate use unless it is extracted and then linked back to the appropriate sequence. The goal of our work is to enable health agencies and other researchers to automatically generate phylogeographic models that incorporate enhanced geospatial data for better estimates of virus spread. This proposal focuses on developing and applying information extraction and statistical phylogeography approaches to enhance models that track evolutionary changes in viral genomes and their spread. We propose a framework that uses natural language processing (NLP) for the automatic extraction of relevant geospatial data from the literature, and assigns a confidence between such geospatial mentions and the GenBank record. We will then use these locations and the estimates as observation error in the creation of phylogeographic models of zoonotic virus spread. We hypothesize that a combined NLP-phylogeography infrastructure that produces models that include observation error in the geospatial assignment of taxa will be closer to a gold standard than phylogeographic models that do not include them. Our research will extend phylogeography and zoonotic surveillance by: creating a NLP infrastructure that will improve the level of detail of geospatial data for phylogeography of zoonotic viruses (Aim 1), develop phylogeographic models using the estimates from Aim 1 as observation error (Aim 2), and evaluating our approach by comparing the models it produces to models that do not account for observation error in the geospatial assignment of taxa (Aim 3). We will allow users to generate enhanced models and view results on a web portal accessible via a LinkOut feature from GenBank, IRD, and ViPR. The addition of more precise geospatial information in building such models could enable health agencies to better target areas that represent the greatest public health risk.

"Metadata applications on informed content to facilitate biorepository data regulation and sharing ABSTRACT Biorepositories are critical to enabling modern molecular-based research that will drive the development of a new generation of targeted diagnostics and therapies as well as personalized medicine to improve clinical outcomes for patients. The use of data and biospecimen resources collected during research are constrained by the informed consent that research participants give to research teams, research protocol documents, and the constraints imposed on the research by the IRB itself. Currently there is a lack of a common model of consent that limits how easily data (and research specimens) from multiple research projects, or multiple institutions can be combined for large-scale retrospective studies. Manually examining and reconciling potentially millions of informed consent forms from different biobanks becomes an expensive and possibly irreconcilable problem. The application of suitable metadata in support of the complex set of regulatory, legal, privacy and security requirement processes and information flows involved in regulated research is a field in an early phases of development. The complicated legal and technical requirements involved in the processes challenge our ability to effectively build information systems that support sharing of research data, specimens and other research artifacts at scale. Additionally, much of the regulatory processes involved in research are still based on paper-based workflows. We posit that by developing suitable machine-based metadata representation of regulatory processes focusing on informed consents and the associated documents would enhance the ability of regulatory bodies such as Institutional Review Boards to 1) review proposals in a more streamlined fashion, 2) have the potential to provide a more comprehensive understanding of risk along multiple axes, and 3) provide a formal and computable basis for data sharing and information release policies. More specifically we will focus on three specific aims: 1) Develop standard-conforming metadata representations of informed consent; 2) Develop NLP-based automatic annotation tool for informed consent documents; and 3) Evaluate the metadata-ontology-based approach for semantically representing the domain and demonstrate its capacity for answering competency questions. Our proposed approach is novel for the following reasons: 1) it provides the first metadata ontology, to the best of our knowledge, to represent the informed consent space while considering the US common rules; 2) it combines natural language processing technologies with ontology-based approaches for semantic annotation as well as ontology enrichment; and 3) it engages stakeholders in the ontology development and evaluation process and uses competency questions to verify the coverage of the ontology.

"Secondary use of EMRs for surgical complication surveillance DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Recent statistics indicate that worldwide almost 234 million major surgical procedures are performed each year with the rates of major postsurgical complications (PSCs) range from 3% to 16% and rates of permanent disability or death range from 0.4% to 0.8%. Early detection of PSCs is crucial since early intervention could be lifesaving. Meanwhile, with the rapid adoption of electronic medical records (EMRs) and the accelerated advance of health information technology (HIT), detection of PSCs by applying advanced analytics on EMRs makes it possible for near real-time PSC surveillance. We have developed a rule-based PSC surveillance system to detect most frequent colorectal PSCs near real-time from EMRs where a pattern-based natural language processing (NLP) engine is used to extract PSC related information from text and a set of expert rules is used to detect PSCs. Two challenges are identified. First, it is very challenging to integrate a diverse set of relevant data using expert rules. In the past, probabilistic approaches such as Bayesian Network which can integrate a diverse set of relevant data have become popular in clinical decision support and disease outbreak surveillance. Can we implement probabilistic approaches for PSC surveillance? Secondly, a large portion of the clinical information is embedded in text and it has been quite expensive to manually obtain the patterns used in the NLP system since it requires team effort of subject matter experts and NLP specialists. In the research field, statistical NLP has been quite popular. However, decision making in clinical practice demands tractable evidences while models for statistical NLP are not human interpretable. Can we incorporate statistical NLP to accelerate the NLP knowledge engineering process? We hypothesize that a probabilistic approach for PSC surveillance can be developed for improved case detection which can integrate multiple evidences from structured as well as unstructured EMR data. We also hypothesize that empirical NLP can accelerate the knowledge engineering process needed for building pattern- based NLP systems used in practice. Specific aims include: i) developing and evaluating an innovative Bayesian PSC surveillance system that incorporates evidences from both structured and unstructured EMR data; and ii) incorporating and evaluating statistical NLP in accelerating the NLP knowledge engineering process of pattern-based NLP for PSC surveillance. Given the significance of HIT, our study results will advance the science in developing practical NLP systems that can be translated to meet NLP needs in health care practice. Additionally, given the significance of PSCs, our study results will address significant patient safety and quality issues in surgical practice. Utilizing automated methods to detect postsurgical complications will enable early detection of complications compared to other methods and therefore have great potential of improving patient safety and health care quality while reducing cost. The results could lead to large scale PSC surveillance and quality improvement towards safer and better health care. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Rapid growth in the clinical implementation of large electronic medical records (EMRs) has led to unprecedented opportunities to use EMRs for clinical practice and research. We explore the use of EMRs for near real-time postsurgical complication surveillance with the aim of improving health care quality and reducing health care cost through enhanced analytics towards surgical excellence.",Secondary use of EMRs for surgical complication surveillance,9476980,R01EB019403,"['Abscess', 'Address', 'Adoption', 'Age', 'Anesthetics', 'Area', 'Bayesian Method', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Colorectal', 'Complex', 'Complication', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Educational workshop', 'Engineering', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'Healthcare', 'Hemorrhage', 'Human', 'Ileus', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Manuals', 'Methods', 'Minor', 'Motivation', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Nutritional', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perioperative', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Process', 'Registries', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk Factors', 'Science', 'Severities', 'Specialist', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Surgeon', 'Surgical complication', 'System', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Uncertainty', 'Work', 'Wound Infection', 'base', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical implementation', 'clinical practice', 'computer based statistical methods', 'cost', 'disability', 'health care quality', 'health information technology', 'improved', 'innovation', 'patient safety', 'public health relevance', 'rapid growth', 'statistics']",NIBIB,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,R01,2018,300000,-0.03189371190992208

"How Does Automated Record Linkage Affect Inferences about Population Health? ABSTRACT  Our broad research objective is to create the Longitudinal Intergenerational Family Electronic Micro-dataset (LIFE-M) spanning the late 19th and 20th century United States. Using automated record linkage technology, the LIFE-M project combines millions of vital records to reconstruct how and why individuals' health has changed across time. This multi-generational, longitudinal micro-database aims to transform research on health and longevity, on childbearing and family structure, and on the long-run health effects of early-life circumstances and exposures.  In creating LIFE-M, however, we have encountered serious deficits in knowledge about the performance of automated record linkage technology. The proposed project seeks to evaluate the performance of the most popular and cutting-edge automated linking techniques for the purposes of creating longitudinal health data. Our specific aims are to (1) produce systematic evidence regarding the performance of automated record linking algorithms in terms of match rates, representativeness of the linked sample, erroneous matches (type I errors), and systematic measurement error; (2) examine how phonetic name-cleaning methods affect quality metrics; and (3) examine how record quality metrics vary for different underrepresented subgroups (including women, racial/ethnic minorities, and immigrants) and to determine how linking methods affect representativeness and inferences. To achieve these aims, we have developed new partnerships with record linking experts allowing us to incorporate the most cutting-edge methods in record linking. We will also rely on new “ground truth” generated by LIFE-M project's independent, double-blind human review process.  This project will contribute significantly to existing knowledge about the use of automated linking methods for creating longitudinal and intergenerational health data. It will also increase knowledge about potential sources of bias in health studies. Both contributions should greatly enhance the quality of descriptive and causal inferences about population health and aging and disparities in these outcomes. PROJECT NARRATIVE  This project contributes to public health knowledge by advancing record linking methodology for creating longitudinal and intergenerational health datasets. It will also increase knowledge about potential sources of bias in public health and aging studies using linked records.

"COINSTAC: decentralized, scalable analysis of loosely coupled data Project Summary/Abstract  The brain imaging community is greatly benefiting from extensive data sharing efforts currently underway5,10. However, there is a significant gap in existing strategies which focus on anonymized, post-hoc sharing of either 1) full raw or preprocessed data [in the case of open studies] or 2) manually computed summary measures [such as hippocampal volume11, in the case of closed (or not yet shared) studies] which we propose to address. Current approaches to data sharing often include significant logistical hurdles both for the investigator sharing the data as well as for the individual requesting the data (e.g. often times multiple data sharing agreements and approvals are required from US and international institutions). This needs to change, so that the scientific community be- comes a venue where data can be collected, managed, widely shared and analyzed while also opening up access to the (many) data sets which are not currently available (see recent overview on this from our group2). The large amount of existing data requires an approach that can analyze data in a distributed way while also leaving control of the source data with the individual investigator; this motivates a dynamic, decentralized way of approaching large scale analyses. We are proposing a peer-to-peer system called the Collaborative Informat- ics and Neuroimaging Suite Toolkit for Anonymous Computation (COINSTAC). The system will provide an inde- pendent, open, no-strings-attached tool that performs analysis on datasets distributed across different locations. Thus, the step of actually aggregating data can be avoided, while the strength of large-scale analyses can be retained. To achieve this, in Aim 1, the uniform data interfaces that we propose will make it easy to share and cooperate. Robust and novel quality assurance and replicability tools will also be incorporated. Collaboration and data sharing will be done through forming temporary (need and project-based) virtual clusters of studies performing automatically generated local computation on their respective data and aggregating statistics in global inference procedures. The communal organization will provide a continuous stream of large scale projects that can be formed and completed without the need of creating new rigid organizations or project-oriented stor- age vaults. In Aim 2, we develop, evaluate, and incorporate privacy-preserving algorithms to ensure that the data used are not re-identifiable even with multiple re-uses. We also will develop advanced distributed and pri- vacy preserving approaches for several key multivariate families of algorithms (general linear model, matrix fac- torization [e.g. independent component analysis], classification) to estimate intrinsic networks and perform data fusion. Finally, in Aim 3, we will demonstrate the utility of this approach in a proof of concept study through distributed analyses of substance abuse datasets across national and international venues with multiple imaging modalities. 4 Project Narrative  Hundreds of millions of dollars have been spent to collect human neuroimaging data for clinical and research purposes, many of which don’t have data sharing agreements or collect sensitive data which are not easily shared, such as genetics. Opportunities for large scale aggregated analyses to infer health-relevant facts create new challenges in protecting the privacy of individuals' data. Open sharing of raw data, though desirable from the research perspective, and growing rapidly, is not a good solution for a large number of datasets which have additional privacy risks or IRB concerns. The COINSTAC solution we are proposing will capture this ‘missing data’ and allow for pooling of both open and ‘closed’ repositories by developing privacy preserving versions of widely-used algorithms and incorporating within an easy-to-use platform which enables distributed computation. In addition, COINSTAC will accelerate research on both open and closed data by offering a distributed compu- tational solution for a large toolkit of widely used algorithms. 3","COINSTAC: decentralized, scalable analysis of loosely coupled data",9717051,R01DA040487,"['AODD relapse', 'Accounting', 'Address', 'Agreement', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Algorithms', 'Attention', 'Brain imaging', 'Classification', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Consent Forms', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Aggregation', 'Data Set', 'Decentralization', 'Development', 'Ensure', 'Family', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Markers', 'Health', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Institution', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'International', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Letters', 'Linear Models', 'Location', 'Logistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Movement', 'Paper', 'Plant Roots', 'Poaceae', 'Population', 'Privacy', 'Privatization', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Science', 'Site', 'Source', 'Stream', 'Substance abuse problem', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'base', 'commune', 'computer framework', 'computing resources', 'connectome', 'cost', 'data sharing', 'distributed data', 'flexibility', 'imaging genetics', 'imaging modality', 'independent component analysis', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'open data', 'peer', 'quality assurance', 'repository', 'statistics', 'tool', 'virtual']",NIDA,THE MIND RESEARCH NETWORK,R01,2018,282320,0.010727014475201661
"Clinic Interactions of a Brain-Computer Interface for Communication ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The promise of brain-computer interfaces (BCI) for communication is becoming a reality for individuals with severe speech and physical impairments (SSPI) who cannot rely on speech or writing to express themselves. While the majority of research efforts are devoted to technology development to address problems of stability, reliability and/or classification, clinical and behavioral challenges are becoming more apparent as individuals with SSPI and their family/care teams assess the systems during novice or long-term trials. The objective of the RSVP Keyboard(tm) BCI translational research team is to address the clinical challenges raised during functional BCI use with innovative engineering design, thereby enhancing the potential of this novel assistive technology. Four specific aims are proposed: (1) to develop a BCI Communication Application Suite (BCI-CAS) that offers a set of language modules to people with SSPI that can meet their language/literacy skills; (2) to develop improved statistical signal models for personalized feature extraction, artifact/interference handling, and robust, accurate intent evidence extraction from physiologic signals; (3) to develop improved language models and stimulus sequence optimization methods; and (4) to evaluate cognitive variables that affect learning and performance of the BCI-CAS. Five language modules are proposed that rely on a multimodal evidence fusion framework for model-based context-aware optimal intent inference: RSVP Keyboard(tm) generative spelling; RSVP texting; RSVP in-context typing; RSVP in-context icon typing; and binary yes/no responses with SSVEPs. Usability data on the current RSVP Keyboard(tm) and SSVEP system drive all proposed aims. Users select a language module, and the BCI system optimizes performance for each individual based on user adaptation, intent inference, and personalized language modeling. A unique simulation function drives individualization of system parameters. The robustness of the BCI customization efforts are evaluated continually by adults with SSPI and neurotypical controls in an iterative fashion. The effect of three intervention programs that address the cognitive construct of attention (process-specific attention training, mindfulness meditation training and novel stimulus presentations) will be implemented through hypothesis-driven single subject designs. Thirty participants, ages 21 years and older with SSPI will be included in home-based interventions. By measuring information transfer rate (ITR), user satisfaction, and intrinsic user factors, we will identify learning strategies that influence BCI sill acquisition and performance for adults with neurodegenerative or neurodevelopmental conditions. The translational teams include (1) signal processing (Erdogmus); (2) clinical neurophysiology (Oken); (3) natural language processing (Bedrick/Gorman); and (4) assistive technology (Fried-Oken). We continue to rely on a solid Bayesian foundation and theoretical frameworks: ICF disability classification (WHO, 2001), the AAC model of participation (Beukelman & Mirenda, 2013) and the Matching Person to Technology Model (Scherer, 2002). PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The populations of patients with severe speech and physical impairments secondary to neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative diseases are increasing as medical technologies advance and successfully support life. These individuals with limited to no movement could potentially contribute to their medical decision making, informed consent, and daily caregiving if they had faster, more reliable means to interface with communication systems. The BCI Communication Applications Suite is a hybrid brain-computer interface that is an innovative technological advance so that patients and their families can participate in daily activities and advocate for improvements in standard clinical care.

"A Multigenerational Longitudinal Panel for Aging Research Summary/Abstract This project will construct a Multigenerational Longitudinal Panel (IPUMS-MLP) of unprecedented scale and scope. Using cutting-edge automatic record linkage technology and drawing on complete count U.S. census data available from IPUMS for the period 1850 to 1940, the project will construct millions of individual life histories and trace millions of families over multiple generations. This infrastructure will provide the most comprehensive view of long-run changes in life-course dynamics available for any place in the world and will transform our understanding of processes of population aging. The work will require significant innovation and new technical infrastructure to accommodate the massive scale of the database. These data will allow investigators to directly observe changes in aging processes and life-course transitions during the period in which U.S. society was being transformed by industrialization, urbanization, immigration, demographic transition, and economic collapse. Investigators will be able to follow individuals over time to evaluate the impact of early-life conditions on later outcomes, trace life-course transitions into adulthood and old age, and observe family change over multiple generations. IPUMS-MLP will enrich existing aging surveys by providing data on multiple generations of forebears of survey respondents; likewise, it will enrich existing historical databases by enabling them to connect with descendants across multiple generations. Leveraging billions of dollars of federal investments in census data and transactional records from a variety of administrative sources, this project is a highly cost-effective use of scarce resources to develop shared infrastructure for research, education, and policy-making on health and aging. Project Narrative The proposed work is directly relevant to the core mission of the Population and Social Processes branch of NIA: the new data will advance fundamental knowledge about the causes and consequences of changes in health and well-being of the older population and will support research on the effects of public policies, social institutions, and environmental conditions on the health, well-being, and functioning of people, both over the life course and in their later years. For example, the data will enable examinations of the impact of lead exposure to late onset Alzheimer’s disease, the socioeconomic and health effects of early-life income support, intergenerational transmission of health and wellbeing over multiple generations, and the impact of early-life cognitive capacity on later-life health and economic outcomes.",A Multigenerational Longitudinal Panel for Aging Research,9594032,R01AG057679,"['Adult', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Aging-Related Process', 'Algorithms', 'Big Data', 'Censuses', 'Characteristics', 'Communities', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Quality', 'Data Security', 'Databases', 'Demographic Transitions', 'Economics', 'Education', 'Elderly', 'Exposure to', 'Family', 'Family member', 'Future', 'Genealogy', 'Generations', 'Health', 'Household', 'Immigration', 'Income', 'Individual', 'Industrialization', 'Institution', 'Investments', 'Knowledge', 'Late Onset Alzheimer Disease', 'Life', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Military Personnel', 'Mission', 'Names', 'Neighborhoods', 'Older Population', 'Outcome', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Persons', 'Policy Making', 'Population', 'Population Process', 'Process', 'Public Policy', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Support', 'Resources', 'Respondent', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Selection Bias', 'Social Processes', 'Social Security', 'Societies', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Urbanization', 'War', 'Weight', 'Woman', 'Work', 'aging population', 'base', 'cognitive capacity', 'cost effective', 'data integration', 'economic outcome', 'experience', 'health economics', 'improved', 'innovation', 'intergenerational', 'lead exposure', 'learning strategy', 'life history', 'longitudinal dataset', 'novel', 'parallel processing', 'social', 'socioeconomics', 'tool', 'transmission process']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,R01,2018,695826,-0.02434227840371157

This needs to change, so that the scientific community becomes a venue where data can be collected, managed, widely shared and analyzed while also opening up access to the (many) data sets which are not currently available (see recent overview on this from our group2).    The large amount of existing data requires an approach that can analyze data in a distributed way while also leaving control of the source data with the individual investigator; this motivates  dynamic, decentralized way of approaching large scale analyses. We are proposing a peer-to-peer system called the Collaborative Informatics and Neuroimaging Suite Toolkit for Anonymous Computation (COINSTAC). The system will provide an independent, open, no-strings-attached tool that performs analysis on datasets distributed across different locations. Thus, the step of actually aggregating data can be avoided, while the strength of large-scale analyses can be retained. To achieve this, in Aim 1, the uniform data interfaces that we propose will make it easy to share and cooperate. Robust and novel quality assurance and replicability tools will also be incorporated. Collaboration and data sharing will be done through forming temporary (need and project-based) virtual clusters of studies performing automatically generated local computation on their respective data and aggregating statistics in global inference procedures. The communal organization will provide a continuous stream of large scale projects that can be formed and completed without the need of creating new rigid organizations or project-oriented storage vaults. In Aim 2, we develop, evaluate, and incorporate privacy-preserving algorithms to ensure that the data used are not re-identifiable even with multiple re-uses. We also will develop advanced distributed and privacy preserving approaches for several key multivariate families of algorithms (general linear model, matrix factorization [e.g. independent component analysis], classification) to estimate intrinsic networks and perform data fusion. Finally, in Aim 3, we will demonstrate the utility of this approach in a proof of concept study through distributed analyses of substance abuse datasets across national and international venues with multiple imaging modalities. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Hundreds of millions of dollars have been spent to collect human neuroimaging data for clinical and research purposes, many of which don't have data sharing agreements or collect sensitive data which are not easily shared, such as genetics. Opportunities for large scale aggregated analyses to infer health-relevant facts create new challenges in protecting the privacy of individuals' data. Open sharing of raw data, though desirable from the research perspective, and growing rapidly, is not a good solution for a large number of datasets which have additional privacy risks or IRB concerns. The COINSTAC solution we are proposing will capture this 'missing data' and allow for pooling of both open and 'closed' repositories by developing privacy preserving versions of widely-used algorithms and incorporating within an easy-to-use platform which enables distributed computation. In addition, COINSTAC will accelerate research on both open and closed data by offering a distributed computational solution for a large toolkit of widely used algorithms.","COINSTAC: decentralized, scalable analysis of loosely coupled data",9473021,R01DA040487,"['AODD relapse', 'Accounting', 'Address', 'Agreement', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Algorithms', 'Attention', 'Brain imaging', 'Classification', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Consent Forms', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Aggregation', 'Data Set', 'Decentralization', 'Development', 'Ensure', 'Family', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Markers', 'Health', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Institution', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'International', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Letters', 'Linear Models', 'Location', 'Logistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Movement', 'Paper', 'Plant Roots', 'Poaceae', 'Population', 'Privacy', 'Privatization', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Science', 'Site', 'Source', 'Stream', 'Substance abuse problem', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'base', 'commune', 'computer framework', 'computing resources', 'connectome', 'cost', 'data sharing', 'distributed data', 'flexibility', 'imaging genetics', 'imaging modality', 'independent component analysis', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'open data', 'peer', 'public health relevance', 'quality assurance', 'repository', 'statistics', 'tool', 'virtual']",NIDA,THE MIND RESEARCH NETWORK,R01,2018,649098,0.010323173701239172
"Development of a secure, cloud-based platform to improve record linkage & cross-agency collaboration for the public sector: using deep learning & scalable data integrations to combat the opioid crisis Project Summary/Abstract: This SBIR Phase I proposal aims to fund research and development for a new, multitenant secure cloud-based platform specifically tailored to provide local governmental agencies with tools to share datasets and link them accurately, at high quality and low cost. The OpenLattice platform will focus on reducing drug overdoses and making drug treatment less fractured. Individual-level datasets linked across medical providers and law enforcement can support analyses of prescribing pathways and treatment trajectories that precede opioid overdose, entry into treatment, disruption, and recovery. However, linking data at the individual level has proven to be a difficult and resource-intensive endeavor compared to use of aggregate-level data, with issues with deduplication plaguing many institutional databases. With 91 American deaths recorded daily from opioid overdoses and systems of care spread across multiple institutions, the need for greater and high-quality data sharing is undeniable. Our test partner for assessing the efficacy of proposed innovations is the Greater Portland Addiction Collaborative (GPAC) in Maine, a partnership of hospitals, a police department, jail, detox treatment centers and halfway houses already working together to reduce drug overdoses. This proposal aims to demonstrate proof of concept for (i) scaling high-quality data integrations across multiple governmental domains via a standardized entity data model, and (ii) improving record linkage using neural networks. Firstly, OpenLattice is developing an open source ontology and integration scripts to standardize integration of datasets into OpenLattice's database. As the individual customization requirements decline for onboarding customers and integrating new data into the platform, costs will be greatly slashed, removing a significant barrier to data solutions for smaller counties and cities across the country, who have historically faced custom integrations, system updates, data storage fees and add-ons at high cost. The OpenLattice platform also enables use of existing ETL tools and seamless integration with police dispatch systems, emergency medical calls, healthcare records, and online prescription systems across partners who have committed to data sharing and collaboration. Secondly, OpenLattice is developing a new, proprietary algorithm for record linkage that employs a promising but as-yet commercially untested technique: a multilayer perceptron neural network, more commonly known as deep learning. In pilot research, the linking algorithm has already demonstrated success rivaling—and sometimes exceeding—current state of the art linking technologies. In Phase I, OpenLattice will continue to improve ontologies, integration tools, and the deep learning neural network, and test on publicly available datasets with dissimilar data types and formats, with manual confirmation of results. When successful, these innovations will address critical barriers to improving clinical practice in treating opioid addiction by enabling a more comprehensive continuum of care for those in treatment. Project Narrative: Large-scale and coordinated responses to several of the US’s hot-button public health and criminal justice issues, such as the opioid epidemic and mass incarceration, are complicated by poor resource sharing and the US government’s highly fractured jurisdictional authority. This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project aims to develop an efficient, scalable, cloud- based platform for hosting and linking highly sensitive state and local government databases at low cost, using (i) innovative data integration scripts and ontologies that standardize and scale capacity and (ii) technical advances in record de-duplication for linking databases. Data solutions would have tremendous societal impact on understandings of public health and the opioid epidemic by making drug treatment less fractured, saving lives and dramatically broadening contextual information, once data is broken out of silos.","Development of a secure, cloud-based platform to improve record linkage & cross-agency collaboration for the public sector: using deep learning & scalable data integrations to combat the opioid crisis",9622726,R43CE002937,[' '],NCIPC,"OPENLATTICE, INC.",R43,2018,225000,-0.012888056392259158
"Microdata for Analysis of Early Life Conditions, Health, and Population Project Summary This project will enhance and develop the only source of data that provides core information about work, education, income, and migration for the entire U.S. population. This unique resource allows us to observe today's late-life population when they were young. This allows a prospective view of the impact of early-life environments and socioeconomic status on health and well-being in later life. The massive database describes the characteristics of all 133 million persons who resided in the United States in 1940. The data have been available for only a brief period, but are already having a profound impact on scientific research. They are the primary data source for at least 19 sponsored projects, including nine funded by NIH and seven funded by NSF. Through May 2017, 104 investigators had produced 95 papers based on the data, including 22 articles, four books, three PhD dissertations, and 66 working papers. This project will improve the quality and usability of the database by correcting transcription errors; improving the coding, editing, and allocation of key variables; and introducing new data dissemination tools designed to simplify access to the data. The project will undertake three major activities to meet these objectives. 1. Incorporate new verified census information on name, age, sex, family relationship, race, marital status,  birthplace, and residence five years ago. 2. Improve coding, editing, and allocation for geographic variables, migration, occupation, and numerically-  coded variables such as income. 3. Apply new technologies to democratize access to the data through new data access tools and a virtual data  enclave for a restricted version of the data that contains names. This project is a highly cost-effective use of scarce resources to develop shared infrastructure for research, education, and policy-making on health and aging. The proposed improvement of data quality is urgent, and will provide a resource of unprecedented power for understanding the effects of public policies, social institutions, and environmental conditions on the health, well-being, and functioning of people, both over the life course and in their later years.

"Sequencing and Genotyping in Diverse Populations:  Who Wants What Back (and When)? PROJECT SUMMARY The North Coast Conference on Precision Medicine is a national annual mid-sized conference series held in Cleveland, Ohio. The conference series aims to serve as a venue for the continuing education and exchange of scientific ideas related to the rapidly evolving and highly interdisciplinary landscape that is precision medicine research. The topics for each conference coincide with the national conversation and research agenda set by national research programs focused on precision medicine. The 2018 conference is a symposium that will focus on issues related to return of genomic results both in clinical and research settings with an emphasis on diverse populations. The conference will be organized as a traditional format with invited speakers from among national experts for topics ranging from issues returning research results to culturally diverse participants and family members, inclusion of diverse patient and participant populations in the Clinical Sequencing Evidence- Generating Research (CSER) consortium and the Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine (TOPMed) Program, pharmacogenomics-guided dosing and race/ethnicity, strategies used to return results, among others. 2019 and beyond conference topics are being considered from previous symposia attendees and trends in precision medicine research. Odd-numbered year conferences include a workshop component that has previously covered outcome and exposure variable extraction from electronic health records. Future workshop topics being considered include integration of multiple ‘omics, drug response in different populations, pharmacogenomics clinical implementation, precision medicine in cancer, data sharing and informed consent, and the use of apps for recruitment, diagnosis, follow-up, and treatment. Our second major objective of this conference series is the promotion of diversity in the biomedical workforce. It is well-known that the pipeline from training to full professor for women in biomedical research is leaky whereas the pipeline for under-represented minorities is practically non-existent. Drawing from national and local sources, we vet women and under-represented minorities for every invited speaker opportunity, thereby providing valuable career currency and networking opportunities. We will also encourage women and under-represented minorities, particularly at the trainee level, to attend and participate in this conference series to spur interest in pursuing precision medicine research as a career. Overall, the North Coast Conference on Precision Medicine series is a valuable addition to the national conference landscape, and with its unique location and low cost to participants, will serve as an important educational opportunity as precision medicine research accelerates in earnest. PROJECT NARRATIVE The North Coast Conference on Precision Medicine is a yearly fall conference series in Cleveland, Ohio designed as a continuing education forum in the burgeoning area of precision medicine research. The conference brings together national experts on a host of topics ranging from bioethics to bioinformatics to biomedical informatics to speak and lead workshops on timely challenges posed in translating complex genomic and health data into clinical practice. The conference series also serves to promote diversity in the biomedical workforce.

"Longitudinal and Intergenerational Determinants of Aging and Mortality ABSTRACT  Some of the most important open questions in aging relate to the impact of longitudinal and intergenerational factors. But documenting the role of early-life and intergenerational determinants of health and aging is limited by the dearth of large-scale micro-data containing this information. This is especially true for understudied populations such as women and minority groups.  Our research objective is to add critical information on cause of death to the new large-scale data resource, the Longitudinal, Intergenerational Family Electronic Micro-database (LIFE-M). Funded by the National Science Foundation, LIFE-M links millions of vital records (birth, marriage, and death certificates) to decennial censuses over four generations and 120 years for five states. LIFE-M is a representative sample of cohorts aging and dying in the last 25 years of the 20th century and includes crucial early-life and intergenerational information. Enhancing the LIFE-M with cause of death will facilitate path-breaking research on the relationship of longevity and cause of death with demographic, socio-economic, and early-life environmental factors for family networks across four generations.  We will achieve this objective by pursuing the following specific aims:  (1) We will use new “Smart Indexing” technology to digitize and cross-validate hand-written cause-of-death information;  (2) We will link digitized causes of death to the LIFE-M infrastructure and create extensive documentation for  this new variable for public use; and  (3) We will publicly release the cause-of-death variable and documentation with the LIFE-M dataset, meta-  data, and supporting documentation on ICPSR in 2020.  The proposed project will also have broader impacts. In addition to contributing a significant new data resource that can be added to Minnesota Population Center's historical linked censuses and the Census Longitudinal Infrastructure Project (CLIP), this project's methodological innovations in script digitization will enhance on-going and future data infrastructure initiatives. Both contributions promise to transform the research frontier in population health and aging in the United States. PROJECT NARRATIVE  This project contributes to public health knowledge by adding cause-of-death information to a new intergenerational and longitudinal dataset (LIFE-M). These data will allow much more research on the long- term determinants of health and aging, including a deeper understanding the intergenerational and early-life origins of later-life diseases and mortality in today's aging population.",Longitudinal and Intergenerational Determinants of Aging and Mortality,9423915,R01AG057704,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'American', 'Biogenesis', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Birth', 'Birth Records', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cause of Death', 'Censuses', 'Cessation of life', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Complement', 'Cost Savings', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Death Certificates', 'Demography', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Documentation', 'Economics', 'Elderly', 'Enrollment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemiology', 'Exposure to', 'Family', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Hand', 'Handwriting', 'Health', 'Health Campaign', 'Health Resources', 'Health and Retirement Study', 'Hypertension', 'Image', 'Immigrant', 'Income', 'Individual', 'Inequality', 'Infant', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Link', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Maiden Name', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Marriage', 'Medicare/Medicaid', 'Metadata', 'Methodology', 'Michigan', 'Minnesota', 'Minority Groups', 'Names', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Price', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Role', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Sanitation', 'Science', 'Subgroup', 'Surveys', 'Technology', 'Toxin', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Vaccines', 'Water', 'Woman', 'Women&apos', 's Group', 'aging population', 'base', 'cohort', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'data resource', 'early-life nutrition', 'ethnic minority population', 'frontier', 'health knowledge', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'intergenerational', 'longitudinal dataset', 'mortality', 'panel study of income dynamics', 'population health', 'population survey', 'programs', 'racial and ethnic', 'response', 'socioeconomics', 'suicide rate']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2018,325845,-0.012761968065898998
"Washington University School of Medicine Undiagnosed Diseases Network Clinical Site 1.0 PROJECT SUMMARY The scientific premise of this application is that the individualized translational research process of the Undiagnosed Diseases Network (UDN) developed during Phase I is scalable and that its impact on patients, families, and disease discovery can be advanced and sustained by addition of a Clinical Site at Washington University School of Medicine (WUSM). WUSM represents a large academic medical center that is fully integrated with world-renowned basic science capabilities and demonstrated expertise in a gene first approach for patients with undiagnosed diseases. The highly collaborative clinical and biomedical research culture at WUSM promotes interactions within and across Departments, with institutional genomic, clinical, computational, and model system experts, and with colleagues regionally, nationally, and internationally. These interactions support recruitment, selection, evaluation, diagnosis discovery, and follow up of pediatric and adult patients with undiagnosed diseases through both established networks and individual referrals. Building on this infrastructure, WUSM faculty and staff will advance the success of the UDN in diagnosing and managing disease in undiagnosed patients by, first, using, refining, and improving protocols designed during Phase I of the UDN for comprehensive, timely clinical evaluations of 30 undiagnosed patients annually. Secondly, we will collect, securely store, and share standardized, high-quality clinical and laboratory data including genotyping, phenotyping, and documentation of environmental exposures and promote an integrated and collaborative community across the UDN and among laboratory and clinical investigators focused on defining the pathophysiology, cell biologic, and molecular mechanisms that cause these difficult to diagnose diseases. Thirdly, the WUSM UDN Clinical Site will propose a bioinformatics plan for leveraging institutional infrastructure and expertise to develop innovative strategies to improve discovery of pathogenic variants. Fourthly, the assessment, dissemination, outreach, and training plan will accelerate assessment and dissemination of data, protocols, consent materials, and methods, availability of educational and outreach materials for participants, clinicians, and other researchers, engagement of underrepresented minorities, and training for students, fellows, staff, and faculty in collaboration with WUSM’s Clinical and Translational Science Award infrastructure. Finally, WUSM will make a clear institutional commitment to maintain its Clinical Site, to adapt UDN Phase I practices for sustainability, to contribute to formation of a sustainable national UDN resource, and to adapt to unique needs and unexpected circumstances that may arise once Common Fund support ends in fiscal year 2022. 2.0 PROJECT NARRATIVE Undiagnosed diseases in children and adults represent frustrating and costly challenges for patients, families, physicians, and society. Building on established institutional infrastructure similar to the Undiagnosed Diseases Network (UDN), Washington University School of Medicine (WUSM) will establish a UDN Clinical Site to improve the level of diagnosis and care for patients with undiagnosed diseases, facilitate research into the etiology of undiagnosed diseases, and promote an integrated and collaborative community across multiple UDN Clinical Sites, Sequencing Cores, Model Organisms Screening Centers, and among laboratory and clinical investigators. Specifically, the WUSM UDN Clinical Site will annually recruit, select, evaluate, and follow 30 participants with disorders in any clinical specialty, adult and pediatric, provide comprehensive clinical evaluations that require <5 days and follow up, and participate in all UDN protocols, data management and sharing, and sustainability planning.",Washington University School of Medicine Undiagnosed Diseases Network Clinical Site,9593059,U01HG010215,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Accreditation', 'Adult', 'Animal Model', 'Basic Science', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biomedical Research', 'Businesses', 'Cells', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Clinical and Translational Science Awards', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computer Simulation', 'Consent', 'DNA Sequencing Facility', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Documentation', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Expert Systems', 'Faculty', 'Family', 'Family Physicians', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Genes', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Geographic Locations', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'International', 'Laboratories', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Network-based', 'Participant', 'Pathogenicity', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Phase I Clinical Trials', 'Phenotype', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Review Committee', 'Secure', 'Societies', 'Standardization', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Underrepresented Minority', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Washington', 'clinical practice', 'clinical research site', 'cost', 'data management', 'deep learning', 'design', 'disease diagnosis', 'exome sequencing', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'genetic variant', 'genome sequencing', 'improved', 'innovation', 'medical schools', 'medical specialties', 'network models', 'operation', 'outreach', 'recruit', 'research clinical testing', 'screening', 'sequencing platform', 'student training', 'success', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NHGRI,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,U01,2018,750000,-0.0177562672915652
"Interactive machine learning methods for clinical natural language processing DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Growing deployments of electronic health records (EHRs) systems have made massive clinical data available electronically. However, much of detailed clinical information of patients is embedded in narrative text and is not directly accessible for computerized clinical applications. Therefore, natural language processing (NLP) technologies, which can unlock information in narrative document, have received great attention in the medical domain. Current state-of-the-art NLP approaches often involve building probabilistic models. However, the wide adoption of statistical methods in clinical NLP faces two grand challenges: 1) the lack of large annotated clinical corpora; and 2) the lack of methodologies that can efficiently integrate linguistic and domain knowledge with statistical learning. High-performance statistical NLP methods rely on large scale and high quality annotations of clinical text, but it is time-consuming and costly to create large annotated clinica corpora as it often requires manual review by physicians. Moreover, the medical domain is knowledge intensive. To achieve optimal performance, probabilistic models need to leverage medical domain knowledge. Therefore, methods that can efficiently integrate domain and expert knowledge with machine learning processes to quickly build high-quality probabilistic models with minimum annotation cost would be highly desirable for clinical text processing.    In this study, we propose to investigate interactive machine learning (IML) methods to address the above challenges in clinical NLP. An IML system builds a classification model in an iterative process, which can actively select informative samples for annotation based on models built on previously annotated samples, thus reducing the annotation cost for model development. More importantly, an IML system also involves human inputs to the learning process (e.g., an expert can specify important features for a classification task based on domain knowledge). Thus, IML is an ideal framework for efficiently integrating rule-based (via domain experts specifying features) and statistics-based (via different learning algorithms) approaches to clinical NLP. To achieve our goal, we propose three specific aims. In Aim 1, we plan to investigate different aspects of IML for word sense disambiguation, including developing new active learning algorithms and conducting cognitive usability analysis for efficient feature annotation by users. To demonstrate the broad uses of IML, we further extend IML approaches to two other important clinical NLP classification tasks: named entity recognition and clinical phenoytping in Aim 2. Finally we propose to disseminate the IML methods and tools to the biomedical research community in Aim 3. Project Narrative In this project, we propose to develop interactive machine learning methods to process clinical text stored in electronic health records (EHRs) systems. Such methods can efficiently integrate domain and expert knowledge with machine learning processes to quickly build high-quality probabilistic models with minimum annotation cost, thus improving performance of text processors. This technology will allow more accurate data extraction from clinical documents, thus to facilitate clinical research that rely on EHRs data.",Interactive machine learning methods for clinical natural language processing,9337267,R01LM010681,"['Abbreviations', 'Active Learning', 'Address', 'Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Attention', 'Biomedical Research', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Educational workshop', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Face Processing', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Informatics', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Linguistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Medical', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Names', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Process', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Priority', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Source', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'United States National Library of Medicine', 'base', 'clinical application', 'clinical phenotype', 'cohort', 'computer human interaction', 'computerized', 'cost', 'experience', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'model development', 'novel', 'open source', 'real world application', 'statistics', 'success', 'tool', 'usability', 'word learning']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR HOUSTON,R01,2017,463061,-0.008093097778128585
"Natural language processing for characterizing psychopathology ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Convergent genetic and epidemiologic evidence suggests the importance of understanding psychiatric illness from a dimensional rather than solely a categorical perspective. The limitations of traditional diagnostic categories motivated a major NIMH-supported effort to identify measures of psychopathology that more closely align with underlying disease biology.  At present, however, the available large clinical data sets, whether health claims, registries, or electronic health records, do not include such dimensional measures. Even with the integration of structure clinician and patient-reported outcomes, generating such cohorts could require a decade or more. Moreover, coded data does not systematically capture clinically-important concepts such as health behaviors or stressors.  While such cohorts are developed, natural language processing can facilitate the application of existing electronic health records to enable precision medicine in psychiatry. Specifically, while traditional natural language tools focus on extracting individual terms, emerging methods including those in development by the investigators allow extraction of concepts and dimensions.  The present investigation proposes to develop a toolkit for natural language processing of narrative patient notes to extract measures of psychopathology, including estimated RDoC domains. In preliminary investigations in a large health system, these tools have demonstrated both face validity and predictive validity. This toolkit also allows extraction o complex concepts from narrative notes, such as stressors and health behaviors.  In the proposed study, these natural language processing tools will be applied to a large psychiatric inpatient data set as well as a large general medical inpatient data set, to derive measures of psychopathology and other topics. The resulting measures will then be used in combination with coded data to build regression and machine-learning-based models to predict clinical outcomes including length of hospital stay and risk of readmission. The models will then be validated in independent clinical cohorts.  By combining expertise in longitudinal clinical investigation, natural language processing, and machine learning, the proposed study brings together a team with the needed skills to develop a critical toolkit for understanding health records dimensionally The resulting models can be applied to facilitate investigation of dimensions of psychopathology and related topics, allowing stratification of clinical risk to enable development of targeted interventions.

"Crowdsourcing Mark-up of the Medical Literature to Support Evidence-Based Medicine and Develop Automated Annotation Capabilities ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Evidence-based medicine (EBM) promises to transform the way that physicians treat their patients, resulting in better quality and more consistent care informed directly by the totality of relevant evidence. However, clinicians do not have the time to keep up to date with the vast medical literature. Systematic reviews, which provide rigorous, comprehensive and transparent assessments of the evidence pertaining to specific clinical questions, promise to mitigate this problem by concisely summarizing all pertinent evidence. But producing such reviews has become increasingly burdensome (and hence expensive) due in part to the exponential expansion of the biomedical literature base, hampering our ability to provide evidence-based care.  If we are to scale EBM to meet the demands imposed by the rapidly growing volume of published evidence, then we must modernize EBM tools and methods. More specifically, if we are to continue generating up-to-date evidence syntheses, then we must optimize the systematic review process. Toward this end, we propose developing new methods that combine crowdsourcing and machine learning to facilitate efficient annotation of the full-texts of articles describing clinical trials. These annotations will comprise mark-up of sections of text that discuss clinically relevant fields of importance in EBM, such as discussion of patient characteristics, interventions studied and potential sources of bias. Such annotations would make literature search and data extraction much easier for systematic reviewers, thus reducing their workload and freeing more time for them to conduct thoughtful evidence synthesis.  This will be the first in-depth exploration of crowdsourcing for EBM. We will collect annotations from workers with varying levels of expertise and cost, ranging from medical students to workers recruited via Amazon Mechanical Turk. We will develop and evaluate novel methods of aggregating annotations from such heterogeneous sources. And we will use the acquired manual annotations to train machine learning models that automate this markup process. Models capable of automatically identifying clinically salient text snippets in full-text articles describing clinical trials would be broadly useful for biomedical literature retrieval tasks and would have impact beyond our immediate application of EBM. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We propose to develop crowdsourcing and machine learning methods to annotate clinically important sentences in full-text articles describing clinical trials Ultimately, we aim to automate such annotation, thereby enabling more efficient practice of evidence- based medicine (EBM).",Crowdsourcing Mark-up of the Medical Literature to Support Evidence-Based Medicine and Develop Automated Annotation Capabilities,9275458,UH2CA203711,"['Artificial Intelligence', 'Automated Annotation', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Crowding', 'Data', 'Data Quality', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Effectiveness', 'Eligibility Determination', 'Environment', 'Evidence Based Medicine', 'Evidence based practice', 'Health', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Individual', 'Information Retrieval', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Mechanics', 'Medical', 'Medical Students', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Outcome', 'Paper', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Population Characteristics', 'Preparation', 'Process', 'Publishing', 'Quality of Care', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Reporting', 'Retrieval', 'Rewards', 'Source', 'System', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'Work', 'Workload', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'collaborative environment', 'cost', 'crowdsourcing', 'demographics', 'detector', 'dosage', 'evidence base', 'learning strategy', 'novel', 'phrases', 'public health relevance', 'scale up', 'skills', 'systematic review', 'tool']",NCI,NORTHEASTERN UNIVERSITY,UH2,2017,210198,-0.03537460513548532
"Semi-Automating Data Extraction for Systematic Reviews ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Evidence-based medicine (EBM) looks to inform patient care with the totality of available relevant evidence. Systematic reviews are the cornerstone of EBM and are critical to modern healthcare, informing everything from national health policy to bedside decision-making. But conducting systematic reviews is extremely laborious (and hence expensive): producing a single review requires thousands of person-hours. Moreover, the exponential expansion of the biomedical literature base has imposed an unprecedented burden on reviewers, thus multiplying costs. Researchers can no longer keep up with the primary literature, and this hinders the practice of evidence-based care.      The long term aim of this work is to develop computational tools and methods that optimize the practice of EBM. The proposed work thus builds upon our previous successful efforts developing computational approaches that reduce the workload in EBM. More speciﬁcally, we aim to develop tools that semi-automate the laborious task of data extraction - identifying and extracting the information of interest (e.g., trial sample size, interventions and outcomes) from the free-texts of biomedical articles - via novel machine learning methods. Semi-automating this task will drastically reduce reviewer workload, thus enabling the practice of EBM in an age of information overload.      Previous efforts to automate data extraction from articles describing clinical trials have shown promise, but lack the accuracy and scope necessary for real-world use. These approaches have been impeded by the absence of a large corpus of annotated clinical trials, and by the difﬁculty of constructing models to automatically extract all of the variables necessary for synthesis. We describe methodological innovations to overcome these hurdles. First, to train our machine learning models we propose leveraging large existing databases that contain structured information about clinical trials, in lieu of the usual approach of collecting expensive manual annotations. Practically, this means we will be able to exploit a very large `pseudo-annotated' dataset that is an order of magnitude bigger than what has been used in previous efforts, thus substantially improving model performance. Our extensive preliminary work demonstrates the promise and feasibility of this approach. Second, we propose novel machine learning models appropriate for the tasks of article categorization and data extraction for EBM. These models will speciﬁcally be designed to perform extraction of multiple, correlated data elements of interest while simultaneously classifying articles into clinically salient categories useful for EBM.      We will rigorously evaluate the developed methods to assess their practical utility, speciﬁcally y comparing automated extraction accuracy to that achieved by trained systematic reviewers. And to make these methods useful to end-users (systematic reviewers), we will develop and evaluate open-source software and tools, including a web-based extraction tool that integrates our machine learning models to automatically extract information from uploaded articles (PDFs). We will conduct a user study to evaluate the utility and usability of this tool in practice. Public Health Narrative  We propose to develop computational methods and tools that make the practice of evidence-based medicine (EBM) more efﬁcient, speciﬁcally by semi-automating data extraction from the full-texts of articles describing clinical trials. Such tools would drastically reduce the workload currently involved in producing evidence syntheses, ultimately enabling evidence- based care in an era of information overload.",Semi-Automating Data Extraction for Systematic Reviews,9326367,R01LM012086,"['Age', 'Area', 'Caring', 'Categories', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Community Medicine', 'Complement', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Element', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Effectiveness of Interventions', 'Elements', 'Evidence Based Medicine', 'Evidence based practice', 'Exercise', 'Feedback', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Healthcare', 'Hour', 'Human Resources', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention', 'Letters', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'National Health Policy', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Population Characteristics', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Sample Size', 'Services', 'Software Tools', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'System', 'Text', 'Training', 'Work', 'Workload', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'cost efficient', 'data mining', 'design', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'member', 'novel', 'open source', 'process optimization', 'study characteristics', 'systematic review', 'tool', 'trial design', 'usability', 'web services', 'web-based tool']",NLM,NORTHEASTERN UNIVERSITY,R01,2017,293503,-0.00364210186346585
"Open Health Natural Language Processing Collaboratory Project Summary One of the major barriers in leveraging Electronic Health Record (EHR) data for clinical and translational science is the prevalent use of unstructured or semi-structured clinical narratives for documenting clinical information. Natural Language Processing (NLP), which extracts structured information from narratives, has received great attention and has played a critical role in enabling secondary use of EHRs for clinical and translational research. As demonstrated by large scale efforts such as ACT (Accrual of patients for Clinical Trials), eMERGE, and PCORnet, using EHR data for research rests on the capabilities of a robust data and informatics infrastructure that allows the structuring of clinical narratives and supports the extraction of clinical information for downstream applications. Current successful NLP use cases often require a strong informatics team (with NLP experts) to work with clinicians to supply their domain knowledge and build customized NLP engines iteratively. This requires close collaboration between NLP experts and clinicians, not feasible at institutions with limited informatics support. Additionally, the usability, portability, and generalizability of the NLP systems are still limited, partially due to the lack of access to EHRs across institutions to train the systems. The limited availability of EHR data limits the training available to improve the workforce competence in clinical NLP. We aim to address the above challenges by extending our existing collaboration among multiple CTSA hubs on open health natural language processing (OHNLP) to share distributional information of NLP artifacts (i.e., words, n-grams, phrases, sentences, concept mentions, concepts, and text segments) acquired from real EHRs across multiple institutions. We will leverage the advanced privacy-preserving computing infrastructure of iDASH (integrating Data for Analysis, Anonymization, and SHaring) for privacy- preserving data analysis models and will partner with diverse communities including Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics (OHDSI), Precision Medicine Initiative (PMI), PCORnet, and Rare Diseases Clinical Research Network (RDCRN) to demonstrate the utility of NLP for translational research. This CTSA innovation award RFA provides us with a unique opportunity to address the challenges faced with clinical NLP and through strong partnership with multiple research communities and leadership roles of the research team in clinical NLP, we envision that the successful delivery of this project will broaden the utilization of clinical NLP across the research community. There are four aims planned: i) obtain PHI-suppressed NLP artifacts with retained distribution information across multiple institutions and assess the privacy risk of accessing PHI- suppressed artifacts, ii) generate a synthetic text corpus for exploratory analysis of clinical narratives and assess its utility in NLP tasks leveraging various NLP challenges, iii) develop privacy-preserving computational phenotyping models empowered with NLP, and iv) partner with diverse communities to demonstrate the utility of our project for translational research.

"Semi-structured Information Retrieval in Clinical Text for Cohort Identification DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques have shown promise for extracting data from the free text of electronic health records (EHRs), but studies have consistently found that techniques do not readily generalize across application settings. Unfortunately, most of the focus in applying NLP to real use cases has remained on a paradigm of single, well-defined application settings, so that generalizability to unseen use cases remains implicitly unaddressed. We propose to explicitly account for unseen application settings by adopting an information retrieval (IR) perspective with the objective of patient-level cohort identification. To do so, we introduce layered language models, an IR framework that enables the reuse of NLP-produced artifacts. Our long term goal is to accelerate investigations of patient health and disease by providing robust, user- centric tools that are necessary to process, retrieve, and utilize the free text of EHRs. The main goal of this proposal is to accurately retrieve ad hoc, realistic cohorts from clinical text at Mayo Clinic and OHSU, establishing methods, resources, and evaluation for patient-level IR. We hypothesize that cohort identification can be addressed in a generalizable fashion by a new IR framework: layered language models. We will test this hypothesis through four specific aims. In Aim 1, we will make medical NLP artifacts searchable in our layered language IR framework. This involves storing and indexing the NLP artifacts, as well as using statistical language models to retrieve documents based on text and its associated NLP artifacts. In Aim 2, we deal with the practical setting of ad hoc cohort identification, moving to patient-level (rather than document-level) IR. To accurately handle patient cohorts in which qualifying evidence may be spread over multiple documents, we will develop and implement patient-level retrieval models that account for cross- document relational and temporal combinations of events. In Aim 3, we will construct parallel IR test collections using EHR data from two sites; a diverse set of cohort queries written by multiple people toward various clinical or epidemiological ends; and assessments of which patients are relevant to which queries at both sites. Finally, in Aim 4, we refine and evaluate patient-level layered language IR on the ad hoc cohort identification task, making comparisons across the users, queries, optimization metrics, and institutions. We will draw additional extrinsic comparisons with pre-existing techniques, e.g., for cohorts from the Electronic Medical Records and Genonmics network. The expected outcomes of the proposed work are: (i) An open-source cohort identification tool, usable by clinicians and epidemiologists, that makes principled use of NLP artifacts for unseen queries; ii) A parallel test collection for cohort identification, includig two intra-institutional document collections, diverse test topics and user-produced text queries, and patient-level judgments of relevance to each query; and (iii) Validation of the reusability of medical NLP via the task of retrieving patient cohorts. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  With the widespread adoption of electronic medical records, one might expect that it would be simple for a medical expert to find things like ""patients in the community who suffer from asthma."" Unfortunately, on top of lab tests, medications, and demographic information, there are observations that a physician writes down as text - which are difficult for a computer to understand. Therefore, we aim to process text so that a computer can understand enough of it, and then search that text along with the rest of a patient's medical record; this will allow clinicians or researchers to find and study patients groups of interest.",Semi-structured Information Retrieval in Clinical Text for Cohort Identification,9325065,R01LM011934,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Adoption', 'Asthma', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Dictionary', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Epidemiologist', 'Epidemiology', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Evidence Based Medicine', 'Evolution', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Information Retrieval', 'Information Retrieval Systems', 'Institution', 'Interest Group', 'Investigation', 'Judgment', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Records', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Names', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Ontology', 'Outcome', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Process', 'Publishing', 'Qualifying', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Retrieval', 'Sampling', 'Semantics', 'Site', 'Smoke', 'Source', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Validation', 'Weight', 'Work', 'Writing', 'asthmatic patient', 'base', 'cohort', 'improved', 'indexing', 'information model', 'novel', 'open source', 'profiles in patients', 'public health relevance', 'query optimization', 'syntax', 'text searching', 'tool']",NLM,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,R01,2017,387966,-0.005030440714510568

"From genomics to natural language processing: A protected environment for research computing in the health science NIH S10 equipment proposal: From genomics to natural language processing:  A protected environment for research computing in the health sciences. Health sciences researchers are often required to manage, mine, and analyze restricted patient data (Protected Health Information, PHI) to facilitate and advance their research aims. They are often required to do this without access to central information technology expertise or resources to facilitate their research aims. These researchers are often left to their own devices to “solve” their research compute and data needs and are challenged due to lack of available resources, barriers from central IT, and/or lack of knowledge of available resources. A further challenge is that “small” data sets— data that researchers could formerly handle on office resources—have morphed and grown into the big data domain through the explosion of technical advances and significant expansion in various research directions. Examples include: genomics research, image analysis, simulation, natural language processing, and mining of EMRs. Therefore, the need exists to develop a framework for managing and processing this data securely and reliably. This S10 equipment proposal is to replace the “protected environment” (PE) prototype the University of Utah’s Center for High Performance Computing (CHPC) and Department of Biomedical Informatics built six years ago and has operated since. The PE consists of both high performance computing and virtual machine (VM) components and associated storage sufficient to manage, protect and analyze HIPAA protected health information. This environment has been very successful and has grown significantly in scope. CHPC isolated this protected environment in the secured University of Utah Downtown Data Center and setup a network protected logical partition that provided research groups specific access to individual data sets. As the environment and technology developed, CHPC added additional security features such as two-factor authentication for entry and audit/monitoring. Unfortunately, the prototype has reached the point where demand is surpassing capability and all the hardware is aged and off-warranty. To give an idea of users of the virtual machine farm component, the Biomedical Informatics Core (BMIC) REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture) environment for data collection has over 2,500 users in 1,500 projects supporting over $25M in NIH funding at the University of Utah, including support for more than 25 active NIH R-01 grants. Moreover, the HIPAA compliant protected environment was a key factor that aided passing the recent University of Utah HIPAA audit. The “protected environment” also helped the University of Utah Health Sciences Center and the BMIC justify the NCATS Center Clinical and Translational Science award (1ULTR001067). NIH S10 equipment proposal: From genomics to natural language processing:  A protected environment for research computing in the health sciences. Project Narrative: The proposed “Protected Environment” instrument will provide research computing and data management capabilities for health sciences researchers to properly manage, secure, and analyze HIPAA regulated protected health information. The technology will not only support a large number of clinical trials, but also enable research in Human Genetics and Natural Language Processing of electronic health records.",From genomics to natural language processing: A protected environment for research computing in the health science,9274445,S10OD021644,"['Award', 'Big Data', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Devices', 'Environment', 'Equipment', 'Explosion', 'Farming environment', 'Funding', 'Genomics', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act', 'Health Sciences', 'High Performance Computing', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Information Technology', 'Knowledge', 'Left', 'Mining', 'Monitor', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Patients', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Secure', 'Security', 'Technology', 'Translational Research', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Utah', 'aged', 'biomedical informatics', 'computerized data processing', 'electronic data', 'prototype', 'simulation', 'virtual']",OD,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,S10,2017,493595,-0.008951363454115343
"MACE2K - Molecular And Clinical Extraction: A Natural Language Processing Tool for Personalized Medicine ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The velocity, variety, volume and veracity of data from relevant information sources make it extremely challenging for oncologists to collect and review pertinent data that can support routine personalized treatment for their patients. There is an urgent need to develop data wrangling approaches including Natural Language Processing and information retrieval methods to extract and curate personalized-therapy related publications and clinical trials. Once curated, the structured data can be used by biomedical researchers to generate novel scientific hypotheses, design new studies, obtain a better understanding of biological mechanisms of disease, perform meta-analyses, and create clinical decision support systems. There is an urgent need to develop improved search interfaces specific to the field of personalized therapy, including ways to display, rank, and save results by end users. While several database and web-based keyword search engine algorithms exist, there is a lack of tools that meet the unique challenges of personalized medicine. There is also an urgent need to develop software that allows for verification and validation of information extracted and ranked through computational methods using subject matter expertise to improve the gold standard corpus that can be used for biomedical research into personalized therapies.  To address these issues, we will build an innovative software stack (MACE2K) to adapt and extend widely tested Biocreative natural language processing (NLP) tools to automatically retrieve and pre-process targeted therapy information from clinicaltrials.gov, PubMed abstracts as well as open access articles, and conference proceedings. We will build an entity extraction cartridge to accurately parse gene mutations, translocations, gene expression, protein expression, and protein phosphorylation. A marker disambiguation cartridge will be built to assess for trial inclusion or exclusion criteria and to determine marker-related primary endpoints. We will include a ranking cartridge that uses the disambiguated information on markers, drugs and trials to provide a rigorous scoring of trials and studies according to their relevance for personalized medicine. A novel gamification cartridge will be built to allow subject matter experts to verify and validate the information corpus.

"Text Mining Pipeline to Accelerate Systematic Reviews in Evidence-Based Medicine We hypothesize that a flexible, configurable suite of automated informatics tools can reduce significantly the effort needed to generate systematic reviews while maintaining or even improving their quality. To test this hypothesis, we propose: Aim 1. To extend our research on automated RCT tagging to include additional study types and provide public resources. A) Machine learning models will be created that automatically assign probability estimates to three types of observational studies that are widely examined by systematic reviewers. B) The RCT and other taggers will be evaluated prospectively for newly published PubMed articles. C) All PubMed articles will be automatically tagged for RCT, cohort, case-control and cross-sectional studies and annotated in a public dataset linked to a public query interface. Users will also receive tags for articles from non-PubMed data sources on demand. Aim 2. To evaluate the performance and usability of our tools when used by systematic reviewers under field conditions. A) The tools will be customized and integrated to facilitate field evaluation. B) A three-stage evaluation: 1. Retrospective evaluation of Metta and RCT Tagger performance. 2. Real-time “shadowing”. 3. Prospective controlled study. Aim 3. To identify additional clinical trial articles, appearing after a published systematic review was completed, that are relevant to the review topic. Aim 4. To identify publications related to specific ClinicalTrials.gov registered trials. Aim 5. To develop and evaluate new machine learning methods and tools that will facilitate rapid evidence scoping for new systematic review topics. A) Methods will be developed for ranking articles with respect to their relevance to a proposed new systematic review topic. B) A scoping tool will be created that displays articles ranked by predicted relevance, tagged with study design attributes, sample sizes, and Cochrane risk of bias estimates.

"Evidence-based Strategy and Tool to Simplify Text for Patients and Consumers ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Lifespans continue to increase, chronic disease survival rates are drastically improved, and treatments are being discovered for a variety of illnesses. This rapidly changing scenario requires patients to participate in their recovery, understand written information and directions thereby calling upon patients to have increasingly more complex health literacy. However, time availability of practitioners or other resources to explain the required information has not increased to match. As a result, finding efficient means to improving patient health literacy is an increasingly important topic in healthcare. Increased health literacy may promote healthy lifestyle behaviors and increase access to health services by the population. It has been argued that for the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act to be successful, more effort is needed to increase the health literacy of millions of Americans. Similarly, the Healthy People 2020 statement by the Department of Health and Human Services identified improving health literacy (HC/HIT-1) as an important national goal. The broad- long term objectives of this project are to contribute to increasing the health literacy of patients and health information consumers and provide caregivers an evidence-based tool for simplifying text. The most commonly used tool for estimating the difficulty of text is the readability formula. They are not sufficient, however, because there is no evidence to support a connection between their use and decreases in difficulty. This problem is addressed by using modern resources and techniques for discovering traits that make health-related text difficult and developing a tool to guide the simplification of text. . There are four specific aims of this project: 1) Identify differentiating features of easy versus difficult texts, 2) Design a simplification strategy using computer algorithms, 3) Measure the impact of simplification on perceived and actual text difficulty with online participants and a representative community sample, 4) Create free, online software that incorporates proven features algorithmically. Corpus analysis will be conducted to compare easy and difficult texts with each other and discover lexical, grammatical, semantic, and composition and discourse features typical for each. Then, simplification algorithms will be designed and developed relying on rule-based techniques to leverage available resources, e.g., vocabularies, or on machine learning approaches for discovering the best combinations of features for simplification. A representative writer will simplify text by relying on the suggestios provided by an online that tool that uses simplification algorithms. The effect of simplification wll be tested in comprehensive user studies to evaluate the effect on both actual and perceived difficulty. Features successfully shown to decrease text difficulty will be incorporated in an onlie software program designed to reduce text difficulty. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Improving health literacy is an important national goal and necessary trait for a healthy population. Providing understandable information is critical but few tools exist to help write understandable text. We aim to discover features indicative of difficult text, design translation algorithms and create a free, online software tool for rewriting health-related text with demonstrated impact on perceived and actual text difficulty",Evidence-based Strategy and Tool to Simplify Text for Patients and Consumers,9306183,R01LM011975,"['Address', 'Advocate', 'Affect', 'Affordable Care Act', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Arizona', 'Behavior', 'Caregivers', 'Chronic Disease', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Comprehension', 'Computational Linguistics', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer software', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Data Set', 'Education', 'Education Projects', 'Ensure', 'Faculty', 'Feedback', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Promotion', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Health behavior', 'Health education', 'Healthcare', 'Healthy People 2020', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Informatics', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Modernization', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Readability', 'Reader', 'Recovery', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Semantics', 'Software Tools', 'Survival Rate', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Translations', 'Underserved Population', 'United States Dept. of Health and Human Services', 'Universities', 'Vocabulary', 'Work', 'Writing', 'base', 'college', 'combat', 'community based participatory research', 'cost effective', 'design', 'evidence base', 'health literacy', 'healthy lifestyle', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'lexical', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'support tools', 'tool', 'trait', 'user-friendly', 'volunteer']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA,R01,2017,368201,-0.018124770981566105
"Crowd Sourcing Labels From Electronic Medical Records to Enable Biomedical Research ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Supervised machine learning is a popular method that uses labeled training examples to predict future outcomes.  Unfortunately, supervised machine learning for biomedical research is often limited by a lack of labeled data.  Current methods to produce labeled data involve manual chart reviews that are laborious and do not scale with data creation rates.  This project aims to develop a framework to crowd source labeled data sets from electronic medical records by forming a crowd of clinical personnel labelers.  The construction of these labeled data sets will allow for new biomedical research studies that were previously infeasible to conduct.  There are numerous practical and theoretical challenges of developing a crowd sourcing platform for clinical data.  First, popular, public crowd sourcing platforms such as Amazon's Mechanical Turk are not suitable for medical record labeling as HIPAA makes clinical data sharing risky.  Second, the types of clinical questions that are amenable for crowd sourcing are not well understood.  Third, it is unclear if the clinical crowd can produce labels quickly and accurately.  Each of these challenges will be addressed in a separate Aim. As the first Aim of this project, the team will evaluate different clinical crowd sourcing architectures.  The architecture must leverage the scale of the crowd, while minimizing patient information exposure.  De-identification tools will be considered to scrub clinical notes t reduce information leakage.  Using this design, the team will extend a popular open source crowd sourcing tool, Pybossa, and release it to the public.  As the second Aim, the team will study the type, structure, topic and specificity of clinical prediction questions, and how these characteristics impact labeler quality.  Lastly, the team will evaluate the quality and accuracy of collected clinical crowd sourced data on two existing chart review problems to determine the platform's utility. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Traditionally, clinical prediction models rely on supervised machine learning algorithms to probabilistically predict clinical events using labeled medical records.  When data sets are small, manual chart reviews performed by clinical staff are sufficient to label each outcome; however, as data sets have scaled up and researchers aim to study larger cohorts, current manual approaches become intractable.  The goal of this proposal is to develop a framework to crowd source labeled data sets from electronic medical records to support prediction model development.",Crowd Sourcing Labels From Electronic Medical Records to Enable Biomedical Research,9270528,UH2CA203708,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Asthma', 'Biomedical Research', 'Characteristics', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Collection', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Crowding', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Disclosure', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Extravasation', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act', 'Human Resources', 'Incentives', 'Interview', 'Label', 'Machine Learning', 'Management Audit', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Medical Records', 'Medical Research', 'Medical Students', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nurses', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Privacy', 'Productivity', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Security', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Time', 'Training', 'clinical predictors', 'cohort', 'computer science', 'crowdsourcing', 'data sharing', 'design', 'member', 'model development', 'open source', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'response', 'scale up', 'tool']",NCI,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,UH2,2017,316000,-0.005431213749526362
"SWIFT-ActiveScreener: research and development of an intelligent web-based document screening system Project Summary More than 4,000 systematic reviews are performed each year in the fields of environmental health and evidence- based medicine, with each review requiring, on average, between six months to one year of effort to complete. In order to remain accurate, systematic reviews require regular updates after their initial publication, with most reviews out of date within five years. In the screening phase of systematic review, researchers use detailed inclusion/exclusion criteria to decide whether each article in a set of candidate citations is relevant to the research question under consideration. For each article considered, a researcher reads the title and abstract and evaluates its content with respect to the prespecified criteria. A typical review may require screening thousands or tens of thousands of articles in this manner. Under the assumption that it takes a skilled reviewer 30-90 seconds, on average, to screen a single abstract, dual-screening a set of 10,000 abstracts may require between 150 to 500 hours of labor. We have shown in previous work that automated machine learning methods for article prioritization can reduce by more than 50% the human effort required to screen articles for inclusion in a systematic review. Recently, we have further extended these methods and packaged them into a web-based, collaborative systematic review software application called SWIFT-Active Screener. Active Screener has been used successfully to reduce the effort required to screen articles for systematic reviews conducted at a variety of organizations including the National Institute of Environmental Health Science (NIEHS), the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), The Endocrine Disruption Exchange (TEDX), and the Evidence Based Toxicology Collaboration (EBTC). These early adopters have provided us with an abundance of useful data and user feedback, and we have identified several areas where we can continue to improve our methods and software. Our goal for the current proposal is to conduct additional research and development to make significant improvements to SWIFT-Active Screener, including several innovations that will be necessary for commercial success. The research we propose encompasses three specific aims: (1) Investigate several improvements to statistical algorithms used for article prioritization and recall estimation. We will explore promising avenues for further improving the performance of our existing algorithms and address critical technical issues that limit the applicability of our current methods (Aim 1 – Improved Statistical Models). (2) Explore ways in which we can improve our models and methods to handle the scenario in which an existing systematic review is updated with new data several years after its initial publication (Aim 2 – New Methods for Systematic Review Updates). (3) Investigate several questions related to scaling the system to support hundreds to thousands of simultaneous screeners (Aim 3 - Software Engineering for Scalability, Usability and Full Text Extraction). Project Narrative Systematic review is a formal process used widely in evidence-based medicine and environmental health research to identify, assess, and integrate the primary scientific literature with the goal of answering a specific, targeted question in pursuit of the current scientific consensus. By conducting research and development to build a web-based, collaborative systematic review software application that uses machine learning to prioritize documents for screening, we will make an important contribution toward ongoing efforts to automate systematic review. These efforts will serve to make systematic reviews both more efficient to produce and less expensive to maintain, a result which will greatly accelerate the process by which scientific consensus is obtained in a variety of medical and health-related disciplines having great public significance.",SWIFT-ActiveScreener: research and development of an intelligent web-based document screening system,9467160,R43ES029001,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Collaborations', 'Computer software', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Discipline', 'Endocrine disruption', 'Environmental Health', 'Evidence Based Medicine', 'Exclusion Criteria', 'Feedback', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences', 'Online Systems', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Process', 'Publications', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Software Engineering', 'Statistical Algorithm', 'Statistical Models', 'System', 'Text', 'Toxicology', 'United States Department of Agriculture', 'United States Environmental Protection Agency', 'Update', 'Work', 'evidence base', 'improved', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'research and development', 'screening', 'success', 'systematic review', 'usability']",NIEHS,"SCIOME, LLC",R43,2017,211900,0.01005388911827353
"Policy Surveillance: the Future of Scientific Legal Mapping. “Policy surveillance” is the “ongoing, systematic collection, analysis, interpretation and dissemination of information about a given body of public health law and policy” (Chriqui, O'Connor, and Chaloupka 2011). Policy surveillance produces reliable longitudinal data for evaluating the health effects of laws; it can also increase public and policymaker awareness of trends in the law, and support diffusion of promising and evidence-based policy innovations. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) supported the development of policy surveillance programs, through NIAAA’s Alcohol Policy Information System (APIS) and the National Cancer Institute’s CLASS. More recently, NIDA has funded the launch of two policy surveillance programs, the Prescription Drug Abuse Policy System (PDAPS) and the Drug Abuse Policy System (DAPS). CDC has been increasing its support for policy surveillance activities, and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation has funded a Policy Surveillance Program to provide methodological and technical assistance, and maintain LawAtlas.org, a general health policy surveillance portal. As more and more researchers and consumers enter the field — from the state, federal and international levels and in private industry — harmonization of terms, methodological standards, and consensus on any needed governance mechanisms is valuable to ensure continued growth and adoption of this important scientific process and its valuable products. To meet these needs, we propose to convene one conference of 30-35 invited attendees who represent the practice’s primary stakeholders from across research, technology and practice; develop, publish and disseminate at least one report that summarizes the discussion and consensus reached among attendees; and establish a one-year plan of collaborative work towards further cooperation and cohesion. Project Narrative Policy surveillance produces reliable longitudinal data for evaluating the health effects of laws, can increase public and policymaker awareness of trends in the law, and support diffusion of promising and evidence-based policy innovations to improve health. A conference funded by NIH will harmonize terms and methodological standards, and will build consensus on field leadership and governance needed to ensure continued growth and adoption of this important scientific process and its valuable products.",Policy Surveillance: the Future of Scientific Legal Mapping.,9331919,R13DA043979,"['Adoption', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Awareness', 'Categories', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Code', 'Collection', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diffusion', 'Drug abuse', 'Emerging Technologies', 'Ensure', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Health Policy', 'Industry', 'Industry Standard', 'Information Dissemination', 'Information Technology', 'International', 'Laws', 'Leadership', 'Legal', 'Machine Learning', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'National Cancer Institute', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism', 'Outcome', 'Policies', 'Privatization', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Public Health Schools', 'Publishing', 'Quality Control', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Site', 'Statutes and Laws', 'Sum', 'Surveillance Program', 'System', 'Technology', 'Text', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'Wood material', 'Work', 'alcohol policy information system', 'cohesion', 'data access', 'data structure', 'development policy', 'evidence base', 'improved', 'innovation', 'innovative technologies', 'prescription drug abuse', 'programs', 'public health intervention', 'symposium', 'tool', 'trend', 'uptake']",NIDA,TEMPLE UNIV OF THE COMMONWEALTH,R13,2017,24772,-0.01336470420334683
"The Center for Predictive Computational Phenotyping-1 Overall DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The biomedical sciences are being radically transformed by advances in our ability to monitor, record, store and integrate information characterizing human biology and health at scales that range from individual molecules to large populations of subjects. This wealth of information has the potential to substantially advance both our understanding of human biology and our ability to improve human health. Perhaps the most central and general approach for exploiting biomedical data is to use methods from machine learning and statistical modeling to infer predictive models. Such models take as input observable data representing some object of interest, and produce as output a prediction about a particular, unobservable property of the object. This approach has proven to be of high value for a wide range of biomedical tasks, but numerous significant challenges remain to be solved in order for the full potential of predictive modeling to be realized.  To address these challenges, we propose to establish The Center for Predictive Computational Phenotyping (CPCP). Our proposed center will focus on a broad range of problems that can be cast as computational phenotyping. Although some phenotypes are easily measured and interpreted, and are available in an accessible format, a wide range of scientifically and clinically important phenotypes do not satisfy these criteria. In such cases, computational phenotyping methods are required either to (i) extract a relevant  phenotype from a complex data source or collection of heterogeneous data sources, (ii) predict clinically  important phenotypes before they are exhibited, or (iii) do both in the same application. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  We will develop innovative new approaches and tools that are able to discover, and make crucial inferences with large data sets that include molecular profiles, medical images, electronic health records, population-level data, and various combinations of these and other data types. These approaches will significantly advance the state of the art in wide range of biological and clinical investigations, such as predicting which patients are most at risk for breast cancer, heart attacks and severe blood clots.",The Center for Predictive Computational Phenotyping-1 Overall,9266344,U54AI117924,"['Address', 'Biological', 'Blood coagulation', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Exhibits', 'General Population', 'Generations', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Greek', 'Health', 'Human', 'Human Biology', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Monitor', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Organism', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Property', 'Regulatory Element', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Statistical Algorithm', 'Statistical Models', 'Time', 'Training Activity', 'biomedical scientist', 'clinical investigation', 'clinical predictors', 'education research', 'graduate student', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'novel strategies', 'outcome forecast', 'predictive modeling', 'public health relevance', 'success', 'tool', 'treatment planning', 'undergraduate student']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,U54,2017,229691,-0.01935937022395556
"HERCULES: Exposome Research Center PROJECT SUMMARY: HERCULES The vision of the HERCULES P30 is to demonstrably advance the role of environmental health sciences in clinical and public health settings using the platform of the exposome. Healthcare and biomedical research have become increasingly genome-centric. While much of this is due to the impressive achievements in genomics, which have consistently outpaced gains in environmental health, it is our contention that a more persuasive case needs to be made for environmental factors.

"Extended Methods and Software Development for Health NLP PROJECT SUMMARY There is a deluge of health-related texts in many genres, from the clinical narrative to newswire and social media. These texts are diverse in content, format, and style, and yet they represent complementary facets of biomedical and health knowledge. Natural Language Processing (NLP) holds much promise to extract, understand, and distill valuable information from these overwhelming large and complex streams of data, with the ultimate goal to advance biomedicine and impact the health and wellbeing of patients. There have been a number of success stories in various biomedical NLP applications, but the NLP methods investigated are usually tailored to one specific phenotype and one institution, thus reducing portability and scalability. Moreover, while there has been much work in the processing of clinical texts, other genres of health texts, like narratives and posts authored by health consumers and patients, are lacking solutions to marshal and make sense of the health information they contain. Robust NLP solutions that answer the needs of biomedicine and health in general have not been fully investigated yet. A unified, data-science approach to health NLP enables the exploration of methods and solutions unprecedented up to now.  Our vision is to unravel the information buried in the health narratives by advancing text-processing methods in a unified way across all the genres of texts. The crosscutting theme is the investigation of methods for health NLP (hNLP) made possible by big data, fused with health knowledge. Our proposal moves the field into exploring semi-supervised and fully unsupervised methods, which only succeed when very large amounts of data are leveraged and knowledge is injected into the methods with care. Our hNLP proposal also targets a key challenge of current hNLP research: the lack of shared software. We seek to provide a clearinghouse for software created under this proposal, and as such all developed tools will be disseminated. Starting from the data characteristics of health texts and information needs of stakeholders, we will develop and evaluate methods for information extraction, information understanding. We will translate our research into the publicly available NLP software platform cTAKES, through robust modules for extraction and understanding across all genres of health texts. We will also demonstrate impact of our methods and tools through several use cases, ranging from clinical point of care to public health, to translational and precision medicine, to participatory medicine. Finally, we will disseminate our work through community activities, such as challenges to advance the state of the art in health natural language processing. PROJECT NARRATIVE  There is a deluge of health texts. Natural Language Processing (NLP) holds much promise to unravel valuable information from these large data streams with the goal to advance medicine and the wellbeing of patients.

"Developing Smokers for Smoker (S4S): A Collective Intelligence tailoring system DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Smoking is still the number one preventable cause of cancer death. New approaches are needed to engage smokers in the 21st century in smoking cessation. I propose to develop S4S (Smokers for Smoker), a next- generation patient-centered computer tailored health communication (CTHC) system. Unlike current rule- based CTHCs, S4S will replace rules with complex machine learning algorithms, and use the collective experiences of thousands of smokers engaged in a web-assisted tobacco intervention to enhance personally- relevant tailoring for new smokers entering the system. This NCI K07 will provide a mentored research experience, giving me the opportunity to acquire new competencies in cancer health communication for behavior change, research design and statistical methods underlying clinical trial implementation and evaluation. I will adapt collectiv intelligence algorithms that have been used outside healthcare by companies like Amazon and Google to enhance CTHC. Using knowledge from scientific experts, current CTHC collect baseline patient ""profiles"" and then use expert-written, rule-based systems to tailor messages to patient subsets. Such theory-based ""market segmentation has been effective in helping patients reach lifestyle goals. However, there is a natural limit in the ability of a rule-based system to truly personalize content, and adapt personalization over time. Current CTHC have reached this limit, and I propose to go beyond. My first aim is to develop the Web 2.0 ""S4S"" recommender system. My second aim is to evaluate S4S within the context of a NCI funded web-assisted tobacco intervention (Decide2Quit.org). In my efforts, I will guided by my primary mentor (Dr. Houston, MD MPH) and two other mentor teams: The Cancer Health Behavior and Communication Team (Stephenie Lemon, PhD and Kathleen Mazor, EdD), and the Clinical Trial Design and Analysis Team (Jeroan Allison, MD, MS and Arlene Ash, PhD). My comprehensive training also includes coursework, seminars, and conferences. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: A high priority research area identified by the NIH is to understand the role of different media in increasing consumer demand for and use of effective, individually oriented tobacco cessation treatments for diverse populations. Specifically, a research focus is on understanding how to best tailor interventions. Although effective, there is a natural limit in the ability of current rle-based tailoring systems to truly personalize content, and adapt personalization over time. This NCI K07 will advance computer tailoring by adapting machine learning collective intelligence algorithms that have been used outside healthcare by companies like Amazon and Google to enhance the personal relevance of the health communication.",Developing Smokers for Smoker (S4S): A Collective Intelligence tailoring system,9313191,K07CA172677,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Attitude', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Carbon Monoxide', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Competence', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Electronic Mail', 'Engineering', 'Evaluation', 'Feedback', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Communication', 'Health behavior', 'Healthcare', 'Individual', 'Intelligence', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Life Style', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Metadata', 'Modeling', 'Motivation', 'Outpatients', 'Patients', 'Plant Roots', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Preventable cancer cause', 'Randomized', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Priority', 'Role', 'Smoker', 'Smoking', 'Smoking Behavior', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tobacco', 'Tobacco Use Cessation', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Visit', 'Withholding Treatment', 'Work', 'base', 'behavior change', 'behavioral construct', 'computer center', 'consumer demand', 'demographics', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'insight', 'next generation', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'patient oriented', 'patient subsets', 'profiles in patients', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'skills', 'smoking cessation', 'symposium', 'tailored messaging', 'theories', 'web services', 'web site']",NCI,UNIV OF MASSACHUSETTS MED SCH WORCESTER,K07,2017,139974,-0.011852573564303021

"An Informatics Framework for Discovery and Ascertainment of Drug-Supplement Interactions Most U.S. adults (68%) take dietary supplements (DS) and there is increasing evidence of drug-supplement interactions (DSIs); our ability to readily identify interactions between DS with prescription medications is currently very limited. To optimize the safe use of DS, there remains a critical and unmet need for informatics methods to detect DSIs. Our rationale is that an innovative informatics framework to discover potential DSIs from the large scale of biomedical literature will enable a new line of research for targeted DSI validation and will also significantly narrow the range of DSIs that must be further explored. Our long-term goal is to use informatics approaches to enhance DSI clinical research and translate its findings to clinical practice ultimately via clinical decision support systems. The objective of this application is to develop an informatics framework to enable the discovery of DSIs by creating a DS terminology and mining scientific evidence from the biomedical literature. Towards these objectives, we propose the following specific aims: (1) Compile a comprehensive DS terminology using online resources; and (2) Discover potential DSIs from the biomedical literature. The successful accomplishment of this project will deliver a novel informatics paradigm and resources for identifying most clinically significant DSI signals and their biological mechanisms. This information is critical to subsequent efforts aimed at improving patient safety and efficacy of therapeutic interventions. The results from this study are imperative in order to achieve the ultimate goal of reducing an individual’s risk of potential DSIs. PROJECT NARRATIVE This research will address a critical and unmet need to conduct large-scale clinical research in drug-supplement interactions (DSIs) and improve evidence bases for healthcare practice. Our primary overarching goal is to use informatics approaches to enhance DSI clinical research and translate our findings to clinical practice ultimately via clinical decision support.

"Biomedical Data Translator Technical Feasibility Assessment and Architecture Design New technologies afford the acquisition of dense “data clouds” of individual humans. However, heterogeneity, dimensionality and multi-scale nature of such data (genomes, transcriptomes, clinical variables, etc.) pose a new challenge: How can one query such dense data clouds of mixed data as an integrated set (as opposed to variable by variable) against multiple knowledge bases, and translate the joint molecular information into the clinical realm? Current lexical mapping and brute-force data mining seek to make heterogeneous data interoperable and accessible but their output is fragmented and requires expertise to assemble into coherent actionable information. We propose DeepTranslate, an innovative approach that incorporates the known actual physical organization of biological entities that are the substrate of pathogenesis into (i) networks (data graphs) and (ii) hierarchies of concepts that span the multiscale space from molecule to clinic. Organizing data sources along such natural structures will allow translation of burgeoning high-dimensional data sets into concepts familiar to clinicians, while capturing mechanistic relationships. DeepTranslate will take a hybrid approach to learn and organize its content from both (i) existing generic comprehensive knowledge sources (GO, KEGG, IDC, etc.) and (ii) newly measured instances of individual data clouds from two demonstration projects: (1) ISB’s Pioneer 100 and (2) St. Jude Lifetime cancer survivors. We will focus on diabetes as test case. These two studies cover a deep biological scale-space and thus can test the full extent of the multiscale capacity of DeepTranslate in a focused application. 1. TYPES OF RESEARCH QUESTION ENABLED. How can a clinician find out that the dozens of “out of range” variables observed in a patient’s data cloud, form a connected set with respect to pathophysiology pathways, from gene to clinical variable? How can the high-dimensional data of studies that measure for each individual 100+ data points of various types (“personal data clouds”) be analyzed as one set in an integrated fashion (as opposed to variable by variable) against existing knowledge bases and also be used to improve the databases? DeepTranslate addresses these two types of questions and thereby will accelerate translation of future personal data clouds into (A) care decisions and (B) hypotheses on new disease mechanisms / treatments, thereby benefiting providers as well as researchers. 2. USE OF EXPERTISE AND RESOURCES. ■ ISB: pioneer in personalized, big-data driven medicine (Demo Project 1); biomedical content expertise; multiscale omics and molecular pathogenesis, big data analysis, housing of databases for public access; query engine designs, GUI. ■ UCSD: leader in biomedical data integration; automated assembly of molecular and clinical data into hierarchical structures; translation between data types ■ U Montreal: biomedical database curation from literature and construction of gene/protein/drug interaction networks; machine learning, open resource database ■ St Jude CRH: Cancer monitoring Demo Project 2, cancer patient data analytics. 3. POTENTIAL DATA AND INFRASTRUCTURE CHALLENGES. (a) Existing comprehensive clinical data sources are not uniform and not explicitly based on biological networks; cross-mapping is being performed at NLM based on lexical relationships: HPO (phenotypes) vs. SNOMED CT (for EMR) vs. IDC or Merck Manual (for diseases). Careful selection of these sources in close collaboration with NLM is needed. (b) Existing molecular pathway databases are static, based on averages of heterogeneous non-stratified populations, while the newly measured high-dimensional data clouds are varied due to intra-individual temporal fluctuation and inter-individual variation. How this will affect building of ontotypes in our hybrid approach, and how large cohorts of data clouds must be to offer statistical power is yet to be determined. Our two Demonstration Projects with their uniquely deep (high-dimensional and multiscale) data in cohorts of limited but growing size are thus crucial first steps in a long journey of collective learning in the TRANSLATOR community. n/a",Biomedical Data Translator Technical Feasibility Assessment and Architecture Design,9486059,OT3TR002026,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Architecture', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'CRH gene', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cancer Survivor', 'Caring', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Drug Interactions', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Gene Proteins', 'Generic Drugs', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Graph', 'Heterogeneity', 'Housing', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Individual', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Nature', 'Output', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Provider', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'SNOMED Clinical Terms', 'Saint Jude Children&apos', 's Research Hospital', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'base', 'cohort', 'data integration', 'data mining', 'design', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'inter-individual variation', 'interoperability', 'knowledge base', 'lexical', 'molecular assembly/self assembly', 'new technology', 'transcriptome']",NCATS,INSTITUTE FOR SYSTEMS BIOLOGY,OT3,2017,1408263,-0.03610528298404013
"All of Us, Wisconsin Our application for OT-PM-16-003, “One in a Million – Precision Medicine Initiative Wisconsin” represents the collaborative efforts of three fully integrated regional healthcare systems to form a virtual state-wide integrated delivery network. The application originates at the Marshfield Clinic Health System (MCHS), one of the most productive and earliest adopters of what has become Precision Medicine. The work of the MCHS has been cited by NIH Director Dr. Francis Collins as a model for the Precision Medicine Initiative (PMI). To ensure comprehensive nearly state-wide coverage of participant health care, MCHS has partnered with the other academic integrated delivery networks in Wisconsin, (University of Wisconsin (UW) and Medical College of Wisconsin (MCW)), that together include 173 clinics, 13 hospitals, insurer partners and 5 Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs). The Blood Center of Wisconsin (BCW) also partners to operate state-wide mobile units of staff and equipment for blood collection that may be purposed for this effort. Through an independent agreement with Aurora Health, the electronic health records of participants recruited by academic and FQHC sites will be made available, ensuring nearly complete coverage of health care records across an entire state, with special emphasis on those populations that are traditionally the most underserved and understudied. The academic sites and FQHC partners have a long history of research cooperation and robust community engagement demonstrated by Clinical and Translational Science Awards (CTSA) ties, the Wisconsin Genome Initiative, reciprocal IRB arrangements, multiple joint grants and other collaborative studies. We have pioneered and implemented data sharing platforms and have demonstrated their usefulness with numerous high impact publications over many years. All three academic centers are leaders in the details of community engagement, recruitment, tracking, return of results and data sharing across various platforms in national and international consortia using large cohorts (e.g., MCHS’s 20,000 participant Personalized Medicine Research Project). A major innovation of this application is that it aligns the major healthcare systems of an entire state to more fully capture each participant’s data wherever participants get their health care. Indeed, 80% of all health care in Wisconsin is captured by our footprint. The State-wide catchment area also includes the oldest, sickest and poorest regions in the US and represent rural and urban areas, including African Americans, Hispanics and Native Americans, all represented as community champions. Through the FQHC partners, the recruiting institutions will achieve the 40% African American, Hispanic and Native American participant rate, with long standing community engagement and history of successful recruitment, including Wisconsin’s 12 Native American Tribes. Lending active support are Community Champions and Community Advisory Boards. A second innovative approach will employ Machine Learning (ML) techniques to optimize recruitment and retention processes. Our scientists have long collaborated on efforts to enhance the breadth and reliability of information extracted from the electronic health record (EHR), using a range of data to identify elements including family pedigrees or the occurrence of clinical events that are susceptible to unreliable coding. These efforts employed state-of-the-art methods including random forests, support vector machines and statistical relational learning, among others. These advanced computational methods will be used to predict those who are most likely to participate and which methods of approach are most effective. A third innovative approach is the planned use of mobile recruitment labs, previously successful with the Survey of the Health of Wisconsin (SHOW). SHOW, began in 2008 provides a novel infrastructure for population health research recruitment, enabling engagement across the state, longitudinal follow-up of participants and community-specific studies. Key assets of SHOW are two mobile units staffed by research and healthcare professionals to facilitate on-site health studies in randomly selected or community-specific participants. SHOW is predicated on community engagement and the response rate has been outstanding (in one study more than 90% of ~4,000 participants consented to follow-up, DNA testing, or blood work). This is true across all racial/ethnic groups, including non-Hispanic Whites, African Americans, Hispanics and Native Americans. The fourth innovative approach is to work with our FQHC partners to recruit traditionally underserved populations. MCHS, UW and MCW will work with FQHC partners (Marshfield Family Health Center, Access Community Health Center, Milwaukee Health Services, Progressive Health Center and 16th Street Community Health Center). Importantly, we are ready to start. We have already informed and engaged our communities through press releases and newsletters. Processes are in place. Volunteers have already asked us to contact them. All the required personnel are trained and SOPs are in place to begin recruitment. We have a productive history of working with partners already funded for PMI cohort recruitment. For several years, we have worked closely (and published) with our colleagues at Northwestern and Columbia through the eMERGE Network and with the University of Pittsburgh through CTSA. Project Director Murray Brilliant has recently served as an advisor to the University of Arizona’s Precision Medicine Program. Thus, we are team-players who are ready, willing and able to be valuable collaborative partners in the effort to build a national engine to transform healthcare under PMI. n/a","All of Us, Wisconsin",9512099,OT2OD025286,"['African American', 'Agreement', 'Arizona', 'Award', 'Blood', 'Catchment Area', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Code', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Community Health Centers', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Consent', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Elements', 'Ensure', 'Equipment', 'Ethnic group', 'Event', 'Family', 'Family health status', 'Federally Qualified Health Center', 'Funding', 'Genome', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Health Professional', 'Health Services', 'Health Surveys', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hispanic Americans', 'Hospitals', 'Human Resources', 'Institution', 'Insurance Carriers', 'International', 'Joints', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Native Americans', 'Newsletter', 'Not Hispanic or Latino', 'PMI cohort', 'Participant', 'Population', 'Precision Medicine Initiative', 'Press Releases', 'Process', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Recording of previous events', 'Records', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Project Grants', 'Scientist', 'Site', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Tribes', 'Underserved Population', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Wisconsin', 'Work', 'cohort', 'data sharing', 'follow-up', 'forest', 'genetic pedigree', 'innovation', 'medical schools', 'novel', 'personalized medicine', 'population health', 'precision medicine', 'programs', 'racial and ethnic', 'response', 'rural area', 'urban area', 'virtual', 'volunteer']",OD,MARSHFIELD CLINIC RESEARCH FOUNDATION,OT2,2017,5360833,-0.01733492919612465
"An Intelligent Concept Agent for Assisting with the Application of Metadata PROJECT ABSTRACT Biomedical investigators are generating increasing amounts of complex and diverse data. This data varies tremendously, from genome sequences through phenotypic measurements and imaging data. If researchers and data scientists can tap into this data effectively, then we can gain insights into disease mechanisms and how to tackle them. However, the main stumbling block is that it is increasingly hard to find and integrate the relevant datasets due to the lack of sufficient metadata. A researcher studying Crohn's disease may miss a crucial dataset on how certain microbial communities affect gut histology due to the lack of descriptive tags on the data. Currently, applying metadata is difficult, time-consuming and error prone due to the vast sea of confusing and overlapping standards for each datatype. Often specialized `data wranglers' are employed to apply metadata, but even these experts are hindered by lack of good tools. Here we propose to develop an intelligent agent that researchers and data wranglers can use to assist them apply metadata. The agent is based around a personalized dashboard of metadata elements that can be collected from multiple specialized portals, as well as sites such as Wikipedia. These elements can be coupled with classifiers that can be used to self-identify datasets to which they may be relevant, making the selection of appropriate vocabularies easier for researchers. We will deploy the system for a number of targeted use cases, including annotation of the National Center for Biomedical Information Bio-Samples repository, and annotation of images within the Figshare repository. Project Narrative Biomedical data is being generated at an increasing rate, and it is becoming increasingly difficult for researchers to be able to locate and effectively operate over this data, which has negative impacts on the rate of new discoveries. One solution is to attach metadata (data about data) onto all information generated in a research project, but application of metadata is currently difficult and time consuming due to the diverse range of standards on offer, typically requiring the expertise of trained data wranglers. Here we propose to develop an intelligent concept assistant that will allow researchers to generate and share sets of metadata elements relevant to their project, and will use machine learning techniques to automatically apply this to data.",An Intelligent Concept Agent for Assisting with the Application of Metadata,9357656,U01HG009453,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Area', 'Categories', 'Classification', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Coupled', 'Crohn&apos', 's disease', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Deposition', 'Disease', 'Distributed Systems', 'Ecosystem', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Fostering', 'Frustration', 'Genome', 'Histology', 'Human Microbiome', 'Image', 'Intelligence', 'Internet', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Logic', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Metadata', 'Ontology', 'Phenotype', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Sampling', 'Sea', 'Site', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Suggestion', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'Vision', 'Vocabulary', 'base', 'dashboard', 'improved', 'insight', 'microbial community', 'peer', 'prospective', 'repository', 'social', 'tool', 'transcriptomics']",NHGRI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIF-LAWRENC BERKELEY LAB,U01,2017,572778,-0.03349555844102996
"Metadata applications on informed content to facilitate biorepository data regulation and sharing ABSTRACT Biorepositories are critical to enabling modern molecular-based research that will drive the development of a new generation of targeted diagnostics and therapies as well as personalized medicine to improve clinical outcomes for patients. The use of data and biospecimen resources collected during research are constrained by the informed consent that research participants give to research teams, research protocol documents, and the constraints imposed on the research by the IRB itself. Currently there is a lack of a common model of consent that limits how easily data (and research specimens) from multiple research projects, or multiple institutions can be combined for large-scale retrospective studies. Manually examining and reconciling potentially millions of informed consent forms from different biobanks becomes an expensive and possibly irreconcilable problem. The application of suitable metadata in support of the complex set of regulatory, legal, privacy and security requirement processes and information flows involved in regulated research is a field in an early phases of development. The complicated legal and technical requirements involved in the processes challenge our ability to effectively build information systems that support sharing of research data, specimens and other research artifacts at scale. Additionally, much of the regulatory processes involved in research are still based on paper-based workflows. We posit that by developing suitable machine-based metadata representation of regulatory processes focusing on informed consents and the associated documents would enhance the ability of regulatory bodies such as Institutional Review Boards to 1) review proposals in a more streamlined fashion, 2) have the potential to provide a more comprehensive understanding of risk along multiple axes, and 3) provide a formal and computable basis for data sharing and information release policies. More specifically we will focus on three specific aims: 1) Develop standard-conforming metadata representations of informed consent; 2) Develop NLP-based automatic annotation tool for informed consent documents; and 3) Evaluate the metadata-ontology-based approach for semantically representing the domain and demonstrate its capacity for answering competency questions. Our proposed approach is novel for the following reasons: 1) it provides the first metadata ontology, to the best of our knowledge, to represent the informed consent space while considering the US common rules; 2) it combines natural language processing technologies with ontology-based approaches for semantic annotation as well as ontology enrichment; and 3) it engages stakeholders in the ontology development and evaluation process and uses competency questions to verify the coverage of the ontology.

"Tracking Evolution and Spread of Viral Genomes by Geospatial Observation Error ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Tracking evolutionary changes in viral genomes and their spread often requires the use of data deposited in public databases such as GenBank, the Influenza Research Database (IRD), or the Virus Pathogen Resource (ViPR). GenBank provides an abundance of available viral sequence data for phylogeography. Sequences and their metadata can be downloaded and imported into software applications that generate phylogeographic trees and models for surveillance. IRD and ViPR are NIH/NIAID funded programs that import data from GenBank but contain additional data sources, visualization, and search tools for their users. Tracking evolutionary changes and spread also requires the geospatial assignment of taxa, which is often obtained from GenBank metadata. Unfortunately, geospatial metadata such as host location is often uncertain in GenBank entries, with only 36% containing a precise location such as a county, town, or region within a state. For example, information such as China or USA was indicated instead of Beijing or Bedford, NH. While town or county might be included in the corresponding journal article, this valuable information is not available for immediate use unless it is extracted and then linked back to the appropriate sequence. The goal of our work is to enable health agencies and other researchers to automatically generate phylogeographic models that incorporate enhanced geospatial data for better estimates of virus spread. This proposal focuses on developing and applying information extraction and statistical phylogeography approaches to enhance models that track evolutionary changes in viral genomes and their spread. We propose a framework that uses natural language processing (NLP) for the automatic extraction of relevant geospatial data from the literature, and assigns a confidence between such geospatial mentions and the GenBank record. We will then use these locations and the estimates as observation error in the creation of phylogeographic models of zoonotic virus spread. We hypothesize that a combined NLP-phylogeography infrastructure that produces models that include observation error in the geospatial assignment of taxa will be closer to a gold standard than phylogeographic models that do not include them. Our research will extend phylogeography and zoonotic surveillance by: creating a NLP infrastructure that will improve the level of detail of geospatial data for phylogeography of zoonotic viruses (Aim 1), develop phylogeographic models using the estimates from Aim 1 as observation error (Aim 2), and evaluating our approach by comparing the models it produces to models that do not account for observation error in the geospatial assignment of taxa (Aim 3). We will allow users to generate enhanced models and view results on a web portal accessible via a LinkOut feature from GenBank, IRD, and ViPR. The addition of more precise geospatial information in building such models could enable health agencies to better target areas that represent the greatest public health risk. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We will develop and evaluate an infrastructure that uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) to identify more precise geographic information for modeling spread of zoonotic viruses. These new models could enable public health agencies to identify the most at-risk areas. In addition, by improving geospatial information in popular sequence databases such as GenBank, we will enrich other sciences that utilize this information such as molecular epidemiology, population genetics, and environmental health.",Tracking Evolution and Spread of Viral Genomes by Geospatial Observation Error,9249484,R01AI117011,"['Animals', 'Area', 'Award', 'Back', 'China', 'Computer software', 'County', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Diffusion', 'Disease', 'Environmental Health', 'Evaluation', 'Evolution', 'Funding', 'Genbank', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Hantavirus', 'Health', 'Human', 'Imagery', 'Influenza', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Location', 'Manuals', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Epidemiology', 'National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nucleotides', 'Population Genetics', 'Public Health', 'Publications', 'RNA Viruses', 'Rabies', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Science', 'Source', 'Surveillance Modeling', 'System', 'Time', 'Trees', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Viral', 'Viral Genome', 'Virus', 'Work', 'Zoonoses', 'improved', 'information model', 'interest', 'journal article', 'molecular sequence database', 'pathogen', 'population health', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'simulation', 'surveillance data', 'tool', 'web portal']",NIAID,ARIZONA STATE UNIVERSITY-TEMPE CAMPUS,R01,2017,461012,0.007010089387669594
"Secondary use of EMRs for surgical complication surveillance DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Recent statistics indicate that worldwide almost 234 million major surgical procedures are performed each year with the rates of major postsurgical complications (PSCs) range from 3% to 16% and rates of permanent disability or death range from 0.4% to 0.8%. Early detection of PSCs is crucial since early intervention could be lifesaving. Meanwhile, with the rapid adoption of electronic medical records (EMRs) and the accelerated advance of health information technology (HIT), detection of PSCs by applying advanced analytics on EMRs makes it possible for near real-time PSC surveillance. We have developed a rule-based PSC surveillance system to detect most frequent colorectal PSCs near real-time from EMRs where a pattern-based natural language processing (NLP) engine is used to extract PSC related information from text and a set of expert rules is used to detect PSCs. Two challenges are identified. First, it is very challenging to integrate a diverse set of relevant data using expert rules. In the past, probabilistic approaches such as Bayesian Network which can integrate a diverse set of relevant data have become popular in clinical decision support and disease outbreak surveillance. Can we implement probabilistic approaches for PSC surveillance? Secondly, a large portion of the clinical information is embedded in text and it has been quite expensive to manually obtain the patterns used in the NLP system since it requires team effort of subject matter experts and NLP specialists. In the research field, statistical NLP has been quite popular. However, decision making in clinical practice demands tractable evidences while models for statistical NLP are not human interpretable. Can we incorporate statistical NLP to accelerate the NLP knowledge engineering process? We hypothesize that a probabilistic approach for PSC surveillance can be developed for improved case detection which can integrate multiple evidences from structured as well as unstructured EMR data. We also hypothesize that empirical NLP can accelerate the knowledge engineering process needed for building pattern- based NLP systems used in practice. Specific aims include: i) developing and evaluating an innovative Bayesian PSC surveillance system that incorporates evidences from both structured and unstructured EMR data; and ii) incorporating and evaluating statistical NLP in accelerating the NLP knowledge engineering process of pattern-based NLP for PSC surveillance. Given the significance of HIT, our study results will advance the science in developing practical NLP systems that can be translated to meet NLP needs in health care practice. Additionally, given the significance of PSCs, our study results will address significant patient safety and quality issues in surgical practice. Utilizing automated methods to detect postsurgical complications will enable early detection of complications compared to other methods and therefore have great potential of improving patient safety and health care quality while reducing cost. The results could lead to large scale PSC surveillance and quality improvement towards safer and better health care. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Rapid growth in the clinical implementation of large electronic medical records (EMRs) has led to unprecedented opportunities to use EMRs for clinical practice and research.

"How Does Automated Record Linkage Affect Inferences about Population Health? ABSTRACT  Our broad research objective is to create the Longitudinal Intergenerational Family Electronic Micro-dataset (LIFE-M) spanning the late 19th and 20th century United States. Using automated record linkage technology, the LIFE-M project combines millions of vital records to reconstruct how and why individuals' health has changed across time. This multi-generational, longitudinal micro-database aims to transform research on health and longevity, on childbearing and family structure, and on the long-run health effects of early-life circumstances and exposures.  In creating LIFE-M, however, we have encountered serious deficits in knowledge about the performance of automated record linkage technology. The proposed project seeks to evaluate the performance of the most popular and cutting-edge automated linking techniques for the purposes of creating longitudinal health data. Our specific aims are to (1) produce systematic evidence regarding the performance of automated record linking algorithms in terms of match rates, representativeness of the linked sample, erroneous matches (type I errors), and systematic measurement error; (2) examine how phonetic name-cleaning methods affect quality metrics; and (3) examine how record quality metrics vary for different underrepresented subgroups (including women, racial/ethnic minorities, and immigrants) and to determine how linking methods affect representativeness and inferences. To achieve these aims, we have developed new partnerships with record linking experts allowing us to incorporate the most cutting-edge methods in record linking. We will also rely on new “ground truth” generated by LIFE-M project's independent, double-blind human review process.  This project will contribute significantly to existing knowledge about the use of automated linking methods for creating longitudinal and intergenerational health data. It will also increase knowledge about potential sources of bias in health studies. Both contributions should greatly enhance the quality of descriptive and causal inferences about population health and aging and disparities in these outcomes. PROJECT NARRATIVE  This project contributes to public health knowledge by advancing record linking methodology for creating longitudinal and intergenerational health datasets. It will also increase knowledge about potential sources of bias in public health and aging studies using linked records. Both contributions should significantly improve the quality of inferences about public and population health and health disparities.",How Does Automated Record Linkage Affect Inferences about Population Health?,9372797,R21AG056912,"['Affect', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Benchmarking', 'Big Data', 'Birth', 'Birth Certificates', 'Birth Records', 'Censuses', 'Child', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Linkages', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Double-Blind Method', 'Economics', 'Family', 'Foundations', 'Four-dimensional', 'Funding', 'Genealogy', 'Generations', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Hand', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Immigrant', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Link', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Maiden Name', 'Marriage', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medicare', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Minnesota', 'Minor', 'Names', 'Outcome', 'Performance', 'Pilot Projects', 'Politics', 'Population', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Running', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Source', 'Speed', 'Subgroup', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Veterans', 'Woman', 'aging population', 'child bearing', 'cost effective', 'ethnic minority population', 'family structure', 'health data', 'health disparity', 'health knowledge', 'improved', 'innovation', 'intergenerational', 'longitudinal database', 'population health', 'racial and ethnic', 'repository', 'social', 'vector']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R21,2017,232500,-0.013821677762197448
"COINSTAC: decentralized, scalable analysis of loosely coupled data ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     The brain imaging community is greatly benefiting from extensive data sharing efforts currently underway5,10. However, there is a significant gap in existing strategies which focus on anonymized, post-hoc sharing of either 1) full raw or preprocessed data [in the case of open studies] or 2) manually computed summary measures [such as hippocampal volume11, in the case of closed (or not yet shared) studies] which we propose to address. Current approaches to data sharing often include significant logistical hurdles both for the investigator sharing the dat as well as for the individual requesting the data (e.g. often times multiple data sharing agreements and approvals are required from US and international institutions). This needs to change, so that the scientific community becomes a venue where data can be collected, managed, widely shared and analyzed while also opening up access to the (many) data sets which are not currently available (see recent overview on this from our group2).    The large amount of existing data requires an approach that can analyze data in a distributed way while also leaving control of the source data with the individual investigator; this motivates  dynamic, decentralized way of approaching large scale analyses. We are proposing a peer-to-peer system called the Collaborative Informatics and Neuroimaging Suite Toolkit for Anonymous Computation (COINSTAC). The system will provide an independent, open, no-strings-attached tool that performs analysis on datasets distributed across different locations. Thus, the step of actually aggregating data can be avoided, while the strength of large-scale analyses can be retained. To achieve this, in Aim 1, the uniform data interfaces that we propose will make it easy to share and cooperate. Robust and novel quality assurance and replicability tools will also be incorporated. Collaboration and data sharing will be done through forming temporary (need and project-based) virtual clusters of studies performing automatically generated local computation on their respective data and aggregating statistics in global inference procedures. The communal organization will provide a continuous stream of large scale projects that can be formed and completed without the need of creating new rigid organizations or project-oriented storage vaults. In Aim 2, we develop, evaluate, and incorporate privacy-preserving algorithms to ensure that the data used are not re-identifiable even with multiple re-uses. We also will develop advanced distributed and privacy preserving approaches for several key multivariate families of algorithms (general linear model, matrix factorization [e.g. independent component analysis], classification) to estimate intrinsic networks and perform data fusion. Finally, in Aim 3, we will demonstrate the utility of this approach in a proof of concept study through distributed analyses of substance abuse datasets across national and international venues with multiple imaging modalities. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Hundreds of millions of dollars have been spent to collect human neuroimaging data for clinical and research purposes, many of which don't have data sharing agreements or collect sensitive data which are not easily shared, such as genetics. Opportunities for large scale aggregated analyses to infer health-relevant facts create new challenges in protecting the privacy of individuals' data. Open sharing of raw data, though desirable from the research perspective, and growing rapidly, is not a good solution for a large number of datasets which have additional privacy risks or IRB concerns. The COINSTAC solution we are proposing will capture this 'missing data' and allow for pooling of both open and 'closed' repositories by developing privacy preserving versions of widely-used algorithms and incorporating within an easy-to-use platform which enables distributed computation. In addition, COINSTAC will accelerate research on both open and closed data by offering a distributed computational solution for a large toolkit of widely used algorithms.","COINSTAC: decentralized, scalable analysis of loosely coupled data",9268713,R01DA040487,"['AODD relapse', 'Accounting', 'Address', 'Agreement', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Algorithms', 'Attention', 'Brain imaging', 'Classification', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Consent Forms', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Aggregation', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Decentralization', 'Development', 'Ensure', 'Family', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Markers', 'Health', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Institution', 'International', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Letters', 'Linear Models', 'Location', 'Logistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Movement', 'Paper', 'Plant Roots', 'Poaceae', 'Population', 'Privacy', 'Privatization', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Science', 'Site', 'Stream', 'Substance abuse problem', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'base', 'commune', 'computer framework', 'computing resources', 'connectome', 'cost', 'data sharing', 'distributed data', 'flexibility', 'imaging genetics', 'imaging modality', 'independent component analysis', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'open data', 'peer', 'public health relevance', 'quality assurance', 'repository', 'statistics', 'tool', 'virtual']",NIDA,THE MIND RESEARCH NETWORK,R01,2017,655080,0.010323173701239172
"Clinic Interactions of a Brain-Computer Interface for Communication ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The promise of brain-computer interfaces (BCI) for communication is becoming a reality for individuals with severe speech and physical impairments (SSPI) who cannot rely on speech or writing to express themselves. While the majority of research efforts are devoted to technology development to address problems of stability, reliability and/or classification, clinical and behavioral challenges are becoming more apparent as individuals with SSPI and their family/care teams assess the systems during novice or long-term trials. The objective of the RSVP Keyboard(tm) BCI translational research team is to address the clinical challenges raised during functional BCI use with innovative engineering design, thereby enhancing the potential of this novel assistive technology. Four specific aims are proposed: (1) to develop a BCI Communication Application Suite (BCI-CAS) that offers a set of language modules to people with SSPI that can meet their language/literacy skills; (2) to develop improved statistical signal models for personalized feature extraction, artifact/interference handling, and robust, accurate intent evidence extraction from physiologic signals; (3) to develop improved language models and stimulus sequence optimization methods; and (4) to evaluate cognitive variables that affect learning and performance of the BCI-CAS. Five language modules are proposed that rely on a multimodal evidence fusion framework for model-based context-aware optimal intent inference: RSVP Keyboard(tm) generative spelling; RSVP texting; RSVP in-context typing; RSVP in-context icon typing; and binary yes/no responses with SSVEPs. Usability data on the current RSVP Keyboard(tm) and SSVEP system drive all proposed aims. Users select a language module, and the BCI system optimizes performance for each individual based on user adaptation, intent inference, and personalized language modeling. A unique simulation function drives individualization of system parameters. The robustness of the BCI customization efforts are evaluated continually by adults with SSPI and neurotypical controls in an iterative fashion. The effect of three intervention programs that address the cognitive construct of attention (process-specific attention training, mindfulness meditation training and novel stimulus presentations) will be implemented through hypothesis-driven single subject designs. Thirty participants, ages 21 years and older with SSPI will be included in home-based interventions. By measuring information transfer rate (ITR), user satisfaction, and intrinsic user factors, we will identify learning strategies that influence BCI sill acquisition and performance for adults with neurodegenerative or neurodevelopmental conditions. The translational teams include (1) signal processing (Erdogmus); (2) clinical neurophysiology (Oken); (3) natural language processing (Bedrick/Gorman); and (4) assistive technology (Fried-Oken). We continue to rely on a solid Bayesian foundation and theoretical frameworks: ICF disability classification (WHO, 2001), the AAC model of participation (Beukelman & Mirenda, 2013) and the Matching Person to Technology Model (Scherer, 2002). PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The populations of patients with severe speech and physical impairments secondary to neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative diseases are increasing as medical technologies advance and successfully support life. These individuals with limited to no movement could potentially contribute to their medical decision making, informed consent, and daily caregiving if they had faster, more reliable means to interface with communication systems. The BCI Communication Applications Suite is a hybrid brain-computer interface that is an innovative technological advance so that patients and their families can participate in daily activities and advocate for improvements in standard clinical care.

"Interactive machine learning methods for clinical natural language processing DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Growing deployments of electronic health records (EHRs) systems have made massive clinical data available electronically. However, much of detailed clinical information of patients is embedded in narrative text and is not directly accessible for computerized clinical applications. Therefore, natural language processing (NLP) technologies, which can unlock information in narrative document, have received great attention in the medical domain. Current state-of-the-art NLP approaches often involve building probabilistic models. However, the wide adoption of statistical methods in clinical NLP faces two grand challenges: 1) the lack of large annotated clinical corpora; and 2) the lack of methodologies that can efficiently integrate linguistic and domain knowledge with statistical learning. High-performance statistical NLP methods rely on large scale and high quality annotations of clinical text, but it is time-consuming and costly to create large annotated clinica corpora as it often requires manual review by physicians. Moreover, the medical domain is knowledge intensive. To achieve optimal performance, probabilistic models need to leverage medical domain knowledge. Therefore, methods that can efficiently integrate domain and expert knowledge with machine learning processes to quickly build high-quality probabilistic models with minimum annotation cost would be highly desirable for clinical text processing.    In this study, we propose to investigate interactive machine learning (IML) methods to address the above challenges in clinical NLP. An IML system builds a classification model in an iterative process, which can actively select informative samples for annotation based on models built on previously annotated samples, thus reducing the annotation cost for model development. More importantly, an IML system also involves human inputs to the learning process (e.g., an expert can specify important features for a classification task based on domain knowledge). Thus, IML is an ideal framework for efficiently integrating rule-based (via domain experts specifying features) and statistics-based (via different learning algorithms) approaches to clinical NLP. To achieve our goal, we propose three specific aims. In Aim 1, we plan to investigate different aspects of IML for word sense disambiguation, including developing new active learning algorithms and conducting cognitive usability analysis for efficient feature annotation by users. To demonstrate the broad uses of IML, we further extend IML approaches to two other important clinical NLP classification tasks: named entity recognition and clinical phenoytping in Aim 2. Finally we propose to disseminate the IML methods and tools to the biomedical research community in Aim 3. Project Narrative In this project, we propose to develop interactive machine learning methods to process clinical text stored in electronic health records (EHRs) systems. Such methods can efficiently integrate domain and expert knowledge with machine learning processes to quickly build high-quality probabilistic models with minimum annotation cost, thus improving performance of text processors. This technology will allow more accurate data extraction from clinical documents, thus to facilitate clinical research that rely on EHRs data.",Interactive machine learning methods for clinical natural language processing,9132834,R01LM010681,"['Abbreviations', 'Active Learning', 'Address', 'Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Attention', 'Biomedical Research', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Educational workshop', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Face', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Linguistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Medical', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Names', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Process', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Priority', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Source', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'United States National Library of Medicine', 'base', 'clinical application', 'clinical phenotype', 'cohort', 'computer human interaction', 'computerized', 'cost', 'experience', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'model building', 'model development', 'novel', 'open source', 'real world application', 'statistics', 'success', 'tool', 'usability']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR HOUSTON,R01,2016,463405,-0.008093097778128585
"Natural language processing for characterizing psychopathology ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Convergent genetic and epidemiologic evidence suggests the importance of understanding psychiatric illness from a dimensional rather than solely a categorical perspective. The limitations of traditional diagnostic categories motivated a major NIMH-supported effort to identify measures of psychopathology that more closely align with underlying disease biology.  At present, however, the available large clinical data sets, whether health claims, registries, or electronic health records, do not include such dimensional measures. Even with the integration of structure clinician and patient-reported outcomes, generating such cohorts could require a decade or more. Moreover, coded data does not systematically capture clinically-important concepts such as health behaviors or stressors.  While such cohorts are developed, natural language processing can facilitate the application of existing electronic health records to enable precision medicine in psychiatry. Specifically, while traditional natural language tools focus on extracting individual terms, emerging methods including those in development by the investigators allow extraction of concepts and dimensions.  The present investigation proposes to develop a toolkit for natural language processing of narrative patient notes to extract measures of psychopathology, including estimated RDoC domains. In preliminary investigations in a large health system, these tools have demonstrated both face validity and predictive validity. This toolkit also allows extraction o complex concepts from narrative notes, such as stressors and health behaviors.  In the proposed study, these natural language processing tools will be applied to a large psychiatric inpatient data set as well as a large general medical inpatient data set, to derive measures of psychopathology and other topics. The resulting measures will then be used in combination with coded data to build regression and machine-learning-based models to predict clinical outcomes including length of hospital stay and risk of readmission. The models will then be validated in independent clinical cohorts.  By combining expertise in longitudinal clinical investigation, natural language processing, and machine learning, the proposed study brings together a team with the needed skills to develop a critical toolkit for understanding health records dimensionally The resulting models can be applied to facilitate investigation of dimensions of psychopathology and related topics, allowing stratification of clinical risk to enable development of targeted interventions.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Public health significance many aspects of psychiatric illness are not adequately captured by diagnostic codes. This study will apply natural language processing and machine learning to electronic health records from large health systems. The resulting symptom dimensions will allow better stratification of risk for clinically-important outcomes, including prolonged hospital stays and early readmissions.            ",Natural language processing for characterizing psychopathology,9105846,R01MH106577,"['Admission activity', 'Antidepressive Agents', 'Applaud', 'Area', 'Back', 'Biology', 'Categories', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Code', 'Complex', 'DSM-IV', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Electronics', 'Epidemiology', 'Face', 'Genetic', 'Health', 'Health behavior', 'Health system', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Inpatients', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Investigation', 'Length of Stay', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Moods', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Natural Language Processing', 'New England', 'Outcome', 'Patient Outcomes Assessments', 'Patients', 'Penetration', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Process', 'Psychiatric Diagnosis', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychopathology', 'Public Health', 'Registries', 'Reporting', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Severities', 'Stratification', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Text', 'United States National Academy of Sciences', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical investigation', 'clinical risk', 'cohort', 'health data', 'health record', 'hospital readmission', 'improved', 'natural language', 'neuropsychiatric symptom', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'precision medicine', 'predict clinical outcome', 'public health relevance', 'skills', 'stressor', 'success', 'terabyte', 'tool', 'trend']",NIMH,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2016,413500,-0.026111356893668503
"Crowdsourcing Mark-up of the Medical Literature to Support Evidence-Based Medicine and Develop Automated Annotation Capabilities ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Evidence-based medicine (EBM) promises to transform the way that physicians treat their patients, resulting in better quality and more consistent care informed directly by the totality of relevant evidence. However, clinicians do not have the time to keep up to date with the vast medical literature. Systematic reviews, which provide rigorous, comprehensive and transparent assessments of the evidence pertaining to specific clinical questions, promise to mitigate this problem by concisely summarizing all pertinent evidence. But producing such reviews has become increasingly burdensome (and hence expensive) due in part to the exponential expansion of the biomedical literature base, hampering our ability to provide evidence-based care.  If we are to scale EBM to meet the demands imposed by the rapidly growing volume of published evidence, then we must modernize EBM tools and methods. More specifically, if we are to continue generating up-to-date evidence syntheses, then we must optimize the systematic review process. Toward this end, we propose developing new methods that combine crowdsourcing and machine learning to facilitate efficient annotation of the full-texts of articles describing clinical trials. These annotations will comprise mark-up of sections of text that discuss clinically relevant fields of importance in EBM, such as discussion of patient characteristics, interventions studied and potential sources of bias. Such annotations would make literature search and data extraction much easier for systematic reviewers, thus reducing their workload and freeing more time for them to conduct thoughtful evidence synthesis.  This will be the first in-depth exploration of crowdsourcing for EBM. We will collect annotations from workers with varying levels of expertise and cost, ranging from medical students to workers recruited via Amazon Mechanical Turk. We will develop and evaluate novel methods of aggregating annotations from such heterogeneous sources. And we will use the acquired manual annotations to train machine learning models that automate this markup process. Models capable of automatically identifying clinically salient text snippets in full-text articles describing clinical trials would be broadly useful for biomedical literature retrieval tasks and would have impact beyond our immediate application of EBM.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We propose to develop crowdsourcing and machine learning methods to annotate clinically important sentences in full-text articles describing clinical trials Ultimately, we aim to automate such annotation, thereby enabling more efficient practice of evidence- based medicine (EBM).         ",Crowdsourcing Mark-up of the Medical Literature to Support Evidence-Based Medicine and Develop Automated Annotation Capabilities,9076888,UH2CA203711,"['Artificial Intelligence', 'Automated Annotation', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Crowding', 'Data', 'Data Quality', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Effectiveness', 'Eligibility Determination', 'Environment', 'Evidence Based Medicine', 'Health', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Individual', 'Information Retrieval', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Mechanics', 'Medical', 'Medical Students', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Paper', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Population Characteristics', 'Preparation', 'Process', 'Publishing', 'Quality of Care', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Reporting', 'Retrieval', 'Rewards', 'Source', 'System', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'Work', 'Workload', 'abstracting', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'collaborative environment', 'cost', 'crowdsourcing', 'demographics', 'detector', 'dosage', 'evidence base', 'learning strategy', 'meetings', 'novel', 'phrases', 'public health relevance', 'scale up', 'skills', 'systematic review', 'text searching', 'tool']",NCI,NORTHEASTERN UNIVERSITY,UH2,2016,240650,-0.03537460513548532
"Semi-structured Information Retrieval in Clinical Text for Cohort Identification DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques have shown promise for extracting data from the free text of electronic health records (EHRs), but studies have consistently found that techniques do not readily generalize across application settings. Unfortunately, most of the focus in applying NLP to real use cases has remained on a paradigm of single, well-defined application settings, so that generalizability to unseen use cases remains implicitly unaddressed. We propose to explicitly account for unseen application settings by adopting an information retrieval (IR) perspective with the objective of patient-level cohort identification. To do so, we introduce layered language models, an IR framework that enables the reuse of NLP-produced artifacts. Our long term goal is to accelerate investigations of patient health and disease by providing robust, user- centric tools that are necessary to process, retrieve, and utilize the free text of EHRs. The main goal of this proposal is to accurately retrieve ad hoc, realistic cohorts from clinical text at Mayo Clinic and OHSU, establishing methods, resources, and evaluation for patient-level IR. We hypothesize that cohort identification can be addressed in a generalizable fashion by a new IR framework: layered language models. We will test this hypothesis through four specific aims. In Aim 1, we will make medical NLP artifacts searchable in our layered language IR framework. This involves storing and indexing the NLP artifacts, as well as using statistical language models to retrieve documents based on text and its associated NLP artifacts. In Aim 2, we deal with the practical setting of ad hoc cohort identification, moving to patient-level (rather than document-level) IR. To accurately handle patient cohorts in which qualifying evidence may be spread over multiple documents, we will develop and implement patient-level retrieval models that account for cross- document relational and temporal combinations of events. In Aim 3, we will construct parallel IR test collections using EHR data from two sites; a diverse set of cohort queries written by multiple people toward various clinical or epidemiological ends; and assessments of which patients are relevant to which queries at both sites. Finally, in Aim 4, we refine and evaluate patient-level layered language IR on the ad hoc cohort identification task, making comparisons across the users, queries, optimization metrics, and institutions. We will draw additional extrinsic comparisons with pre-existing techniques, e.g., for cohorts from the Electronic Medical Records and Genonmics network. The expected outcomes of the proposed work are: (i) An open-source cohort identification tool, usable by clinicians and epidemiologists, that makes principled use of NLP artifacts for unseen queries; ii) A parallel test collection for cohort identification, includig two intra-institutional document collections, diverse test topics and user-produced text queries, and patient-level judgments of relevance to each query; and (iii) Validation of the reusability of medical NLP via the task of retrieving patient cohorts. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  With the widespread adoption of electronic medical records, one might expect that it would be simple for a medical expert to find things like ""patients in the community who suffer from asthma."" Unfortunately, on top of lab tests, medications, and demographic information, there are observations that a physician writes down as text - which are difficult for a computer to understand. Therefore, we aim to process text so that a computer can understand enough of it, and then search that text along with the rest of a patient's medical record; this will allow clinicians or researchers to find and study patients groups of interest.",Semi-structured Information Retrieval in Clinical Text for Cohort Identification,9115996,R01LM011934,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Adoption', 'Asthma', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Dictionary', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Epidemiologist', 'Epidemiology', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Evidence Based Medicine', 'Evolution', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Information Retrieval', 'Information Retrieval Systems', 'Institution', 'Interest Group', 'Investigation', 'Judgment', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Records', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Names', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Process', 'Publishing', 'Qualifying', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Retrieval', 'Sampling', 'Semantics', 'Site', 'Smoke', 'Source', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Validation', 'Weight', 'Work', 'Writing', 'asthmatic patient', 'base', 'cohort', 'improved', 'indexing', 'novel', 'open source', 'profiles in patients', 'query optimization', 'syntax', 'text searching', 'tool']",NLM,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,R01,2016,387966,-0.005030440714510568
"Natural language processing for clinical and translational research DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Rapid growth in the clinical implementation of large electronic medical records (EMRs) has led to an unprecedented expansion in the availability of dense longitudinal datasets for clinical and translational research. This growth is being fueled by recent federal legislation that provides generous financial incentives to institutions demonstrating aggressive application and ""meaningful use"" of comprehensive EMRs. Efforts are already underway to link these EMRs across institutions, and standardize the definition of phenotypes for large scale studies of disease onset and treatment outcome, specifically within the context of routine clinical care. However, a well-known challenge for secondary use of EMR data for clinical and translational research is that much of detailed patient information is embedded in narrative text. Natural Language Processing (NLP) technologies, which are able to convert unstructured clinical text into coded data, have been introduced into the biomedical domain and have demonstrated promising results. Researchers have used NLP systems to identify clinical syndromes and common biomedical concepts from radiology reports, discharge summaries, problem lists, nursing documentation, and medical education documents. Different NLP systems have been developed at different institutions and utilized to convert clinical narrative text into structured data that may be used for other clinical applications and studies. Successful stories in applying NLP to clinical and translational research have been reported widely. However, institutions often deploy different NLP systems, which produce various types of output formats and make it difficult to exchange information between sites. Therefore, the lack of interoperability among different clinical NLP systems becomes a bottleneck for efficient multi-site studies. In addition, many successful studies often require a strong interdisciplinary team where informaticians and clinicians have to work very closely to iteratively define optimal algorithms for clinical phenotypes. As intensive informatics support may not be available to every clinical researcher, the usability of NLP systems for end users is another important issue. The proposed project builds upon first-hand knowledge and experience across the research team in the use of NLP for clinical and translational research projects. There are several big informatics initiatives for clinical and translational research but those initiatives generally assume one shoe fits all and follow top-down approaches to develop NLP solutions. Complementary to those initiatives, we will use a bottom-up approach to handle interoperability and usability: i) we will obtain a common NLP data model and exchange format through empirical analysis of existing NLP systems and NLP results; ii) we will develop a user-centric NLP front end interface for NLP systems wrapped to be consistent with the proposed NLP data model and exchange format incorporating usability analysis into the agile development process. All deliverables will be distributed through the open health NLP (OHNLP) consortium which we intend to make it more open and inclusive. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Rapid growth in the clinical implementation of large electronic medical records (EMRs) has led to an unprecedented expansion in the availability of dense longitudinal datasets for clinical and translational research.

"MACE2K - Molecular And Clinical Extraction: A Natural Language Processing Tool for Personalized Medicine ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The velocity, variety, volume and veracity of data from relevant information sources make it extremely challenging for oncologists to collect and review pertinent data that can support routine personalized treatment for their patients. There is an urgent need to develop data wrangling approaches including Natural Language Processing and information retrieval methods to extract and curate personalized-therapy related publications and clinical trials. Once curated, the structured data can be used by biomedical researchers to generate novel scientific hypotheses, design new studies, obtain a better understanding of biological mechanisms of disease, perform meta-analyses, and create clinical decision support systems. There is an urgent need to develop improved search interfaces specific to the field of personalized therapy, including ways to display, rank, and save results by end users. While several database and web-based keyword search engine algorithms exist, there is a lack of tools that meet the unique challenges of personalized medicine. There is also an urgent need to develop software that allows for verification and validation of information extracted and ranked through computational methods using subject matter expertise to improve the gold standard corpus that can be used for biomedical research into personalized therapies.  To address these issues, we will build an innovative software stack (MACE2K) to adapt and extend widely tested Biocreative natural language processing (NLP) tools to automatically retrieve and pre-process targeted therapy information from clinicaltrials.gov, PubMed abstracts as well as open access articles, and conference proceedings. We will build an entity extraction cartridge to accurately parse gene mutations, translocations, gene expression, protein expression, and protein phosphorylation. A marker disambiguation cartridge will be built to assess for trial inclusion or exclusion criteria and to determine marker-related primary endpoints. We will include a ranking cartridge that uses the disambiguated information on markers, drugs and trials to provide a rigorous scoring of trials and studies according to their relevance for personalized medicine. A novel gamification cartridge will be built to allow subject matter experts to verify and validate the information corpus. Our research leverages National Cancer Institute's investments in several programs (many of which we are involved in) including the NCI drug dictionary, National Cancer Informatics Program (NCIP), I-SPY trials, and Center for cancer systems biology (CCSB) to efficiently accomplish our aims. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will develop new computational methods and software to retrieve targeted molecular and drug therapy information from multiple sources of big data including: clinicaltrials.gov, PubMed abstracts, open access articles, and conference proceedings.

Once curated, the structured data can be used by biomedical researchers to generate novel scientific hypotheses, design new studies, obtain a better understanding of biological mechanisms of disease, perform meta-analyses, and create clinical decision support systems. There is an urgent need to develop improved search interfaces specific to the field of personalized therapy, including ways to display, rank, and save results by end users. While several database and web-based keyword search engine algorithms exist, there is a lack of tools that meet the unique challenges of personalized medicine. There is also an urgent need to develop software that allows for verification and validation of information extracted and ranked through computational methods using subject matter expertise to improve the gold standard corpus that can be used for biomedical research into personalized therapies.  To address these issues, we will build an innovative software stack (MACE2K) to adapt and extend widely tested Biocreative natural language processing (NLP) tools to automatically retrieve and pre-process targeted therapy information from clinicaltrials.gov, PubMed abstracts as well as open access articles, and conference proceedings. We will build an entity extraction cartridge to accurately parse gene mutations, translocations, gene expression, protein expression, and protein phosphorylation. A marker disambiguation cartridge will be built to assess for trial inclusion or exclusion criteria and to determine marker-related primary endpoints. We will include a ranking cartridge that uses the disambiguated information on markers, drugs and trials to provide a rigorous scoring of trials and studies according to their relevance for personalized medicine. A novel gamification cartridge will be built to allow subject matter experts to verify and validate the information corpus. Our research leverages National Cancer Institute's investments in several programs (many of which we are involved in) including the NCI drug dictionary, National Cancer Informatics Program (NCIP), I-SPY trials, and Center for cancer systems biology (CCSB) to efficiently accomplish our aims. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will develop new computational methods and software to retrieve targeted molecular and drug therapy information from multiple sources of big data including: clinicaltrials.gov, PubMed abstracts, open access articles, and conference proceedings. The software can be used by biomedical researchers to generate new hypotheses for research on personalized cancer treatment decisions based on enormous volumes of public data already in existence. A novel gamification component will be built to allow subject matter experts to verify and validate the information corpus to enhance accuracy of the software.",MACE2K - Molecular And Clinical Extraction: A Natural Language Processing Tool for Personalized Medicine,9243496,U01HG008390,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Big Data', 'Big Data to Knowledge', 'Biological', 'Biomedical Research', 'Cancer Center', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Clinical Trials', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Crowding', 'Data', 'Data Aggregation', 'Databases', 'Dictionary', 'Disease', 'Exclusion Criteria', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Mutation', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Informatics', 'Information Retrieval', 'Investments', 'Letters', 'Literature', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Molecular Target', 'Mutation', 'National Cancer Institute', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Oncologist', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Peer Review', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phosphorylation', 'Process', 'PubMed', 'Publications', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Software Validation', 'Source', 'Structure', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'abstracting', 'base', 'crowdsourcing', 'data to knowledge', 'data wrangling', 'design', 'improved', 'inclusion criteria', 'innovation', 'interest', 'knowledge base', 'meetings', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'personalized cancer care', 'personalized cancer therapy', 'personalized medicine', 'programs', 'protein expression', 'search engine', 'software development', 'symposium', 'targeted treatment', 'tool', 'user friendly software', 'verification and validation']",NHGRI,GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY,U01,2016,150865,-0.017703992233050813
"Text Mining Pipeline to Accelerate Systematic Reviews in Evidence-Based Medicine We hypothesize that a flexible, configurable suite of automated informatics tools can reduce significantly the effort needed to generate systematic reviews while maintaining or even improving their quality. To test this hypothesis, we propose: Aim 1. To extend our research on automated RCT tagging to include additional study types and provide public resources. A) Machine learning models will be created that automatically assign probability estimates to three types of observational studies that are widely examined by systematic reviewers. B) The RCT and other taggers will be evaluated prospectively for newly published PubMed articles. C) All PubMed articles will be automatically tagged for RCT, cohort, case-control and cross-sectional studies and annotated in a public dataset linked to a public query interface. Users will also receive tags for articles from non-PubMed data sources on demand. Aim 2. To evaluate the performance and usability of our tools when used by systematic reviewers under field conditions. A) The tools will be customized and integrated to facilitate field evaluation. B) A three-stage evaluation: 1. Retrospective evaluation of Metta and RCT Tagger performance. 2. Real-time “shadowing”. 3. Prospective controlled study. Aim 3. To identify additional clinical trial articles, appearing after a published systematic review was completed, that are relevant to the review topic. Aim 4. To identify publications related to specific ClinicalTrials.gov registered trials. Aim 5. To develop and evaluate new machine learning methods and tools that will facilitate rapid evidence scoping for new systematic review topics. A) Methods will be developed for ranking articles with respect to their relevance to a proposed new systematic review topic. B) A scoping tool will be created that displays articles ranked by predicted relevance, tagged with study design attributes, sample sizes, and Cochrane risk of bias estimates. The proposed studies will advance the automation of early steps in the process of writing systematic reviews, and thereby enhance evidence-based medicine and the incorporation of best practices into clinical care. Project Narrative Systematic reviews are essential for determining which treatments and interventions are safe and effective. At present, systematic reviews are written largely by laborious manual methods. The proposed studies will reduce the time and effort needed to write systematic reviews, and thereby enhance evidence-based medicine and the incorporation of best practices into clinical care.",Text Mining Pipeline to Accelerate Systematic Reviews in Evidence-Based Medicine,9176354,R01LM010817,"['Automation', 'Clinical Trials', 'Controlled Study', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Evaluation', 'Evidence Based Medicine', 'Informatics', 'Intervention', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Observational Study', 'Performance', 'Probability', 'Process', 'PubMed', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sample Size', 'Staging', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Writing', 'case control', 'clinical care', 'cohort', 'flexibility', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'prospective', 'systematic review', 'text searching', 'tool', 'usability']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT CHICAGO,R01,2016,599995,0.018775828825779724
"Semi-Automating Data Extraction for Systematic Reviews ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Evidence-based medicine (EBM) looks to inform patient care with the totality of available relevant evidence. Systematic reviews are the cornerstone of EBM and are critical to modern healthcare, informing everything from national health policy to bedside decision-making. But conducting systematic reviews is extremely laborious (and hence expensive): producing a single review requires thousands of person-hours. Moreover, the exponential expansion of the biomedical literature base has imposed an unprecedented burden on reviewers, thus multiplying costs. Researchers can no longer keep up with the primary literature, and this hinders the practice of evidence-based care.      The long term aim of this work is to develop computational tools and methods that optimize the practice of EBM. The proposed work thus builds upon our previous successful efforts developing computational approaches that reduce the workload in EBM. More speciﬁcally, we aim to develop tools that semi-automate the laborious task of data extraction - identifying and extracting the information of interest (e.g., trial sample size, interventions and outcomes) from the free-texts of biomedical articles - via novel machine learning methods. Semi-automating this task will drastically reduce reviewer workload, thus enabling the practice of EBM in an age of information overload.      Previous efforts to automate data extraction from articles describing clinical trials have shown promise, but lack the accuracy and scope necessary for real-world use. These approaches have been impeded by the absence of a large corpus of annotated clinical trials, and by the difﬁculty of constructing models to automatically extract all of the variables necessary for synthesis. We describe methodological innovations to overcome these hurdles. First, to train our machine learning models we propose leveraging large existing databases that contain structured information about clinical trials, in lieu of the usual approach of collecting expensive manual annotations. Practically, this means we will be able to exploit a very large `pseudo-annotated' dataset that is an order of magnitude bigger than what has been used in previous efforts, thus substantially improving model performance. Our extensive preliminary work demonstrates the promise and feasibility of this approach. Second, we propose novel machine learning models appropriate for the tasks of article categorization and data extraction for EBM. These models will speciﬁcally be designed to perform extraction of multiple, correlated data elements of interest while simultaneously classifying articles into clinically salient categories useful for EBM.      We will rigorously evaluate the developed methods to assess their practical utility, speciﬁcally y comparing automated extraction accuracy to that achieved by trained systematic reviewers. And to make these methods useful to end-users (systematic reviewers), we will develop and evaluate open-source software and tools, including a web-based extraction tool that integrates our machine learning models to automatically extract information from uploaded articles (PDFs). We will conduct a user study to evaluate the utility and usability of this tool in practice. Public Health Narrative  We propose to develop computational methods and tools that make the practice of evidence-based medicine (EBM) more efﬁcient, speciﬁcally by semi-automating data extraction from the full-texts of articles describing clinical trials. Such tools would drastically reduce the workload currently involved in producing evidence syntheses, ultimately enabling evidence- based care in an era of information overload.",Semi-Automating Data Extraction for Systematic Reviews,9145775,R01LM012086,"['Age', 'Area', 'Beds', 'Caring', 'Categories', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Element', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Effectiveness of Interventions', 'Elements', 'Evidence Based Medicine', 'Evidence based practice', 'Exercise', 'Feedback', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Healthcare', 'Hour', 'Human Resources', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention', 'Letters', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Health Policy', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Population Characteristics', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Sample Size', 'Services', 'Side', 'Software Tools', 'Structure', 'System', 'Text', 'Training', 'Work', 'Workload', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'cost efficient', 'data mining', 'design', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'member', 'natural language', 'novel', 'open source', 'study characteristics', 'systematic review', 'tool', 'trial design', 'usability']",NLM,NORTHEASTERN UNIVERSITY,R01,2016,293874,-0.00364210186346585
"Evidence-based Strategy and Tool to Simplify Text for Patients and Consumers ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Lifespans continue to increase, chronic disease survival rates are drastically improved, and treatments are being discovered for a variety of illnesses. This rapidly changing scenario requires patients to participate in their recovery, understand written information and directions thereby calling upon patients to have increasingly more complex health literacy. However, time availability of practitioners or other resources to explain the required information has not increased to match. As a result, finding efficient means to improving patient health literacy is an increasingly important topic in healthcare. Increased health literacy may promote healthy lifestyle behaviors and increase access to health services by the population. It has been argued that for the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act to be successful, more effort is needed to increase the health literacy of millions of Americans. Similarly, the Healthy People 2020 statement by the Department of Health and Human Services identified improving health literacy (HC/HIT-1) as an important national goal. The broad- long term objectives of this project are to contribute to increasing the health literacy of patients and health information consumers and provide caregivers an evidence-based tool for simplifying text. The most commonly used tool for estimating the difficulty of text is the readability formula. They are not sufficient, however, because there is no evidence to support a connection between their use and decreases in difficulty. This problem is addressed by using modern resources and techniques for discovering traits that make health-related text difficult and developing a tool to guide the simplification of text. . There are four specific aims of this project: 1) Identify differentiating features of easy versus difficult texts, 2) Design a simplification strategy using computer algorithms, 3) Measure the impact of simplification on perceived and actual text difficulty with online participants and a representative community sample, 4) Create free, online software that incorporates proven features algorithmically. Corpus analysis will be conducted to compare easy and difficult texts with each other and discover lexical, grammatical, semantic, and composition and discourse features typical for each. Then, simplification algorithms will be designed and developed relying on rule-based techniques to leverage available resources, e.g., vocabularies, or on machine learning approaches for discovering the best combinations of features for simplification. A representative writer will simplify text by relying on the suggestios provided by an online that tool that uses simplification algorithms. The effect of simplification wll be tested in comprehensive user studies to evaluate the effect on both actual and perceived difficulty. Features successfully shown to decrease text difficulty will be incorporated in an onlie software program designed to reduce text difficulty. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Improving health literacy is an important national goal and necessary trait for a healthy population. Providing understandable information is critical but few tools exist to help write understandable text. We aim to discover features indicative of difficult text, design translation algorithms and create a free, online software tool for rewriting health-related text with demonstrated impact on perceived and actual text difficulty",Evidence-based Strategy and Tool to Simplify Text for Patients and Consumers,9127807,R01LM011975,"['Address', 'Advocate', 'Affect', 'Affordable Care Act', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Arizona', 'Behavior', 'Caregivers', 'Chronic Disease', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Comprehension', 'Computational Linguistics', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer software', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Data Set', 'Education', 'Education Projects', 'Ensure', 'Faculty', 'Feedback', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Promotion', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Health behavior', 'Health education', 'Healthcare', 'Healthy People 2020', 'Lead', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Informatics', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Mullerian duct inhibiting substance', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Readability', 'Reader', 'Recovery', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Semantics', 'Software Tools', 'Survival Rate', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Translations', 'Underserved Population', 'United States Dept. of Health and Human Services', 'Universities', 'Vocabulary', 'Work', 'Writing', 'base', 'college', 'combat', 'community based participatory research', 'cost effective', 'design', 'evidence base', 'health literacy', 'healthy lifestyle', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'lexical', 'programs', 'support tools', 'tool', 'trait', 'user-friendly', 'volunteer']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA,R01,2016,362613,-0.018124770981566105
"Crowd Sourcing Labels From Electronic Medical Records to Enable Biomedical Research ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Supervised machine learning is a popular method that uses labeled training examples to predict future outcomes.  Unfortunately, supervised machine learning for biomedical research is often limited by a lack of labeled data.  Current methods to produce labeled data involve manual chart reviews that are laborious and do not scale with data creation rates.  This project aims to develop a framework to crowd source labeled data sets from electronic medical records by forming a crowd of clinical personnel labelers.  The construction of these labeled data sets will allow for new biomedical research studies that were previously infeasible to conduct.  There are numerous practical and theoretical challenges of developing a crowd sourcing platform for clinical data.  First, popular, public crowd sourcing platforms such as Amazon's Mechanical Turk are not suitable for medical record labeling as HIPAA makes clinical data sharing risky.  Second, the types of clinical questions that are amenable for crowd sourcing are not well understood.  Third, it is unclear if the clinical crowd can produce labels quickly and accurately.  Each of these challenges will be addressed in a separate Aim. As the first Aim of this project, the team will evaluate different clinical crowd sourcing architectures.  The architecture must leverage the scale of the crowd, while minimizing patient information exposure.  De-identification tools will be considered to scrub clinical notes t reduce information leakage.  Using this design, the team will extend a popular open source crowd sourcing tool, Pybossa, and release it to the public.  As the second Aim, the team will study the type, structure, topic and specificity of clinical prediction questions, and how these characteristics impact labeler quality.  Lastly, the team will evaluate the quality and accuracy of collected clinical crowd sourced data on two existing chart review problems to determine the platform's utility.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Traditionally, clinical prediction models rely on supervised machine learning algorithms to probabilistically predict clinical events using labeled medical records.  When data sets are small, manual chart reviews performed by clinical staff are sufficient to label each outcome; however, as data sets have scaled up and researchers aim to study larger cohorts, current manual approaches become intractable.  The goal of this proposal is to develop a framework to crowd source labeled data sets from electronic medical records to support prediction model development.        ",Crowd Sourcing Labels From Electronic Medical Records to Enable Biomedical Research,9076555,UH2CA203708,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Asthma', 'Biomedical Research', 'Characteristics', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Collection', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Crowding', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disclosure', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Extravasation', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act', 'Human Resources', 'Incentives', 'Interview', 'Label', 'Machine Learning', 'Management Audit', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Medical Records', 'Medical Research', 'Medical Students', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nurses', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Privacy', 'Productivity', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Security', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'System', 'Time', 'Training', 'cohort', 'computer science', 'crowdsourcing', 'design', 'member', 'model development', 'open source', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'response', 'scale up', 'tool']",NCI,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,UH2,2016,316000,-0.005431213749526362
"The Center for Predictive Computational Phenotyping-1 Overall     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The biomedical sciences are being radically transformed by advances in our ability to monitor, record, store and integrate information characterizing human biology and health at scales that range from individual molecules to large populations of subjects. This wealth of information has the potential to substantially advance both our understanding of human biology and our ability to improve human health. Perhaps the most central and general approach for exploiting biomedical data is to use methods from machine learning and statistical modeling to infer predictive models. Such models take as input observable data representing some object of interest, and produce as output a prediction about a particular, unobservable property of the object.

"Utilizing social media as a resource for mental health surveillance DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Major depressive disorder is one of the most common debilitating illnesses in the United States, with a lifetime prevalence of 16.2%. Currently, nationwide mental health surveillance takes the form of large-scale telephone- based surveys. These surveys have high running costs and require teams of human telephone operators. Even the largest system, the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, reaches only 0.13% of the US population. Twitter (and other microblog services) offers a rich, if terse, multilingual source of real time data for public health surveillance. Natural Language Processing (NLP) provides techniques and resources to ""unlock"" data from text. We propose using Twitter and NLP as a cost-effective and flexible approach to augmenting current telephone- based surveillance methods for population level depression monitoring.         This grant application has two major strands. First, investigating ethical issues and challenges to privacy that emerge with the use of Twitter data for public health surveillance (Aim One). Second, developing techniques and resources for real-time public health surveillance for mental illness from Twitter (Aim Two &Aim Three). Aim One seeks to investigate and codify our responsibilities as researchers towards Twitter users by engaging with those users directly. With Aim Two, we will build and evaluate Natural Language Processing resources - algorithms, lexicons and taxonomies - to support the identification of depression symptoms in Twitter data. For Aim Three, we will build and evaluate Natural Language Processing modules and services that use Twitter as a data source for monitoring depression levels in the community. The significance of the proposed work lies in three areas. First, our investigations - both empirical and theoretical - will explore ethical issues in the use of Twitter for public health surveillance. This work has the potential to guide future research in the area. Second, in developing and evaluating algorithms and resources for identifying depression from tweets, we are contributing foundational work to the field of NLP. Third, developing these algorithms and resources will provide the bedrock for building social media based surveillance systems which will provide a cost effective means of augmenting current mental health surveillance practice. This proposal is innovative in both its application area (microblogs have not been used before for mental health surveillance), its focus on using NLP to identify depressive symptoms for public health, and in the central role that qualitative bioethical research will play in guiding the work. Project Narrative The proposed research focuses on using advanced Natural Language Processing methods to mine microblog data - in this case, Twitter - for mental health surveillance (specifically, depression surveillance), in order to augment current telephone-based mental health surveillance systems.

"Extended Methods and Software Development for Health NLP PROJECT SUMMARY There is a deluge of health-related texts in many genres, from the clinical narrative to newswire and social media. These texts are diverse in content, format, and style, and yet they represent complementary facets of biomedical and health knowledge. Natural Language Processing (NLP) holds much promise to extract, understand, and distill valuable information from these overwhelming large and complex streams of data, with the ultimate goal to advance biomedicine and impact the health and wellbeing of patients. There have been a number of success stories in various biomedical NLP applications, but the NLP methods investigated are usually tailored to one specific phenotype and one institution, thus reducing portability and scalability. Moreover, while there has been much work in the processing of clinical texts, other genres of health texts, like narratives and posts authored by health consumers and patients, are lacking solutions to marshal and make sense of the health information they contain. Robust NLP solutions that answer the needs of biomedicine and health in general have not been fully investigated yet. A unified, data-science approach to health NLP enables the exploration of methods and solutions unprecedented up to now.  Our vision is to unravel the information buried in the health narratives by advancing text-processing methods in a unified way across all the genres of texts. The crosscutting theme is the investigation of methods for health NLP (hNLP) made possible by big data, fused with health knowledge. Our proposal moves the field into exploring semi-supervised and fully unsupervised methods, which only succeed when very large amounts of data are leveraged and knowledge is injected into the methods with care. Our hNLP proposal also targets a key challenge of current hNLP research: the lack of shared software. We seek to provide a clearinghouse for software created under this proposal, and as such all developed tools will be disseminated. Starting from the data characteristics of health texts and information needs of stakeholders, we will develop and evaluate methods for information extraction, information understanding. We will translate our research into the publicly available NLP software platform cTAKES, through robust modules for extraction and understanding across all genres of health texts. We will also demonstrate impact of our methods and tools through several use cases, ranging from clinical point of care to public health, to translational and precision medicine, to participatory medicine. Finally, we will disseminate our work through community activities, such as challenges to advance the state of the art in health natural language processing. PROJECT NARRATIVE  There is a deluge of health texts. Natural Language Processing (NLP) holds much promise to unravel valuable information from these large data streams with the goal to advance medicine and the wellbeing of patients.

New approaches are needed to engage smokers in the 21st century in smoking cessation. I propose to develop S4S (Smokers for Smoker), a next- generation patient-centered computer tailored health communication (CTHC) system. Unlike current rule- based CTHCs, S4S will replace rules with complex machine learning algorithms, and use the collective experiences of thousands of smokers engaged in a web-assisted tobacco intervention to enhance personally- relevant tailoring for new smokers entering the system. This NCI K07 will provide a mentored research experience, giving me the opportunity to acquire new competencies in cancer health communication for behavior change, research design and statistical methods underlying clinical trial implementation and evaluation. I will adapt collectiv intelligence algorithms that have been used outside healthcare by companies like Amazon and Google to enhance CTHC. Using knowledge from scientific experts, current CTHC collect baseline patient ""profiles"" and then use expert-written, rule-based systems to tailor messages to patient subsets. Such theory-based ""market segmentation has been effective in helping patients reach lifestyle goals. However, there is a natural limit in the ability of a rule-based system to truly personalize content, and adapt personalization over time. Current CTHC have reached this limit, and I propose to go beyond. My first aim is to develop the Web 2.0 ""S4S"" recommender system. My second aim is to evaluate S4S within the context of a NCI funded web-assisted tobacco intervention (Decide2Quit.org). In my efforts, I will guided by my primary mentor (Dr. Houston, MD MPH) and two other mentor teams: The Cancer Health Behavior and Communication Team (Stephenie Lemon, PhD and Kathleen Mazor, EdD), and the Clinical Trial Design and Analysis Team (Jeroan Allison, MD, MS and Arlene Ash, PhD). My comprehensive training also includes coursework, seminars, and conferences. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: A high priority research area identified by the NIH is to understand the role of different media in increasing consumer demand for and use of effective, individually oriented tobacco cessation treatments for diverse populations. Specifically, a research focus is on understanding how to best tailor interventions. Although effective, there is a natural limit in the ability of current rle-based tailoring systems to truly personalize content, and adapt personalization over time. This NCI K07 will advance computer tailoring by adapting machine learning collective intelligence algorithms that have been used outside healthcare by companies like Amazon and Google to enhance the personal relevance of the health communication.",Developing Smokers for Smoker (S4S): A Collective Intelligence tailoring system,9118118,K07CA172677,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Attitude', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Carbon Monoxide', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Electronic Mail', 'Engineering', 'Evaluation', 'Feedback', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Communication', 'Health behavior', 'Healthcare', 'Intelligence', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Life Style', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Marketing', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Metadata', 'Modeling', 'Outpatients', 'Patients', 'Plant Roots', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Preventable cancer cause', 'Randomized', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Priority', 'Role', 'Smoker', 'Smoking', 'Smoking Behavior', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tobacco', 'Tobacco Use Cessation', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Visit', 'Withholding Treatment', 'Work', 'Writing', 'base', 'behavior change', 'behavioral construct', 'communication behavior', 'consumer demand', 'demographics', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'improved', 'insight', 'next generation', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'patient oriented', 'patient subsets', 'profiles in patients', 'programs', 'research study', 'skills', 'smoking cessation', 'symposium', 'theories', 'web services', 'web site']",NCI,UNIV OF MASSACHUSETTS MED SCH WORCESTER,K07,2016,139974,-0.011852573564303021
"Biomedical Data Translator Technical Feasibility Assessment and Architecture Design New technologies afford the acquisition of dense “data clouds” of individual humans. However, heterogeneity, dimensionality and multi-scale nature of such data (genomes, transcriptomes, clinical variables, etc.) pose a new challenge: How can one query such dense data clouds of mixed data as an integrated set (as opposed to variable by variable) against multiple knowledge bases, and translate the joint molecular information into the clinical realm? Current lexical mapping and brute-force data mining seek to make heterogeneous data interoperable and accessible but their output is fragmented and requires expertise to assemble into coherent actionable information. We propose DeepTranslate, an innovative approach that incorporates the known actual physical organization of biological entities that are the substrate of pathogenesis into (i) networks (data graphs) and (ii) hierarchies of concepts that span the multiscale space from molecule to clinic. Organizing data sources along such natural structures will allow translation of burgeoning high-dimensional data sets into concepts familiar to clinicians, while capturing mechanistic relationships. DeepTranslate will take a hybrid approach to learn and organize its content from both (i) existing generic comprehensive knowledge sources (GO, KEGG, IDC, etc.) and (ii) newly measured instances of individual data clouds from two demonstration projects: (1) ISB’s Pioneer 100 and (2) St. Jude Lifetime cancer survivors. We will focus on diabetes as test case. These two studies cover a deep biological scale-space and thus can test the full extent of the multiscale capacity of DeepTranslate in a focused application. 1. TYPES OF RESEARCH QUESTION ENABLED. How can a clinician find out that the dozens of “out of range” variables observed in a patient’s data cloud, form a connected set with respect to pathophysiology pathways, from gene to clinical variable? How can the high-dimensional data of studies that measure for each individual 100+ data points of various types (“personal data clouds”) be analyzed as one set in an integrated fashion (as opposed to variable by variable) against existing knowledge bases and also be used to improve the databases? DeepTranslate addresses these two types of questions and thereby will accelerate translation of future personal data clouds into (A) care decisions and (B) hypotheses on new disease mechanisms / treatments, thereby benefiting providers as well as researchers. 2. USE OF EXPERTISE AND RESOURCES. ■ ISB: pioneer in personalized, big-data driven medicine (Demo Project 1); biomedical content expertise; multiscale omics and molecular pathogenesis, big data analysis, housing of databases for public access; query engine designs, GUI. ■ UCSD: leader in biomedical data integration; automated assembly of molecular and clinical data into hierarchical structures; translation between data types ■ U Montreal: biomedical database curation from literature and construction of gene/protein/drug interaction networks; machine learning, open resource database ■ St Jude CRH: Cancer monitoring Demo Project 2, cancer patient data analytics. 3. POTENTIAL DATA AND INFRASTRUCTURE CHALLENGES. (a) Existing comprehensive clinical data sources are not uniform and not explicitly based on biological networks; cross-mapping is being performed at NLM based on lexical relationships: HPO (phenotypes) vs. SNOMED CT (for EMR) vs. IDC or Merck Manual (for diseases). Careful selection of these sources in close collaboration with NLM is needed. (b) Existing molecular pathway databases are static, based on averages of heterogeneous non-stratified populations, while the newly measured high-dimensional data clouds are varied due to intra-individual temporal fluctuation and inter-individual variation. How this will affect building of ontotypes in our hybrid approach, and how large cohorts of data clouds must be to offer statistical power is yet to be determined. Our two Demonstration Projects with their uniquely deep (high-dimensional and multiscale) data in cohorts of limited but growing size are thus crucial first steps in a long journey of collective learning in the TRANSLATOR community. n/a",Biomedical Data Translator Technical Feasibility Assessment and Architecture Design,9338977,OT3TR002026,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Architecture', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'CRH gene', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cancer Survivor', 'Caring', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Drug Interactions', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Gene Proteins', 'Generic Drugs', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Graph', 'Heterogeneity', 'Housing', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Individual', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Nature', 'Output', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Provider', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'SNOMED Clinical Terms', 'Saint Jude Children&apos', 's Research Hospital', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'base', 'cohort', 'data integration', 'data mining', 'design', 'improved', 'innovation', 'inter-individual variation', 'knowledge base', 'lexical', 'molecular assembly/self assembly', 'new technology', 'transcriptome']",NCATS,INSTITUTE FOR SYSTEMS BIOLOGY,OT3,2016,1071976,-0.03610528298404013
"InfoMediator: Weaving Clinical Expertise in Online Health Communities DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Chronic illness can be overwhelming to patients because it impacts many areas of their daily lives. Accordingly, many patients turn to online health support groups to get social support. In face-to-face patient support groups (F2F), health professional moderators provide clinical expertise within the context of peer-patients' sharing of experience. However, in online health community settings, because health professionals' time and resources are expensive, it is challenging to get health professionals' opinions for thousands of messages posted each day. To solve this problem, I propose to develop methods and techniques that maximize the use of already available clinical expertise online for online peer-patient conversation threads by developing a system, InfoMediator. The InfoMediator will semi-automatically weave health professionals' existing answers to patients' questions into peer-patient conversations by using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques complemented by user feedback. As the career development component of this proposal, I deepen my skills and knowledge in NLP necessary for proposed work and patient education. As I develop the NLP techniques and knowledge in patient education, I and my mentors will develop methods and techniques that address weaving clinical expertise within peer-patient conversations by designing, implementing, and evaluating socio-technical aspects of the InfoMediator. The training opportunities provided by this NIH NLM K01 grant, together with the supportive research environment at Michigan State University, will help further extend my existing expertise in human-computer interaction, design, and health informatics to establish my independent informatics research program in patient-centered technologies. Focusing on persons with diabetes, the outcomes of the proposed research will help us understand how to empower persons with diabetes to improve self- efficacy and self-care, while increasing the quality of online health information environment. 8. Project Narrative Because health professionals' time and resources are expensive, it is challenging for online health communities to engage health professionals in thousands of peer-patient conversations in the same way that health professionals moderate patient conversations in face-to-face patient support groups.

"An Intelligent Concept Agent for Assisting with the Application of Metadata PROJECT ABSTRACT Biomedical investigators are generating increasing amounts of complex and diverse data. This data varies tremendously, from genome sequences through phenotypic measurements and imaging data. If researchers and data scientists can tap into this data effectively, then we can gain insights into disease mechanisms and how to tackle them. However, the main stumbling block is that it is increasingly hard to find and integrate the relevant datasets due to the lack of sufficient metadata. A researcher studying Crohn's disease may miss a crucial dataset on how certain microbial communities affect gut histology due to the lack of descriptive tags on the data. Currently, applying metadata is difficult, time-consuming and error prone due to the vast sea of confusing and overlapping standards for each datatype. Often specialized `data wranglers' are employed to apply metadata, but even these experts are hindered by lack of good tools. Here we propose to develop an intelligent agent that researchers and data wranglers can use to assist them apply metadata. The agent is based around a personalized dashboard of metadata elements that can be collected from multiple specialized portals, as well as sites such as Wikipedia. These elements can be coupled with classifiers that can be used to self-identify datasets to which they may be relevant, making the selection of appropriate vocabularies easier for researchers. We will deploy the system for a number of targeted use cases, including annotation of the National Center for Biomedical Information Bio-Samples repository, and annotation of images within the Figshare repository. Project Narrative Biomedical data is being generated at an increasing rate, and it is becoming increasingly difficult for researchers to be able to locate and effectively operate over this data, which has negative impacts on the rate of new discoveries. One solution is to attach metadata (data about data) onto all information generated in a research project, but application of metadata is currently difficult and time consuming due to the diverse range of standards on offer, typically requiring the expertise of trained data wranglers. Here we propose to develop an intelligent concept assistant that will allow researchers to generate and share sets of metadata elements relevant to their project, and will use machine learning techniques to automatically apply this to data.",An Intelligent Concept Agent for Assisting with the Application of Metadata,9161233,U01HG009453,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Area', 'Categories', 'Classification', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Coupled', 'Crohn&apos', 's disease', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Deposition', 'Disease', 'Distributed Systems', 'Ecosystem', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Fostering', 'Frustration', 'Histology', 'Human Microbiome', 'Image', 'Intelligence', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Logic', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Metadata', 'Ontology', 'Process', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Sampling', 'Sea', 'Site', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Suggestion', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'Vision', 'Vocabulary', 'Work', 'base', 'dashboard', 'empowered', 'genome sequencing', 'improved', 'insight', 'meetings', 'microbial community', 'peer', 'repository', 'social', 'tool', 'transcriptomics', 'web portal']",NHGRI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIF-LAWRENC BERKELEY LAB,U01,2016,575532,-0.03349555844102996
"Hybrid Approaches to Optimizing Evidence Synthesis via Machine Learning and Crowdsourcing Abstract  Systematic reviews constitute the highest quality of evidence and form the cornerstone of evidence-based medicine (EBM). Such reviews now inform everything from national health policy guidelines to bedside care. However, systematic reviews are extremely laborious to produce; researchers can no longer keep pace with the massive amount of evidence now being published.  Semi-automation of systematic review production via machine learning (ML) has demonstrated the potential to substantially reduce reviewer workload while maintaining comprehensiveness. However, it is unlikely that machines will fully supplant human reviewers in the near future. Rather, human experts will probably remain in the loop, assisted by automated methods. Methods that exploit the intersection of human workers and ML models in the context of systematic reviews have not been explored at length. Furthermore, we believe there is substantial untapped potential in harnessing distributed crowd-workers to contribute to systematic reviews, and thus economize expert reviewer efforts. This novel avenue has largely been neglected as a means of increasing the efficiency of review production.  We propose addressing this gap by developing and evaluating novel, hybrid approaches to generating systematic reviews that jointly incorporate domain experts (systematic reviewers), layperson workers recruited via crowdworking platforms such as Amazon's Mechanical Turk and volunteer citizen scientists, while simultaneously capitalizing on ML models.  This innovative, hybrid approach will be the first in-depth exploration of intelligent ML/human systems that aim to reduce the workload in the production of biomedical systematic reviews. Our strong preliminary work demonstrates the promise of this general strategy.   We propose to develop hybrid approaches that combine crowdsourcing and machine learning methods to optimize the conduct of systematic reviews.  ",Hybrid Approaches to Optimizing Evidence Synthesis via Machine Learning and Crowdsourcing,9223968,R03HS025024,[' '],AHRQ,NORTHEASTERN UNIVERSITY,R03,2016,98635,0.011412115695226922
"Metadata applications on informed content to facilitate biorepository data regulation and sharing ABSTRACT Biorepositories are critical to enabling modern molecular-based research that will drive the development of a new generation of targeted diagnostics and therapies as well as personalized medicine to improve clinical outcomes for patients. The use of data and biospecimen resources collected during research are constrained by the informed consent that research participants give to research teams, research protocol documents, and the constraints imposed on the research by the IRB itself. Currently there is a lack of a common model of consent that limits how easily data (and research specimens) from multiple research projects, or multiple institutions can be combined for large-scale retrospective studies. Manually examining and reconciling potentially millions of informed consent forms from different biobanks becomes an expensive and possibly irreconcilable problem. The application of suitable metadata in support of the complex set of regulatory, legal, privacy and security requirement processes and information flows involved in regulated research is a field in an early phases of development. The complicated legal and technical requirements involved in the processes challenge our ability to effectively build information systems that support sharing of research data, specimens and other research artifacts at scale. Additionally, much of the regulatory processes involved in research are still based on paper-based workflows. We posit that by developing suitable machine-based metadata representation of regulatory processes focusing on informed consents and the associated documents would enhance the ability of regulatory bodies such as Institutional Review Boards to 1) review proposals in a more streamlined fashion, 2) have the potential to provide a more comprehensive understanding of risk along multiple axes, and 3) provide a formal and computable basis for data sharing and information release policies. More specifically we will focus on three specific aims: 1) Develop standard-conforming metadata representations of informed consent; 2) Develop NLP-based automatic annotation tool for informed consent documents; and 3) Evaluate the metadata-ontology-based approach for semantically representing the domain and demonstrate its capacity for answering competency questions. Our proposed approach is novel for the following reasons: 1) it provides the first metadata ontology, to the best of our knowledge, to represent the informed consent space while considering the US common rules; 2) it combines natural language processing technologies with ontology-based approaches for semantic annotation as well as ontology enrichment; and 3) it engages stakeholders in the ontology development and evaluation process and uses competency questions to verify the coverage of the ontology. PROJECT NARRATIVE The application of suitable metadata in support of the complex set of regulatory, legal, privacy and security requirement processes and information flows involved in regulated research is a field in an early phases of development. The complicated legal and technical requirements involved in the processes challenge our ability to effectively build information systems that support sharing of research data, specimens and other research artifacts at scale. In response to RFA-CA-15-017, this proposed project will develop suitable machine-based metadata representation and automatic annotation of regulatory processes focusing on informed consents and the associated documents. The proposed approach will presumably enhance the ability of regulatory bodies such as Institutional Review Boards to (a) review proposals in a more streamlined fashion, (b) have the potential to provide a more comprehensive understanding of risk along multiple axes, and (c) provide a formal and computable basis for data sharing and information release policies.",Metadata applications on informed content to facilitate biorepository data regulation and sharing,9161167,U01HG009454,"['Address', 'Adherence', 'Automated Annotation', 'Charge', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Consent', 'Consent Forms', 'Data', 'Data Element', 'Decision Making', 'Derivation procedure', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Elements', 'Ensure', 'Ethics', 'Evaluation', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Guidelines', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Information Systems', 'Informed Consent', 'Institution', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'Knowledge', 'Legal', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Ontology', 'Paper', 'Participant', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Phase', 'Policies', 'Privacy', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resources', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Rights', 'Risk', 'Science', 'Security', 'Semantics', 'Specimen', 'Support System', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Terminology', 'Text', 'Trust', 'Work', 'base', 'biobank', 'common rule', 'data integration', 'data modeling', 'data sharing', 'human subject', 'improved', 'information processing', 'knowledge base', 'novel', 'personalized medicine', 'repository', 'response', 'stem', 'tool']",NHGRI,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR HOUSTON,U01,2016,471848,-0.030946185614442095
"Tracking Evolution and Spread of Viral Genomes by Geospatial Observation Error ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Tracking evolutionary changes in viral genomes and their spread often requires the use of data deposited in public databases such as GenBank, the Influenza Research Database (IRD), or the Virus Pathogen Resource (ViPR). GenBank provides an abundance of available viral sequence data for phylogeography. Sequences and their metadata can be downloaded and imported into software applications that generate phylogeographic trees and models for surveillance. IRD and ViPR are NIH/NIAID funded programs that import data from GenBank but contain additional data sources, visualization, and search tools for their users. Tracking evolutionary changes and spread also requires the geospatial assignment of taxa, which is often obtained from GenBank metadata. Unfortunately, geospatial metadata such as host location is often uncertain in GenBank entries, with only 36% containing a precise location such as a county, town, or region within a state. For example, information such as China or USA was indicated instead of Beijing or Bedford, NH. While town or county might be included in the corresponding journal article, this valuable information is not available for immediate use unless it is extracted and then linked back to the appropriate sequence. The goal of our work is to enable health agencies and other researchers to automatically generate phylogeographic models that incorporate enhanced geospatial data for better estimates of virus spread. This proposal focuses on developing and applying information extraction and statistical phylogeography approaches to enhance models that track evolutionary changes in viral genomes and their spread. We propose a framework that uses natural language processing (NLP) for the automatic extraction of relevant geospatial data from the literature, and assigns a confidence between such geospatial mentions and the GenBank record. We will then use these locations and the estimates as observation error in the creation of phylogeographic models of zoonotic virus spread. We hypothesize that a combined NLP-phylogeography infrastructure that produces models that include observation error in the geospatial assignment of taxa will be closer to a gold standard than phylogeographic models that do not include them. Our research will extend phylogeography and zoonotic surveillance by: creating a NLP infrastructure that will improve the level of detail of geospatial data for phylogeography of zoonotic viruses (Aim 1), develop phylogeographic models using the estimates from Aim 1 as observation error (Aim 2), and evaluating our approach by comparing the models it produces to models that do not account for observation error in the geospatial assignment of taxa (Aim 3). We will allow users to generate enhanced models and view results on a web portal accessible via a LinkOut feature from GenBank, IRD, and ViPR. The addition of more precise geospatial information in building such models could enable health agencies to better target areas that represent the greatest public health risk.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We will develop and evaluate an infrastructure that uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) to identify more precise geographic information for modeling spread of zoonotic viruses. These new models could enable public health agencies to identify the most at-risk areas. In addition, by improving geospatial information in popular sequence databases such as GenBank, we will enrich other sciences that utilize this information such as molecular epidemiology, population genetics, and environmental health.                ",Tracking Evolution and Spread of Viral Genomes by Geospatial Observation Error,9065021,R01AI117011,"['Accounting', 'Animals', 'Applied Research', 'Area', 'Award', 'Back', 'China', 'Computer software', 'County', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Diffusion', 'Disease', 'Environmental Health', 'Evaluation', 'Evolution', 'Funding', 'Genbank', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Hantavirus', 'Health', 'Human', 'Imagery', 'Influenza', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Location', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Epidemiology', 'National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nucleotides', 'Population Genetics', 'Public Health', 'Publications', 'RNA Viruses', 'Rabies', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Science', 'Source', 'Surveillance Modeling', 'System', 'Taxon', 'Time', 'Trees', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Viral', 'Viral Genome', 'Virus', 'Work', 'improved', 'information model', 'interest', 'journal article', 'pathogen', 'population health', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'simulation', 'surveillance data', 'tool', 'web portal']",NIAID,ARIZONA STATE UNIVERSITY-TEMPE CAMPUS,R01,2016,479735,0.007010089387669594
"Secondary use of EMRs for surgical complication surveillance DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Recent statistics indicate that worldwide almost 234 million major surgical procedures are performed each year with the rates of major postsurgical complications (PSCs) range from 3% to 16% and rates of permanent disability or death range from 0.4% to 0.8%. Early detection of PSCs is crucial since early intervention could be lifesaving. Meanwhile, with the rapid adoption of electronic medical records (EMRs) and the accelerated advance of health information technology (HIT), detection of PSCs by applying advanced analytics on EMRs makes it possible for near real-time PSC surveillance. We have developed a rule-based PSC surveillance system to detect most frequent colorectal PSCs near real-time from EMRs where a pattern-based natural language processing (NLP) engine is used to extract PSC related information from text and a set of expert rules is used to detect PSCs. Two challenges are identified. First, it is very challenging to integrate a diverse set of relevant data using expert rules. In the past, probabilistic approaches such as Bayesian Network which can integrate a diverse set of relevant data have become popular in clinical decision support and disease outbreak surveillance. Can we implement probabilistic approaches for PSC surveillance? Secondly, a large portion of the clinical information is embedded in text and it has been quite expensive to manually obtain the patterns used in the NLP system since it requires team effort of subject matter experts and NLP specialists. In the research field, statistical NLP has been quite popular. However, decision making in clinical practice demands tractable evidences while models for statistical NLP are not human interpretable. Can we incorporate statistical NLP to accelerate the NLP knowledge engineering process? We hypothesize that a probabilistic approach for PSC surveillance can be developed for improved case detection which can integrate multiple evidences from structured as well as unstructured EMR data. We also hypothesize that empirical NLP can accelerate the knowledge engineering process needed for building pattern- based NLP systems used in practice. Specific aims include: i) developing and evaluating an innovative Bayesian PSC surveillance system that incorporates evidences from both structured and unstructured EMR data; and ii) incorporating and evaluating statistical NLP in accelerating the NLP knowledge engineering process of pattern-based NLP for PSC surveillance. Given the significance of HIT, our study results will advance the science in developing practical NLP systems that can be translated to meet NLP needs in health care practice. Additionally, given the significance of PSCs, our study results will address significant patient safety and quality issues in surgical practice. Utilizing automated methods to detect postsurgical complications will enable early detection of complications compared to other methods and therefore have great potential of improving patient safety and health care quality while reducing cost. The results could lead to large scale PSC surveillance and quality improvement towards safer and better health care. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Rapid growth in the clinical implementation of large electronic medical records (EMRs) has led to unprecedented opportunities to use EMRs for clinical practice and research. We explore the use of EMRs for near real-time postsurgical complication surveillance with the aim of improving health care quality and reducing health care cost through enhanced analytics towards surgical excellence.",Secondary use of EMRs for surgical complication surveillance,9050675,R01EB019403,"['Abscess', 'Address', 'Adoption', 'Age', 'Anesthetics', 'Area', 'Bayesian Method', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Colorectal', 'Complex', 'Complication', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Educational workshop', 'Engineering', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Healthcare', 'Hemorrhage', 'Human', 'Ileus', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Manuals', 'Methods', 'Minor', 'Motivation', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Nutritional', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perioperative', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Process', 'Registries', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk Factors', 'Science', 'Severities', 'Specialist', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Surgeon', 'Surgical complication', 'System', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Uncertainty', 'Work', 'Wound Infection', 'abstracting', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'computer based statistical methods', 'cost', 'disability', 'health care quality', 'health information technology', 'improved', 'innovation', 'meetings', 'patient safety', 'rapid growth', 'statistics']",NIBIB,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,R01,2016,300000,-0.03189371190992208

"COINSTAC: decentralized, scalable analysis of loosely coupled data ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     The brain imaging community is greatly benefiting from extensive data sharing efforts currently underway5,10. However, there is a significant gap in existing strategies which focus on anonymized, post-hoc sharing of either 1) full raw or preprocessed data [in the case of open studies] or 2) manually computed summary measures [such as hippocampal volume11, in the case of closed (or not yet shared) studies] which we propose to address. Current approaches to data sharing often include significant logistical hurdles both for the investigator sharing the dat as well as for the individual requesting the data (e.g. often times multiple data sharing agreements and approvals are required from US and international institutions). This needs to change, so that the scientific community becomes a venue where data can be collected, managed, widely shared and analyzed while also opening up access to the (many) data sets which are not currently available (see recent overview on this from our group2).    The large amount of existing data requires an approach that can analyze data in a distributed way while also leaving control of the source data with the individual investigator; this motivates  dynamic, decentralized way of approaching large scale analyses. We are proposing a peer-to-peer system called the Collaborative Informatics and Neuroimaging Suite Toolkit for Anonymous Computation (COINSTAC). The system will provide an independent, open, no-strings-attached tool that performs analysis on datasets distributed across different locations. Thus, the step of actually aggregating data can be avoided, while the strength of large-scale analyses can be retained. To achieve this, in Aim 1, the uniform data interfaces that we propose will make it easy to share and cooperate. Robust and novel quality assurance and replicability tools will also be incorporated. Collaboration and data sharing will be done through forming temporary (need and project-based) virtual clusters of studies performing automatically generated local computation on their respective data and aggregating statistics in global inference procedures. The communal organization will provide a continuous stream of large scale projects that can be formed and completed without the need of creating new rigid organizations or project-oriented storage vaults. In Aim 2, we develop, evaluate, and incorporate privacy-preserving algorithms to ensure that the data used are not re-identifiable even with multiple re-uses. We also will develop advanced distributed and privacy preserving approaches for several key multivariate families of algorithms (general linear model, matrix factorization [e.g. independent component analysis], classification) to estimate intrinsic networks and perform data fusion. Finally, in Aim 3, we will demonstrate the utility of this approach in a proof of concept study through distributed analyses of substance abuse datasets across national and international venues with multiple imaging modalities. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Hundreds of millions of dollars have been spent to collect human neuroimaging data for clinical and research purposes, many of which don't have data sharing agreements or collect sensitive data which are not easily shared, such as genetics. Opportunities for large scale aggregated analyses to infer health-relevant facts create new challenges in protecting the privacy of individuals' data. Open sharing of raw data, though desirable from the research perspective, and growing rapidly, is not a good solution for a large number of datasets which have additional privacy risks or IRB concerns. The COINSTAC solution we are proposing will capture this 'missing data' and allow for pooling of both open and 'closed' repositories by developing privacy preserving versions of widely-used algorithms and incorporating within an easy-to-use platform which enables distributed computation. In addition, COINSTAC will accelerate research on both open and closed data by offering a distributed computational solution for a large toolkit of widely used algorithms.","COINSTAC: decentralized, scalable analysis of loosely coupled data",9100683,R01DA040487,"['AODD relapse', 'Accounting', 'Address', 'Agreement', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Algorithms', 'Attention', 'Brain imaging', 'Classification', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Consent Forms', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Aggregation', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Ensure', 'Family', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Markers', 'Health', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Institution', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'International', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Left', 'Letters', 'Linear Models', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Movement', 'Paper', 'Plant Roots', 'Poaceae', 'Population', 'Privacy', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Science', 'Site', 'Stream', 'Substance abuse problem', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'base', 'computing resources', 'connectome', 'cost', 'data sharing', 'distributed data', 'flexibility', 'imaging genetics', 'imaging modality', 'independent component analysis', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'open data', 'peer', 'quality assurance', 'repository', 'statistics', 'tool', 'virtual']",NIDA,THE MIND RESEARCH NETWORK,R01,2016,680020,0.010323173701239172

"Clinic Interactions of a Brain-Computer Interface for Communication ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The promise of brain-computer interfaces (BCI) for communication is becoming a reality for individuals with severe speech and physical impairments (SSPI) who cannot rely on speech or writing to express themselves. While the majority of research efforts are devoted to technology development to address problems of stability, reliability and/or classification, clinical and behavioral challenges are becoming more apparent as individuals with SSPI and their family/care teams assess the systems during novice or long-term trials. The objective of the RSVP Keyboard(tm) BCI translational research team is to address the clinical challenges raised during functional BCI use with innovative engineering design, thereby enhancing the potential of this novel assistive technology. Four specific aims are proposed: (1) to develop a BCI Communication Application Suite (BCI-CAS) that offers a set of language modules to people with SSPI that can meet their language/literacy skills; (2) to develop improved statistical signal models for personalized feature extraction, artifact/interference handling, and robust, accurate intent evidence extraction from physiologic signals; (3) to develop improved language models and stimulus sequence optimization methods; and (4) to evaluate cognitive variables that affect learning and performance of the BCI-CAS. Five language modules are proposed that rely on a multimodal evidence fusion framework for model-based context-aware optimal intent inference: RSVP Keyboard(tm) generative spelling; RSVP texting; RSVP in-context typing; RSVP in-context icon typing; and binary yes/no responses with SSVEPs. Usability data on the current RSVP Keyboard(tm) and SSVEP system drive all proposed aims. Users select a language module, and the BCI system optimizes performance for each individual based on user adaptation, intent inference, and personalized language modeling. A unique simulation function drives individualization of system parameters. The robustness of the BCI customization efforts are evaluated continually by adults with SSPI and neurotypical controls in an iterative fashion. The effect of three intervention programs that address the cognitive construct of attention (process-specific attention training, mindfulness meditation training and novel stimulus presentations) will be implemented through hypothesis-driven single subject designs. Thirty participants, ages 21 years and older with SSPI will be included in home-based interventions. By measuring information transfer rate (ITR), user satisfaction, and intrinsic user factors, we will identify learning strategies that influence BCI sill acquisition and performance for adults with neurodegenerative or neurodevelopmental conditions. The translational teams include (1) signal processing (Erdogmus); (2) clinical neurophysiology (Oken); (3) natural language processing (Bedrick/Gorman); and (4) assistive technology (Fried-Oken). We continue to rely on a solid Bayesian foundation and theoretical frameworks: ICF disability classification (WHO, 2001), the AAC model of participation (Beukelman & Mirenda, 2013) and the Matching Person to Technology Model (Scherer, 2002). PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The populations of patients with severe speech and physical impairments secondary to neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative diseases are increasing as medical technologies advance and successfully support life. These individuals with limited to no movement could potentially contribute to their medical decision making, informed consent, and daily caregiving if they had faster, more reliable means to interface with communication systems. The BCI Communication Applications Suite is a hybrid brain-computer interface that is an innovative technological advance so that patients and their families can participate in daily activities and advocate for improvements in standard clinical care.

"Semantic Data Lake for Biomedical Research Capitalizing on the transformative opportunities afforded by the extremely large and ever-growing volume, velocity, and variety of biomedical data being continuously produced is a major challenge. The development and increasingly widespread adoption of several new technologies, including next generation genetic sequencing, electronic health records and clinical trials systems, and research data warehouses means that we are in the midst of a veritable explosion in data production. This in turn results in the migration of the bottleneck in scientific productivity into data management and interpretation: tools are urgently needed to assist cancer researchers in the assembly, integration, transformation, and analysis of these Big Data sets. In this project, we propose to develop the Semantic Data Lake for Biomedical Research (SDL-BR) system, a cluster-computing software environment that enables rapid data ingestion, multifaceted data modeling, logical and semantic querying and data transformation, and intelligent resource discovery. SDL-BR is based on the idea of a data lake, a distributed store that does not make any assumptions about the structure of incoming data, and that delays modeling decisions until data is to be used. This project adds to the data lake paradigm methods for semantic data modeling, integration, and querying, and for resource discovery based on learned relationships between users and data resources. The SDL-BR System is a distributed computing software solution that enables research institutions to manage, integrate, and make available large institutional data sets to researchers, and that permits users to generate data models specific to particular applications. It uses state of the art cluster computing, Semantic Web, and machine learning technologies to provide for rapid data ingestion, semantic modeling and querying, and search and discovery of data resources through a sophisticated, Web-based user interface.",Semantic Data Lake for Biomedical Research,9200905,R44CA206782,"['Accelerometer', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adoption', 'Area', 'Big Data', 'Biomedical Computing', 'Biomedical Research', 'Cataloging', 'Catalogs', 'Chronic Myeloid Leukemia', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collection', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Collection', 'Data Discovery', 'Data Quality', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Decision Modeling', 'Demographic Factors', 'Development', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Explosion', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Markers', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Immigration', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Ingestion', 'Institution', 'Knowledge', 'Knowledge Extraction', 'Learning', 'Legal', 'Legal patent', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Non-Small-Cell Lung Carcinoma', 'Online Systems', 'Ontology', 'Phase', 'Policies', 'Precision therapeutics', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Production', 'Productivity', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resources', 'Retrieval', 'Risk', 'Secure', 'Security', 'Semantics', 'Services', 'Source', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Vocabulary', 'Work', 'base', 'cancer therapy', 'cluster computing', 'computer based Semantic Analysis', 'cost effective', 'data access', 'data exchange', 'data integration', 'data management', 'data modeling', 'design', 'disease heterogeneity', 'experience', 'genetic information', 'handheld mobile device', 'indexing', 'individualized medicine', 'melanoma', 'natural language', 'new technology', 'next generation', 'novel', 'precision medicine', 'prototype', 'success', 'systems research', 'targeted treatment', 'technology development', 'time use', 'tool']",NCI,"INFOTECH SOFT, INC.",R44,2016,221175,-0.037766474582902734
"Encoding and Processing Patient Allergy Information in EHRs DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Allergies affect one in five Americans and are the 5th leading chronic disease in the U.S. Each year, allergies account for more than 17 million outpatient office visits. Although documenting and exchanging allergy information in electronic health records (EHRs) is becoming increasingly important, we still face multiple challenges. These include: lack of well-adopted standard terminologies for representing allergies, frequent entry of allergy information as free-text, and no existing process for reconciling allergy information. In this study, we will provide solutions to these challenges by addressing the following specific aims: 1) conduct analyses on standard terminologies and a large allergy repository to build a comprehensive knowledge base for representing allergy information; 2) design, develop and evaluate a natural language processing (NLP) module for extracting and encoding free-text allergy information and integrate it with an existing NLP system; 3) measure the feasibility and efficiency of the proposed NLP system for the new process of allergy reconciliation; and 4) distribute our methods and tool, so they are widely available to other researchers and healthcare institutions for non-commercial use. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Managing allergy information within the electronic health record (EHR) is vital to ensuring patient safety. The goal of this study is to propose a comprehensive solution to assess existing terminology standards and knowledge bases for representing allergy information, develop and evaluate a natural language processing (NLP) system for extracting and encoding allergy information from free-text clinical documents, and finally measure the feasibility of using NLP output to facilitate the allergy reconciliation proces.",Encoding and Processing Patient Allergy Information in EHRs,9142280,R01HS022728,[' '],AHRQ,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2016,491053,-0.01035204437919014
"Scalable EEG interpretation using Deep Learning and Schema Descriptors ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Electronic medical records (EMRs) collected at every hospital in the country collectively contain a staggering wealth of biomedical knowledge. EMRs can include unstructured text, temporally constrained measurements (e.g., vital signs), multichannel signal data (e.g., EEGs), and image data (e.g., MRIs). This information could be transformative if properly harnessed. Information about patient medical problems, treatments, and clinical course is essential for conducting comparative effectiveness research. Uncovering clinical knowledge that enables comparative research is the primary goal of this proposal. We will focus on the automatic interpretation of clinical EEGs collected over 12 years at Temple University Hospital (over 25,000 sessions and 15,000 patients). Clinicians will be able to retrieve relevant EEG signals and EEG reports using standard queries (e.g. ""Young patients with focal cerebral dysfunction who were treated with Topamax""). In Aim 1 we will automatically annotate EEG events that contribute to a diagnosis. We will develop automated techniques to discover and time-align the underlying EEG events using semi-supervised learning. In Aim 2 we will process the text from the EEG reports using state-of-the-art clinical language processing techniques. Clinical concepts, their type, polarity and modality shall be discovered automatically, as well as spatial and temporal information. In addition, we shall extract the medical concepts describing the clinical picture of patients from the EEG reports. In Aim 3, we will develop a patient cohort retrieval system that will operate on the clinical knowledge extracted in Aims 1 and 2. In addition we shall organize this knowledge in a unified representation: the Qualified Medical Knowledge Graph (QMKG), which will be built using BigData solutions through MapReduce. The QMKG will be able to be searched by biomedical researchers as well as practicing clinicians. The QMKG will also provide a characterization of the way in which events in an EEG are narrated by physicians and the validation of these across a BigData resource. The EMKG represents an important contribution to basic science. In Aim 4 we will validate the usefulness of the patient cohort identification system by collecting feedback from clinicians and medical students who will participate in a rigorous evaluation protocol. Inclusion and exclusion criteria for the queries shall be designed and experts will provide relevance judgments for the results. For each query, medical experts shall examine the top-ranked cohorts for common precision errors (false positives) and the bottom five ranked common recall errors (false negatives). User validation testing will be performed using live clinical data and the feedback wil enhance the quality of the cohort identification system. The existence of an annotated BigData archive of EEGs will greatly increase accessibility for non- experts in neuroscience, bioengineering and medical informatics who would like to study EEG data. The creation of this resource through the development of efficient automated data wrangling techniques will demonstrate that a much wider range of BigData bioengineering applications are now tractable. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The primary goal of this proposal is to enable comparative research by automatically uncovering clinical knowledge from a vast BigData archive of clinical EEG signals and EEG reports collected over the past 12 years at Temple University Hospital. In the proposed project, we will develop a proof-of-concept based on the discovery of patient cohorts and provide an annotated BigData archive as well as the software that enabled the annotations and the generation of the patient cohort retrieval system. This resource will be accompanied by a novel medical knowledge representation generated with MapReduce, greatly increasing accessibility for non- experts in neuroscience, bioengineering and medical informatics, and demonstrating the transformative potential of mining the staggering wealth of biomedical knowledge available in hospital medical records.",Scalable EEG interpretation using Deep Learning and Schema Descriptors,9243724,U01HG008468,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Archives', 'Area', 'Basic Science', 'Big Data', 'Bilateral', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Blinking', 'Cerebrum', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Code', 'Comparative Study', 'Computer software', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Country', 'Data', 'Descriptor', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diffuse', 'Discharge from eye', 'Electroencephalography', 'Epilepsy', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Exclusion Criteria', 'Feedback', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Health', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Judgment', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Link', 'Measurement', 'Medical', 'Medical Informatics', 'Medical Records', 'Medical Students', 'Mining', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Multimedia', 'Nature', 'Neurosciences', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physicians', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Qualifying', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Support', 'Resources', 'Retrieval', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'University Hospitals', 'Validation', 'base', 'career', 'cohort', 'comparative', 'comparative effectiveness', 'data archive', 'data wrangling', 'design', 'effectiveness research', 'inclusion criteria', 'information organization', 'language processing', 'novel', 'repository']",NHGRI,TEMPLE UNIV OF THE COMMONWEALTH,U01,2016,374745,-0.010733413847295993
"Empiric Testing and enhancement of web-based abstract screening tool(Abstrackr) EMPIRICAL TESTING AND ENHANCEMENT OF WEB-BASED ABSTRACT SCREENING TOOL (ABSTRACKR)  In this year-long project, we aim to empirically assess the performance and efficiency of state-of-the-art information analysis technologies to assist the production of systematic reviews and meta-analyses that are increasingly being used as a foundation for evidence-based medicine and stakeholder-driven comparative effectiveness reviews. We have developed AbstrackrTM (hereon, Abstrackr), a human-guided computerized abstract screening tool that aims to reduce the need to perform a tedious but crucial step of manually screening many thousands of abstracts generated by literature searches in order to retrieve a small fraction potentially relevant for further analysis. Abstrackr makes use of machine learning techniques, and is offered as a free web-based tool that enables management of the screening process.  We also aim to revise the web-interface of Abstrackr to make it more intuitive, user friendly, and add documentation and functionalities requested by users; and to revise Abstrackr’s back-end, which includes the way the software parses and analyses citations, fits machine learning models, and makes computations, to make it more efficient. These revisions will ensure that the tool becomes more robust, and that it remains usable for larger projects and for many teams.  The proposed work will be carried out by the developers of Abstrackr, comprising a highly experienced team of systematic review investigators and computer scientists at Brown University and the University of Texas at Austin, who have been working together for at least seven years. We will pursue dissemination of the findings of this assessment and of the revised tool through numerous channels including, but not limited to publication, presentation at conferences, exploring interest in its wider adoption by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality Evidence-based Practice Center Program, Cochrane Collaboration, and other groups conducting systematic reviews. We will also continue to make all code available online. Our aims are to: Aim 1. Empirically measure the efficiency and accuracy of the prediction algorithms in Abstrackr in the computer-assisted semi-automated screening of citations for eligibility in systematic reviews. Aim 2. Improve and add to the functionality of the Web-based Abstrackr software, based in part on enhancements suggested by a panel of identified heavy users. Systematic reviewing is a scientific approach to objectively summarizing the effectiveness and safety of existing treatments for diseases, a prerequisite for informed healthcare decision-making and systematic reviewers must read many thousands of medical study abstracts, the vast majority of which are completely irrelevant to the review at hand. This is hugely laborious and time consuming. We propose to assess the performance and efficiency of a computerized system that automatically excludes a large number of the irrelevant abstracts, thereby accelerating the process and expediting the application of the systematic review findings to patient care, and to augment the functionality of its public implementation.",Empiric Testing and enhancement of web-based abstract screening tool(Abstrackr),9168247,R03HS024812,[' '],AHRQ,BROWN UNIVERSITY,R03,2016,99999,-0.011022456439139672
"Supporting Systematic Review Production with Article Similarity Network Visualization PROJECT SUMMARY Systematic reviews (SRs), or systematic reviews of literature, summarize evidence drawn from high quality studies, and are often the preferred source of evidence-based practice (EBP). However, conducting an SR is labor-intensive and time consuming, typically requiring several months to complete. It has been reported that more than ten thousands of SRs are needed to synthesize existing medical knowledge. An Article screening process is one of the most intensive and time consuming steps, which requires SR researchers to screen a large amount of references, ranging from hundreds to more than 10,000 articles, depending on the size of a SR. In the past 10 years, machine learning model training approaches24-29 were developed to accelerate the article selection process through automation. However, they are not widely used due to diffusion challenges.7,14 Major obstacles include 1) a training sample is required to generate the automation algorithm. If the training sample is biased, the article selection process will systematically fail; 2) the automation approach is not made available for non-computer science specialists, therefore SR researchers will not be able to “fine-tune” the automation algorithm for particular conditions in various SR topics; 3) As there is no global automation algorithm, the generalizability is significantly limited; 4) It is difficult to assess the actual workload saved, while finding every relevant article is required in SR. We propose a new approach to provide views of article relationships in an article network. This is different from other bibliometric networks constructing citation, co-author, or co-occurrence networks. Article network is a simple and logical concept: visualizing article relationships and distribution based on articles' similarities in titles, abstracts, keywords, publication types, etc. SR researchers can also alter the article distribution by adjusting the similarities. This approach does not aim to suggest an end-point of the screening process. Rather, it provides a view of distribution for included, excluded, and undecided articles. In the proposed research, we will integrate advanced techniques to sparsify article networks with mixed sparsification methods, and improve the quality and efficiency of large network visualization layouts by constructing a multi-level network structure and advanced force model. We aim to provide approaches to sparsify and visualize article networks with more than 10,000 articles. Our approach is highly generalizable that it can be used for any health science topics. By viewing the article distribution, SR researchers will be able to screen a large amount of literature more efficiently. This approach can be integrated into current SR technologies and used directly by SR researchers. The success of this project can support SR production on any health science topics, and thus streamline their ultimate application in EBP paradigms. PROJECT NARRATIVE Systematic reviews (SRs) provide the highest quality of research evidence for patient care. To accelerate the production of SRs, we will implement advanced visualization techniques to view article relationships and distribution with article networks and in a timely and human readable manner. The success of the project will support SR production and thus streamline their ultimate application to evidence-based practice.",Supporting Systematic Review Production with Article Similarity Network Visualization,9227858,R03HS025047,[' '],AHRQ,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,R03,2016,100000,-0.00025872533728487626
"Interactive machine learning methods for clinical natural language processing DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Growing deployments of electronic health records (EHRs) systems have made massive clinical data available electronically. However, much of detailed clinical information of patients is embedded in narrative text and is not directly accessible for computerized clinical applications. Therefore, natural language processing (NLP) technologies, which can unlock information in narrative document, have received great attention in the medical domain. Current state-of-the-art NLP approaches often involve building probabilistic models. However, the wide adoption of statistical methods in clinical NLP faces two grand challenges: 1) the lack of large annotated clinical corpora; and 2) the lack of methodologies that can efficiently integrate linguistic and domain knowledge with statistical learning. High-performance statistical NLP methods rely on large scale and high quality annotations of clinical text, but it is time-consuming and costly to create large annotated clinica corpora as it often requires manual review by physicians. Moreover, the medical domain is knowledge intensive. To achieve optimal performance, probabilistic models need to leverage medical domain knowledge. Therefore, methods that can efficiently integrate domain and expert knowledge with machine learning processes to quickly build high-quality probabilistic models with minimum annotation cost would be highly desirable for clinical text processing.    In this study, we propose to investigate interactive machine learning (IML) methods to address the above challenges in clinical NLP. An IML system builds a classification model in an iterative process, which can actively select informative samples for annotation based on models built on previously annotated samples, thus reducing the annotation cost for model development. More importantly, an IML system also involves human inputs to the learning process (e.g., an expert can specify important features for a classification task based on domain knowledge). Thus, IML is an ideal framework for efficiently integrating rule-based (via domain experts specifying features) and statistics-based (via different learning algorithms) approaches to clinical NLP. To achieve our goal, we propose three specific aims. In Aim 1, we plan to investigate different aspects of IML for word sense disambiguation, including developing new active learning algorithms and conducting cognitive usability analysis for efficient feature annotation by users. To demonstrate the broad uses of IML, we further extend IML approaches to two other important clinical NLP classification tasks: named entity recognition and clinical phenoytping in Aim 2. Finally we propose to disseminate the IML methods and tools to the biomedical research community in Aim 3. Project Narrative In this project, we propose to develop interactive machine learning methods to process clinical text stored in electronic health records (EHRs) systems. Such methods can efficiently integrate domain and expert knowledge with machine learning processes to quickly build high-quality probabilistic models with minimum annotation cost, thus improving performance of text processors.

"Challenges in Natural Language Processing for Clinical Narratives DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Narratives of electronic health records (EHRs) contain useful information that is difficult to automatically extract, index, search, or interpret. Clinical natural language processing (NLP) technologies for automatic extraction, indexing, searching, and interpretation of EHRs are in development; however, due to privacy concerns related to EHRs, such technologies are usually developed by teams that have privileged access to EHRs in a specific institution. Technologies that are tailored to a specific set of data from a given institution generate inspiring results on that data; however, they can fail to generalize to similar data from other institutions and even other departments from the same institution. Therefore, learning from these technologies and building on them becomes difficult.          In order to improve NLP in EHRs, there is need for head-to-head comparison of approaches that can address a given task on the same data set. Shared-tasks provide one way of conducting systematic head-to- head comparisons. This proposal describes a series of shared-task challenges and conferences, spread over a five year period, that promote the development and evaluation of cutting edge clinical NLP systems by distributing de-identified EHRs to the broad research community, under data use agreements, so that:      *	the state-of-the-art in clinical NLP technologies can be identified and advanced,      *	a set of technologies that enable the use of the information contained in EHR narratives becomes available, and      *	the information from EHR narratives can be made more accessible, for example, for clinical and medical research.          The scientific activities supporting the organization of the shared-task challenges are sponsored in part by Informatics for Integrating Biology and the Bedside (i2b2), grant number U54-LM008748, PI: Kohane.          This proposal aims to organize a series of workshops, conference proceedings, and journal special issues that will accompany the shared-task challenges in order to disseminate the knowledge generated by the challenges. Public health relevance: this proposal will address two main challenges related to the use of clinical narratives for research: availability of clinical records for research and identification of the state of the art in clinical natural language processing (NLP) technologies so that we can push the state of the art forward and so that future work can build on the past. Progress in clinical NLP will improve access to electronic health records for research, and for clinical applications, benefiting healthcare and public health.",Challenges in Natural Language Processing for Clinical Narratives,8913773,R13LM011411,"['Access to Information', 'Address', 'Agreement', 'Biology', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Distributed Systems', 'Educational workshop', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Evaluation', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Grant', 'Hand', 'Healthcare', 'Improve Access', 'Informatics', 'Institution', 'Journals', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Medical Research', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Privacy', 'Public Health', 'Publications', 'Records', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Series', 'System', 'Systems Development', 'Targeted Research', 'Technology', 'Work', 'clinical application', 'data sharing', 'head-to-head comparison', 'improved', 'indexing', 'practical application', 'public health relevance', 'symposium']",NLM,STATE UNIVERSITY OF NEW YORK AT ALBANY,R13,2015,19800,-0.01129887169304166
"Semi-structured Information Retrieval in Clinical Text for Cohort Identification DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques have shown promise for extracting data from the free text of electronic health records (EHRs), but studies have consistently found that techniques do not readily generalize across application settings. Unfortunately, most of the focus in applying NLP to real use cases has remained on a paradigm of single, well-defined application settings, so that generalizability to unseen use cases remains implicitly unaddressed. We propose to explicitly account for unseen application settings by adopting an information retrieval (IR) perspective with the objective of patient-level cohort identification. To do so, we introduce layered language models, an IR framework that enables the reuse of NLP-produced artifacts. Our long term goal is to accelerate investigations of patient health and disease by providing robust, user- centric tools that are necessary to process, retrieve, and utilize the free text of EHRs. The main goal of this proposal is to accurately retrieve ad hoc, realistic cohorts from clinical text at Mayo Clinic and OHSU, establishing methods, resources, and evaluation for patient-level IR. We hypothesize that cohort identification can be addressed in a generalizable fashion by a new IR framework: layered language models. We will test this hypothesis through four specific aims. In Aim 1, we will make medical NLP artifacts searchable in our layered language IR framework. This involves storing and indexing the NLP artifacts, as well as using statistical language models to retrieve documents based on text and its associated NLP artifacts. In Aim 2, we deal with the practical setting of ad hoc cohort identification, moving to patient-level (rather than document-level) IR. To accurately handle patient cohorts in which qualifying evidence may be spread over multiple documents, we will develop and implement patient-level retrieval models that account for cross- document relational and temporal combinations of events. In Aim 3, we will construct parallel IR test collections using EHR data from two sites; a diverse set of cohort queries written by multiple people toward various clinical or epidemiological ends; and assessments of which patients are relevant to which queries at both sites. Finally, in Aim 4, we refine and evaluate patient-level layered language IR on the ad hoc cohort identification task, making comparisons across the users, queries, optimization metrics, and institutions. We will draw additional extrinsic comparisons with pre-existing techniques, e.g., for cohorts from the Electronic Medical Records and Genonmics network. The expected outcomes of the proposed work are: (i) An open-source cohort identification tool, usable by clinicians and epidemiologists, that makes principled use of NLP artifacts for unseen queries; ii) A parallel test collection for cohort identification, includig two intra-institutional document collections, diverse test topics and user-produced text queries, and patient-level judgments of relevance to each query; and (iii) Validation of the reusability of medical NLP via the task of retrieving patient cohorts. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  With the widespread adoption of electronic medical records, one might expect that it would be simple for a medical expert to find things like ""patients in the community who suffer from asthma."" Unfortunately, on top of lab tests, medications, and demographic information, there are observations that a physician writes down as text - which are difficult for a computer to understand. Therefore, we aim to process text so that a computer can understand enough of it, and then search that text along with the rest of a patient's medical record; this will allow clinicians or researchers to find and study patients groups of interest.",Semi-structured Information Retrieval in Clinical Text for Cohort Identification,8928647,R01LM011934,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Adoption', 'Asthma', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Dictionary', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Epidemiologist', 'Epidemiology', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Evidence Based Medicine', 'Evolution', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Information Retrieval', 'Information Retrieval Systems', 'Institution', 'Interest Group', 'Investigation', 'Judgment', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Records', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Names', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Process', 'Publishing', 'Qualifying', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Retrieval', 'Sampling', 'Semantics', 'Site', 'Smoke', 'Source', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Validation', 'Weight', 'Work', 'Writing', 'asthmatic patient', 'base', 'cohort', 'improved', 'indexing', 'novel', 'open source', 'query optimization', 'syntax', 'text searching', 'tool']",NLM,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,R01,2015,376327,-0.005030440714510568
"MACE2K - Molecular And Clinical Extraction: A Natural Language Processing Tool for Personalized Medicine ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The velocity, variety, volume and veracity of data from relevant information sources make it extremely challenging for oncologists to collect and review pertinent data that can support routine personalized treatment for their patients. There is an urgent need to develop data wrangling approaches including Natural Language Processing and information retrieval methods to extract and curate personalized-therapy related publications and clinical trials. Once curated, the structured data can be used by biomedical researchers to generate novel scientific hypotheses, design new studies, obtain a better understanding of biological mechanisms of disease, perform meta-analyses, and create clinical decision support systems. There is an urgent need to develop improved search interfaces specific to the field of personalized therapy, including ways to display, rank, and save results by end users. While several database and web-based keyword search engine algorithms exist, there is a lack of tools that meet the unique challenges of personalized medicine. There is also an urgent need to develop software that allows for verification and validation of information extracted and ranked through computational methods using subject matter expertise to improve the gold standard corpus that can be used for biomedical research into personalized therapies.  To address these issues, we will build an innovative software stack (MACE2K) to adapt and extend widely tested Biocreative natural language processing (NLP) tools to automatically retrieve and pre-process targeted therapy information from clinicaltrials.gov, PubMed abstracts as well as open access articles, and conference proceedings. We will build an entity extraction cartridge to accurately parse gene mutations, translocations, gene expression, protein expression, and protein phosphorylation. A marker disambiguation cartridge will be built to assess for trial inclusion or exclusion criteria and to determine marker-related primary endpoints. We will include a ranking cartridge that uses the disambiguated information on markers, drugs and trials to provide a rigorous scoring of trials and studies according to their relevance for personalized medicine. A novel gamification cartridge will be built to allow subject matter experts to verify and validate the information corpus. Our research leverages National Cancer Institute's investments in several programs (many of which we are involved in) including the NCI drug dictionary, National Cancer Informatics Program (NCIP), I-SPY trials, and Center for cancer systems biology (CCSB) to efficiently accomplish our aims.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will develop new computational methods and software to retrieve targeted molecular and drug therapy information from multiple sources of big data including: clinicaltrials.gov, PubMed abstracts, open access articles, and conference proceedings. The software can be used by biomedical researchers to generate new hypotheses for research on personalized cancer treatment decisions based on enormous volumes of public data already in existence.

"Natural language processing for clinical and translational research DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Rapid growth in the clinical implementation of large electronic medical records (EMRs) has led to an unprecedented expansion in the availability of dense longitudinal datasets for clinical and translational research. This growth is being fueled by recent federal legislation that provides generous financial incentives to institutions demonstrating aggressive application and ""meaningful use"" of comprehensive EMRs. Efforts are already underway to link these EMRs across institutions, and standardize the definition of phenotypes for large scale studies of disease onset and treatment outcome, specifically within the context of routine clinical care. However, a well-known challenge for secondary use of EMR data for clinical and translational research is that much of detailed patient information is embedded in narrative text. Natural Language Processing (NLP) technologies, which are able to convert unstructured clinical text into coded data, have been introduced into the biomedical domain and have demonstrated promising results. Researchers have used NLP systems to identify clinical syndromes and common biomedical concepts from radiology reports, discharge summaries, problem lists, nursing documentation, and medical education documents. Different NLP systems have been developed at different institutions and utilized to convert clinical narrative text into structured data that may be used for other clinical applications and studies. Successful stories in applying NLP to clinical and translational research have been reported widely. However, institutions often deploy different NLP systems, which produce various types of output formats and make it difficult to exchange information between sites. Therefore, the lack of interoperability among different clinical NLP systems becomes a bottleneck for efficient multi-site studies. In addition, many successful studies often require a strong interdisciplinary team where informaticians and clinicians have to work very closely to iteratively define optimal algorithms for clinical phenotypes. As intensive informatics support may not be available to every clinical researcher, the usability of NLP systems for end users is another important issue. The proposed project builds upon first-hand knowledge and experience across the research team in the use of NLP for clinical and translational research projects. There are several big informatics initiatives for clinical and translational research but those initiatives generally assume one shoe fits all and follow top-down approaches to develop NLP solutions. Complementary to those initiatives, we will use a bottom-up approach to handle interoperability and usability: i) we will obtain a common NLP data model and exchange format through empirical analysis of existing NLP systems and NLP results; ii) we will develop a user-centric NLP front end interface for NLP systems wrapped to be consistent with the proposed NLP data model and exchange format incorporating usability analysis into the agile development process. All deliverables will be distributed through the open health NLP (OHNLP) consortium which we intend to make it more open and inclusive. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Rapid growth in the clinical implementation of large electronic medical records (EMRs) has led to an unprecedented expansion in the availability of dense longitudinal datasets for clinical and translational research.

"Evidence-based Strategy and Tool to Simplify Text for Patients and Consumers ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Lifespans continue to increase, chronic disease survival rates are drastically improved, and treatments are being discovered for a variety of illnesses. This rapidly changing scenario requires patients to participate in their recovery, understand written information and directions thereby calling upon patients to have increasingly more complex health literacy. However, time availability of practitioners or other resources to explain the required information has not increased to match. As a result, finding efficient means to improving patient health literacy is an increasingly important topic in healthcare. Increased health literacy may promote healthy lifestyle behaviors and increase access to health services by the population. It has been argued that for the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act to be successful, more effort is needed to increase the health literacy of millions of Americans. Similarly, the Healthy People 2020 statement by the Department of Health and Human Services identified improving health literacy (HC/HIT-1) as an important national goal. The broad- long term objectives of this project are to contribute to increasing the health literacy of patients and health information consumers and provide caregivers an evidence-based tool for simplifying text. The most commonly used tool for estimating the difficulty of text is the readability formula. They are not sufficient, however, because there is no evidence to support a connection between their use and decreases in difficulty. This problem is addressed by using modern resources and techniques for discovering traits that make health-related text difficult and developing a tool to guide the simplification of text. . There are four specific aims of this project: 1) Identify differentiating features of easy versus difficult texts, 2) Design a simplification strategy using computer algorithms, 3) Measure the impact of simplification on perceived and actual text difficulty with online participants and a representative community sample, 4) Create free, online software that incorporates proven features algorithmically. Corpus analysis will be conducted to compare easy and difficult texts with each other and discover lexical, grammatical, semantic, and composition and discourse features typical for each. Then, simplification algorithms will be designed and developed relying on rule-based techniques to leverage available resources, e.g., vocabularies, or on machine learning approaches for discovering the best combinations of features for simplification. A representative writer will simplify text by relying on the suggestios provided by an online that tool that uses simplification algorithms. The effect of simplification wll be tested in comprehensive user studies to evaluate the effect on both actual and perceived difficulty. Features successfully shown to decrease text difficulty will be incorporated in an onlie software program designed to reduce text difficulty.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Improving health literacy is an important national goal and necessary trait for a healthy population. Providing understandable information is critical but few tools exist to help write understandable text. We aim to discover features indicative of difficult text, design translation algorithms and create a free, online software tool for rewriting health-related text with demonstrated impact on perceived and actual text difficulty            ",Evidence-based Strategy and Tool to Simplify Text for Patients and Consumers,8884888,R01LM011975,"['Address', 'Advocate', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Arizona', 'Behavior', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Chronic Disease', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Comprehension', 'Computational Linguistics', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer software', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Data Set', 'Education', 'Education Projects', 'Ensure', 'Faculty', 'Feedback', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Promotion', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Health behavior', 'Health education', 'Healthcare', 'Healthy People 2020', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Informatics', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Mullerian duct inhibiting substance', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Readability', 'Reader', 'Recovery', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Semantics', 'Software Tools', 'Survival Rate', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Translations', 'Underserved Population', 'United States Dept. of Health and Human Services', 'Universities', 'Vocabulary', 'Work', 'Writing', 'base', 'college', 'combat', 'cost effective', 'design', 'evidence base', 'health literacy', 'healthy lifestyle', 'improved', 'lexical', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'tool', 'trait', 'user-friendly', 'volunteer']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA,R01,2015,376917,-0.018124770981566105
"Semi-Automating Data Extraction for Systematic Reviews ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Evidence-based medicine (EBM) looks to inform patient care with the totality of available relevant evidence. Systematic reviews are the cornerstone of EBM and are critical to modern healthcare, informing everything from national health policy to bedside decision-making. But conducting systematic reviews is extremely laborious (and hence expensive): producing a single review requires thousands of person-hours. Moreover, the exponential expansion of the biomedical literature base has imposed an unprecedented burden on reviewers, thus multiplying costs. Researchers can no longer keep up with the primary literature, and this hinders the practice of evidence-based care.      The long term aim of this work is to develop computational tools and methods that optimize the practice of EBM. The proposed work thus builds upon our previous successful efforts developing computational approaches that reduce the workload in EBM. More speciﬁcally, we aim to develop tools that semi-automate the laborious task of data extraction - identifying and extracting the information of interest (e.g., trial sample size, interventions and outcomes) from the free-texts of biomedical articles - via novel machine learning methods. Semi-automating this task will drastically reduce reviewer workload, thus enabling the practice of EBM in an age of information overload.      Previous efforts to automate data extraction from articles describing clinical trials have shown promise, but lack the accuracy and scope necessary for real-world use. These approaches have been impeded by the absence of a large corpus of annotated clinical trials, and by the difﬁculty of constructing models to automatically extract all of the variables necessary for synthesis. We describe methodological innovations to overcome these hurdles. First, to train our machine learning models we propose leveraging large existing databases that contain structured information about clinical trials, in lieu of the usual approach of collecting expensive manual annotations. Practically, this means we will be able to exploit a very large `pseudo-annotated' dataset that is an order of magnitude bigger than what has been used in previous efforts, thus substantially improving model performance. Our extensive preliminary work demonstrates the promise and feasibility of this approach. Second, we propose novel machine learning models appropriate for the tasks of article categorization and data extraction for EBM. These models will speciﬁcally be designed to perform extraction of multiple, correlated data elements of interest while simultaneously classifying articles into clinically salient categories useful for EBM.      We will rigorously evaluate the developed methods to assess their practical utility, speciﬁcally y comparing automated extraction accuracy to that achieved by trained systematic reviewers. And to make these methods useful to end-users (systematic reviewers), we will develop and evaluate open-source software and tools, including a web-based extraction tool that integrates our machine learning models to automatically extract information from uploaded articles (PDFs). We will conduct a user study to evaluate the utility and usability of this tool in practice.             Public Health Narrative  We propose to develop computational methods and tools that make the practice of evidence-based medicine (EBM) more efﬁcient, speciﬁcally by semi-automating data extraction from the full-texts of articles describing clinical trials. Such tools would drastically reduce the workload currently involved in producing evidence syntheses, ultimately enabling evidence- based care in an era of information overload.",Semi-Automating Data Extraction for Systematic Reviews,9028559,R01LM012086,"['Age', 'Area', 'Beds', 'Caring', 'Categories', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Element', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Effectiveness of Interventions', 'Elements', 'Evidence Based Medicine', 'Evidence based practice', 'Exercise', 'Feedback', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Healthcare', 'Hour', 'Human Resources', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention', 'Letters', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Health Policy', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Population Characteristics', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Sample Size', 'Services', 'Side', 'Software Tools', 'Structure', 'System', 'Text', 'Training', 'Work', 'Workload', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'data mining', 'design', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'member', 'natural language', 'novel', 'open source', 'study characteristics', 'systematic review', 'tool', 'trial design', 'usability']",NLM,"UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS, AUSTIN",R01,2015,317900,-0.00364210186346585

"Informatics Tools for High-Throughput Sequences Data Analysis DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK) is a suite of best-in-class, widely-used, well-supported, open-source tools for processing and analysis of next-generation DNA sequencing (NGS) data. These tools currently  include a multiple sequence realigner, a covariate-correcting base quality score recalibrator, multi-sample  SNP, INDEL, and CNV genotypers, machine learning algorithms for false positive identification, variant  evaluation modules, somatic SNP and indel callers, and hundreds of other tools. Underlying all of these tools is our structured programming framework (GATK-Engine) that uses the functional programming philosophy of MapReduce to make writing feature-rich, efficient and robust analysis tools easy. By centralizing common data management infrastructure, all GATK-based tools benefit from the engine's correctness, CPU and memory efficiency, as well as automatic distributed and shared memory parallelization, essential capabilities given the massive and growing size of NGS datasets. The GATK currently supports all of the major sequencing technologies including lllumina. Life Sciences 454, and ABI SOLID, from hybrid capture of exomes to 1000s of low-pass samples in the 1000 Genomes Project. Our emphasis on technology-agnostic processing tools has helped to popularize the now standard SAM/BAM and VCFs formats for representing NGS data and variation calls, respectively. In this RFA we propose to  continue to develop the GATK-Engine and data processing tools to (1) achieve complete and accurate  variation discovery and genotyping for all major sequencing study designs and NGS technologies (2)  optimize the GATK-Engine and pipelining infrastructure to operate efficiently on distributed data sets at the  scale of tens of thousands of samples (3) extend the GATK data processing tools to support the upcoming  sequencing technologies of Complete Genomics, lon Torrent, and Pacific Biosciences as well as we do  current technologies, (4) expand significantly our educational and support structures to ensure that the longtail  of future NGS users can benefit from the best-practice data processing and analysis tools in the GATK. The proposed project aims to continue to develop the Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK), a suite of widely used and mission-critical tools for analyzing the next-generation DNA sequencing data. With this grant we will improve these tools, make them more robust, and extend them to new sequencing technologies. This is essential to realize the potential of DNA sequencing to understand human history, diversity, and to discover  new loci associated with human disease, leading to new biologic hypotheses and new drug targets.",Informatics Tools for High-Throughput Sequences Data Analysis,8788050,U01HG006569,"['Algorithms', 'Biological Sciences', 'Communities', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Documentation', 'Drug Targeting', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Experimental Designs', 'Floods', 'Future', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Grant', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Informatics', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical Genetics', 'Memory', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Philosophy', 'Process', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research Design', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'SNP genotyping', 'Sampling', 'Site', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Variant', 'Work', 'Writing', 'base', 'cancer genetics', 'computerized data processing', 'data management', 'distributed data', 'distributed memory', 'exome', 'genome analysis', 'human disease', 'improved', 'insertion/deletion mutation', 'next generation', 'novel', 'open source', 'programs', 'shared memory', 'tool']",NHGRI,"BROAD INSTITUTE, INC.",U01,2015,967608,-0.038673654581471296
"The Center for Predictive Computational Phenotyping-1 Overall     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The biomedical sciences are being radically transformed by advances in our ability to monitor, record, store and integrate information characterizing human biology and health at scales that range from individual molecules to large populations of subjects. This wealth of information has the potential to substantially advance both our understanding of human biology and our ability to improve human health. Perhaps the most central and general approach for exploiting biomedical data is to use methods from machine learning and statistical modeling to infer predictive models. Such models take as input observable data representing some object of interest, and produce as output a prediction about a particular, unobservable property of the object. This approach has proven to be of high value for a wide range of biomedical tasks, but numerous significant challenges remain to be solved in order for the full potential of predictive modeling to be realized.  To address these challenges, we propose to establish The Center for Predictive Computational Phenotyping (CPCP). Our proposed center will focus on a broad range of problems that can be cast as computational phenotyping. Although some phenotypes are easily measured and interpreted, and are available in an accessible format, a wide range of scientifically and clinically important phenotypes do not satisfy these criteria. In such cases, computational phenotyping methods are required either to (i) extract a relevant  phenotype from a complex data source or collection of heterogeneous data sources, (ii) predict clinically  important phenotypes before they are exhibited, or (iii) do both in the same application.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  We will develop innovative new approaches and tools that are able to discover, and make crucial inferences with large data sets that include molecular profiles, medical images, electronic health records, population-level data, and various combinations of these and other data types. These approaches will significantly advance the state of the art in wide range of biological and clinical investigations, such as predicting which patients are most at risk for breast cancer, heart attacks and severe blood clots.            ",The Center for Predictive Computational Phenotyping-1 Overall,8935748,U54AI117924,"['Address', 'Arts', 'Biological', 'Blood coagulation', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Education', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Exhibits', 'General Population', 'Generations', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Greek', 'Health', 'Human', 'Human Biology', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Monitor', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Organism', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Property', 'Regulatory Element', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Statistical Algorithm', 'Statistical Models', 'Time', 'Training Activity', 'clinical investigation', 'graduate student', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'novel strategies', 'outcome forecast', 'predictive modeling', 'public health relevance', 'success', 'tool', 'treatment planning']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,U54,2015,73173,-0.01935937022395556
"Developing Smokers for Smoker (S4S): A Collective Intelligence tailoring system DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Smoking is still the number one preventable cause of cancer death. New approaches are needed to engage smokers in the 21st century in smoking cessation. I propose to develop S4S (Smokers for Smoker), a next- generation patient-centered computer tailored health communication (CTHC) system. Unlike current rule- based CTHCs, S4S will replace rules with complex machine learning algorithms, and use the collective experiences of thousands of smokers engaged in a web-assisted tobacco intervention to enhance personally- relevant tailoring for new smokers entering the system. This NCI K07 will provide a mentored research experience, giving me the opportunity to acquire new competencies in cancer health communication for behavior change, research design and statistical methods underlying clinical trial implementation and evaluation. I will adapt collectiv intelligence algorithms that have been used outside healthcare by companies like Amazon and Google to enhance CTHC. Using knowledge from scientific experts, current CTHC collect baseline patient ""profiles"" and then use expert-written, rule-based systems to tailor messages to patient subsets. Such theory-based ""market segmentation has been effective in helping patients reach lifestyle goals. However, there is a natural limit in the ability of a rule-based system to truly personalize content, and adapt personalization over time. Current CTHC have reached this limit, and I propose to go beyond. My first aim is to develop the Web 2.0 ""S4S"" recommender system. My second aim is to evaluate S4S within the context of a NCI funded web-assisted tobacco intervention (Decide2Quit.org). In my efforts, I will guided by my primary mentor (Dr. Houston, MD MPH) and two other mentor teams: The Cancer Health Behavior and Communication Team (Stephenie Lemon, PhD and Kathleen Mazor, EdD), and the Clinical Trial Design and Analysis Team (Jeroan Allison, MD, MS and Arlene Ash, PhD). My comprehensive training also includes coursework, seminars, and conferences. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: A high priority research area identified by the NIH is to understand the role of different media in increasing consumer demand for and use of effective, individually oriented tobacco cessation treatments for diverse populations. Specifically, a research focus is on understanding how to best tailor interventions. Although effective, there is a natural limit in the ability of current rle-based tailoring systems to truly personalize content, and adapt personalization over time.

"Utilizing social media as a resource for mental health surveillance DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Major depressive disorder is one of the most common debilitating illnesses in the United States, with a lifetime prevalence of 16.2%. Currently, nationwide mental health surveillance takes the form of large-scale telephone- based surveys. These surveys have high running costs and require teams of human telephone operators. Even the largest system, the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, reaches only 0.13% of the US population. Twitter (and other microblog services) offers a rich, if terse, multilingual source of real time data for public health surveillance. Natural Language Processing (NLP) provides techniques and resources to ""unlock"" data from text. We propose using Twitter and NLP as a cost-effective and flexible approach to augmenting current telephone- based surveillance methods for population level depression monitoring.         This grant application has two major strands. First, investigating ethical issues and challenges to privacy that emerge with the use of Twitter data for public health surveillance (Aim One). Second, developing techniques and resources for real-time public health surveillance for mental illness from Twitter (Aim Two &Aim Three). Aim One seeks to investigate and codify our responsibilities as researchers towards Twitter users by engaging with those users directly. With Aim Two, we will build and evaluate Natural Language Processing resources - algorithms, lexicons and taxonomies - to support the identification of depression symptoms in Twitter data. For Aim Three, we will build and evaluate Natural Language Processing modules and services that use Twitter as a data source for monitoring depression levels in the community. The significance of the proposed work lies in three areas. First, our investigations - both empirical and theoretical - will explore ethical issues in the use of Twitter for public health surveillance. This work has the potential to guide future research in the area. Second, in developing and evaluating algorithms and resources for identifying depression from tweets, we are contributing foundational work to the field of NLP. Third, developing these algorithms and resources will provide the bedrock for building social media based surveillance systems which will provide a cost effective means of augmenting current mental health surveillance practice. This proposal is innovative in both its application area (microblogs have not been used before for mental health surveillance), its focus on using NLP to identify depressive symptoms for public health, and in the central role that qualitative bioethical research will play in guiding the work. Project Narrative The proposed research focuses on using advanced Natural Language Processing methods to mine microblog data - in this case, Twitter - for mental health surveillance (specifically, depression surveillance), in order to augment current telephone-based mental health surveillance systems.

"Protect Privacy of Healthcare Data in the Cloud DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cloud computing is gain popularity due to its cost-effective storage and computation. There are few studies on how to leverage cloud computing resources to facilitate healthcare research in a privacy preserving manner. This project proposes an advanced framework that combines rigorous privacy protection and encryption techniques to facilitate healthcare data sharing in the cloud environment. Comparing to traditional centralized data anonymization, we are facing major challenges such as lack of global knowledge and the difficulty to enforce consistency. We adopt differential privacy as our privacy criteria and will leverage homomorphic encryption and Yao's garbled circuit protocol to build secure yet scalable information exchange to overcome the barrier.

"InfoMediator: Weaving Clinical Expertise in Online Health Communities DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Chronic illness can be overwhelming to patients because it impacts many areas of their daily lives. Accordingly, many patients turn to online health support groups to get social support. In face-to-face patient support groups (F2F), health professional moderators provide clinical expertise within the context of peer-patients' sharing of experience. However, in online health community settings, because health professionals' time and resources are expensive, it is challenging to get health professionals' opinions for thousands of messages posted each day. To solve this problem, I propose to develop methods and techniques that maximize the use of already available clinical expertise online for online peer-patient conversation threads by developing a system, InfoMediator. The InfoMediator will semi-automatically weave health professionals' existing answers to patients' questions into peer-patient conversations by using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques complemented by user feedback. As the career development component of this proposal, I deepen my skills and knowledge in NLP necessary for proposed work and patient education. As I develop the NLP techniques and knowledge in patient education, I and my mentors will develop methods and techniques that address weaving clinical expertise within peer-patient conversations by designing, implementing, and evaluating socio-technical aspects of the InfoMediator. The training opportunities provided by this NIH NLM K01 grant, together with the supportive research environment at Michigan State University, will help further extend my existing expertise in human-computer interaction, design, and health informatics to establish my independent informatics research program in patient-centered technologies. Focusing on persons with diabetes, the outcomes of the proposed research will help us understand how to empower persons with diabetes to improve self- efficacy and self-care, while increasing the quality of online health information environment. 8. Project Narrative Because health professionals' time and resources are expensive, it is challenging for online health communities to engage health professionals in thousands of peer-patient conversations in the same way that health professionals moderate patient conversations in face-to-face patient support groups.

"Using NLP to Extract Clinically Important Recommendations from Radiology Reports  Abstract Communication of clinically important follow-up recommendations when abnormalities are identified on imaging studies is prone to error. The absence of an automated system to identify and track radiology follow-up recommendations is an important barrier to ensuring timely follow-up of patients, especially for non-acute but potentially life threatening and unexpected findings. The primary goal of this proposal is to develop a Natural Language Processing (NLP) system to extract clinically important recommendation information from free-text radiology reports. Each radiology report will be preprocessed at the structural, syntactic, and semantic level to generate features that will be used to extract the boundaries of sentences that include recommendation information as well as the details of reason for recommendation, requested imaging test, and recommendation time frame. We will use a large corpus of free-text radiology reports represented by a mixture of modalities (e.g., radiography, computed tomography, ultrasound, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)) from three different institutions. Using this dataset we will perform the following specific aims: Aim 1. Create a multi- institutional radiology report corpus annotated for clinically important recommendation information; Aim 2. Develop a novel NLP system to extract clinically important recommendations in radiology reports. The proposed research is innovative because it will generate a new text processing approach that can be used to flag reports visually and electronically so that separate workflow processes can be initiated to reduce the chance that necessary investigations or interventions suggested in the report are missed by clinicians. The proposed set of tools will be disseminated to the biomedical informatics community as open source tools. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Communication of recommendations for necessary investigations and interventions when abnormalities are identified on imaging studies is prone to error. When recommendations are not systematically identified and promptly communicated to referrers, poor patient outcomes can result. We propose to build natural language processing tools to automatically extract clinically important recommendation information from radiology reports.                ",Using NLP to Extract Clinically Important Recommendations from Radiology Reports,8804856,R21EB016872,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data Set', 'Dependency', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Ensure', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Growth', 'Guidelines', 'Hand', 'Health', 'Image', 'Imaging technology', 'Incidental Findings', 'Institution', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Lung nodule', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Quality of Care', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Project Grants', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'Semantics', 'Shapes', 'Societies', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Speech', 'System', 'Telephone', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'Trauma', 'Ultrasonography', 'Unified Medical Language System', 'Washington', 'Writing', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'biomedical informatics', 'cancer care', 'care delivery', 'design', 'falls', 'follow-up', 'health care delivery', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'novel', 'open source', 'phrases', 'public health relevance', 'radiologist', 'screening', 'syntax', 'tool']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R21,2015,217500,-0.005077304193266879
"Secondary use of EMRs for surgical complication surveillance     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Recent statistics indicate that worldwide almost 234 million major surgical procedures are performed each year with the rates of major postsurgical complications (PSCs) range from 3% to 16% and rates of permanent disability or death range from 0.4% to 0.8%. Early detection of PSCs is crucial since early intervention could be lifesaving. Meanwhile, with the rapid adoption of electronic medical records (EMRs) and the accelerated advance of health information technology (HIT), detection of PSCs by applying advanced analytics on EMRs makes it possible for near real-time PSC surveillance. We have developed a rule-based PSC surveillance system to detect most frequent colorectal PSCs near real-time from EMRs where a pattern-based natural language processing (NLP) engine is used to extract PSC related information from text and a set of expert rules is used to detect PSCs. Two challenges are identified. First, it is very challenging to integrate a diverse set of relevant data using expert rules. In the past, probabilistic approaches such as Bayesian Network which can integrate a diverse set of relevant data have become popular in clinical decision support and disease outbreak surveillance. Can we implement probabilistic approaches for PSC surveillance? Secondly, a large portion of the clinical information is embedded in text and it has been quite expensive to manually obtain the patterns used in the NLP system since it requires team effort of subject matter experts and NLP specialists. In the research field, statistical NLP has been quite popular. However, decision making in clinical practice demands tractable evidences while models for statistical NLP are not human interpretable. Can we incorporate statistical NLP to accelerate the NLP knowledge engineering process? We hypothesize that a probabilistic approach for PSC surveillance can be developed for improved case detection which can integrate multiple evidences from structured as well as unstructured EMR data. We also hypothesize that empirical NLP can accelerate the knowledge engineering process needed for building pattern- based NLP systems used in practice. Specific aims include: i) developing and evaluating an innovative Bayesian PSC surveillance system that incorporates evidences from both structured and unstructured EMR data; and ii) incorporating and evaluating statistical NLP in accelerating the NLP knowledge engineering process of pattern-based NLP for PSC surveillance. Given the significance of HIT, our study results will advance the science in developing practical NLP systems that can be translated to meet NLP needs in health care practice. Additionally, given the significance of PSCs, our study results will address significant patient safety and quality issues in surgical practice. Utilizing automated methods to detect postsurgical complications will enable early detection of complications compared to other methods and therefore have great potential of improving patient safety and health care quality while reducing cost. The results could lead to large scale PSC surveillance and quality improvement towards safer and better health care.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Rapid growth in the clinical implementation of large electronic medical records (EMRs) has led to unprecedented opportunities to use EMRs for clinical practice and research. We explore the use of EMRs for near real-time postsurgical complication surveillance with the aim of improving health care quality and reducing health care cost through enhanced analytics towards surgical excellence.                ",Secondary use of EMRs for surgical complication surveillance,8798027,R01EB019403,"['Abscess', 'Address', 'Adoption', 'Age', 'Anesthetics', 'Area', 'Bayesian Method', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Colorectal', 'Complex', 'Complication', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Educational workshop', 'Engineering', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'Healthcare', 'Hemorrhage', 'Human', 'Ileus', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Manuals', 'Methods', 'Minor', 'Motivation', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Nutritional', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perioperative', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Process', 'Registries', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk Factors', 'Science', 'Severities', 'Specialist', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Surgeon', 'Surgical complication', 'System', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Uncertainty', 'Work', 'Wound Infection', 'abstracting', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'computer based statistical methods', 'cost', 'disability', 'health care quality', 'health information technology', 'improved', 'innovation', 'meetings', 'patient safety', 'public health relevance', 'rapid growth', 'statistics']",NIBIB,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,R01,2015,299888,-0.03189371190992208
"COINSTAC: decentralized, scalable analysis of loosely coupled data ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     The brain imaging community is greatly benefiting from extensive data sharing efforts currently underway5,10. However, there is a significant gap in existing strategies which focus on anonymized, post-hoc sharing of either 1) full raw or preprocessed data [in the case of open studies] or 2) manually computed summary measures [such as hippocampal volume11, in the case of closed (or not yet shared) studies] which we propose to address. Current approaches to data sharing often include significant logistical hurdles both for the investigator sharing the dat as well as for the individual requesting the data (e.g. often times multiple data sharing agreements and approvals are required from US and international institutions). This needs to change, so that the scientific community becomes a venue where data can be collected, managed, widely shared and analyzed while also opening up access to the (many) data sets which are not currently available (see recent overview on this from our group2).    The large amount of existing data requires an approach that can analyze data in a distributed way while also leaving control of the source data with the individual investigator; this motivates  dynamic, decentralized way of approaching large scale analyses. We are proposing a peer-to-peer system called the Collaborative Informatics and Neuroimaging Suite Toolkit for Anonymous Computation (COINSTAC). The system will provide an independent, open, no-strings-attached tool that performs analysis on datasets distributed across different locations. Thus, the step of actually aggregating data can be avoided, while the strength of large-scale analyses can be retained. To achieve this, in Aim 1, the uniform data interfaces that we propose will make it easy to share and cooperate. Robust and novel quality assurance and replicability tools will also be incorporated. Collaboration and data sharing will be done through forming temporary (need and project-based) virtual clusters of studies performing automatically generated local computation on their respective data and aggregating statistics in global inference procedures. The communal organization will provide a continuous stream of large scale projects that can be formed and completed without the need of creating new rigid organizations or project-oriented storage vaults. In Aim 2, we develop, evaluate, and incorporate privacy-preserving algorithms to ensure that the data used are not re-identifiable even with multiple re-uses. We also will develop advanced distributed and privacy preserving approaches for several key multivariate families of algorithms (general linear model, matrix factorization [e.g. independent component analysis], classification) to estimate intrinsic networks and perform data fusion. Finally, in Aim 3, we will demonstrate the utility of this approach in a proof of concept study through distributed analyses of substance abuse datasets across national and international venues with multiple imaging modalities.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Hundreds of millions of dollars have been spent to collect human neuroimaging data for clinical and research purposes, many of which don't have data sharing agreements or collect sensitive data which are not easily shared, such as genetics. Opportunities for large scale aggregated analyses to infer health-relevant facts create new challenges in protecting the privacy of individuals' data. Open sharing of raw data, though desirable from the research perspective, and growing rapidly, is not a good solution for a large number of datasets which have additional privacy risks or IRB concerns. The COINSTAC solution we are proposing will capture this 'missing data' and allow for pooling of both open and 'closed' repositories by developing privacy preserving versions of widely-used algorithms and incorporating within an easy-to-use platform which enables distributed computation. In addition, COINSTAC will accelerate research on both open and closed data by offering a distributed computational solution for a large toolkit of widely used algorithms.                ","COINSTAC: decentralized, scalable analysis of loosely coupled data",8975906,R01DA040487,"['AODD relapse', 'Accounting', 'Address', 'Agreement', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Algorithms', 'Attention', 'Brain imaging', 'Classification', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Consent Forms', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Aggregation', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Ensure', 'Family', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Markers', 'Health', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Institution', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'International', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Left', 'Letters', 'Linear Models', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Movement', 'Paper', 'Plant Roots', 'Poaceae', 'Population', 'Privacy', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Science', 'Site', 'Solutions', 'Stream', 'Substance abuse problem', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'base', 'computing resources', 'cost', 'data sharing', 'distributed data', 'flexibility', 'imaging modality', 'independent component analysis', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'peer', 'public health relevance', 'quality assurance', 'repository', 'statistics', 'tool', 'virtual']",NIDA,THE MIND RESEARCH NETWORK,R01,2015,727692,0.010323173701239172
"Clinic Interactions of a Brain-Computer Interface for Communication ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The promise of brain-computer interfaces (BCI) for communication is becoming a reality for individuals with severe speech and physical impairments (SSPI) who cannot rely on speech or writing to express themselves. While the majority of research efforts are devoted to technology development to address problems of stability, reliability and/or classification, clinical and behavioral challenges are becoming more apparent as individuals with SSPI and their family/care teams assess the systems during novice or long-term trials. The objective of the RSVP Keyboard(tm) BCI translational research team is to address the clinical challenges raised during functional BCI use with innovative engineering design, thereby enhancing the potential of this novel assistive technology. Four specific aims are proposed: (1) to develop a BCI Communication Application Suite (BCI-CAS) that offers a set of language modules to people with SSPI that can meet their language/literacy skills; (2) to develop improved statistical signal models for personalized feature extraction, artifact/interference handling, and robust, accurate intent evidence extraction from physiologic signals; (3) to develop improved language models and stimulus sequence optimization methods; and (4) to evaluate cognitive variables that affect learning and performance of the BCI-CAS. Five language modules are proposed that rely on a multimodal evidence fusion framework for model-based context-aware optimal intent inference: RSVP Keyboard(tm) generative spelling; RSVP texting; RSVP in-context typing; RSVP in-context icon typing; and binary yes/no responses with SSVEPs. Usability data on the current RSVP Keyboard(tm) and SSVEP system drive all proposed aims. Users select a language module, and the BCI system optimizes performance for each individual based on user adaptation, intent inference, and personalized language modeling. A unique simulation function drives individualization of system parameters. The robustness of the BCI customization efforts are evaluated continually by adults with SSPI and neurotypical controls in an iterative fashion. The effect of three intervention programs that address the cognitive construct of attention (process-specific attention training, mindfulness meditation training and novel stimulus presentations) will be implemented through hypothesis-driven single subject designs. Thirty participants, ages 21 years and older with SSPI will be included in home-based interventions. By measuring information transfer rate (ITR), user satisfaction, and intrinsic user factors, we will identify learning strategies that influence BCI sill acquisition and performance for adults with neurodegenerative or neurodevelopmental conditions. The translational teams include (1) signal processing (Erdogmus); (2) clinical neurophysiology (Oken); (3) natural language processing (Bedrick/Gorman); and (4) assistive technology (Fried-Oken). We continue to rely on a solid Bayesian foundation and theoretical frameworks: ICF disability classification (WHO, 2001), the AAC model of participation (Beukelman & Mirenda, 2013) and the Matching Person to Technology Model (Scherer, 2002).         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The populations of patients with severe speech and physical impairments secondary to neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative diseases are increasing as medical technologies advance and successfully support life. These individuals with limited to no movement could potentially contribute to their medical decision making, informed consent, and daily caregiving if they had faster, more reliable means to interface with communication systems. The BCI Communication Applications Suite is a hybrid brain-computer interface that is an innovative technological advance so that patients and their families can participate in daily activities and advocate for improvements in standard clinical care.

"Encoding and Processing Patient Allergy Information in EHRs DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Allergies affect one in five Americans and are the 5th leading chronic disease in the U.S. Each year, allergies account for more than 17 million outpatient office visits. Although documenting and exchanging allergy information in electronic health records (EHRs) is becoming increasingly important, we still face multiple challenges. These include: lack of well-adopted standard terminologies for representing allergies, frequent entry of allergy information as free-text, and no existing process for reconciling allergy information. In this study, we will provide solutions to these challenges by addressing the following specific aims: 1) conduct analyses on standard terminologies and a large allergy repository to build a comprehensive knowledge base for representing allergy information; 2) design, develop and evaluate a natural language processing (NLP) module for extracting and encoding free-text allergy information and integrate it with an existing NLP system; 3) measure the feasibility and efficiency of the proposed NLP system for the new process of allergy reconciliation; and 4) distribute our methods and tool, so they are widely available to other researchers and healthcare institutions for non-commercial use. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Managing allergy information within the electronic health record (EHR) is vital to ensuring patient safety. The goal of this study is to propose a comprehensive solution to assess existing terminology standards and knowledge bases for representing allergy information, develop and evaluate a natural language processing (NLP) system for extracting and encoding allergy information from free-text clinical documents, and finally measure the feasibility of using NLP output to facilitate the allergy reconciliation proces.",Encoding and Processing Patient Allergy Information in EHRs,8920540,R01HS022728,[' '],AHRQ,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2015,488893,-0.01035204437919014
"Improving Accuracy of Electronic Notes Using A Faster, Simpler Approach DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Physician progress notes contain information essential to patient care, including findings from history and physical exam, interpretation of tests, assessment and treatment plans. However in the transition from paper to electronic physician notes, many physicians spend more time creating them, which has led to the use of time-saving measures such as copy/paste and templates that have degraded note accuracy and quality. This threatens the usefulness of notes not only for their most important use-patient care-but also for research, quality improvement, and in supporting reimbursement. To address these problems, we propose a project with the following specific aims: 1. To refine and implement a new voice-generated enhanced electronic note system (VGEENS) integrating voice recognition with natural language processing and links to the electronic medical record (EMR) to improve note accuracy and timeliness. 2. To evaluate VGEENS using a randomized trial with 30 internal medicine physicians in each arm to assess electronic note accuracy, quality, timeliness, and user satisfaction. Intervention physicians will use VGEENS, while the control physicians will continue with note creation as they normally would. This novel approach has the potential to improve note accuracy while reducing delays in making progress notes in EMRs available to other clinicians. It leverages rapidly improving voice recognition and NLP technologies to permit physicians to use a natural, fast method-human voice-to convey their observation and thoughts into the EMR record. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Physician documentation of a patient visit contains information that is used in that patient's care. This information includes findings from a patient' history and physical exam, interpretation of necessary tests, the problem assessment and treatment plan. However, in the transition from paper to electronic physician notes, many physicians are spending more time creating these notes. This has led to use of time-saving measures that have degraded the accuracy and ease of use of patient notes. By the end of this project, we expect to have developed, used and evaluated a new method for creating electronic physician notes that both improve accuracy and timely availability of inpatient progress notes.","Improving Accuracy of Electronic Notes Using A Faster, Simpler Approach",8928601,R21HS023631,[' '],AHRQ,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R21,2015,139245,-0.017919766840913627
"Interactive machine learning methods for clinical natural language processing     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Growing deployments of electronic health records (EHRs) systems have made massive clinical data available electronically. However, much of detailed clinical information of patients is embedded in narrative text and is not directly accessible for computerized clinical applications. Therefore, natural language processing (NLP) technologies, which can unlock information in narrative document, have received great attention in the medical domain. Current state-of-the-art NLP approaches often involve building probabilistic models. However, the wide adoption of statistical methods in clinical NLP faces two grand challenges: 1) the lack of large annotated clinical corpora; and 2) the lack of methodologies that can efficiently integrate linguistic and domain knowledge with statistical learning. High-performance statistical NLP methods rely on large scale and high quality annotations of clinical text, but it is time-consuming and costly to create large annotated clinica corpora as it often requires manual review by physicians. Moreover, the medical domain is knowledge intensive. To achieve optimal performance, probabilistic models need to leverage medical domain knowledge. Therefore, methods that can efficiently integrate domain and expert knowledge with machine learning processes to quickly build high-quality probabilistic models with minimum annotation cost would be highly desirable for clinical text processing.    In this study, we propose to investigate interactive machine learning (IML) methods to address the above challenges in clinical NLP. An IML system builds a classification model in an iterative process, which can actively select informative samples for annotation based on models built on previously annotated samples, thus reducing the annotation cost for model development. More importantly, an IML system also involves human inputs to the learning process (e.g., an expert can specify important features for a classification task based on domain knowledge). Thus, IML is an ideal framework for efficiently integrating rule-based (via domain experts specifying features) and statistics-based (via different learning algorithms) approaches to clinical NLP. To achieve our goal, we propose three specific aims. In Aim 1, we plan to investigate different aspects of IML for word sense disambiguation, including developing new active learning algorithms and conducting cognitive usability analysis for efficient feature annotation by users. To demonstrate the broad uses of IML, we further extend IML approaches to two other important clinical NLP classification tasks: named entity recognition and clinical phenoytping in Aim 2. Finally we propose to disseminate the IML methods and tools to the biomedical research community in Aim 3.             Project Narrative In this project, we propose to develop interactive machine learning methods to process clinical text stored in electronic health records (EHRs) systems. Such methods can efficiently integrate domain and expert knowledge with machine learning processes to quickly build high-quality probabilistic models with minimum annotation cost, thus improving performance of text processors. This technology will allow more accurate data extraction from clinical documents, thus to facilitate clinical research that rely on EHRs data.",Interactive machine learning methods for clinical natural language processing,8818096,R01LM010681,"['Abbreviations', 'Active Learning', 'Address', 'Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Attention', 'Biomedical Research', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Educational workshop', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Face', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Linguistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Medical', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Names', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Process', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Priority', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Solutions', 'Source', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'United States National Library of Medicine', 'base', 'clinical application', 'clinical phenotype', 'cohort', 'computer human interaction', 'computerized', 'cost', 'experience', 'improved', 'model development', 'novel', 'open source', 'statistics', 'success', 'tool', 'usability']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR HOUSTON,R01,2014,558372,-0.008093097778128585
"Screening Nonrandomized Studies for Inclusion in Systematic Reviews of Evidence  Screening Nonrandomized Studies for Inclusion in Systematic Reviews of Evidence Translation of biomedical research into practice depends in part on the production of quality systematic reviews that synthesize available evidence. Unfortunately, about 20% of reviews are never completed. Of those that reach fruition, the average time to completion may be 2.4 years, with a reported maximum of 9 years. A major bottleneck occurs when teammates screen studies. In the first step, they independently identify provisionally eligible studies by reading the same set of perhaps thousands of titles and abstracts. To date, researchers have used supervised machine learning (ML) methods in an attempt to automate identification of eligible randomized controlled trials (RCTs). However, finding nonrandomized (NR) studies for inclusion in systematic reviews has yet to be addressed. This is an important problem because RCTs may be unlikely or even unethical for some research questions. Hypotheses. It is broadly hypothesized that (a) methods based on natural language processing and ML can be used to automatically identify topically relevant studies with a mix of NR designs eligible for inclusion in systematic reviews; and (b) machine performance can consistently reach current human standards with respect to identifying eligible studies. Aims. This research has three aims: (1) Compare the language that biomedical researchers use to describe their NR study designs with existing relevant vocabularies. Develop complementary terminologies for overlooked NR study designs to improve coverage of important vocabularies. Develop and validate a standalone terminology to support librarians who add free-text terms to expert searches. (2) Develop and compare procedures based on natural language processing and supervised ML methods to identify provisionally eligible NR studies that are topically relevant from a set of citations, including titles, abstracts, and metadata. Use terms for NR study designs to improve classification. (3) Generalize procedures developed under Aims 1 and 2 to select topically relevant studies with a mix of designs for provisional inclusion in several types of systematic reviews. Use contextual information in segments of full texts tagged for location to enrich feature vectors. Methods. Reference standards will be built from studies in published Cochrane reviews. Features will be extracted from citations and regions of full texts. Additionally, feature vectors will be enriched with terms for designs that researchers use in combination with terms extracted from major vocabularies. Model performance will be compared with respect to several measures, including mean recall and precision, for 10-fold cross-validations and validations on held-out test sets. Significance. The proposed research is significant because it will help support translation of biomedical research to improve human health. Moreover, developing procedures to identify NR studies is essential for the expeditious translation of a very large body of research.  Translation of biomedical research helps to improve public health by delivering the best available evidence to clinicians. This process depends in part on the production of systematic reviews of research.

"Scalable and Robust Clinical Text De-Identification Tools     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Exploiting the full potential of information rich and rapidly growing repositories of patient clinical text is hampered by the absence of scalable and robust de-identification tools. Clinical text contains protected health information (PHI), and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) restricts research use of patient information containing PHI to specific, limited, IRB-approved projects. As a result, vast repositories of clinical text remain under-used by internal researchers, and are even less available for external transmission to outside collaborators or for centralized processing by state-of-the-art natural language processing (NLP) technologies. De-identification, which is the removal of PHI from clinical text, is challenging. Despite their availability for over a decade, commercially available automated systems are expensive, require local tailoring, and have not gained widespread market penetration. Manual methods are costly and do not scale, yet continue to be used despite the small amount of residual PHI they leave behind. Open source de-identification tools based on state-of-the-art machine learning technologies can perform at or above the level of manual approaches but also suffer from the residual PHI problem. Current de-identification approaches, then, also severely limit the use and mobility of clinical text while exposing patients to privacy risks. These approaches redact PHI, blacking it out or replacing it with symbols (e.g., ""Here for cardiac eval is Mr. **PT_NAME<AA>, a **AGE<60s> yo male with his son Doug ...""). Traditional approaches leave residual PHI (""Doug"" in this example) to be easily noticed by readers of the text, as it remains plainly visible among the prominent redactions. We developed and pilot tested an alternative approach we believe addresses the residual PHI problem. Our approach uses the strategy of concealing, rather than trying to eliminate, residual PHI. We call it the ""Hiding In Plain Sight"" (HIPS) approach. HIPS replaces all known PHI with ""surrogate"" PHI- fictional names, ages, etc.-that look real but do not refer to any actual patient. A HIPS version of the above text is: ""Here for cardiac eval is Mr. Jones, a 64 yo male with his son Doug ..."" where the name ""Jones"" and age ""64"" are fictional surrogates, but the name ""Doug"" is residual PHI. To a reader, the surrogates and the residual PHI are indistinguishable. This prevents the reader from detecting the latter, avoiding disclosure. Our preliminary studies suggest that HIPS can reduce the risk of disclosure of residual PHI by a factor of 10. This yields overall performance that far surpasses the performance attainable by manual methods, and is unlikely to be matched, we believe, by additional incremental improvements in PHI tagging models (i.e., efforts to reduce residual PHI). Our pilot studies indicate IRBs would welcome the HIPS approach if it were shown to be effective through rigorous evaluation. To expand usage of clinical text and enhance patient privacy, we propose to formalize rules of effective surrogate generation (Aim 1), extend related de-identification confidence scoring methods (Aim 2), and conduct rigorous efficacy testing of HIPS in diverse institutional settings (Aim 3).                  All known automated de-identification methods leave behind a small amount of residual protected health information (PHI), which presents a risk of disclosing patient privacy and creates barriers to more widespread internal use and external sharing of information-rich clinical text for broad research purpose. This project advances and evaluates the efficacy of a novel method, called the Hiding In Plain Sight (HIPS) approach, which conceals residual PHI by replacing all other instance of PHI found in a document with realistic appearing but fictitious surrogates. Rigorous efficacy testing is needed to confirm that HIPS surrogates effectively reduce risk of exposing patient privacy by concealing the small amount of residual PHI all known de-identification leave behind.",Scalable and Robust Clinical Text De-Identification Tools,8722030,R01LM011366,"['Address', 'Age', 'Applied Research', 'Cardiac', 'Clinical', 'Detection', 'Disclosure', 'Evaluation', 'Excision', 'Foundations', 'Generations', 'Health', 'Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act', 'Healthcare', 'Human', 'Information Theory', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'Left', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Marketing', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Names', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Patients', 'Penetration', 'Performance', 'Pilot Projects', 'Plant Roots', 'Privacy', 'Process', 'Publishing', 'Reader', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Residual state', 'Risk', 'Scoring Method', 'Simulate', 'Son', 'Source', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Validation', 'Vision', 'Work', 'base', 'efficacy testing', 'male', 'novel', 'open source', 'patient privacy', 'prevent', 'programs', 'repository', 'software systems', 'tool', 'transmission process']",NLM,KAISER FOUNDATION HEALTH PLAN OF WASHINGTON,R01,2014,260727,-0.010729816838810295
"Challenges in Natural Language Processing for Clinical Narratives     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Narratives of electronic health records (EHRs) contain useful information that is difficult to automatically extract, index, search, or interpret. Clinical natural language processing (NLP) technologies for automatic extraction, indexing, searching, and interpretation of EHRs are in development; however, due to privacy concerns related to EHRs, such technologies are usually developed by teams that have privileged access to EHRs in a specific institution. Technologies that are tailored to a specific set of data from a given institution generate inspiring results on that data; however, they can fail to generalize to similar data from other institutions and even other departments from the same institution. Therefore, learning from these technologies and building on them becomes difficult.          In order to improve NLP in EHRs, there is need for head-to-head comparison of approaches that can address a given task on the same data set. Shared-tasks provide one way of conducting systematic head-to- head comparisons. This proposal describes a series of shared-task challenges and conferences, spread over a five year period, that promote the development and evaluation of cutting edge clinical NLP systems by distributing de-identified EHRs to the broad research community, under data use agreements, so that:      *	the state-of-the-art in clinical NLP technologies can be identified and advanced,      *	a set of technologies that enable the use of the information contained in EHR narratives becomes available, and      *	the information from EHR narratives can be made more accessible, for example, for clinical and medical research.          The scientific activities supporting the organization of the shared-task challenges are sponsored in part by Informatics for Integrating Biology and the Bedside (i2b2), grant number U54-LM008748, PI: Kohane.

Public health relevance: this proposal will address two main challenges related to the use of clinical narratives for research: availability of clinical records for research and identification of the state of the art in clinical natural language processing (NLP) technologies so that we can push the state of the art forward and so that future work can build on the past.

"Semi-structured Information Retrieval in Clinical Text for Cohort Identification     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques have shown promise for extracting data from the free text of electronic health records (EHRs), but studies have consistently found that techniques do not readily generalize across application settings. Unfortunately, most of the focus in applying NLP to real use cases has remained on a paradigm of single, well-defined application settings, so that generalizability to unseen use cases remains implicitly unaddressed. We propose to explicitly account for unseen application settings by adopting an information retrieval (IR) perspective with the objective of patient-level cohort identification. To do so, we introduce layered language models, an IR framework that enables the reuse of NLP-produced artifacts. Our long term goal is to accelerate investigations of patient health and disease by providing robust, user- centric tools that are necessary to process, retrieve, and utilize the free text of EHRs. The main goal of this proposal is to accurately retrieve ad hoc, realistic cohorts from clinical text at Mayo Clinic and OHSU, establishing methods, resources, and evaluation for patient-level IR. We hypothesize that cohort identification can be addressed in a generalizable fashion by a new IR framework: layered language models. We will test this hypothesis through four specific aims. In Aim 1, we will make medical NLP artifacts searchable in our layered language IR framework. This involves storing and indexing the NLP artifacts, as well as using statistical language models to retrieve documents based on text and its associated NLP artifacts. In Aim 2, we deal with the practical setting of ad hoc cohort identification, moving to patient-level (rather than document-level) IR. To accurately handle patient cohorts in which qualifying evidence may be spread over multiple documents, we will develop and implement patient-level retrieval models that account for cross- document relational and temporal combinations of events. In Aim 3, we will construct parallel IR test collections using EHR data from two sites; a diverse set of cohort queries written by multiple people toward various clinical or epidemiological ends; and assessments of which patients are relevant to which queries at both sites. Finally, in Aim 4, we refine and evaluate patient-level layered language IR on the ad hoc cohort identification task, making comparisons across the users, queries, optimization metrics, and institutions. We will draw additional extrinsic comparisons with pre-existing techniques, e.g., for cohorts from the Electronic Medical Records and Genonmics network. The expected outcomes of the proposed work are: (i) An open-source cohort identification tool, usable by clinicians and epidemiologists, that makes principled use of NLP artifacts for unseen queries; ii) A parallel test collection for cohort identification, includig two intra-institutional document collections, diverse test topics and user-produced text queries, and patient-level judgments of relevance to each query; and (iii) Validation of the reusability of medical NLP via the task of retrieving patient cohorts.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  With the widespread adoption of electronic medical records, one might expect that it would be simple for a medical expert to find things like ""patients in the community who suffer from asthma."" Unfortunately, on top of lab tests, medications, and demographic information, there are observations that a physician writes down as text - which are difficult for a computer to understand. Therefore, we aim to process text so that a computer can understand enough of it, and then search that text along with the rest of a patient's medical record; this will allow clinicians or researchers to find and study patients groups of interest.                ",Semi-structured Information Retrieval in Clinical Text for Cohort Identification,8811565,R01LM011934,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Adoption', 'Asthma', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Dictionary', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Epidemiologist', 'Epidemiology', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Evidence Based Medicine', 'Evolution', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Information Retrieval', 'Information Retrieval Systems', 'Institution', 'Interest Group', 'Investigation', 'Judgment', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Records', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Metric', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Names', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Process', 'Publishing', 'Qualifying', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Retrieval', 'Sampling', 'Semantics', 'Site', 'Smoke', 'Source', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Validation', 'Weight', 'Work', 'Writing', 'asthmatic patient', 'base', 'cohort', 'improved', 'indexing', 'novel', 'open source', 'public health relevance', 'syntax', 'text searching', 'tool']",NLM,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,R01,2014,460688,-0.005030440714510568
"Natural language processing for clinical and translational research DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Rapid growth in the clinical implementation of large electronic medical records (EMRs) has led to an unprecedented expansion in the availability of dense longitudinal datasets for clinical and translational research. This growth is being fueled by recent federal legislation that provides generous financial incentives to institutions demonstrating aggressive application and ""meaningful use"" of comprehensive EMRs. Efforts are already underway to link these EMRs across institutions, and standardize the definition of phenotypes for large scale studies of disease onset and treatment outcome, specifically within the context of routine clinical care. However, a well-known challenge for secondary use of EMR data for clinical and translational research is that much of detailed patient information is embedded in narrative text. Natural Language Processing (NLP) technologies, which are able to convert unstructured clinical text into coded data, have been introduced into the biomedical domain and have demonstrated promising results. Researchers have used NLP systems to identify clinical syndromes and common biomedical concepts from radiology reports, discharge summaries, problem lists, nursing documentation, and medical education documents. Different NLP systems have been developed at different institutions and utilized to convert clinical narrative text into structured data that may be used for other clinical applications and studies. Successful stories in applying NLP to clinical and translational research have been reported widely. However, institutions often deploy different NLP systems, which produce various types of output formats and make it difficult to exchange information between sites. Therefore, the lack of interoperability among different clinical NLP systems becomes a bottleneck for efficient multi-site studies. In addition, many successful studies often require a strong interdisciplinary team where informaticians and clinicians have to work very closely to iteratively define optimal algorithms for clinical phenotypes. As intensive informatics support may not be available to every clinical researcher, the usability of NLP systems for end users is another important issue. The proposed project builds upon first-hand knowledge and experience across the research team in the use of NLP for clinical and translational research projects. There are several big informatics initiatives for clinical and translational research but those initiatives generally assume one shoe fits all and follow top-down approaches to develop NLP solutions. Complementary to those initiatives, we will use a bottom-up approach to handle interoperability and usability: i) we will obtain a common NLP data model and exchange format through empirical analysis of existing NLP systems and NLP results; ii) we will develop a user-centric NLP front end interface for NLP systems wrapped to be consistent with the proposed NLP data model and exchange format incorporating usability analysis into the agile development process.

Therefore, the lack of interoperability among different clinical NLP systems becomes a bottleneck for efficient multi-site studies. In addition, many successful studies often require a strong interdisciplinary team where informaticians and clinicians have to work very closely to iteratively define optimal algorithms for clinical phenotypes. As intensive informatics support may not be available to every clinical researcher, the usability of NLP systems for end users is another important issue. The proposed project builds upon first-hand knowledge and experience across the research team in the use of NLP for clinical and translational research projects. There are several big informatics initiatives for clinical and translational research but those initiatives generally assume one shoe fits all and follow top-down approaches to develop NLP solutions. Complementary to those initiatives, we will use a bottom-up approach to handle interoperability and usability: i) we will obtain a common NLP data model and exchange format through empirical analysis of existing NLP systems and NLP results; ii) we will develop a user-centric NLP front end interface for NLP systems wrapped to be consistent with the proposed NLP data model and exchange format incorporating usability analysis into the agile development process. All deliverables will be distributed through the open health NLP (OHNLP) consortium which we intend to make it more open and inclusive.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Rapid growth in the clinical implementation of large electronic medical records (EMRs) has led to an unprecedented expansion in the availability of dense longitudinal datasets for clinical and translational research. We propose the development of a novel framework to enable the use of clinical information embedded in clinical narratives for clinical and translational research.                ",Natural language processing for clinical and translational research,8640959,R01GM102282,"['Acceleration', 'Adopted', 'Adoption', 'Adverse drug effect', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Attention', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Clinical Research', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'DNA Databases', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Dictionary', 'Discipline of Nursing', 'Disease Association', 'Documentation', 'Elements', 'Exclusion Criteria', 'Genes', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Informatics', 'Institution', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Logical Observation Identifiers Names and Codes', 'Manuals', 'Medical Education', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Onset of illness', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Pharmacogenomics', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Process', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resources', 'Role', 'SNOMED Clinical Terms', 'Semantics', 'Shoes', 'Site', 'Solutions', 'Statutes and Laws', 'Structure', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Translational Research', 'Treatment outcome', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical application', 'clinical care', 'clinical phenotype', 'computer human interaction', 'data exchange', 'data modeling', 'experience', 'financial incentive', 'flexibility', 'human centered computing', 'interoperability', 'novel', 'open source', 'patient safety', 'public health relevance', 'rapid growth', 'success', 'tool', 'usability', 'user-friendly']",NIGMS,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,R01,2014,580082,0.010951132029329846
"Informatics Tools for High-Throughput Sequences Data Analysis    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK) is a suite of best-in-class, widely-used, well-supported, open-source tools for processing and analysis of next-generation DNA sequencing (NGS) data. These tools currently  include a multiple sequence realigner, a covariate-correcting base quality score recalibrator, multi-sample  SNP, INDEL, and CNV genotypers, machine learning algorithms for false positive identification, variant  evaluation modules, somatic SNP and indel callers, and hundreds of other tools. Underlying all of these tools is our structured programming framework (GATK-Engine) that uses the functional programming philosophy of MapReduce to make writing feature-rich, efficient and robust analysis tools easy. By centralizing common data management infrastructure, all GATK-based tools benefit from the engine's correctness, CPU and memory efficiency, as well as automatic distributed and shared memory parallelization, essential capabilities given the massive and growing size of NGS datasets. The GATK currently supports all of the major sequencing technologies including lllumina. Life Sciences 454, and ABI SOLID, from hybrid capture of exomes to 1000s of low-pass samples in the 1000 Genomes Project. Our emphasis on technology-agnostic processing tools has helped to popularize the now standard SAM/BAM and VCFs formats for representing NGS data and variation calls, respectively. In this RFA we propose to  continue to develop the GATK-Engine and data processing tools to (1) achieve complete and accurate  variation discovery and genotyping for all major sequencing study designs and NGS technologies (2)  optimize the GATK-Engine and pipelining infrastructure to operate efficiently on distributed data sets at the  scale of tens of thousands of samples (3) extend the GATK data processing tools to support the upcoming  sequencing technologies of Complete Genomics, lon Torrent, and Pacific Biosciences as well as we do  current technologies, (4) expand significantly our educational and support structures to ensure that the longtail  of future NGS users can benefit from the best-practice data processing and analysis tools in the GATK.        The proposed project aims to continue to develop the Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK), a suite of widely used and mission-critical tools for analyzing the next-generation DNA sequencing data. With this grant we will improve these tools, make them more robust, and extend them to new sequencing technologies. This is essential to realize the potential of DNA sequencing to understand human history, diversity, and to discover  new loci associated with human disease, leading to new biologic hypotheses and new drug targets.

"The Center for Predictive Computational Phenotyping-1 Overall     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The biomedical sciences are being radically transformed by advances in our ability to monitor, record, store and integrate information characterizing human biology and health at scales that range from individual molecules to large populations of subjects. This wealth of information has the potential to substantially advance both our understanding of human biology and our ability to improve human health. Perhaps the most central and general approach for exploiting biomedical data is to use methods from machine learning and statistical modeling to infer predictive models. Such models take as input observable data representing some object of interest, and produce as output a prediction about a particular, unobservable property of the object. This approach has proven to be of high value for a wide range of biomedical tasks, but numerous significant challenges remain to be solved in order for the full potential of predictive modeling to be realized.  To address these challenges, we propose to establish The Center for Predictive Computational Phenotyping (CPCP). Our proposed center will focus on a broad range of problems that can be cast as computational phenotyping. Although some phenotypes are easily measured and interpreted, and are available in an accessible format, a wide range of scientifically and clinically important phenotypes do not satisfy these criteria. In such cases, computational phenotyping methods are required either to (i) extract a relevant  phenotype from a complex data source or collection of heterogeneous data sources, (ii) predict clinically  important phenotypes before they are exhibited, or (iii) do both in the same application.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  We will develop innovative new approaches and tools that are able to discover, and make crucial inferences with large data sets that include molecular profiles, medical images, electronic health records, population-level data, and various combinations of these and other data types. These approaches will significantly advance the state of the art in wide range of biological and clinical investigations, such as predicting which patients are most at risk for breast cancer, heart attacks and severe blood clots.            ",The Center for Predictive Computational Phenotyping-1 Overall,8774800,U54AI117924,"['Address', 'Arts', 'Biological', 'Blood coagulation', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Education', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Exhibits', 'General Population', 'Generations', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Greek', 'Health', 'Human', 'Human Biology', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Monitor', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Organism', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Property', 'Regulatory Element', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Statistical Algorithm', 'Statistical Models', 'Time', 'Training Activity', 'graduate student', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'novel strategies', 'outcome forecast', 'predictive modeling', 'public health relevance', 'success', 'tool', 'treatment planning']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,U54,2014,73173,-0.01935937022395556
"Secure Sharing of Clinical History & Genetic Data: Empowering Predictive Pers. Me    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Computer-assisted medicine is at a crossroads: medical care requires accurate data, but making such data widely available can create unacceptable risks to the privacy of individual patients. This tension between utility and privacy is especially acute in predictive personalized medicine (PPM). PPM holds the promise of making treatment decisions tailored to the individual based on her or his particular genetics and clinical history. Making PPM a reality requires running statistical, data mining and machine learning algorithms on combined genetic, clinical and demographic data to construct predictive models. Access to such data directly competes with the need for healthcare providers to protect the privacy of each patient's data, thus creating a tradeoff between model efficacy and privacy. Thus we find ourselves in an unfortunate standoff: significant medical advances that would result from more powerful mining of the data by a wider variety of researchers are hindered by significant privacy concerns on behalf of the patients represented in the data set. In this proposed work, we seek to develop and evaluate technology to resolve this standoff, enabling health practitioners and researchers to compute on privacy-sensitive medical records in order to make treatment decisions or create accurate models, while protecting patient privacy. We will evaluate our approach on a de-identified actual electronic medical record, with an average of 29 years of clinical history on each patient, and with detailed genetic data (650K SNPs) available for a subset of 5000 of the patients. This data set is available to us now through the Wisconsin Genomics Initiative, but only on a computer at the Marshfield Clinic. If successful our approach will make possible the sharing of this cutting-edge data set, and others like it that are now in development, including our ability to analyze this data at UW-Madison where we have thousands of processors available in our Condor pool. Our privacy approach integrates secure data access environments, including those appropriate to the use of laptops and cloud computing, with novel anonymization algorithms providing differential privacy guarantees for data and/or published results of data analysis. To this end, our specific aims are as follows:       AIM 1: Develop and deploy a secure local environment that, in combination with secure network functionality, will ensure end-to-end security and privacy for electronic medical records and biomedical datasets shared between clinical institutions and researchers.       AIM 2: Develop and deploy a secure virtual environment to allow large-scale, privacy-preserving data analysis ""in the cloud.""       AIM 3: Develop and evaluate privacy-preserving data mining algorithms for use with original (not anonymized) data sets consisting of electronic medical records and genetic data.       AIM 4: Develop and evaluate anonymizing data publishing algorithms and privacy guarantees that are appropriate to the complex structure present in electronic medical records with genetic data.            Project Narrative This project will develop an integrated approach to secure sharing of clinical and genetic data that based on algorithms for anonymization of data to achieve differential privacy guarantees, for privacy-preserving publication of data analysis results, and secure environments for data sharing that include addressing the increasing use of laptops and of cloud computing. The end goal of this project is to meet the competing demands of providing patients with both privacy and accurate predictive models based on clinical history and genetics. This project includes the first concrete evaluation of privacy- preserving data mining algorithms on actual combined EMR and genetic data, using with the Wisconsin Genomics Initiative data set.",Secure Sharing of Clinical History & Genetic Data: Empowering Predictive Pers.

"Developing Smokers for Smoker (S4S): A Collective Intelligence tailoring system     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Smoking is still the number one preventable cause of cancer death. New approaches are needed to engage smokers in the 21st century in smoking cessation. I propose to develop S4S (Smokers for Smoker), a next- generation patient-centered computer tailored health communication (CTHC) system. Unlike current rule- based CTHCs, S4S will replace rules with complex machine learning algorithms, and use the collective experiences of thousands of smokers engaged in a web-assisted tobacco intervention to enhance personally- relevant tailoring for new smokers entering the system. This NCI K07 will provide a mentored research experience, giving me the opportunity to acquire new competencies in cancer health communication for behavior change, research design and statistical methods underlying clinical trial implementation and evaluation. I will adapt collectiv intelligence algorithms that have been used outside healthcare by companies like Amazon and Google to enhance CTHC. Using knowledge from scientific experts, current CTHC collect baseline patient ""profiles"" and then use expert-written, rule-based systems to tailor messages to patient subsets. Such theory-based ""market segmentation has been effective in helping patients reach lifestyle goals. However, there is a natural limit in the ability of a rule-based system to truly personalize content, and adapt personalization over time. Current CTHC have reached this limit, and I propose to go beyond. My first aim is to develop the Web 2.0 ""S4S"" recommender system. My second aim is to evaluate S4S within the context of a NCI funded web-assisted tobacco intervention (Decide2Quit.org). In my efforts, I will guided by my primary mentor (Dr. Houston, MD MPH) and two other mentor teams: The Cancer Health Behavior and Communication Team (Stephenie Lemon, PhD and Kathleen Mazor, EdD), and the Clinical Trial Design and Analysis Team (Jeroan Allison, MD, MS and Arlene Ash, PhD). My comprehensive training also includes coursework, seminars, and conferences.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: A high priority research area identified by the NIH is to understand the role of different media in increasing consumer demand for and use of effective, individually oriented tobacco cessation treatments for diverse populations. Specifically, a research focus is on understanding how to best tailor interventions. Although effective, there is a natural limit in the ability of current rle-based tailoring systems to truly personalize content, and adapt personalization over time.

"Utilizing social media as a resource for mental health surveillance DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Major depressive disorder is one of the most common debilitating illnesses in the United States, with a lifetime prevalence of 16.2%. Currently, nationwide mental health surveillance takes the form of large-scale telephone- based surveys. These surveys have high running costs and require teams of human telephone operators. Even the largest system, the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, reaches only 0.13% of the US population. Twitter (and other microblog services) offers a rich, if terse, multilingual source of real time data for public health surveillance. Natural Language Processing (NLP) provides techniques and resources to ""unlock"" data from text. We propose using Twitter and NLP as a cost-effective and flexible approach to augmenting current telephone- based surveillance methods for population level depression monitoring.         This grant application has two major strands. First, investigating ethical issues and challenges to privacy that emerge with the use of Twitter data for public health surveillance (Aim One). Second, developing techniques and resources for real-time public health surveillance for mental illness from Twitter (Aim Two &Aim Three). Aim One seeks to investigate and codify our responsibilities as researchers towards Twitter users by engaging with those users directly. With Aim Two, we will build and evaluate Natural Language Processing resources - algorithms, lexicons and taxonomies - to support the identification of depression symptoms in Twitter data. For Aim Three, we will build and evaluate Natural Language Processing modules and services that use Twitter as a data source for monitoring depression levels in the community. The significance of the proposed work lies in three areas. First, our investigations - both empirical and theoretical - will explore ethical issues in the use of Twitter for public health surveillance. This work has the potential to guide future research in the area. Second, in developing and evaluating algorithms and resources for identifying depression from tweets, we are contributing foundational work to the field of NLP. Third, developing these algorithms and resources will provide the bedrock for building social media based surveillance systems which will provide a cost effective means of augmenting current mental health surveillance practice. This proposal is innovative in both its application area (microblogs have not been used before for mental health surveillance), its focus on using NLP to identify depressive symptoms for public health, and in the central role that qualitative bioethical research will play in guiding the work. Project Narrative The proposed research focuses on using advanced Natural Language Processing methods to mine microblog data - in this case, Twitter - for mental health surveillance (specifically, depression surveillance), in order to augment current telephone-based mental health surveillance systems.

"Interactive Search and Review of Clinical Records with Multi-layered Semantic Ann    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       A critical element of translating science into practice is the ability to find patient populations for clinical research. Many studies rely on administrative data for selecting relevant patients for studies of comparative effectiveness, but the limitations of administrative data is well-known. Much of the information critical for clinical research is locked in free-text dictated reports, such as history and physical exams and radiology reports. Data repositories, such as the Medical Archival Retrieval System (MARS) at the University of Pittsburgh, are useful for identifying supersets of patients for clinical research studies through indexed word searches. However, simple text-based queries are also limited in their effectiveness, and researchers are often left reading through hundreds or thousands of reports to filter out false positive cases. Current processes are time-consuming and extraordinarily expensive. They lead to long delays between the development of a testable hypothesis and the ability to share findings with the medical community at large.       A potential solution to this problem is pre-annotating de-identified clinical reports to facilitate more intelligent and sophisticated retrieval and review. Clinical reports are rich in meaning and structure and can be annotated at many different levels using natural language processing technology. It is not clear, however, what types of annotations would be most helpful to a clinical researcher, nor is it clear how to display the annotations to best assist manual review of reports. There is interdependence between the annotation schema used by an NLP system and the user interface for assisting researchers in retrieving data for retrospective studies. In this proposal, we will interactively revise an NLP annotation schema as well as explore various methods for annotation display based on feedback from users reviewing patient data for specific research studies.       We hypothesize that an interactive search application that relies on NLP-annotated clinical text will increase the accuracy and efficiency of finding patients for clinical research studies and will support visualization techniques for viewing the data in a way that improves a researcher's ability to review patient data.              Narrative We will develop a novel review application for this proposal that will facilitate translational research from secondary use of EHR data by assisting researchers in more efficiently finding retrospective populations of patients for clinical research studies. The application will rely both on multi-layered annotation of the textual data, using natural langauge processing, and on coordinated views of the patient data.",Interactive Search and Review of Clinical Records with Multi-layered Semantic Ann,8714052,R01LM010964,"['Automated Annotation', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Effectiveness', 'Elements', 'Feedback', 'Imagery', 'Lead', 'Left', 'Manuals', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Process', 'Property', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Reading', 'Recording of previous events', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Retrieval', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Science', 'Semantics', 'Solutions', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Translational Research', 'Universities', 'base', 'comparative effectiveness', 'computer human interaction', 'improved', 'indexing', 'novel', 'patient population', 'research study', 'success']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,R01,2014,579144,0.004804204158032474
"InfoMediator: Weaving Clinical Expertise in Online Health Communities     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Chronic illness can be overwhelming to patients because it impacts many areas of their daily lives. Accordingly, many patients turn to online health support groups to get social support. In face-to-face patient support groups (F2F), health professional moderators provide clinical expertise within the context of peer-patients' sharing of experience. However, in online health community settings, because health professionals' time and resources are expensive, it is challenging to get health professionals' opinions for thousands of messages posted each day. To solve this problem, I propose to develop methods and techniques that maximize the use of already available clinical expertise online for online peer-patient conversation threads by developing a system, InfoMediator. The InfoMediator will semi-automatically weave health professionals' existing answers to patients' questions into peer-patient conversations by using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques complemented by user feedback. As the career development component of this proposal, I deepen my skills and knowledge in NLP necessary for proposed work and patient education. As I develop the NLP techniques and knowledge in patient education, I and my mentors will develop methods and techniques that address weaving clinical expertise within peer-patient conversations by designing, implementing, and evaluating socio-technical aspects of the InfoMediator. The training opportunities provided by this NIH NLM K01 grant, together with the supportive research environment at Michigan State University, will help further extend my existing expertise in human-computer interaction, design, and health informatics to establish my independent informatics research program in patient-centered technologies. Focusing on persons with diabetes, the outcomes of the proposed research will help us understand how to empower persons with diabetes to improve self- efficacy and self-care, while increasing the quality of online health information environment.             8.

"Using NLP to Extract Clinically Important Recommendations from Radiology Reports  Abstract Communication of clinically important follow-up recommendations when abnormalities are identified on imaging studies is prone to error. The absence of an automated system to identify and track radiology follow-up recommendations is an important barrier to ensuring timely follow-up of patients, especially for non-acute but potentially life threatening and unexpected findings. The primary goal of this proposal is to develop a Natural Language Processing (NLP) system to extract clinically important recommendation information from free-text radiology reports. Each radiology report will be preprocessed at the structural, syntactic, and semantic level to generate features that will be used to extract the boundaries of sentences that include recommendation information as well as the details of reason for recommendation, requested imaging test, and recommendation time frame. We will use a large corpus of free-text radiology reports represented by a mixture of modalities (e.g., radiography, computed tomography, ultrasound, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)) from three different institutions. Using this dataset we will perform the following specific aims: Aim 1. Create a multi- institutional radiology report corpus annotated for clinically important recommendation information; Aim 2. Develop a novel NLP system to extract clinically important recommendations in radiology reports. The proposed research is innovative because it will generate a new text processing approach that can be used to flag reports visually and electronically so that separate workflow processes can be initiated to reduce the chance that necessary investigations or interventions suggested in the report are missed by clinicians. The proposed set of tools will be disseminated to the biomedical informatics community as open source tools.

"Encoding and Processing Patient Allergy Information in EHRs     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Allergies affect one in five Americans and are the 5th leading chronic disease in the U.S. Each year, allergies account for more than 17 million outpatient office visits. Although documenting and exchanging allergy information in electronic health records (EHRs) is becoming increasingly important, we still face multiple challenges. These include: lack of well-adopted standard terminologies for representing allergies, frequent entry of allergy information as free-text, and no existing process for reconciling allergy information. In this study, we will provide solutions to these challenges by addressing the following specific aims: 1) conduct analyses on standard terminologies and a large allergy repository to build a comprehensive knowledge base for representing allergy information; 2) design, develop and evaluate a natural language processing (NLP) module for extracting and encoding free-text allergy information and integrate it with an existing NLP system; 3) measure the feasibility and efficiency of the proposed NLP system for the new process of allergy reconciliation; and 4) distribute our methods and tool, so they are widely available to other researchers and healthcare institutions for non-commercial use.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Managing allergy information within the electronic health record (EHR) is vital to ensuring patient safety. The goal of this study is to propose a comprehensive solution to assess existing terminology standards and knowledge bases for representing allergy information, develop and evaluate a natural language processing (NLP) system for extracting and encoding allergy information from free-text clinical documents, and finally measure the feasibility of using NLP output to facilitate the allergy reconciliation proces.

"Improving Accuracy of Electronic Notes Using A Faster, Simpler Approach     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Physician progress notes contain information essential to patient care, including findings from history and physical exam, interpretation of tests, assessment and treatment plans. However in the transition from paper to electronic physician notes, many physicians spend more time creating them, which has led to the use of time-saving measures such as copy/paste and templates that have degraded note accuracy and quality. This threatens the usefulness of notes not only for their most important use-patient care-but also for research, quality improvement, and in supporting reimbursement. To address these problems, we propose a project with the following specific aims: 1. To refine and implement a new voice-generated enhanced electronic note system (VGEENS) integrating voice recognition with natural language processing and links to the electronic medical record (EMR) to improve note accuracy and timeliness. 2. To evaluate VGEENS using a randomized trial with 30 internal medicine physicians in each arm to assess electronic note accuracy, quality, timeliness, and user satisfaction. Intervention physicians will use VGEENS, while the control physicians will continue with note creation as they normally would. This novel approach has the potential to improve note accuracy while reducing delays in making progress notes in EMRs available to other clinicians. It leverages rapidly improving voice recognition and NLP technologies to permit physicians to use a natural, fast method-human voice-to convey their observation and thoughts into the EMR record.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Physician documentation of a patient visit contains information that is used in that patient's care. This information includes findings from a patient' history and physical exam, interpretation of necessary tests, the problem assessment and treatment plan. However, in the transition from paper to electronic physician notes, many physicians are spending more time creating these notes. This has led to use of time-saving measures that have degraded the accuracy and ease of use of patient notes. By the end of this project, we expect to have developed, used and evaluated a new method for creating electronic physician notes that both improve accuracy and timely availability of inpatient progress notes.            ","Improving Accuracy of Electronic Notes Using A Faster, Simpler Approach",8805997,R21HS023631,[' '],AHRQ,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R21,2014,154347,-0.017919766840913627

"Screening Nonrandomized Studies for Inclusion in Systematic Reviews of Evidence  Screening Nonrandomized Studies for Inclusion in Systematic Reviews of Evidence Translation of biomedical research into practice depends in part on the production of quality systematic reviews that synthesize available evidence. Unfortunately, about 20% of reviews are never completed. Of those that reach fruition, the average time to completion may be 2.4 years, with a reported maximum of 9 years. A major bottleneck occurs when teammates screen studies. In the first step, they independently identify provisionally eligible studies by reading the same set of perhaps thousands of titles and abstracts. To date, researchers have used supervised machine learning (ML) methods in an attempt to automate identification of eligible randomized controlled trials (RCTs). However, finding nonrandomized (NR) studies for inclusion in systematic reviews has yet to be addressed. This is an important problem because RCTs may be unlikely or even unethical for some research questions. Hypotheses. It is broadly hypothesized that (a) methods based on natural language processing and ML can be used to automatically identify topically relevant studies with a mix of NR designs eligible for inclusion in systematic reviews; and (b) machine performance can consistently reach current human standards with respect to identifying eligible studies. Aims. This research has three aims: (1) Compare the language that biomedical researchers use to describe their NR study designs with existing relevant vocabularies. Develop complementary terminologies for overlooked NR study designs to improve coverage of important vocabularies. Develop and validate a standalone terminology to support librarians who add free-text terms to expert searches. (2) Develop and compare procedures based on natural language processing and supervised ML methods to identify provisionally eligible NR studies that are topically relevant from a set of citations, including titles, abstracts, and metadata. Use terms for NR study designs to improve classification. (3) Generalize procedures developed under Aims 1 and 2 to select topically relevant studies with a mix of designs for provisional inclusion in several types of systematic reviews. Use contextual information in segments of full texts tagged for location to enrich feature vectors. Methods. Reference standards will be built from studies in published Cochrane reviews. Features will be extracted from citations and regions of full texts. Additionally, feature vectors will be enriched with terms for designs that researchers use in combination with terms extracted from major vocabularies. Model performance will be compared with respect to several measures, including mean recall and precision, for 10-fold cross-validations and validations on held-out test sets. Significance. The proposed research is significant because it will help support translation of biomedical research to improve human health. Moreover, developing procedures to identify NR studies is essential for the expeditious translation of a very large body of research.  Translation of biomedical research helps to improve public health by delivering the best available evidence to clinicians. This process depends in part on the production of systematic reviews of research. Computerized procedures will be developed to reduce the labor associated with screening nonrandomized studies for inclusion in reviews.",Screening Nonrandomized Studies for Inclusion in Systematic Reviews of Evidence,8484438,R00LM010943,"['Address', 'Biomedical Research', 'Classification', 'Health', 'Human', 'Language', 'Librarians', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Performance', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Production', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Reading', 'Reference Standards', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Terminology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Translations', 'Validation', 'Vocabulary', 'abstracting', 'base', 'computerized', 'design', 'improved', 'research to practice', 'screening', 'systematic review', 'vector']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R00,2013,202118,-0.014406712331884772
"Scalable and Robust Clinical Text De-Identification Tools     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Exploiting the full potential of information rich and rapidly growing repositories of patient clinical text is hampered by the absence of scalable and robust de-identification tools. Clinical text contains protected health information (PHI), and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) restricts research use of patient information containing PHI to specific, limited, IRB-approved projects. As a result, vast repositories of clinical text remain under-used by internal researchers, and are even less available for external transmission to outside collaborators or for centralized processing by state-of-the-art natural language processing (NLP) technologies. De-identification, which is the removal of PHI from clinical text, is challenging. Despite their availability for over a decade, commercially available automated systems are expensive, require local tailoring, and have not gained widespread market penetration. Manual methods are costly and do not scale, yet continue to be used despite the small amount of residual PHI they leave behind. Open source de-identification tools based on state-of-the-art machine learning technologies can perform at or above the level of manual approaches but also suffer from the residual PHI problem. Current de-identification approaches, then, also severely limit the use and mobility of clinical text while exposing patients to privacy risks. These approaches redact PHI, blacking it out or replacing it with symbols (e.g., ""Here for cardiac eval is Mr. **PT_NAME<AA>, a **AGE<60s> yo male with his son Doug ...""). Traditional approaches leave residual PHI (""Doug"" in this example) to be easily noticed by readers of the text, as it remains plainly visible among the prominent redactions. We developed and pilot tested an alternative approach we believe addresses the residual PHI problem. Our approach uses the strategy of concealing, rather than trying to eliminate, residual PHI. We call it the ""Hiding In Plain Sight"" (HIPS) approach. HIPS replaces all known PHI with ""surrogate"" PHI- fictional names, ages, etc.-that look real but do not refer to any actual patient. A HIPS version of the above text is: ""Here for cardiac eval is Mr. Jones, a 64 yo male with his son Doug ..."" where the name ""Jones"" and age ""64"" are fictional surrogates, but the name ""Doug"" is residual PHI. To a reader, the surrogates and the residual PHI are indistinguishable. This prevents the reader from detecting the latter, avoiding disclosure. Our preliminary studies suggest that HIPS can reduce the risk of disclosure of residual PHI by a factor of 10. This yields overall performance that far surpasses the performance attainable by manual methods, and is unlikely to be matched, we believe, by additional incremental improvements in PHI tagging models (i.e., efforts to reduce residual PHI). Our pilot studies indicate IRBs would welcome the HIPS approach if it were shown to be effective through rigorous evaluation. To expand usage of clinical text and enhance patient privacy, we propose to formalize rules of effective surrogate generation (Aim 1), extend related de-identification confidence scoring methods (Aim 2), and conduct rigorous efficacy testing of HIPS in diverse institutional settings (Aim 3).                  All known automated de-identification methods leave behind a small amount of residual protected health information (PHI), which presents a risk of disclosing patient privacy and creates barriers to more widespread internal use and external sharing of information-rich clinical text for broad research purpose. This project advances and evaluates the efficacy of a novel method, called the Hiding In Plain Sight (HIPS) approach, which conceals residual PHI by replacing all other instance of PHI found in a document with realistic appearing but fictitious surrogates. Rigorous efficacy testing is needed to confirm that HIPS surrogates effectively reduce risk of exposing patient privacy by concealing the small amount of residual PHI all known de-identification leave behind.",Scalable and Robust Clinical Text De-Identification Tools,8532984,R01LM011366,"['Address', 'Age', 'Applied Research', 'Cardiac', 'Clinical', 'Detection', 'Disclosure', 'Evaluation', 'Excision', 'Foundations', 'Generations', 'Health', 'Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act', 'Healthcare', 'Human', 'Information Theory', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'Left', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Marketing', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Names', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Patients', 'Penetration', 'Performance', 'Pilot Projects', 'Plant Roots', 'Privacy', 'Process', 'Publishing', 'Reader', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Residual state', 'Risk', 'Scoring Method', 'Simulate', 'Son', 'Source', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Validation', 'Vision', 'Work', 'base', 'efficacy testing', 'male', 'novel', 'open source', 'patient privacy', 'prevent', 'programs', 'repository', 'software systems', 'tool', 'transmission process']",NLM,KAISER FOUNDATION HEALTH PLAN OF WASHINGTON,R01,2013,247288,-0.010729816838810295
"Challenges in Natural Language Processing for Clinical Narratives     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Narratives of electronic health records (EHRs) contain useful information that is difficult to automatically extract, index, search, or interpret. Clinical natural language processing (NLP) technologies for automatic extraction, indexing, searching, and interpretation of EHRs are in development; however, due to privacy concerns related to EHRs, such technologies are usually developed by teams that have privileged access to EHRs in a specific institution. Technologies that are tailored to a specific set of data from a given institution generate inspiring results on that data; however, they can fail to generalize to similar data from other institutions and even other departments from the same institution. Therefore, learning from these technologies and building on them becomes difficult.          In order to improve NLP in EHRs, there is need for head-to-head comparison of approaches that can address a given task on the same data set. Shared-tasks provide one way of conducting systematic head-to- head comparisons. This proposal describes a series of shared-task challenges and conferences, spread over a five year period, that promote the development and evaluation of cutting edge clinical NLP systems by distributing de-identified EHRs to the broad research community, under data use agreements, so that:      *	the state-of-the-art in clinical NLP technologies can be identified and advanced,      *	a set of technologies that enable the use of the information contained in EHR narratives becomes available, and      *	the information from EHR narratives can be made more accessible, for example, for clinical and medical research.          The scientific activities supporting the organization of the shared-task challenges are sponsored in part by Informatics for Integrating Biology and the Bedside (i2b2), grant number U54-LM008748, PI: Kohane.

"Natural language processing for clinical and translational research     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Rapid growth in the clinical implementation of large electronic medical records (EMRs) has led to an unprecedented expansion in the availability of dense longitudinal datasets for clinical and translational research. This growth is being fueled by recent federal legislation that provides generous financial incentives to institutions demonstrating aggressive application and ""meaningful use"" of comprehensive EMRs. Efforts are already underway to link these EMRs across institutions, and standardize the definition of phenotypes for large scale studies of disease onset and treatment outcome, specifically within the context of routine clinical care. However, a well-known challenge for secondary use of EMR data for clinical and translational research is that much of detailed patient information is embedded in narrative text. Natural Language Processing (NLP) technologies, which are able to convert unstructured clinical text into coded data, have been introduced into the biomedical domain and have demonstrated promising results. Researchers have used NLP systems to identify clinical syndromes and common biomedical concepts from radiology reports, discharge summaries, problem lists, nursing documentation, and medical education documents. Different NLP systems have been developed at different institutions and utilized to convert clinical narrative text into structured data that may be used for other clinical applications and studies. Successful stories in applying NLP to clinical and translational research have been reported widely. However, institutions often deploy different NLP systems, which produce various types of output formats and make it difficult to exchange information between sites. Therefore, the lack of interoperability among different clinical NLP systems becomes a bottleneck for efficient multi-site studies. In addition, many successful studies often require a strong interdisciplinary team where informaticians and clinicians have to work very closely to iteratively define optimal algorithms for clinical phenotypes. As intensive informatics support may not be available to every clinical researcher, the usability of NLP systems for end users is another important issue. The proposed project builds upon first-hand knowledge and experience across the research team in the use of NLP for clinical and translational research projects. There are several big informatics initiatives for clinical and translational research but those initiatives generally assume one shoe fits all and follow top-down approaches to develop NLP solutions. Complementary to those initiatives, we will use a bottom-up approach to handle interoperability and usability: i) we will obtain a common NLP data model and exchange format through empirical analysis of existing NLP systems and NLP results; ii) we will develop a user-centric NLP front end interface for NLP systems wrapped to be consistent with the proposed NLP data model and exchange format incorporating usability analysis into the agile development process.

"Informatics Tools for High-Throughput Sequences Data Analysis    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK) is a suite of best-in-class, widely-used, well-supported, open-source tools for processing and analysis of next-generation DNA sequencing (NGS) data. These tools currently  include a multiple sequence realigner, a covariate-correcting base quality score recalibrator, multi-sample  SNP, INDEL, and CNV genotypers, machine learning algorithms for false positive identification, variant  evaluation modules, somatic SNP and indel callers, and hundreds of other tools. Underlying all of these tools is our structured programming framework (GATK-Engine) that uses the functional programming philosophy of MapReduce to make writing feature-rich, efficient and robust analysis tools easy. By centralizing common data management infrastructure, all GATK-based tools benefit from the engine's correctness, CPU and memory efficiency, as well as automatic distributed and shared memory parallelization, essential capabilities given the massive and growing size of NGS datasets. The GATK currently supports all of the major sequencing technologies including lllumina. Life Sciences 454, and ABI SOLID, from hybrid capture of exomes to 1000s of low-pass samples in the 1000 Genomes Project. Our emphasis on technology-agnostic processing tools has helped to popularize the now standard SAM/BAM and VCFs formats for representing NGS data and variation calls, respectively. In this RFA we propose to  continue to develop the GATK-Engine and data processing tools to (1) achieve complete and accurate  variation discovery and genotyping for all major sequencing study designs and NGS technologies (2)  optimize the GATK-Engine and pipelining infrastructure to operate efficiently on distributed data sets at the  scale of tens of thousands of samples (3) extend the GATK data processing tools to support the upcoming  sequencing technologies of Complete Genomics, lon Torrent, and Pacific Biosciences as well as we do  current technologies, (4) expand significantly our educational and support structures to ensure that the longtail  of future NGS users can benefit from the best-practice data processing and analysis tools in the GATK.        The proposed project aims to continue to develop the Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK), a suite of widely used and mission-critical tools for analyzing the next-generation DNA sequencing data. With this grant we will improve these tools, make them more robust, and extend them to new sequencing technologies.

"Secure Sharing of Clinical History & Genetic Data: Empowering Predictive Pers. Me    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Computer-assisted medicine is at a crossroads: medical care requires accurate data, but making such data widely available can create unacceptable risks to the privacy of individual patients. This tension between utility and privacy is especially acute in predictive personalized medicine (PPM). PPM holds the promise of making treatment decisions tailored to the individual based on her or his particular genetics and clinical history. Making PPM a reality requires running statistical, data mining and machine learning algorithms on combined genetic, clinical and demographic data to construct predictive models. Access to such data directly competes with the need for healthcare providers to protect the privacy of each patient's data, thus creating a tradeoff between model efficacy and privacy. Thus we find ourselves in an unfortunate standoff: significant medical advances that would result from more powerful mining of the data by a wider variety of researchers are hindered by significant privacy concerns on behalf of the patients represented in the data set. In this proposed work, we seek to develop and evaluate technology to resolve this standoff, enabling health practitioners and researchers to compute on privacy-sensitive medical records in order to make treatment decisions or create accurate models, while protecting patient privacy. We will evaluate our approach on a de-identified actual electronic medical record, with an average of 29 years of clinical history on each patient, and with detailed genetic data (650K SNPs) available for a subset of 5000 of the patients. This data set is available to us now through the Wisconsin Genomics Initiative, but only on a computer at the Marshfield Clinic. If successful our approach will make possible the sharing of this cutting-edge data set, and others like it that are now in development, including our ability to analyze this data at UW-Madison where we have thousands of processors available in our Condor pool. Our privacy approach integrates secure data access environments, including those appropriate to the use of laptops and cloud computing, with novel anonymization algorithms providing differential privacy guarantees for data and/or published results of data analysis. To this end, our specific aims are as follows:       AIM 1: Develop and deploy a secure local environment that, in combination with secure network functionality, will ensure end-to-end security and privacy for electronic medical records and biomedical datasets shared between clinical institutions and researchers.       AIM 2: Develop and deploy a secure virtual environment to allow large-scale, privacy-preserving data analysis ""in the cloud.""       AIM 3: Develop and evaluate privacy-preserving data mining algorithms for use with original (not anonymized) data sets consisting of electronic medical records and genetic data.       AIM 4: Develop and evaluate anonymizing data publishing algorithms and privacy guarantees that are appropriate to the complex structure present in electronic medical records with genetic data.            Project Narrative This project will develop an integrated approach to secure sharing of clinical and genetic data that based on algorithms for anonymization of data to achieve differential privacy guarantees, for privacy-preserving publication of data analysis results, and secure environments for data sharing that include addressing the increasing use of laptops and of cloud computing.

"Developing Smokers for Smoker (S4S): A Collective Intelligence tailoring system     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Smoking is still the number one preventable cause of cancer death. New approaches are needed to engage smokers in the 21st century in smoking cessation. I propose to develop S4S (Smokers for Smoker), a next- generation patient-centered computer tailored health communication (CTHC) system. Unlike current rule- based CTHCs, S4S will replace rules with complex machine learning algorithms, and use the collective experiences of thousands of smokers engaged in a web-assisted tobacco intervention to enhance personally- relevant tailoring for new smokers entering the system. This NCI K07 will provide a mentored research experience, giving me the opportunity to acquire new competencies in cancer health communication for behavior change, research design and statistical methods underlying clinical trial implementation and evaluation. I will adapt collectiv intelligence algorithms that have been used outside healthcare by companies like Amazon and Google to enhance CTHC. Using knowledge from scientific experts, current CTHC collect baseline patient ""profiles"" and then use expert-written, rule-based systems to tailor messages to patient subsets. Such theory-based ""market segmentation has been effective in helping patients reach lifestyle goals. However, there is a natural limit in the ability of a rule-based system to truly personalize content, and adapt personalization over time. Current CTHC have reached this limit, and I propose to go beyond. My first aim is to develop the Web 2.0 ""S4S"" recommender system. My second aim is to evaluate S4S within the context of a NCI funded web-assisted tobacco intervention (Decide2Quit.org). In my efforts, I will guided by my primary mentor (Dr. Houston, MD MPH) and two other mentor teams: The Cancer Health Behavior and Communication Team (Stephenie Lemon, PhD and Kathleen Mazor, EdD), and the Clinical Trial Design and Analysis Team (Jeroan Allison, MD, MS and Arlene Ash, PhD). My comprehensive training also includes coursework, seminars, and conferences.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: A high priority research area identified by the NIH is to understand the role of different media in increasing consumer demand for and use of effective, individually oriented tobacco cessation treatments for diverse populations. Specifically, a research focus is on understanding how to best tailor interventions. Although effective, there is a natural limit in the ability of current rle-based tailoring systems to truly personalize content, and adapt personalization over time. This NCI K07 will advance computer tailoring by adapting machine learning collective intelligence algorithms that have been used outside healthcare by companies like Amazon and Google to enhance the personal relevance of the health communication.            ",Developing Smokers for Smoker (S4S): A Collective Intelligence tailoring system,8581564,K07CA172677,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Attitude', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Carbon Monoxide', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Electronic Mail', 'Engineering', 'Evaluation', 'Feedback', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Communication', 'Health behavior', 'Healthcare', 'Intelligence', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Life Style', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Marketing', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Metadata', 'Modeling', 'Outpatients', 'Patients', 'Plant Roots', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Randomized', 'Receiver Operator Characteristics', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Priority', 'Role', 'Smoker', 'Smoking', 'Smoking Behavior', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tobacco', 'Tobacco Use Cessation', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Visit', 'Withholding Treatment', 'Work', 'Writing', 'base', 'behavior change', 'communication behavior', 'consumer demand', 'demographics', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'improved', 'insight', 'next generation', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'patient oriented', 'programs', 'research study', 'skills', 'smoking cessation', 'symposium', 'theories', 'web services', 'web site']",NCI,UNIV OF MASSACHUSETTS MED SCH WORCESTER,K07,2013,140793,-0.011852573564303021
"Utilizing social media as a resource for mental health surveillance     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Major depressive disorder is one of the most common debilitating illnesses in the United States, with a lifetime prevalence of 16.2%. Currently, nationwide mental health surveillance takes the form of large-scale telephone- based surveys. These surveys have high running costs and require teams of human telephone operators. Even the largest system, the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, reaches only 0.13% of the US population. Twitter (and other microblog services) offers a rich, if terse, multilingual source of real time data for public health surveillance. Natural Language Processing (NLP) provides techniques and resources to ""unlock"" data from text. We propose using Twitter and NLP as a cost-effective and flexible approach to augmenting current telephone- based surveillance methods for population level depression monitoring.         This grant application has two major strands. First, investigating ethical issues and challenges to privacy that emerge with the use of Twitter data for public health surveillance (Aim One). Second, developing techniques and resources for real-time public health surveillance for mental illness from Twitter (Aim Two &Aim Three). Aim One seeks to investigate and codify our responsibilities as researchers towards Twitter users by engaging with those users directly. With Aim Two, we will build and evaluate Natural Language Processing resources - algorithms, lexicons and taxonomies - to support the identification of depression symptoms in Twitter data. For Aim Three, we will build and evaluate Natural Language Processing modules and services that use Twitter as a data source for monitoring depression levels in the community. The significance of the proposed work lies in three areas. First, our investigations - both empirical and theoretical - will explore ethical issues in the use of Twitter for public health surveillance. This work has the potential to guide future research in the area. Second, in developing and evaluating algorithms and resources for identifying depression from tweets, we are contributing foundational work to the field of NLP. Third, developing these algorithms and resources will provide the bedrock for building social media based surveillance systems which will provide a cost effective means of augmenting current mental health surveillance practice. This proposal is innovative in both its application area (microblogs have not been used before for mental health surveillance), its focus on using NLP to identify depressive symptoms for public health, and in the central role that qualitative bioethical research will play in guiding the work.              Project Narrative The proposed research focuses on using advanced Natural Language Processing methods to mine microblog data - in this case, Twitter - for mental health surveillance (specifically, depression surveillance), in order to augment current telephone-based mental health surveillance systems.

"Annotation, development and evaluation for clinical information extraction    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Much of the clinical information required for accurate clinical research, active decision support, and broad-coverage surveillance is locked in text files in an electronic medical record (EMR). The only feasible way to leverage this information for translational science is to extract and encode the information using natural language processing (NLP). Over the last two decades, several research groups have developed NLP tools for clinical notes, but a major bottleneck preventing progress in clinical NLP is the lack of standard, annotated data sets for training and evaluating NLP applications. Without these standards, individual NLP applications abound without the ability to train different algorithms on standard annotations, share and integrate NLP modules, or compare performance. We propose to develop standards and infrastructure that can enable technology to extract scientific information from textual medical records, and we propose the research as a collaborative effort involving NLP experts across the U.S. To accomplish this goal, we will address three specific aims: Aim 1: Extend existing standards and develop new consensus standards for annotating clinical text in a way that is interoperable, extensible, and usable. Aim 2: Apply existing methods and tools, and develop new methods and tools where necessary for manually annotating a set of publicly available clinical texts in a way that is efficient and accurate. Aim 3: Develop a publicly available toolkit for automatically annotating clinical text and perform a shared evaluation to evaluate the toolkit, using evaluation metrics that are multidimensional and flexible.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In this project, we will develop a publicly available corpus of annotated clinical texts for NLP research. We will experiment with methods for increasing the efficiency of annotation and will annotate de-identified reports of nine types for linguistic and clinical information. In addition, we will create an NLP toolkit that can be shared and will evaluate it against other NLP systems in a shared task evaluation with the community.

"Phenotype Discovery in NHLBI Genomic Studies (PhD)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Abstract Researchers continually upload data into public repositories at a rapid pace, yet utilize few common standards for annotation, making it close to impossible to compare or associate data across studies. To address this problem, we will develop a defined meta- data model and build an integrated system called Phenotype Discovery (PhD) that enables researchers to query and find genomic studies of interest in public repositories as well as upload new data into our database (sdGaP), in a standardized manner. A Query Interpreter (QI) will utilize text mining and natural language processing techniques to map free text into concepts in biomedical ontologies, allowing non-structured queries to be answered efficiently. In Phase I of the project, we will develop a proof-of-concept system that can retrospectively structure phenotypic descriptions in dbGaP, and will work with domain experts in pneumology to build use cases and evaluate the automated mappings. In Phase II of the project, we will extend the domain expertise to cardiology, hematology, and sleep disorders to build a more comprehensive system, expanding the phenotype annotation to transcriptome databases, and integrating a flexible automated genotype annotation tool for sdGaP. We will develop a user-friendly interface to prospectively assist researchers in uploading their data with standardized phenotypic annotations. We will provide the tool for free from our website and continuously improve its quality, based on user feedback and usage data.        Relevance Phenotype Discovery (PhD) represents a novel, automated system to describe the characteristics of patients whose genetic information is available in public data repositories, without compromising their privacy. This initiative is greatly needed so that more researchers can make use of data collected from projects funded by public agencies. PhD uses new methodology for natural language processing and semantic integration to interpret the narrative text as well as variables and their values from studies in genomic databases.

"Informatics Infrastructure for vector-based neuroanatomical atlases  Abstract The adage: 'all data is spatial' is especially pertinent in the field of neuroscience, since neuronal data must be indexed by the neuroanatomical location of phenomena or entities under study. Brain atlases are very widely used as laboratory tools, being some of the most highly cited publications in science. This proposal seeks to use brain atlases as a method for indexing data from the literature in a neuroinformatics system. This data includes both textual and graphical information, ranging from highly detailed maps constructed from vector- based spatial primitives, histological photographs and drawings, to textual reports of experimental findings in the literature (which we will analyze on a large scale). These data represent a significant scientific investment that are currently locked away in previously published journal articles (and the detailed data-sets and drawings from researchers that were used to write the articles). A prototype that summarizes the last fifteen years' output of one of the world's most prominent neuroanatomy laboratories is immediately available. This project will develop a collaborative environment to enable neuroscientists to use these valuable maps within the community as a whole by contributing data to a shared system with an open-source system (called 'NeuARt II') that permits querying, overlaying, viewing and annotating such data in an integrated manner. We will also use Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to index neuroanatomical references in large numbers of journal articles to be accessible within our infrastructure. As an initial text corpus, we over 110,000 documents taken from last 35 years of published information from the primary neuroanatomical literature. We will construct a neuroanatomical interface that conceptually resembles the 'Google Maps' system, permitting users to use an intuitive spatial interface to browse large amounts of biomedical data in spatial register. The proposed infrastructure will also provide new opportunities to compare and synthesize the anatomical components of neuroscience data multiple modalities (physiological, behavioral, clinical, genetic, molecular, etc.).  Narrative Given the scope of the use of neuroanatomical maps from the rat and mouse in the study of neurobiological disease, we expect our research impact scientists working in almost all subfields of the subject. Our collaborators who form the early adopters of this approach are neuroendocrinology researchers studying the mechanisms of stress and anxiety disorders which are estimated to affect 19.1 million people in the USA, costing $42 billion in health care costs per year (source: Anxiety Disorders Association of America). A better understanding of the neuronal mechanisms underlying these disorders could lead to new, effective therapies and treatments.",Informatics Infrastructure for vector-based neuroanatomical atlases,8426190,R01MH079068,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Americas', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Atlases', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Community Outreach', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Devices', 'Disease', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Fluoro-Gold', 'Harvest', 'Health Care Costs', 'Image', 'Informatics', 'Investments', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Lesion', 'Literature', 'Location', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Mus', 'Names', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neuroanatomy', 'Neurobiology', 'Neuroendocrinology', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Online Systems', 'Output', 'Paper', 'Physiological', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Rattus', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Semantics', 'Source', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Text', 'Tissues', 'Work', 'Writing', 'abstracting', 'base', 'biomedical ontology', 'cost', 'effective therapy', 'indexing', 'journal article', 'neuroinformatics', 'novel', 'open source', 'prototype', 'research study', 'stress disorder', 'text searching', 'tool', 'vector', 'web services']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,R01,2013,315672,-0.013325613183863789
"POET-2: High-performance computing for advanced clinical narrative preprocessing    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       This project focuses on clinical natural language processing (cNLP), a field of emerging importance in informatics. Starting with the Linguistic String Project's Medical Language Processor (New York University) in the 1970s, researchers have made steady gains in cNLP through empirical studies and by building sophisticated high-level cNLP software applications (e.g., Columbia's MedLEE). There are no fewer than four scientific conferences devoted exclusively to biomedical/clinical NLP. The cNLP literature has been growing over the past decade, and this will gain momentum as more clinical text repositories are released, such as the MIMIC II and University of Pittsburgh BLU Lab corpora.       However, sustained success in the field of cNLP is hampered by the reality that clinical texts have a far more noise than do texts traditionally studied in NLP, such as newswire articles, biomedical abstracts, and discharge summaries. Noise in this context is defined by the parseability characteristics of the language and the linguistic structures that appear in text. Clinical texts come in a striking variety of note types, with the best studied types being discharge summaries, radiology reports, and pathology reports. These note types share an important feature: they are written to communicate care issues between healthcare providers and hence typically are well-composed, well-edited, and often are dictated. But the vast majority of notes in the electronic health record are written primarily to document care issues. They communicate as well, of course, but much less care is used in their creation than with discharge summaries and reports. As a result they are often ungrammatical; are composed of short, telegraphic phrases; are replete with misspellings and shorthand (e.g., abbreviations); are ill-formatted with templates and liberal use of white space; and are embedded with ""non-prose"" (e.g., strings of laboratory values). All of these sources of noise complicate otherwise straightforward NLP tasks like tokenization, sentence segmentation, and ultimately information extraction itself.       We propose a systematic study of ways to increase the signal-to-noise ratio in clinical narratives to improve cNLP. This work extends our preliminary research (under the POET project) and has the following aims:        o Develop and implement a suite of parseability improvement tools designed for all clinical note types from multiple healthcare institutions.     o Evaluate the empirical and the functional success of the parseability improvement tools.     o Design and implement a HIPAA-compliant UlMA-based pipeline cNLP framework for use in a typical high-performance, multi-processor computing environment.              Project Narrative We can see in the multi-billion dollar investment in electronic health records (EHRs) by the ARRA that mining clinical data electronically will continue to be essential to informatics research. Most data in the EHR resides as unstructured text, and POET2 provides a means to unlock that data through combining a new, HIPAA- complaint high-performance computing architecture with sophisticated text preprocessing.",POET-2: High-performance computing for advanced clinical narrative preprocessing,8536940,R01LM010981,"['Abbreviations', 'Active Learning', 'Address', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Authorization documentation', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Electronics', 'Employee Strikes', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Face', 'Gold', 'Growth', 'Health Care Reform', 'Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act', 'Health Personnel', 'Healthcare', 'High Performance Computing', 'Informatics', 'Inpatients', 'Institution', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'Investments', 'Laboratories', 'Language', 'Linguistics', 'Literature', 'Maps', 'Medical', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'New York', 'Noise', 'Occupations', 'Outpatients', 'Paper', 'Pathology', 'Pathology Report', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Proliferating', 'Publishing', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Records', 'Report (document)', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Support', 'Resolution', 'Series', 'Shorthand', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Summary Reports', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Time', 'Universities', 'Voting', 'Work', 'Writing', 'abstracting', 'base', 'cluster computing', 'data mining', 'design', 'improved', 'meetings', 'novel', 'phrases', 'pressure', 'repaired', 'repository', 'research study', 'success', 'symposium', 'tool', 'web services']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,R01,2013,292186,-0.0077054798872180745
"Translational refinement of adaptive communication system for locked-in patients    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proliferation of brain-computer interface (BCI) technology promises locked-in patients potential ways to communicate successfully. Most BCI systems either involve selection from among a set of simultaneously presented stimuli, requiring extensive control of the interface; or use binary stimulus selection mechanisms that fail to achieve high communication rates because of slow intent detection or a fixed (context independent) ordering of stimuli. We propose a new interface using binary selection of text input via rapid serial visual presentation of natural language components. Individuals with severe speech and physical impairments (SSPI) resulting from acquired neurological disorders (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, brainstem stroke, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, spinal cord injury) and neurodevelopmental disorders (cerebral palsy, muscular dystrophy) drive the proposed research. Four laboratories form an alliance for this translational research project: basic research (Erdogmus, engineering; Roark, computer science and natural language processing), and clinical research (Oken, neurology/neurophysiology; Fried-Oken, augmentative communication/neurogenic communication disorders). Our aims are (1) to develop an innovative EEG-based BCI that achieves increased communication rates with fewer errors and greater satisfaction for the target SSPI populations; (2) to iteratively refine the system in the laboratory with user feedback from healthy subjects and expert LIS users of marketed AAC systems; (3) to evaluate the performance of the system within the natural clinical settings of SSPI patients. The innovative BCI is the RSVP Keyboard with three essential features: (1) rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP) of linguistic components ranging from letters to words to phrases; (2) a detection mechanism that employs multichannel electroencephalography (EEG) and/or other suitable response mechanisms that can reliably indicate the binary intent of the user and adapt based on individualized neurophysiologic data of the user; and (3) an open-vocabulary natural language model with a capability for accurate predictions of upcoming text. Theoretical framework is based on a solid Bayesian foundation; clinical usability is based on the WHO ICF (WHO, 2001) and an Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC) model of participation. Rigorous experimental scrutiny in both clinical laboratory and natural settings will be obtained with able-bodied subjects and SSPI patients. Measures of learning rate, speed of message production, error rate and user satisfaction for different iterations of the RSVP keyboard will be obtained using an hypothesis-driven crossover design for 36 healthy subjects, and alternating treatment randomization design for 40 patients with SSPI. Descriptions of the motor, cognitive, and language skills of LIS patients using the novel system in their natural environments will inform clinical guidelines and functional device adaptations to better individualize treatment for children and adults with SSPI. The collaborative nature of the proposed translational research is expected to yield new knowledge for both BCI development and clinical AAC use.    Relevance: The populations of patients with locked-in syndrome are increasing as medical technologies advance and successfully support life. These individuals with limited to no movement could potentially contribute to their medical decision making, informed consent, and daily care giving if they had faster, more reliable means to interface with communication systems. The RSVP keyboard and proposed language models are innovative technological discoveries that are being applied to clinical augmentative communication tools so that patients and their families can participate in daily activities and advocate for improvements in standard clinical care. The proposed project stresses the translation of basic computer science into clinical care, supporting the proposed NIH Roadmap and public health initiatives.

"Continued Development and Evaluation of caTIES Abstract We propose to further develop, test, evaluate and support caTIES - an existing software system for developing networked repositories of sharable de-identified surgical pathology reports. The caTIES system creates a repository of de-identified, structured, and concept-coded clinical reports derived from large corpora of clinical free-text. Documents are automatically coded against a controlled terminology such as the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS), SNOMED-CT, or NCI Metathesaurus. Users construct queries to identify specific kinds of documents and tissue specimens based on the associated clinical report. For example, a researcher studying genetic variation in metastatic breast cancers can identify cases of invasive ductal carcinoma of the breast, followed by metastatic ductal cancer in bone at an interval of three years or greater from the original diagnosis. The caTIES system also supports acquisition and ordering of tissues, using an honest broker model. Through this mechanism, de-identified data and access to tissue can be shared among institutions, enabling multi-center collaborative research. The caTIES system has already been implemented at seven US Cancer Centers, and is being considered for adoption by numerous other institutions including cancer centers, university hospitals and private hospitals. Initial development of caTIES was funded by the Cancer Biomedical Informatics Grid (caBIG). However, interest in the application has far exceeded our expectations and the limitations of caBIG. This grant will allow us to further extend the capabilities of the system by (a) improving the portability of the system and extending the types of documents that can be processed, (b) evaluating the system's NLP performance and usability, (c) building a user community to support this open-source application, and (d) piloting interoperability of caTIES with other enterprise and research systems. This work will preserve and extend a highly novel platform for development of massive repositories of de-identified clinical data that can be used for research within and across institutions. Narrative This grant will fund the further development and evaluation of a system that takes identified clinical documents and converts them into de-identified, concept-coded, structured data. The system enables researchers to access remainder tissues and clinical report data for research purposes within and across institution. This project is important because it will greatly increase the access of researchers to important data and materials while maintaining patient privacy. n/a",Continued Development and Evaluation of caTIES,8403841,R01CA132672,"['Access to Information', 'Adoption', 'Cancer Center', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Community Developments', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Reporting', 'Database Management Systems', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Documentation', 'Ductal', 'Electronic Mail', 'Eligibility Determination', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genomics', 'Grant', 'Information Retrieval', 'Institution', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methods', 'Metric', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Operating System', 'Pathology Report', 'Performance', 'Private Hospitals', 'Process', 'Report (document)', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Services', 'Specimen', 'Structure', 'Surgical Pathology', 'System', 'Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine', 'Terminology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Unified Medical Language System', 'University Hospitals', 'Vocabulary', 'Work', 'abstracting', 'base', 'bone', 'cancer Biomedical Informatics Grid', 'clinical phenotype', 'computer human interaction', 'ductal breast carcinoma', 'expectation', 'flexibility', 'improved', 'interest', 'interoperability', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'meetings', 'metathesaurus', 'novel', 'open source', 'patient privacy', 'portability', 'repository', 'software development', 'software systems', 'systems research', 'tool', 'usability']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2013,286637,-0.051459002472475195

"Temporal relation discovery for clinical text    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overarching long-term vision of our research is to create novel technologies for processing clinical free text. Such technologies will enable sophisticated and efficient indexing, retrieval and data mining over the ever increasing amounts of electronic clinical data. Processing free text poses a number of challenges to which the fields of Artificial intelligence, natural language processing and computer science in general have made advances. Methods for processing free text are informed by linguistic theory combined with the power of statistical inferencing. A key component to the next step, natural language understanding, is discovering events and their relations on a timeline. Temporal relations are of prime importance in biomedicine as they are intrinsically linked to diseases, signs and symptoms, and treatments. Understanding the timeline of clinically relevant events is key to the next generation of translational research where the importance of generalizing over large amounts of data holds the promise of deciphering biomedical puzzles.        The goal of our current proposal is to discover temporal relations from clinical free text through achieving four specific aims:        Specific Aim 1: Develop (1) a temporal relation annotation schema and guidelines for clinical free text based on TimeML, which will require extensions to Treebank, PropBank and VerbNet annotation guidelines to the clinical domain, (2) an annotated corpus following the temporal relations schema with additions to Treebank, PropBank and VerbNet, (3) a descriptive study comparing temporal relations in the clinical and general domains.        Specific Aim 2: Extend and evaluate existing methods and/or develop new algorithms for temporal relation discovery in the clinical domain. Component-level evaluation        Specific Aim 3: Integrate best method and/or a variety of methods for temporal relation discovery into the open source Mayo Clinic IE pipeline and release as open source annotators in the pipeline. Functional testing. Dissemination activities.        Specific Aim 4: System-level evaluation. Test the functionality of the enhanced Mayo Clinic IE pipeline on translational research use cases, e.g. the progression of colon cancer as documented in clinical notes and pathology reports, the progression of brain tumor as documented in radiology reports.        The methods we will use for the temporal relation discovery are based on machine learning, e.g., Support Vector Machine technology. Such methods require the annotation of a reference standard from which the computations are derived. The best methods will be released as part of the Mayo Clinic Information Extraction System for the larger community to use and contribute to. We will test the methods against biomedical queries.           Relevance (max 2-3 sentences) Temporal relations are of prime importance in biomedicine as they are intrinsically linked to diseases, signs and symptoms, and treatments.

"Screening Nonrandomized Studies for Inclusion in Systematic Reviews of Evidence  Screening Nonrandomized Studies for Inclusion in Systematic Reviews of Evidence Translation of biomedical research into practice depends in part on the production of quality systematic reviews that synthesize available evidence. Unfortunately, about 20% of reviews are never completed. Of those that reach fruition, the average time to completion may be 2.4 years, with a reported maximum of 9 years. A major bottleneck occurs when teammates screen studies. In the first step, they independently identify provisionally eligible studies by reading the same set of perhaps thousands of titles and abstracts. To date, researchers have used supervised machine learning (ML) methods in an attempt to automate identification of eligible randomized controlled trials (RCTs). However, finding nonrandomized (NR) studies for inclusion in systematic reviews has yet to be addressed. This is an important problem because RCTs may be unlikely or even unethical for some research questions. Hypotheses. It is broadly hypothesized that (a) methods based on natural language processing and ML can be used to automatically identify topically relevant studies with a mix of NR designs eligible for inclusion in systematic reviews; and (b) machine performance can consistently reach current human standards with respect to identifying eligible studies. Aims. This research has three aims: (1) Compare the language that biomedical researchers use to describe their NR study designs with existing relevant vocabularies. Develop complementary terminologies for overlooked NR study designs to improve coverage of important vocabularies. Develop and validate a standalone terminology to support librarians who add free-text terms to expert searches. (2) Develop and compare procedures based on natural language processing and supervised ML methods to identify provisionally eligible NR studies that are topically relevant from a set of citations, including titles, abstracts, and metadata. Use terms for NR study designs to improve classification. (3) Generalize procedures developed under Aims 1 and 2 to select topically relevant studies with a mix of designs for provisional inclusion in several types of systematic reviews. Use contextual information in segments of full texts tagged for location to enrich feature vectors. Methods. Reference standards will be built from studies in published Cochrane reviews. Features will be extracted from citations and regions of full texts. Additionally, feature vectors will be enriched with terms for designs that researchers use in combination with terms extracted from major vocabularies. Model performance will be compared with respect to several measures, including mean recall and precision, for 10-fold cross-validations and validations on held-out test sets. Significance. The proposed research is significant because it will help support translation of biomedical research to improve human health. Moreover, developing procedures to identify NR studies is essential for the expeditious translation of a very large body of research.  Translation of biomedical research helps to improve public health by delivering the best available evidence to clinicians. This process depends in part on the production of systematic reviews of research. Computerized procedures will be developed to reduce the labor associated with screening nonrandomized studies for inclusion in reviews.",Screening Nonrandomized Studies for Inclusion in Systematic Reviews of Evidence,8471822,R00LM010943,"['Address', 'Biomedical Research', 'Classification', 'Health', 'Human', 'Language', 'Librarians', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Performance', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Production', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Reading', 'Reference Standards', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Screening procedure', 'Terminology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Translations', 'Validation', 'Vocabulary', 'abstracting', 'base', 'computerized', 'design', 'improved', 'research to practice', 'systematic review', 'vector']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R00,2012,224100,-0.014406712331884772
"Scalable and Robust Clinical Text De-Identification Tools     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Exploiting the full potential of information rich and rapidly growing repositories of patient clinical text is hampered by the absence of scalable and robust de-identification tools. Clinical text contains protected health information (PHI), and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) restricts research use of patient information containing PHI to specific, limited, IRB-approved projects. As a result, vast repositories of clinical text remain under-used by internal researchers, and are even less available for external transmission to outside collaborators or for centralized processing by state-of-the-art natural language processing (NLP) technologies. De-identification, which is the removal of PHI from clinical text, is challenging. Despite their availability for over a decade, commercially available automated systems are expensive, require local tailoring, and have not gained widespread market penetration. Manual methods are costly and do not scale, yet continue to be used despite the small amount of residual PHI they leave behind. Open source de-identification tools based on state-of-the-art machine learning technologies can perform at or above the level of manual approaches but also suffer from the residual PHI problem. Current de-identification approaches, then, also severely limit the use and mobility of clinical text while exposing patients to privacy risks. These approaches redact PHI, blacking it out or replacing it with symbols (e.g., ""Here for cardiac eval is Mr. **PT_NAME<AA>, a **AGE<60s> yo male with his son Doug ...""). Traditional approaches leave residual PHI (""Doug"" in this example) to be easily noticed by readers of the text, as it remains plainly visible among the prominent redactions. We developed and pilot tested an alternative approach we believe addresses the residual PHI problem. Our approach uses the strategy of concealing, rather than trying to eliminate, residual PHI. We call it the ""Hiding In Plain Sight"" (HIPS) approach. HIPS replaces all known PHI with ""surrogate"" PHI- fictional names, ages, etc.-that look real but do not refer to any actual patient. A HIPS version of the above text is: ""Here for cardiac eval is Mr. Jones, a 64 yo male with his son Doug ..."" where the name ""Jones"" and age ""64"" are fictional surrogates, but the name ""Doug"" is residual PHI. To a reader, the surrogates and the residual PHI are indistinguishable. This prevents the reader from detecting the latter, avoiding disclosure. Our preliminary studies suggest that HIPS can reduce the risk of disclosure of residual PHI by a factor of 10. This yields overall performance that far surpasses the performance attainable by manual methods, and is unlikely to be matched, we believe, by additional incremental improvements in PHI tagging models (i.e., efforts to reduce residual PHI). Our pilot studies indicate IRBs would welcome the HIPS approach if it were shown to be effective through rigorous evaluation. To expand usage of clinical text and enhance patient privacy, we propose to formalize rules of effective surrogate generation (Aim 1), extend related de-identification confidence scoring methods (Aim 2), and conduct rigorous efficacy testing of HIPS in diverse institutional settings (Aim 3).                  All known automated de-identification methods leave behind a small amount of residual protected health information (PHI), which presents a risk of disclosing patient privacy and creates barriers to more widespread internal use and external sharing of information-rich clinical text for broad research purpose. This project advances and evaluates the efficacy of a novel method, called the Hiding In Plain Sight (HIPS) approach, which conceals residual PHI by replacing all other instance of PHI found in a document with realistic appearing but fictitious surrogates. Rigorous efficacy testing is needed to confirm that HIPS surrogates effectively reduce risk of exposing patient privacy by concealing the small amount of residual PHI all known de-identification leave behind.",Scalable and Robust Clinical Text De-Identification Tools,8345041,R01LM011366,"['Address', 'Age', 'Applied Research', 'Cardiac', 'Clinical', 'Detection', 'Disclosure', 'Evaluation', 'Excision', 'Foundations', 'Generations', 'Health', 'Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act', 'Healthcare', 'Human', 'Information Theory', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'Left', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Marketing', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Names', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Patients', 'Penetration', 'Performance', 'Pilot Projects', 'Plant Roots', 'Privacy', 'Process', 'Publishing', 'Reader', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Residual state', 'Risk', 'Scoring Method', 'Simulate', 'Son', 'Source', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Validation', 'Vision', 'Work', 'base', 'efficacy testing', 'male', 'novel', 'open source', 'patient privacy', 'prevent', 'programs', 'repository', 'software systems', 'tool', 'transmission process']",NLM,KAISER FOUNDATION HEALTH PLAN OF WASHINGTON,R01,2012,318849,-0.010729816838810295
"Real-time Disambiguation of Abbreviations in Clinical Notes    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A key prerequisite for high-quality healthcare delivery is effective communication within and across healthcare settings. However, communication can be hampered by the pervasive use of abbreviations in clinical notes. Clinicians use abbreviations to save time during documentation. While abbreviations may seem unambiguous to their authors, they often cause confusion to other readers, including healthcare providers, patients, and natural language processing (NLP) systems attempting to extract clinical terms from text. While the understanding that abbreviations can cause errors is widespread, few have deployed pragmatic solutions for this important problem. The proposed project will develop, evaluate, and share a systematic approach to Clinical Abbreviation Recognition and Disambiguation (CARD), and in doing so substantially aims to benefit existing NLP systems and to improve computer-based documentation systems by reducing ambiguities in electronic records in real-time. The study includes the following five Specific Aims: 1) Develop automated methods to detect abbreviations and their senses from clinical text corpora and build a comprehensive knowledge base of clinical abbreviations; 2) Develop and evaluate three automated word sense disambiguation (WSD) classifiers, and establish methods to combine those classifiers to maximize both their performance and coverage; 3) Develop the CARD system, and demonstrate its effectiveness by integrating it with two established NLP systems (MedLEE and KnowledgeMap); 4) Integrate CARD with an institutional clinical documentation system (Vanderbilt's StarNotes) and evaluate its ability to expand abbreviations in real-time as clinicians generate records; 5) Distribute the CARD knowledge base and software for non-commercial uses.              Project Narrative Abbreviations are widely used throughout all types of clinical documents and they cause confusion to both healthcare providers and patients and limit effective communications within and across care settings. This proposed study will develop informatics methods to automatically detect abbreviations and their possible meanings from large clinical text and to disambiguate abbreviations that have multiple meanings. We will also integrate those methods with clinical documentation systems so that abbreviations will be expanded in real-time when physicians entering clinical notes, thus to improve the quality of health records.",Real-time Disambiguation of Abbreviations in Clinical Notes,8305149,R01LM010681,"['Abbreviations', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Computer Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Confusion', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Disease', 'Documentation', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronics', 'Equipment and supply inventories', 'Frequencies', 'Health Personnel', 'Healthcare', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Joints', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Medical Records', 'Methods', 'Names', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nitroglycerin', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Reader', 'Records', 'Serious Adverse Event', 'Solutions', 'System', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Time', 'Work', 'Writing', 'acronyms', 'base', 'health care delivery', 'health record', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'knowledge base', 'novel', 'phrases', 'satisfaction']",NLM,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,R01,2012,129035,-0.004776294447103208
"Challenges in Natural Language Processing for Clinical Narratives     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Narratives of electronic health records (EHRs) contain useful information that is difficult to automatically extract, index, search, or interpret. Clinical natural language processing (NLP) technologies for automatic extraction, indexing, searching, and interpretation of EHRs are in development; however, due to privacy concerns related to EHRs, such technologies are usually developed by teams that have privileged access to EHRs in a specific institution. Technologies that are tailored to a specific set of data from a given institution generate inspiring results on that data; however, they can fail to generalize to similar data from other institutions and even other departments from the same institution. Therefore, learning from these technologies and building on them becomes difficult.          In order to improve NLP in EHRs, there is need for head-to-head comparison of approaches that can address a given task on the same data set. Shared-tasks provide one way of conducting systematic head-to- head comparisons. This proposal describes a series of shared-task challenges and conferences, spread over a five year period, that promote the development and evaluation of cutting edge clinical NLP systems by distributing de-identified EHRs to the broad research community, under data use agreements, so that:      *	the state-of-the-art in clinical NLP technologies can be identified and advanced,      *	a set of technologies that enable the use of the information contained in EHR narratives becomes available, and      *	the information from EHR narratives can be made more accessible, for example, for clinical and medical research.          The scientific activities supporting the organization of the shared-task challenges are sponsored in part by Informatics for Integrating Biology and the Bedside (i2b2), grant number U54-LM008748, PI: Kohane.          This proposal aims to organize a series of workshops, conference proceedings, and journal special issues that will accompany the shared-task challenges in order to disseminate the knowledge generated by the challenges.                  Public health relevance: this proposal will address two main challenges related to the use of clinical narratives for research: availability of clinical records for research and identification of the state of the art in clinical natural language processing (NLP) technologies so that we can push the state of the art forward and so that future work can build on the past.

"Informatics Tools for High-Throughput Sequences Data Analysis    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK) is a suite of best-in-class, widely-used, well-supported, open-source tools for processing and analysis of next-generation DNA sequencing (NGS) data. These tools currently  include a multiple sequence realigner, a covariate-correcting base quality score recalibrator, multi-sample  SNP, INDEL, and CNV genotypers, machine learning algorithms for false positive identification, variant  evaluation modules, somatic SNP and indel callers, and hundreds of other tools. Underlying all of these tools is our structured programming framework (GATK-Engine) that uses the functional programming philosophy of MapReduce to make writing feature-rich, efficient and robust analysis tools easy. By centralizing common data management infrastructure, all GATK-based tools benefit from the engine's correctness, CPU and memory efficiency, as well as automatic distributed and shared memory parallelization, essential capabilities given the massive and growing size of NGS datasets. The GATK currently supports all of the major sequencing technologies including lllumina. Life Sciences 454, and ABI SOLID, from hybrid capture of exomes to 1000s of low-pass samples in the 1000 Genomes Project. Our emphasis on technology-agnostic processing tools has helped to popularize the now standard SAM/BAM and VCFs formats for representing NGS data and variation calls, respectively. In this RFA we propose to  continue to develop the GATK-Engine and data processing tools to (1) achieve complete and accurate  variation discovery and genotyping for all major sequencing study designs and NGS technologies (2)  optimize the GATK-Engine and pipelining infrastructure to operate efficiently on distributed data sets at the  scale of tens of thousands of samples (3) extend the GATK data processing tools to support the upcoming  sequencing technologies of Complete Genomics, lon Torrent, and Pacific Biosciences as well as we do  current technologies, (4) expand significantly our educational and support structures to ensure that the longtail  of future NGS users can benefit from the best-practice data processing and analysis tools in the GATK.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed project aims to continue to develop the Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK), a suite of widely used and mission-critical tools for analyzing the next-generation DNA sequencing data.

"Secure Sharing of Clinical History & Genetic Data: Empowering Predictive Pers. Me    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Computer-assisted medicine is at a crossroads: medical care requires accurate data, but making such data widely available can create unacceptable risks to the privacy of individual patients. This tension between utility and privacy is especially acute in predictive personalized medicine (PPM). PPM holds the promise of making treatment decisions tailored to the individual based on her or his particular genetics and clinical history. Making PPM a reality requires running statistical, data mining and machine learning algorithms on combined genetic, clinical and demographic data to construct predictive models. Access to such data directly competes with the need for healthcare providers to protect the privacy of each patient's data, thus creating a tradeoff between model efficacy and privacy. Thus we find ourselves in an unfortunate standoff: significant medical advances that would result from more powerful mining of the data by a wider variety of researchers are hindered by significant privacy concerns on behalf of the patients represented in the data set. In this proposed work, we seek to develop and evaluate technology to resolve this standoff, enabling health practitioners and researchers to compute on privacy-sensitive medical records in order to make treatment decisions or create accurate models, while protecting patient privacy. We will evaluate our approach on a de-identified actual electronic medical record, with an average of 29 years of clinical history on each patient, and with detailed genetic data (650K SNPs) available for a subset of 5000 of the patients. This data set is available to us now through the Wisconsin Genomics Initiative, but only on a computer at the Marshfield Clinic. If successful our approach will make possible the sharing of this cutting-edge data set, and others like it that are now in development, including our ability to analyze this data at UW-Madison where we have thousands of processors available in our Condor pool. Our privacy approach integrates secure data access environments, including those appropriate to the use of laptops and cloud computing, with novel anonymization algorithms providing differential privacy guarantees for data and/or published results of data analysis. To this end, our specific aims are as follows:       AIM 1: Develop and deploy a secure local environment that, in combination with secure network functionality, will ensure end-to-end security and privacy for electronic medical records and biomedical datasets shared between clinical institutions and researchers.       AIM 2: Develop and deploy a secure virtual environment to allow large-scale, privacy-preserving data analysis ""in the cloud.""       AIM 3: Develop and evaluate privacy-preserving data mining algorithms for use with original (not anonymized) data sets consisting of electronic medical records and genetic data.       AIM 4: Develop and evaluate anonymizing data publishing algorithms and privacy guarantees that are appropriate to the complex structure present in electronic medical records with genetic data.            Project Narrative This project will develop an integrated approach to secure sharing of clinical and genetic data that based on algorithms for anonymization of data to achieve differential privacy guarantees, for privacy-preserving publication of data analysis results, and secure environments for data sharing that include addressing the increasing use of laptops and of cloud computing. The end goal of this project is to meet the competing demands of providing patients with both privacy and accurate predictive models based on clinical history and genetics. This project includes the first concrete evaluation of privacy- preserving data mining algorithms on actual combined EMR and genetic data, using with the Wisconsin Genomics Initiative data set.",Secure Sharing of Clinical History & Genetic Data: Empowering Predictive Pers.

"Interactive Search and Review of Clinical Records with Multi-layered Semantic Ann    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       A critical element of translating science into practice is the ability to find patient populations for clinical research. Many studies rely on administrative data for selecting relevant patients for studies of comparative effectiveness, but the limitations of administrative data is well-known. Much of the information critical for clinical research is locked in free-text dictated reports, such as history and physical exams and radiology reports. Data repositories, such as the Medical Archival Retrieval System (MARS) at the University of Pittsburgh, are useful for identifying supersets of patients for clinical research studies through indexed word searches. However, simple text-based queries are also limited in their effectiveness, and researchers are often left reading through hundreds or thousands of reports to filter out false positive cases. Current processes are time-consuming and extraordinarily expensive. They lead to long delays between the development of a testable hypothesis and the ability to share findings with the medical community at large.       A potential solution to this problem is pre-annotating de-identified clinical reports to facilitate more intelligent and sophisticated retrieval and review. Clinical reports are rich in meaning and structure and can be annotated at many different levels using natural language processing technology. It is not clear, however, what types of annotations would be most helpful to a clinical researcher, nor is it clear how to display the annotations to best assist manual review of reports. There is interdependence between the annotation schema used by an NLP system and the user interface for assisting researchers in retrieving data for retrospective studies. In this proposal, we will interactively revise an NLP annotation schema as well as explore various methods for annotation display based on feedback from users reviewing patient data for specific research studies.       We hypothesize that an interactive search application that relies on NLP-annotated clinical text will increase the accuracy and efficiency of finding patients for clinical research studies and will support visualization techniques for viewing the data in a way that improves a researcher's ability to review patient data.              Narrative We will develop a novel review application for this proposal that will facilitate translational research from secondary use of EHR data by assisting researchers in more efficiently finding retrospective populations of patients for clinical research studies. The application will rely both on multi-layered annotation of the textual data, using natural langauge processing, and on coordinated views of the patient data.",Interactive Search and Review of Clinical Records with Multi-layered Semantic Ann,8333306,R01LM010964,"['Automated Annotation', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Effectiveness', 'Elements', 'Feedback', 'Imagery', 'Lead', 'Left', 'Manuals', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Process', 'Property', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Reading', 'Recording of previous events', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Retrieval', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Science', 'Semantics', 'Solutions', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Translational Research', 'Universities', 'base', 'comparative effectiveness', 'computer human interaction', 'improved', 'indexing', 'novel', 'patient population', 'research study', 'success']",NLM,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2012,592423,0.004804204158032474
"Annotation, development and evaluation for clinical information extraction    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Much of the clinical information required for accurate clinical research, active decision support, and broad-coverage surveillance is locked in text files in an electronic medical record (EMR). The only feasible way to leverage this information for translational science is to extract and encode the information using natural language processing (NLP). Over the last two decades, several research groups have developed NLP tools for clinical notes, but a major bottleneck preventing progress in clinical NLP is the lack of standard, annotated data sets for training and evaluating NLP applications. Without these standards, individual NLP applications abound without the ability to train different algorithms on standard annotations, share and integrate NLP modules, or compare performance. We propose to develop standards and infrastructure that can enable technology to extract scientific information from textual medical records, and we propose the research as a collaborative effort involving NLP experts across the U.S. To accomplish this goal, we will address three specific aims: Aim 1: Extend existing standards and develop new consensus standards for annotating clinical text in a way that is interoperable, extensible, and usable. Aim 2: Apply existing methods and tools, and develop new methods and tools where necessary for manually annotating a set of publicly available clinical texts in a way that is efficient and accurate. Aim 3: Develop a publicly available toolkit for automatically annotating clinical text and perform a shared evaluation to evaluate the toolkit, using evaluation metrics that are multidimensional and flexible.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In this project, we will develop a publicly available corpus of annotated clinical texts for NLP research. We will experiment with methods for increasing the efficiency of annotation and will annotate de-identified reports of nine types for linguistic and clinical information. In addition, we will create an NLP toolkit that can be shared and will evaluate it against other NLP systems in a shared task evaluation with the community.

"Phenotype Discovery in NHLBI Genomic Studies (PhD)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Abstract Researchers continually upload data into public repositories at a rapid pace, yet utilize few common standards for annotation, making it close to impossible to compare or associate data across studies. To address this problem, we will develop a defined meta- data model and build an integrated system called Phenotype Discovery (PhD) that enables researchers to query and find genomic studies of interest in public repositories as well as upload new data into our database (sdGaP), in a standardized manner. A Query Interpreter (QI) will utilize text mining and natural language processing techniques to map free text into concepts in biomedical ontologies, allowing non-structured queries to be answered efficiently. In Phase I of the project, we will develop a proof-of-concept system that can retrospectively structure phenotypic descriptions in dbGaP, and will work with domain experts in pneumology to build use cases and evaluate the automated mappings. In Phase II of the project, we will extend the domain expertise to cardiology, hematology, and sleep disorders to build a more comprehensive system, expanding the phenotype annotation to transcriptome databases, and integrating a flexible automated genotype annotation tool for sdGaP. We will develop a user-friendly interface to prospectively assist researchers in uploading their data with standardized phenotypic annotations. We will provide the tool for free from our website and continuously improve its quality, based on user feedback and usage data.        Relevance Phenotype Discovery (PhD) represents a novel, automated system to describe the characteristics of patients whose genetic information is available in public data repositories, without compromising their privacy. This initiative is greatly needed so that more researchers can make use of data collected from projects funded by public agencies. PhD uses new methodology for natural language processing and semantic integration to interpret the narrative text as well as variables and their values from studies in genomic databases.

"Evidence-based Diagnostic Tools for Translational and Clinical Research (eTfor2)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The eTfor2 project will develop and evaluate open-source programs and knowledge representations to better characterize patients for translational and clinical research studies. The project addresses National Library of Medicine (NLM) RFA initiatives for: (a) information & knowledge processing, including natural language processing and text summarization, (b) approaches for linking phenomic and genomic information, and (c) integration of information from heterogeneous sources. Translational studies correlate clinical patient descriptors (phenome) with results of genomic investigations, e.g., genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Standard methods for defining phenotypes require costly, labor-intensive cohort enrollments to identify patients with diseases and appropriate controls. Recently, translational and clinical researchers have used electronic medical record (EMR) data as an alternative to identifying patient characteristics. However, EMR case extraction requires substantial manual review and ""tuning"" for case selection, due to the inaccuracies inherent in ICD9 billing codes. While relevant and useful natural language processing (NLP) approaches to facilitate EMR text extraction have proliferated, the target patient descriptors these approaches employ typically remain non-standard and locally defined, and vary from disease to disease, project to project and institution to institution. At best, such NLP applications use standard terminology descriptors such as SNOMED-CT as EMR extraction targets. Yet, there is no generally utilized ""standard"" knowledge base that links such ""extractable"" descriptors to an academic-quality knowledge source detailing what findings have been reliably reported to occur in each disease. To facilitate translational and clinical research, the eTfor2 project will make available an open-source, evidence-based, electronic clinical knowledge base (KB) and related NLP tools enabling researchers at any site to extract a standard ""target"" set of EMR-based phenomic descriptors at both the finding and disease levels. It will further include diagnostic decision support logic to confirm the degree of support for patients' diagnoses in their EMR records. The eTfor2 project will decrease effort required to harvest EMR patient descriptors for clinical and translational studies, and enable new translational work that identifies genomic associations at both finding and disease levels. The eTfor2 resources should improve the quality and cross-institutional validity of EMR-based translational and clinical studies.           Evidence-based Diagnostic Tools for Translational and Clinical Research (eTfor2) Project Narrative When completed successfully, the eTfor2 project will enable researchers at disparate institutions to extract from their respective EMR systems a shared ""target"" set of common phenomic descriptors, in a standard, reproducible manner.

"Informatics Infrastructure for vector-based neuroanatomical atlases  Abstract The adage: 'all data is spatial' is especially pertinent in the field of neuroscience, since neuronal data must be indexed by the neuroanatomical location of phenomena or entities under study. Brain atlases are very widely used as laboratory tools, being some of the most highly cited publications in science. This proposal seeks to use brain atlases as a method for indexing data from the literature in a neuroinformatics system. This data includes both textual and graphical information, ranging from highly detailed maps constructed from vector- based spatial primitives, histological photographs and drawings, to textual reports of experimental findings in the literature (which we will analyze on a large scale). These data represent a significant scientific investment that are currently locked away in previously published journal articles (and the detailed data-sets and drawings from researchers that were used to write the articles). A prototype that summarizes the last fifteen years' output of one of the world's most prominent neuroanatomy laboratories is immediately available. This project will develop a collaborative environment to enable neuroscientists to use these valuable maps within the community as a whole by contributing data to a shared system with an open-source system (called 'NeuARt II') that permits querying, overlaying, viewing and annotating such data in an integrated manner. We will also use Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to index neuroanatomical references in large numbers of journal articles to be accessible within our infrastructure. As an initial text corpus, we over 110,000 documents taken from last 35 years of published information from the primary neuroanatomical literature. We will construct a neuroanatomical interface that conceptually resembles the 'Google Maps' system, permitting users to use an intuitive spatial interface to browse large amounts of biomedical data in spatial register. The proposed infrastructure will also provide new opportunities to compare and synthesize the anatomical components of neuroscience data multiple modalities (physiological, behavioral, clinical, genetic, molecular, etc.).  Narrative Given the scope of the use of neuroanatomical maps from the rat and mouse in the study of neurobiological disease, we expect our research impact scientists working in almost all subfields of the subject. Our collaborators who form the early adopters of this approach are neuroendocrinology researchers studying the mechanisms of stress and anxiety disorders which are estimated to affect 19.1 million people in the USA, costing $42 billion in health care costs per year (source: Anxiety Disorders Association of America). A better understanding of the neuronal mechanisms underlying these disorders could lead to new, effective therapies and treatments.",Informatics Infrastructure for vector-based neuroanatomical atlases,8238371,R01MH079068,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Americas', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Atlases', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Community Outreach', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Devices', 'Disease', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Fluoro-Gold', 'Harvest', 'Health Care Costs', 'Image', 'Informatics', 'Investments', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Lesion', 'Literature', 'Location', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Mus', 'Names', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neuroanatomy', 'Neurobiology', 'Neuroendocrinology', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Online Systems', 'Output', 'Paper', 'Physiological', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Rattus', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Semantics', 'Source', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Text', 'Tissues', 'Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Work', 'Writing', 'abstracting', 'base', 'biomedical ontology', 'cost', 'effective therapy', 'indexing', 'journal article', 'neuroinformatics', 'novel', 'open source', 'prototype', 'research study', 'text searching', 'tool', 'vector', 'web services']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,R01,2012,326844,-0.013325613183863789
"POET-2: High-performance computing for advanced clinical narrative preprocessing    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       This project focuses on clinical natural language processing (cNLP), a field of emerging importance in informatics. Starting with the Linguistic String Project's Medical Language Processor (New York University) in the 1970s, researchers have made steady gains in cNLP through empirical studies and by building sophisticated high-level cNLP software applications (e.g., Columbia's MedLEE). There are no fewer than four scientific conferences devoted exclusively to biomedical/clinical NLP. The cNLP literature has been growing over the past decade, and this will gain momentum as more clinical text repositories are released, such as the MIMIC II and University of Pittsburgh BLU Lab corpora.       However, sustained success in the field of cNLP is hampered by the reality that clinical texts have a far more noise than do texts traditionally studied in NLP, such as newswire articles, biomedical abstracts, and discharge summaries. Noise in this context is defined by the parseability characteristics of the language and the linguistic structures that appear in text. Clinical texts come in a striking variety of note types, with the best studied types being discharge summaries, radiology reports, and pathology reports. These note types share an important feature: they are written to communicate care issues between healthcare providers and hence typically are well-composed, well-edited, and often are dictated. But the vast majority of notes in the electronic health record are written primarily to document care issues. They communicate as well, of course, but much less care is used in their creation than with discharge summaries and reports. As a result they are often ungrammatical; are composed of short, telegraphic phrases; are replete with misspellings and shorthand (e.g., abbreviations); are ill-formatted with templates and liberal use of white space; and are embedded with ""non-prose"" (e.g., strings of laboratory values). All of these sources of noise complicate otherwise straightforward NLP tasks like tokenization, sentence segmentation, and ultimately information extraction itself.       We propose a systematic study of ways to increase the signal-to-noise ratio in clinical narratives to improve cNLP. This work extends our preliminary research (under the POET project) and has the following aims:        o Develop and implement a suite of parseability improvement tools designed for all clinical note types from multiple healthcare institutions.     o Evaluate the empirical and the functional success of the parseability improvement tools.     o Design and implement a HIPAA-compliant UlMA-based pipeline cNLP framework for use in a typical high-performance, multi-processor computing environment.              Project Narrative We can see in the multi-billion dollar investment in electronic health records (EHRs) by the ARRA that mining clinical data electronically will continue to be essential to informatics research. Most data in the EHR resides as unstructured text, and POET2 provides a means to unlock that data through combining a new, HIPAA- complaint high-performance computing architecture with sophisticated text preprocessing.",POET-2: High-performance computing for advanced clinical narrative preprocessing,8326648,R01LM010981,"['Abbreviations', 'Active Learning', 'Address', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Authorization documentation', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Electronics', 'Employee Strikes', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Face', 'Gold', 'Growth', 'Health Care Reform', 'Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act', 'Health Personnel', 'Healthcare', 'High Performance Computing', 'Informatics', 'Inpatients', 'Institution', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'Investments', 'Laboratories', 'Language', 'Linguistics', 'Literature', 'Maps', 'Medical', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'New York', 'Noise', 'Occupations', 'Outpatients', 'Paper', 'Pathology', 'Pathology Report', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Proliferating', 'Publishing', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Records', 'Report (document)', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Support', 'Resolution', 'Series', 'Shorthand', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Summary Reports', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Time', 'Universities', 'Voting', 'Work', 'Writing', 'abstracting', 'base', 'cluster computing', 'data mining', 'design', 'improved', 'meetings', 'novel', 'phrases', 'pressure', 'repaired', 'repository', 'research study', 'success', 'symposium', 'tool', 'web services']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,R01,2012,318393,-0.0077054798872180745
"Increasing Clinical Trial Enrollment: A Semi-Automated Patient Centered Approach  Abstract The long-term objective of this research is to increase the clinical trial enrollment of US patients via a semi- automated, Natural Language Processing (NLP) based, interactive and patient-centered informatics application. The study design is prospective observational study. Scope is limited to cancer patients. There are three specific aims for this project. The first aim is to identify concepts that overlap between the electronic medical record's (EMR) clinical notes and the free text of clinical trial announcements. The PI will use the concepts to develop mapping frames that connect concepts in the text of trial announcements to those found in clinical notes in the medical record. When he has the mapping frames he will build the NLP module for the application. In the software development work he will utilize as many publicly available software components as possible. He will experiment with UIMA, GATE, MetaMap, Stanford Parser, NegEx algorithm and others. The PI will develop the tool around the National Library of Medicine's Unified Medical Language System knowledgebase. He will use Java for programming. The second aim is to create an algorithm that automatically generates questions to request information directly from the patient if the information is not available or accessible in the records. The third aim is to evaluate the in-vitro, laboratory performance of the application. For performance evaluation purposes the PI will recruit cancer care specialists to generate the gold standard lists of eligible clinical trials for study patients. He will publicly release the developed code at the end of the grant period. This K99/R00 project will serve the foundation for future R01 grant applications. The PI is fully committed to become faculty in the Clinical Research Informatics domain with a specialization in biomedical NLP. The support of the K99/R00 grant will enable him to acquire substantial formal training in Computational Linguistics while contributing to the body of knowledge of the Clinical Research Informatics field. The five-year grant support will ensure success in his endeavor. The proposed work is highly significant because the dismal clinical trial accrual rates (2-4 % nationally) hampers timely development of new drugs. In addition, studies show that physicians have statistically significant bias against elderly and minority patients to invite participation in clinical trials. The proposed project is synergistic with physician-centered efforts but the goal is to provide individualized, EMR based clinical trial recommendations directly to the patients. The results of this research will empower the patients and elevate their role in the decision making process.

"Translational refinement of adaptive communication system for locked-in patients    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proliferation of brain-computer interface (BCI) technology promises locked-in patients potential ways to communicate successfully. Most BCI systems either involve selection from among a set of simultaneously presented stimuli, requiring extensive control of the interface; or use binary stimulus selection mechanisms that fail to achieve high communication rates because of slow intent detection or a fixed (context independent) ordering of stimuli. We propose a new interface using binary selection of text input via rapid serial visual presentation of natural language components. Individuals with severe speech and physical impairments (SSPI) resulting from acquired neurological disorders (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, brainstem stroke, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, spinal cord injury) and neurodevelopmental disorders (cerebral palsy, muscular dystrophy) drive the proposed research. Four laboratories form an alliance for this translational research project: basic research (Erdogmus, engineering; Roark, computer science and natural language processing), and clinical research (Oken, neurology/neurophysiology; Fried-Oken, augmentative communication/neurogenic communication disorders). Our aims are (1) to develop an innovative EEG-based BCI that achieves increased communication rates with fewer errors and greater satisfaction for the target SSPI populations; (2) to iteratively refine the system in the laboratory with user feedback from healthy subjects and expert LIS users of marketed AAC systems; (3) to evaluate the performance of the system within the natural clinical settings of SSPI patients. The innovative BCI is the RSVP Keyboard with three essential features: (1) rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP) of linguistic components ranging from letters to words to phrases; (2) a detection mechanism that employs multichannel electroencephalography (EEG) and/or other suitable response mechanisms that can reliably indicate the binary intent of the user and adapt based on individualized neurophysiologic data of the user; and (3) an open-vocabulary natural language model with a capability for accurate predictions of upcoming text. Theoretical framework is based on a solid Bayesian foundation; clinical usability is based on the WHO ICF (WHO, 2001) and an Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC) model of participation. Rigorous experimental scrutiny in both clinical laboratory and natural settings will be obtained with able-bodied subjects and SSPI patients. Measures of learning rate, speed of message production, error rate and user satisfaction for different iterations of the RSVP keyboard will be obtained using an hypothesis-driven crossover design for 36 healthy subjects, and alternating treatment randomization design for 40 patients with SSPI. Descriptions of the motor, cognitive, and language skills of LIS patients using the novel system in their natural environments will inform clinical guidelines and functional device adaptations to better individualize treatment for children and adults with SSPI. The collaborative nature of the proposed translational research is expected to yield new knowledge for both BCI development and clinical AAC use.    Relevance: The populations of patients with locked-in syndrome are increasing as medical technologies advance and successfully support life. These individuals with limited to no movement could potentially contribute to their medical decision making, informed consent, and daily care giving if they had faster, more reliable means to interface with communication systems.

"Real-time Disambiguation of Abbreviations in Clinical Notes    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A key prerequisite for high-quality healthcare delivery is effective communication within and across healthcare settings. However, communication can be hampered by the pervasive use of abbreviations in clinical notes. Clinicians use abbreviations to save time during documentation. While abbreviations may seem unambiguous to their authors, they often cause confusion to other readers, including healthcare providers, patients, and natural language processing (NLP) systems attempting to extract clinical terms from text. While the understanding that abbreviations can cause errors is widespread, few have deployed pragmatic solutions for this important problem. The proposed project will develop, evaluate, and share a systematic approach to Clinical Abbreviation Recognition and Disambiguation (CARD), and in doing so substantially aims to benefit existing NLP systems and to improve computer-based documentation systems by reducing ambiguities in electronic records in real-time. The study includes the following five Specific Aims: 1) Develop automated methods to detect abbreviations and their senses from clinical text corpora and build a comprehensive knowledge base of clinical abbreviations; 2) Develop and evaluate three automated word sense disambiguation (WSD) classifiers, and establish methods to combine those classifiers to maximize both their performance and coverage; 3) Develop the CARD system, and demonstrate its effectiveness by integrating it with two established NLP systems (MedLEE and KnowledgeMap); 4) Integrate CARD with an institutional clinical documentation system (Vanderbilt's StarNotes) and evaluate its ability to expand abbreviations in real-time as clinicians generate records; 5) Distribute the CARD knowledge base and software for non-commercial uses.              Project Narrative Abbreviations are widely used throughout all types of clinical documents and they cause confusion to both healthcare providers and patients and limit effective communications within and across care settings. This proposed study will develop informatics methods to automatically detect abbreviations and their possible meanings from large clinical text and to disambiguate abbreviations that have multiple meanings. We will also integrate those methods with clinical documentation systems so that abbreviations will be expanded in real-time when physicians entering clinical notes, thus to improve the quality of health records.",Real-time Disambiguation of Abbreviations in Clinical Notes,8589822,R01LM010681,[' '],NLM,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR HOUSTON,R01,2012,237877,-0.004776294447103208

"Continued Development and Evaluation of caTIES Abstract We propose to further develop, test, evaluate and support caTIES - an existing software system for developing networked repositories of sharable de-identified surgical pathology reports. The caTIES system creates a repository of de-identified, structured, and concept-coded clinical reports derived from large corpora of clinical free-text. Documents are automatically coded against a controlled terminology such as the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS), SNOMED-CT, or NCI Metathesaurus. Users construct queries to identify specific kinds of documents and tissue specimens based on the associated clinical report. For example, a researcher studying genetic variation in metastatic breast cancers can identify cases of invasive ductal carcinoma of the breast, followed by metastatic ductal cancer in bone at an interval of three years or greater from the original diagnosis. The caTIES system also supports acquisition and ordering of tissues, using an honest broker model. Through this mechanism, de-identified data and access to tissue can be shared among institutions, enabling multi-center collaborative research. The caTIES system has already been implemented at seven US Cancer Centers, and is being considered for adoption by numerous other institutions including cancer centers, university hospitals and private hospitals. Initial development of caTIES was funded by the Cancer Biomedical Informatics Grid (caBIG). However, interest in the application has far exceeded our expectations and the limitations of caBIG. This grant will allow us to further extend the capabilities of the system by (a) improving the portability of the system and extending the types of documents that can be processed, (b) evaluating the system's NLP performance and usability, (c) building a user community to support this open-source application, and (d) piloting interoperability of caTIES with other enterprise and research systems. This work will preserve and extend a highly novel platform for development of massive repositories of de-identified clinical data that can be used for research within and across institutions. Narrative This grant will fund the further development and evaluation of a system that takes identified clinical documents and converts them into de-identified, concept-coded, structured data. The system enables researchers to access remainder tissues and clinical report data for research purposes within and across institution.

"HealthMap: Knowledge Management for Emerging Infectious Disease Intelligence    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):      Even as many developed countries strengthen their traditional clinically-based surveillance capacity, a basic level of health information infrastructure is still lacking in many parts of the developing world, including areas that are most vulnerable to emerging health threats. To help fill this gap, electronic news outlets, disease reporting networks, discussion sites, and blogs are proving to be invaluable data sources for a new generation of public health surveillance systems that operate across international borders- almost all major outbreaks investigated by WHO, including SARS, are first identified by these informal online sources. These data sources provide local and timely information about disease outbreaks and related events around the world, including areas relatively invisible to day-to-day global public health efforts due to lack of infrastructure or political suppression of information. However, since this information is dispersed and largely unstructured, there is lack of organization and integration between sources, precluding a global view of all ongoing disease threats. In order to construct such an integrated view of current emerging infections, we deployed an early prototype called Health Map, a freely available multi-stream real-time knowledge management system that aggregates and maps health alerts across numerous key data sources, including WHO alerts, newswires, mailing lists. Leveraging our previous National Library of Medicine funded work in real-time health monitoring; we propose extensive development of this new digital resource to address technological and methodological barriers to achieving a synthesized, comprehensive, and customized view of global health. The principal objective of Health Map development is to provide access to the greatest amount of possibly useful information across the widest variety of geographical areas and disease agents, without overwhelming the user with an excess of information, or obscuring important and urgent elements. We will specifically address the challenge of providing structure to unstructured data while still enabling the astute user to notice the subtle pattern that could be an early indication of a significant outbreak. Development of Health Map will proceed along the four key components of surveillance: (1) data acquisition (evaluation and integration of multiple electronic sources) (2) information characterization (disease and location categorization and severity rating of unstructured data), (3) signal interpretation (multi-stream signal detection, spatiotemporal modeling and risk assessment) and (4) knowledge dissemination (tiered dissemination of global infectious disease alerts and flexible data visualization tools). In each area, we will make critical enhancements to the existing prototype. We plan rigorous evaluation to ensure that Health Map successfully leverages electronic sources for surveillance, communication, and intervention. We will also conduct comprehensive user testing, usability studies, user behavior analysis as part of our effort. Our goal is to make Health Map a vital knowledge resource tailored for both the general public and public health decision-makers.        Although an enormous amount of information about current infectious disease outbreaks is found in Web- accessible information sources, this information is dispersed and not well-organized, making it almost impossible for public health officials and concerned citizens to know about all ongoing emerging disease threats. Through rigorous development of our online HealthMap system, we plan to provide a synthesized, timely and comprehensive view of current global infectious disease outbreaks by acquiring, integrating and disseminating a wide variety of Internet-based information sources.

"Temporal relation discovery for clinical text    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overarching long-term vision of our research is to create novel technologies for processing clinical free text. Such technologies will enable sophisticated and efficient indexing, retrieval and data mining over the ever increasing amounts of electronic clinical data. Processing free text poses a number of challenges to which the fields of Artificial intelligence, natural language processing and computer science in general have made advances. Methods for processing free text are informed by linguistic theory combined with the power of statistical inferencing. A key component to the next step, natural language understanding, is discovering events and their relations on a timeline. Temporal relations are of prime importance in biomedicine as they are intrinsically linked to diseases, signs and symptoms, and treatments. Understanding the timeline of clinically relevant events is key to the next generation of translational research where the importance of generalizing over large amounts of data holds the promise of deciphering biomedical puzzles.        The goal of our current proposal is to discover temporal relations from clinical free text through achieving four specific aims:        Specific Aim 1: Develop (1) a temporal relation annotation schema and guidelines for clinical free text based on TimeML, which will require extensions to Treebank, PropBank and VerbNet annotation guidelines to the clinical domain, (2) an annotated corpus following the temporal relations schema with additions to Treebank, PropBank and VerbNet, (3) a descriptive study comparing temporal relations in the clinical and general domains.        Specific Aim 2: Extend and evaluate existing methods and/or develop new algorithms for temporal relation discovery in the clinical domain. Component-level evaluation        Specific Aim 3: Integrate best method and/or a variety of methods for temporal relation discovery into the open source Mayo Clinic IE pipeline and release as open source annotators in the pipeline. Functional testing. Dissemination activities.        Specific Aim 4: System-level evaluation. Test the functionality of the enhanced Mayo Clinic IE pipeline on translational research use cases, e.g. the progression of colon cancer as documented in clinical notes and pathology reports, the progression of brain tumor as documented in radiology reports.        The methods we will use for the temporal relation discovery are based on machine learning, e.g., Support Vector Machine technology. Such methods require the annotation of a reference standard from which the computations are derived. The best methods will be released as part of the Mayo Clinic Information Extraction System for the larger community to use and contribute to. We will test the methods against biomedical queries.           Relevance (max 2-3 sentences) Temporal relations are of prime importance in biomedicine as they are intrinsically linked to diseases, signs and symptoms, and treatments.

"USE OF NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING TO IDENTIFY LINGUISTIC MARKERS OF COPING    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Understanding mechanisms of action is key to improving psychosocial interventions for cancer and other chronic disease conditions. In cancer, emotional expression has been identified as one possible mediator of the effect of psychosocial intervention on patient-reported outcomes. However, scientific evaluations of psychological mechanisms of adjustment to cancer and other chronic diseases are constrained by limitations associated with self-report measures. Because self-care resources, peer-to-peer networks, and more recent forms of psychosocial intervention are increasingly being delivered online, linguistic and behavioral data can be used to characterize internal coping processes, social interactions, and other manifest behaviors. Few tools are currently available for harnessing text as a potential data source, and signal detection indices of existing tools leave room for considerable improvement in these methodologies (Bantum & Owen, 2009). In the present study, natural language processing and other tools of computational linguistics will be used to develop a machine-learning classifier to identify emotional expression in electronic text data. The aims of the study are: 1) to annotate a large text corpus from cancer survivors using an objective and reliable emotion-coding procedure, 2) to incorporate linguistic and psychological features into a machine-learning classification method and identify which of these features are most strongly associated with codes assigned by trained human raters, and 3) to develop combined psychological and natural language processing (NLP) methods for identifying linguistic markers of emotional coping behaviors. To accomplish these aims, a comprehensive corpus of emotionally-laden cancer communications will be developed from 5 existing linguistic datasets. Five raters will be selected and undergo a rigorous training procedure for coding emotional expression using an emotion-coding system previously developed by the research. Coding will take place using an Internet-based coding interface that will allow the investigators to continuously monitor inter-rater reliability. Simultaneous with the coding process, the investigators will link the electronic text data with key linguistic and psychological features, including Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC), Affective Norms for English Words (ANEW), WordNet, part of speech tags, patterns of capitalization and punctuation, emoticons, and textual context. A machine-learning classifier, using tools of natural language processing, will then be applied to the text/feature data and validated against human-rated emotion codes. The long-term objective of this research is to advance a methodology for objectively identifying coping behavior, particularly emotional expression, in order to supplement self-report measures and improve scientific understanding of adjustment to chronic disease, trauma, or other psychological conditions. This work is essential for identifying mechanisms of action in psychosocial interventions for cancer survivors and others and has significance for the fields of medicine, psychology, computational linguistics, and artificial intelligence.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Identifying specific emotional, cognitive, and behavioral factors that contribute to adjustment to cancer and other chronic diseases is essential for being able to develop and improve effective interventions to promote health and well-being. To date, the study of these factors as mechanisms of action has been limited to self-report measures that may not correlate well with other more objective indicators. The proposed study will improve our ability to identify mechanisms of action by supplementing self-report measures with objectively identified markers of coping behaviors such as emotional expression in natural language used by individuals living with cancer.           Identifying specific emotional, cognitive, and behavioral factors that contribute to adjustment to cancer and other chronic diseases is essential for being able to develop and improve effective interventions to promote health and well-being.

"Screening Nonrandomized Studies for Inclusion in Systematic Reviews of Evidence    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Translation of biomedical research into practice depends in part on the production of quality systematic reviews that synthesize available evidence. Unfortunately, about 20% of reviews are never completed. Of those that reach fruition, the average time to completion may be 2.4 years, with a reported maximum of 9 years. A major bottleneck occurs when teammates screen studies. In the first step, they independently identify provisionally eligible studies by reading the same set of perhaps thousands of titles and abstracts. To date, researchers have used supervised machine learning (ML) methods in an attempt to automate identification of eligible randomized controlled trials (RCTs). However, finding nonrandomized (NR) studies for inclusion in systematic reviews has yet to be addressed. This is an important problem because RCTs may be unlikely or even unethical for some research questions. Hypotheses. It is broadly hypothesized that (a) methods based on natural language processing and ML can be used to automatically identify topically relevant studies with a mix of NR designs eligible for inclusion in systematic reviews; and (b) machine performance can consistently reach current human standards with respect to identifying eligible studies. Aims. This research has three aims: (1) Compare the language that biomedical researchers use to describe their NR study designs with existing relevant vocabularies. Develop complementary terminologies for overlooked NR study designs to improve coverage of important vocabularies. Develop and validate a standalone terminology to support librarians who add free-text terms to expert searches. (2) Develop and compare procedures based on natural language processing and supervised ML methods to identify provisionally eligible NR studies that are topically relevant from a set of citations, including titles, abstracts, and metadata. Use terms for NR study designs to improve classification. (3) Generalize procedures developed under Aims 1 and 2 to select topically relevant studies with a mix of designs for provisional inclusion in several types of systematic reviews. Use contextual information in segments of full texts tagged for location to enrich feature vectors. Methods. Reference standards will be built from studies in published Cochrane reviews. Features will be extracted from citations and regions of full texts. Additionally, feature vectors will be enriched with terms for designs that researchers use in combination with terms extracted from major vocabularies. Model performance will be compared with respect to several measures, including mean recall and precision, for 10-fold cross-validations and validations on held-out test sets. Significance. The proposed research is significant because it will help support translation of biomedical research to improve human health. Moreover, developing procedures to identify NR studies is essential for the expeditious translation of a very large body of research.           Translation of biomedical research helps to improve public health by delivering the best available evidence to clinicians. This process depends in part on the production of systematic reviews of research.

"Real-time Disambiguation of Abbreviations in Clinical Notes    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A key prerequisite for high-quality healthcare delivery is effective communication within and across healthcare settings. However, communication can be hampered by the pervasive use of abbreviations in clinical notes. Clinicians use abbreviations to save time during documentation. While abbreviations may seem unambiguous to their authors, they often cause confusion to other readers, including healthcare providers, patients, and natural language processing (NLP) systems attempting to extract clinical terms from text. While the understanding that abbreviations can cause errors is widespread, few have deployed pragmatic solutions for this important problem. The proposed project will develop, evaluate, and share a systematic approach to Clinical Abbreviation Recognition and Disambiguation (CARD), and in doing so substantially aims to benefit existing NLP systems and to improve computer-based documentation systems by reducing ambiguities in electronic records in real-time. The study includes the following five Specific Aims: 1) Develop automated methods to detect abbreviations and their senses from clinical text corpora and build a comprehensive knowledge base of clinical abbreviations; 2) Develop and evaluate three automated word sense disambiguation (WSD) classifiers, and establish methods to combine those classifiers to maximize both their performance and coverage; 3) Develop the CARD system, and demonstrate its effectiveness by integrating it with two established NLP systems (MedLEE and KnowledgeMap); 4) Integrate CARD with an institutional clinical documentation system (Vanderbilt's StarNotes) and evaluate its ability to expand abbreviations in real-time as clinicians generate records; 5) Distribute the CARD knowledge base and software for non-commercial uses.              Project Narrative Abbreviations are widely used throughout all types of clinical documents and they cause confusion to both healthcare providers and patients and limit effective communications within and across care settings. This proposed study will develop informatics methods to automatically detect abbreviations and their possible meanings from large clinical text and to disambiguate abbreviations that have multiple meanings. We will also integrate those methods with clinical documentation systems so that abbreviations will be expanded in real-time when physicians entering clinical notes, thus to improve the quality of health records.",Real-time Disambiguation of Abbreviations in Clinical Notes,8077875,R01LM010681,"['Abbreviations', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Computer Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Confusion', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Disease', 'Documentation', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronics', 'Equipment and supply inventories', 'Frequencies', 'Health Personnel', 'Healthcare', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Joints', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Medical Records', 'Methods', 'Names', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nitroglycerin', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Reader', 'Records', 'Serious Adverse Event', 'Solutions', 'System', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Time', 'Work', 'Writing', 'acronyms', 'base', 'health care delivery', 'health record', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'knowledge base', 'novel', 'phrases', 'satisfaction']",NLM,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,R01,2011,374000,-0.004776294447103208
"Adapting Natural Language Processing Tools for Biosurveillance    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Early detection of disease outbreaks can decrease patient morbidity and mortality and minimize the spread of diseases. Early detection requires accurate classification of patient symptoms early in the course of their illness. One approach is biosurveillance, in which electronic symptom data are captured early in the course of illness, and analyzed for signals that might indicate an outbreak requiring investigation and response by the public health system. Emergency department (ED) patient records are particularly useful for biosurveillance, given their timely, electronic availability. ED data elements used in surveillance systems include the chief complaint (a brief description of the patient's primary symptom(s)), and triage nurses' note (also known as history of present illness).The chief complaint is the most widely used ED data element, because it is recorded electronically by the majority of EDs. One study showed that adding triage notes increased the sensitivity of biosurveillance case detection. The increased sensitivity is because the triage note increases the amount of data available: instead of one symptom in a chief complaint (e.g., fever), triage notes may contain multiple symptoms (e.g., ""fever, cough & shortness of breath for 12 hours""). Surveillance efforts are hampered, however, by the wide variability of free text data in ED chief complaints and triage notes. They often include misspellings, abbreviations, acronyms and other lexical and semantic variants that are difficult to group into symptom clusters (e.g., fever, temp 104, fvr, febrile). Tools are needed to address the lexical and semantic variation in symptom terms in ED data in order to improve biosurveillance. Natural language processing tools have been shown to facilitate concept extraction from more structured clinical data such as radiology reports, but there has been limited application of these techniques to free text ED triage notes. The project team developed the Emergency Medical Text Processor (EMT-P) to preprocess the chief complaint. EMT-P cleans and normalizes brief chief complaint entries and then extracts standardized concepts, but it is not sufficient in its current state to preprocess longer, more complex text passages such as triage notes. This proposed project will further strengthen biosurveillance by adapting EMT-P and other statistical and classical natural language processing tools to develop a system that extracts concepts from triage notes for biosurveillance.           Project Narrative Relevance: The public health system is responsible for monitoring large amounts of timely, electronic health data and needs more sophisticated tools to faciliate detection of, and response to, emerging infectious diseases and potential bioterrorism threats.

"ADAPTIVE PERSONALIZED INFORMATION MANAGEMENT FOR BIOLOGISTS    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  We propose development of an adaptive, personalizable, information management tool, which can be configured and trained by an individual biologist to most effectively exploit the particular knowledge bases and document collections that are most useful for him or her. The proposed tool represents a novel approach for monitoring scientific progress in biology, which has become a formidable task. We will exploit recent advances in machine learning and database systems to develop a useful approximation to a personalized biological knowledge base f.i.i.e., single information resource that would include all the knowledge sources on which a biologist relies. More specifically, we propose a scheme for loosely integrating both structured information and unstructured text, and then querying the integrated information using easily-formulated similarity queries.

"Secure Sharing of Clinical History & Genetic Data: Empowering Predictive Pers. Me    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Computer-assisted medicine is at a crossroads: medical care requires accurate data, but making such data widely available can create unacceptable risks to the privacy of individual patients. This tension between utility and privacy is especially acute in predictive personalized medicine (PPM). PPM holds the promise of making treatment decisions tailored to the individual based on her or his particular genetics and clinical history. Making PPM a reality requires running statistical, data mining and machine learning algorithms on combined genetic, clinical and demographic data to construct predictive models. Access to such data directly competes with the need for healthcare providers to protect the privacy of each patient's data, thus creating a tradeoff between model efficacy and privacy. Thus we find ourselves in an unfortunate standoff: significant medical advances that would result from more powerful mining of the data by a wider variety of researchers are hindered by significant privacy concerns on behalf of the patients represented in the data set. In this proposed work, we seek to develop and evaluate technology to resolve this standoff, enabling health practitioners and researchers to compute on privacy-sensitive medical records in order to make treatment decisions or create accurate models, while protecting patient privacy. We will evaluate our approach on a de-identified actual electronic medical record, with an average of 29 years of clinical history on each patient, and with detailed genetic data (650K SNPs) available for a subset of 5000 of the patients. This data set is available to us now through the Wisconsin Genomics Initiative, but only on a computer at the Marshfield Clinic. If successful our approach will make possible the sharing of this cutting-edge data set, and others like it that are now in development, including our ability to analyze this data at UW-Madison where we have thousands of processors available in our Condor pool. Our privacy approach integrates secure data access environments, including those appropriate to the use of laptops and cloud computing, with novel anonymization algorithms providing differential privacy guarantees for data and/or published results of data analysis. To this end, our specific aims are as follows:       AIM 1: Develop and deploy a secure local environment that, in combination with secure network functionality, will ensure end-to-end security and privacy for electronic medical records and biomedical datasets shared between clinical institutions and researchers.       AIM 2: Develop and deploy a secure virtual environment to allow large-scale, privacy-preserving data analysis ""in the cloud.""       AIM 3: Develop and evaluate privacy-preserving data mining algorithms for use with original (not anonymized) data sets consisting of electronic medical records and genetic data.       AIM 4: Develop and evaluate anonymizing data publishing algorithms and privacy guarantees that are appropriate to the complex structure present in electronic medical records with genetic data.            Project Narrative This project will develop an integrated approach to secure sharing of clinical and genetic data that based on algorithms for anonymization of data to achieve differential privacy guarantees, for privacy-preserving publication of data analysis results, and secure environments for data sharing that include addressing the increasing use of laptops and of cloud computing. The end goal of this project is to meet the competing demands of providing patients with both privacy and accurate predictive models based on clinical history and genetics.

"Phenotype Discovery in NHLBI Genomic Studies (PhD)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Abstract Researchers continually upload data into public repositories at a rapid pace, yet utilize few common standards for annotation, making it close to impossible to compare or associate data across studies. To address this problem, we will develop a defined meta- data model and build an integrated system called Phenotype Discovery (PhD) that enables researchers to query and find genomic studies of interest in public repositories as well as upload new data into our database (sdGaP), in a standardized manner. A Query Interpreter (QI) will utilize text mining and natural language processing techniques to map free text into concepts in biomedical ontologies, allowing non-structured queries to be answered efficiently. In Phase I of the project, we will develop a proof-of-concept system that can retrospectively structure phenotypic descriptions in dbGaP, and will work with domain experts in pneumology to build use cases and evaluate the automated mappings. In Phase II of the project, we will extend the domain expertise to cardiology, hematology, and sleep disorders to build a more comprehensive system, expanding the phenotype annotation to transcriptome databases, and integrating a flexible automated genotype annotation tool for sdGaP. We will develop a user-friendly interface to prospectively assist researchers in uploading their data with standardized phenotypic annotations. We will provide the tool for free from our website and continuously improve its quality, based on user feedback and usage data.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Relevance Phenotype Discovery (PhD) represents a novel, automated system to describe the characteristics of patients whose genetic information is available in public data repositories, without compromising their privacy. This initiative is greatly needed so that more researchers can make use of data collected from projects funded by public agencies. PhD uses new methodology for natural language processing and semantic integration to interpret the narrative text as well as variables and their values from studies in genomic databases.

"NLP for Augmentative and Alternative Communication in Adults    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This proposal relates to the technology of Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC).  The research, to be developed over the three-year course of this project, relates to increasing communication speed for adult users of typing-based AAC devices. The proposed method has commonalities both with chatter bots and more sophisticated automated question answering systems. In particular, we propose to develop a program that will mine a very large database of stored interactions for sentences that are similar to the sentence currently being uttered by the interlocutor, and propose a set of plausible responses for the AAC user. The outcome of this research will be a system that improves over the current state of the art in whole utterance approaches in AAC, making use of sophisticated natural language processing techniques.    Through this research and its practical application to helping real people with real communications needs, as well as coursework, seminars, participation in the AAC and disabilities community in Portland, OR, and intensive one-on-one meetings with his mentor Dr. Melanie Fried-Oken, the PI will accrue substantial clinical experience in AAC, and will gain a deep understanding of how technology can be used to help people.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed project will develop a research program in the field of Augmentative and Alternative Communication.

"Bridging the Semantic Gap Between Research Eligibility Criteria and Clinical Data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Our long-term objective is to enlarge the scope and efficiency of clinical research through enhanced use of clinical data to support clinical research decisions. This proposal aims to improve the use of electronic health records (EHR) to automate clinical trials eligibility screening by developing a new semantic alignment framework. Clinical trials research is an important step for translating breakthroughs in basic biomedical sciences into knowledge that will benefit clinical practice and human health. However, a significant obstacle is identifying eligible participants. Eighty-six percent of all clinical trials are delayed in patient recruitment for from one to six months and 13% are delayed by more than six months. Enrollment delay is expensive. In a recent large, multi-center trial, about 86.8 staff hours and more than $1000 was spent to enroll each participant. Ineffective enrollment also produces a big social cost in that up to 60% of patients can miss being identified. The broad deployment of EHR systems has created unprecedented opportunities to solve the problem because EHR systems contain a rich source of information about potential participants. However, it is often a knowledge-intensive, time-consuming, and inefficient manual procedure to match eligibility criteria such as ""renal in- sufficiency"" to clinical data such as ""serum creatinine = 1.0 mg/dl for an 80-year old white female patient."" This enduring challenge is partly caused by the disconnection between abstract and ambiguous eligibility criteria and highly specific clinical data manifestations; we call this a semantic gap. Despite earlier work on computer-based clinical guidelines and protocols, limited effort has been devoted to support automatic matching between concepts and their manifestations in patient phenotypes such as signs and symptoms.       We hypothesize that we can characterize the semantic gap and design a knowledge-based, natural-language processing assisted semantic alignment framework to bridge the semantic gap. Therefore, our specific aims are: (1) to investigate the semantic gap between clinical trials eligibility criteria and clinical data; (2) to design a concept-based, computable knowledge representation for eligibility criteria; (3) to design a semantic alignment framework linking an eligibility criteria knowledge base and a clinical data warehouse to generate semantic queries for eligibility identification; and (4) to evaluate the utility of the semantic alignment framework.       This research is novel and unique in that (1) there are no prior studies about the semantic gap between eligibility criteria and clinical data; and (2) for the first time, we design a semantic alignment framework to automatically match eligibility criteria to clinical data. The research team comprising expertise from the Department of Biomedical Informatics at Columbia University and the Division of General Medicine from UCSF are uniquely positioned to carry out this research, given the experience of the team (medical knowledge representation, natural language processing, controlled clinical terminology, ontology-based semantic reasoning, data mining, statistics, health data organization, semantic harmonization, and clinical trials), the availability of a repository of 13 years of data on 2 million patients, and the availability of a natural language processor called MedLEE to convert millions of narrative reports into richly coded clinical data.            This research has the potential to improve process efficiency and accuracy, as well as to reduce cost and required human skills for clinical trials eligibility screening. The ultimate goal is to accelerate scientific discovery of more effective treatments for illness.",Bridging the Semantic Gap Between Research Eligibility Criteria and Clinical Data,8055880,R01LM009886,"['Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'Creatinine', 'Data', 'Drug Formulations', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Eligibility Determination', 'Enrollment', 'Female', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Kidney Failure', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Manuals', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Ontology', 'Participant', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Population Surveillance', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Problem Solving', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Science', 'Screening procedure', 'Semantics', 'Serum', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Source', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Terminology', 'Text', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Universities', 'Work', 'abstracting', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'clinical data warehouse', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinical practice', 'cost', 'data mining', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'eligible participant', 'experience', 'improved', 'information organization', 'knowledge base', 'natural language', 'novel', 'repository', 'skills', 'social', 'statistics']",NLM,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2011,328942,-0.013784890449165465
"Annotation, development and evaluation for clinical information extraction    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Much of the clinical information required for accurate clinical research, active decision support, and broad-coverage surveillance is locked in text files in an electronic medical record (EMR). The only feasible way to leverage this information for translational science is to extract and encode the information using natural language processing (NLP). Over the last two decades, several research groups have developed NLP tools for clinical notes, but a major bottleneck preventing progress in clinical NLP is the lack of standard, annotated data sets for training and evaluating NLP applications. Without these standards, individual NLP applications abound without the ability to train different algorithms on standard annotations, share and integrate NLP modules, or compare performance. We propose to develop standards and infrastructure that can enable technology to extract scientific information from textual medical records, and we propose the research as a collaborative effort involving NLP experts across the U.S. To accomplish this goal, we will address three specific aims: Aim 1: Extend existing standards and develop new consensus standards for annotating clinical text in a way that is interoperable, extensible, and usable. Aim 2: Apply existing methods and tools, and develop new methods and tools where necessary for manually annotating a set of publicly available clinical texts in a way that is efficient and accurate. Aim 3: Develop a publicly available toolkit for automatically annotating clinical text and perform a shared evaluation to evaluate the toolkit, using evaluation metrics that are multidimensional and flexible.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In this project, we will develop a publicly available corpus of annotated clinical texts for NLP research. We will experiment with methods for increasing the efficiency of annotation and will annotate de-identified reports of nine types for linguistic and clinical information. In addition, we will create an NLP toolkit that can be shared and will evaluate it against other NLP systems in a shared task evaluation with the community.           Project narrative: In this project, we will develop a publicly available corpus of annotated clinical texts for NLP research.

"Interactive Search and Review of Clinical Records with Multi-layered Semantic Ann    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       A critical element of translating science into practice is the ability to find patient populations for clinical research. Many studies rely on administrative data for selecting relevant patients for studies of comparative effectiveness, but the limitations of administrative data is well-known. Much of the information critical for clinical research is locked in free-text dictated reports, such as history and physical exams and radiology reports. Data repositories, such as the Medical Archival Retrieval System (MARS) at the University of Pittsburgh, are useful for identifying supersets of patients for clinical research studies through indexed word searches. However, simple text-based queries are also limited in their effectiveness, and researchers are often left reading through hundreds or thousands of reports to filter out false positive cases. Current processes are time-consuming and extraordinarily expensive. They lead to long delays between the development of a testable hypothesis and the ability to share findings with the medical community at large.       A potential solution to this problem is pre-annotating de-identified clinical reports to facilitate more intelligent and sophisticated retrieval and review. Clinical reports are rich in meaning and structure and can be annotated at many different levels using natural language processing technology. It is not clear, however, what types of annotations would be most helpful to a clinical researcher, nor is it clear how to display the annotations to best assist manual review of reports. There is interdependence between the annotation schema used by an NLP system and the user interface for assisting researchers in retrieving data for retrospective studies. In this proposal, we will interactively revise an NLP annotation schema as well as explore various methods for annotation display based on feedback from users reviewing patient data for specific research studies.       We hypothesize that an interactive search application that relies on NLP-annotated clinical text will increase the accuracy and efficiency of finding patients for clinical research studies and will support visualization techniques for viewing the data in a way that improves a researcher's ability to review patient data.              Narrative We will develop a novel review application for this proposal that will facilitate translational research from secondary use of EHR data by assisting researchers in more efficiently finding retrospective populations of patients for clinical research studies.

"Evidence-based Diagnostic Tools for Translational and Clinical Research (eTfor2)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The eTfor2 project will develop and evaluate open-source programs and knowledge representations to better characterize patients for translational and clinical research studies. The project addresses National Library of Medicine (NLM) RFA initiatives for: (a) information & knowledge processing, including natural language processing and text summarization, (b) approaches for linking phenomic and genomic information, and (c) integration of information from heterogeneous sources. Translational studies correlate clinical patient descriptors (phenome) with results of genomic investigations, e.g., genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Standard methods for defining phenotypes require costly, labor-intensive cohort enrollments to identify patients with diseases and appropriate controls. Recently, translational and clinical researchers have used electronic medical record (EMR) data as an alternative to identifying patient characteristics. However, EMR case extraction requires substantial manual review and ""tuning"" for case selection, due to the inaccuracies inherent in ICD9 billing codes. While relevant and useful natural language processing (NLP) approaches to facilitate EMR text extraction have proliferated, the target patient descriptors these approaches employ typically remain non-standard and locally defined, and vary from disease to disease, project to project and institution to institution. At best, such NLP applications use standard terminology descriptors such as SNOMED-CT as EMR extraction targets. Yet, there is no generally utilized ""standard"" knowledge base that links such ""extractable"" descriptors to an academic-quality knowledge source detailing what findings have been reliably reported to occur in each disease. To facilitate translational and clinical research, the eTfor2 project will make available an open-source, evidence-based, electronic clinical knowledge base (KB) and related NLP tools enabling researchers at any site to extract a standard ""target"" set of EMR-based phenomic descriptors at both the finding and disease levels. It will further include diagnostic decision support logic to confirm the degree of support for patients' diagnoses in their EMR records. The eTfor2 project will decrease effort required to harvest EMR patient descriptors for clinical and translational studies, and enable new translational work that identifies genomic associations at both finding and disease levels. The eTfor2 resources should improve the quality and cross-institutional validity of EMR-based translational and clinical studies.           Evidence-based Diagnostic Tools for Translational and Clinical Research (eTfor2) Project Narrative When completed successfully, the eTfor2 project will enable researchers at disparate institutions to extract from their respective EMR systems a shared ""target"" set of common phenomic descriptors, in a standard, reproducible manner.

"Informatics Infrastructure for vector-based neuroanatomical atlases    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The adage:  'all data is spatial' is especially pertinent in the field of neuroscience, since neuronal data must be indexed by the neuroanatomical location of phenomena or entities under study.  Brain atlases are very widely used as laboratory tools, being some of the most highly cited publications in science.  This proposal seeks to use brain atlases as a method for indexing data from the literature in a neuroinformatics system.  This data includes both textual and graphical information, ranging from highly detailed maps constructed from vector- based spatial primitives, histological photographs and drawings, to textual reports of experimental findings in the literature (which we will analyze on a large scale).  These data represent a significant scientific investment that are currently locked away in previously published journal articles (and the detailed data-sets and drawings from researchers that were used to write the articles).  A prototype that summarizes the last fifteen years' output of one of the world's most prominent neuroanatomy laboratories is immediately available.  This project will develop a collaborative environment to enable neuroscientists to use these valuable maps within the community as a whole by contributing data to a shared system with an open-source system (called 'NeuARt II') that permits querying, overlaying, viewing and annotating such data in an integrated manner.  We will also use Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to index neuroanatomical references in large numbers of journal articles to be accessible within our infrastructure.  As an initial text corpus, we over 110,000 documents taken from last 35 years of published information from the primary neuroanatomical literature.  We will construct a neuroanatomical interface that conceptually resembles the 'Google Maps' system, permitting users to use an intuitive spatial interface to browse large amounts of biomedical data in spatial register.  The proposed infrastructure will also provide new opportunities to compare and synthesize the anatomical components of neuroscience data multiple modalities (physiological, behavioral, clinical, genetic, molecular, etc.).PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Given the scope of the use of neuroanatomical maps from the rat and mouse in the study of neurobiological disease, we expect our research impact scientists working in almost all subfields of the subject.  Our collaborators who form the early adopters of this approach are neuroendocrinology researchers studying the mechanisms of stress and anxiety disorders which are estimated to affect 19.1 million people in the USA, costing $42 billion in health care costs per year (source:  Anxiety Disorders Association of America).  A better understanding of the neuronal mechanisms underlying these disorders could lead to new, effective therapies and treatments.        Narrative Given the scope of the use of neuroanatomical maps from the rat and mouse in the study of neurobiological disease, we expect our research impact scientists working in almost all subfields of the subject.

"Vanderbilt Genome-Electronic Records Project    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  VGER: The Vanderbilt Genome-Electronic Record project An important potential enabling resource for Personalized Medicine is the combination of a DNA repository with Electronic Medical Record (EMR) systems sufficiently robust to provide excellence in clinical care and to serve as resources for analysis of disease susceptibility and therapeutic outcomes across patient populations. The Vanderbilt EMR is a state of the art clinical and research tool (that includes >1.4 million records), and is associated with a DNA repository which has been in development for over 3 years; these are the key components of VGER, the Vanderbilt Genome-Electronic Records project proposed here. The VGER model acquires DNA from discarded blood samples collected from routine patient care, and can link these to de-identified data extracted and readily updated from the EMR. The phenotype we will analyze here is the QRS duration on the electrocardiogram, since slow conduction (indicated by longer QRS duration) is a marker of arrhythmia susceptibility. This will not only exploit the power of Genome-Wide Association (GWA) approaches to generate new biologic knowledge that impacts an area of public health concern, but also provides a platform for the development of tools, such as Natural Language Processing approaches, to optimally mine EMRs. This project brings together a team of investigators with nationally recognized records of accomplishment in genome science, medical ethics, bioinformatics, de-identification science, and translational and cardiovascular medicine to address four Specific Aims: (1) perform a GWA comparing samples from subjects with QRS durations at the extremes of the normal range, and validate by genotyping high likelihood associations in prospectively ascertained clinical trial sets for QRS duration and for arrhythmia susceptibility; (2) evaluate the validity and utility of structured and unstructured components of EMR data for genome-phenome correlations; (3) assess the ethical, scientific, and societal advantages and disadvantages of the VGER model, and determine best practices for oversight, community involvement, and communication as the resource grows; and (4) develop and evaluate formal privacy protection models for data derived from databanks and EMRs, establishing data sharing and integration practices. We also include here a proposal to develop the Administrative Coordinating Center whose mission will be to facilitate communication and collaboration among nodes in this network, the NHGRI, and external advisors. We subscribe to a vision of Personalized Medicine in which genomic and other patient-specific information drives personalized, predictive, preemptive, and participatory health care, and VGER represents an important step in that direction.           n/a",Vanderbilt Genome-Electronic Records Project,8306467,U01HG004603,"['Address', 'Area', 'Arrhythmia', 'Bioinformatics', 'Blood specimen', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Commit', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disadvantaged', 'Disease', 'Disease susceptibility', 'EKG QRS Complex', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Electronics', 'Ethics', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Healthcare', 'Heart Diseases', 'Institution', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Legal', 'Link', 'Measures', 'Medical Ethics', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'National Human Genome Research Institute', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Normal Range', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Predisposition', 'Privacy', 'Public Health', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Translational Research', 'Update', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Vision', 'clinical care', 'clinical practice', 'data modeling', 'data sharing', 'endophenotype', 'genome wide association study', 'heart rhythm', 'indexing', 'patient population', 'phenome', 'repository', 'tool', 'tool development']",NHGRI,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,U01,2011,13000,-0.013535278914862461
"POET-2: High-performance computing for advanced clinical narrative preprocessing    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       This project focuses on clinical natural language processing (cNLP), a field of emerging importance in informatics. Starting with the Linguistic String Project's Medical Language Processor (New York University) in the 1970s, researchers have made steady gains in cNLP through empirical studies and by building sophisticated high-level cNLP software applications (e.g., Columbia's MedLEE). There are no fewer than four scientific conferences devoted exclusively to biomedical/clinical NLP. The cNLP literature has been growing over the past decade, and this will gain momentum as more clinical text repositories are released, such as the MIMIC II and University of Pittsburgh BLU Lab corpora.       However, sustained success in the field of cNLP is hampered by the reality that clinical texts have a far more noise than do texts traditionally studied in NLP, such as newswire articles, biomedical abstracts, and discharge summaries. Noise in this context is defined by the parseability characteristics of the language and the linguistic structures that appear in text. Clinical texts come in a striking variety of note types, with the best studied types being discharge summaries, radiology reports, and pathology reports. These note types share an important feature: they are written to communicate care issues between healthcare providers and hence typically are well-composed, well-edited, and often are dictated. But the vast majority of notes in the electronic health record are written primarily to document care issues. They communicate as well, of course, but much less care is used in their creation than with discharge summaries and reports. As a result they are often ungrammatical; are composed of short, telegraphic phrases; are replete with misspellings and shorthand (e.g., abbreviations); are ill-formatted with templates and liberal use of white space; and are embedded with ""non-prose"" (e.g., strings of laboratory values). All of these sources of noise complicate otherwise straightforward NLP tasks like tokenization, sentence segmentation, and ultimately information extraction itself.       We propose a systematic study of ways to increase the signal-to-noise ratio in clinical narratives to improve cNLP. This work extends our preliminary research (under the POET project) and has the following aims:        o Develop and implement a suite of parseability improvement tools designed for all clinical note types from multiple healthcare institutions.     o Evaluate the empirical and the functional success of the parseability improvement tools.     o Design and implement a HIPAA-compliant UlMA-based pipeline cNLP framework for use in a typical high-performance, multi-processor computing environment.              Project Narrative We can see in the multi-billion dollar investment in electronic health records (EHRs) by the ARRA that mining clinical data electronically will continue to be essential to informatics research. Most data in the EHR resides as unstructured text, and POET2 provides a means to unlock that data through combining a new, HIPAA- complaint high-performance computing architecture with sophisticated text preprocessing.",POET-2: High-performance computing for advanced clinical narrative preprocessing,8182025,R01LM010981,"['Abbreviations', 'Active Learning', 'Address', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Authorization documentation', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Electronics', 'Employee Strikes', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Face', 'Gold', 'Growth', 'Health Care Reform', 'Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act', 'Health Personnel', 'Healthcare', 'High Performance Computing', 'Informatics', 'Inpatients', 'Institution', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'Investments', 'Laboratories', 'Language', 'Linguistics', 'Literature', 'Maps', 'Medical', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'New York', 'Noise', 'Occupations', 'Outpatients', 'Paper', 'Pathology', 'Pathology Report', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Proliferating', 'Publishing', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Records', 'Report (document)', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Support', 'Resolution', 'Series', 'Shorthand', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Summary Reports', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Time', 'Universities', 'Voting', 'Work', 'Writing', 'abstracting', 'base', 'cluster computing', 'data mining', 'design', 'improved', 'meetings', 'novel', 'phrases', 'pressure', 'repaired', 'repository', 'research study', 'success', 'symposium', 'tool', 'web services']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,R01,2011,325163,-0.0077054798872180745
"Translational refinement of adaptive communication system for locked-in patients    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proliferation of brain-computer interface (BCI) technology promises locked-in patients potential ways to communicate successfully. Most BCI systems either involve selection from among a set of simultaneously presented stimuli, requiring extensive control of the interface; or use binary stimulus selection mechanisms that fail to achieve high communication rates because of slow intent detection or a fixed (context independent) ordering of stimuli. We propose a new interface using binary selection of text input via rapid serial visual presentation of natural language components. Individuals with severe speech and physical impairments (SSPI) resulting from acquired neurological disorders (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, brainstem stroke, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, spinal cord injury) and neurodevelopmental disorders (cerebral palsy, muscular dystrophy) drive the proposed research. Four laboratories form an alliance for this translational research project: basic research (Erdogmus, engineering; Roark, computer science and natural language processing), and clinical research (Oken, neurology/neurophysiology; Fried-Oken, augmentative communication/neurogenic communication disorders). Our aims are (1) to develop an innovative EEG-based BCI that achieves increased communication rates with fewer errors and greater satisfaction for the target SSPI populations; (2) to iteratively refine the system in the laboratory with user feedback from healthy subjects and expert LIS users of marketed AAC systems; (3) to evaluate the performance of the system within the natural clinical settings of SSPI patients. The innovative BCI is the RSVP Keyboard with three essential features: (1) rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP) of linguistic components ranging from letters to words to phrases; (2) a detection mechanism that employs multichannel electroencephalography (EEG) and/or other suitable response mechanisms that can reliably indicate the binary intent of the user and adapt based on individualized neurophysiologic data of the user; and (3) an open-vocabulary natural language model with a capability for accurate predictions of upcoming text. Theoretical framework is based on a solid Bayesian foundation; clinical usability is based on the WHO ICF (WHO, 2001) and an Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC) model of participation. Rigorous experimental scrutiny in both clinical laboratory and natural settings will be obtained with able-bodied subjects and SSPI patients. Measures of learning rate, speed of message production, error rate and user satisfaction for different iterations of the RSVP keyboard will be obtained using an hypothesis-driven crossover design for 36 healthy subjects, and alternating treatment randomization design for 40 patients with SSPI. Descriptions of the motor, cognitive, and language skills of LIS patients using the novel system in their natural environments will inform clinical guidelines and functional device adaptations to better individualize treatment for children and adults with SSPI. The collaborative nature of the proposed translational research is expected to yield new knowledge for both BCI development and clinical AAC use.    Relevance: The populations of patients with locked-in syndrome are increasing as medical technologies advance and successfully support life. These individuals with limited to no movement could potentially contribute to their medical decision making, informed consent, and daily care giving if they had faster, more reliable means to interface with communication systems. The RSVP keyboard and proposed language models are innovative technological discoveries that are being applied to clinical augmentative communication tools so that patients and their families can participate in daily activities and advocate for improvements in standard clinical care. The proposed project stresses the translation of basic computer science into clinical care, supporting the proposed NIH Roadmap and public health initiatives.              Public health relevance statement: The populations of patients with locked-in syndrome are increasing as medical technologies advance and successfully support life.

"Semi-Automated Abstract Screening for Comparative Effectiveness Reviews    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In this three-year project, we aim to apply state-of-the-art information analysis technologies to assist the production of systematic reviews and meta-analyses that are increasingly being used as a foundation for evidence-based medicine (EBM) and comparative effectiveness reviews. We plan to develop a human guided computerized abstract screening tool to greatly reduce the need to perform a tedious but crucial step of manually screening many thousands of abstracts generated by literature searches in order to retrieve a small fraction potentially relevant for further analysis. This tool will combine proven machine learning techniques with a new open source tool that enables management of the screening process. This new technology will enable investigators to screen abstracts in a small fraction of the time compared to the current manual process. It will reduce the time and cost of producing systematic reviews, provide clear documentation of the process and potentially perform the task more accurately. With the acceptance of EBM and increasing demands for systematic reviews, there is a great need for tools to assist in generating new systematic reviews and in updating them. This need cannot be more pressing. The recent passage of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act and the $1.1 billion allocated for comparative effectiveness research have created an unprecedented need for systematic reviews and opportunities to improve the methodologies and efficiency of their conduct.   We herein propose the development of novel, open-source software to help systematic reviewers better   cope with these torrents of data. The research and development of this tool will be carried out by a highly experienced team of systematic review investigators with computer scientists at Tufts University who began to collaborate last year as a result of Tufts being awarded one of the NIH Clinical Translational Science Awards (CTSA). We will pursue dissemination of the new technology through numerous channels including, but not limited to publication, presentation at conferences, exploring interest in its adoption by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) Evidence-based Practice Center (EPC) Program, Cochrane Collaboration, CTSA network, and other groups conducting systematic reviews, and production of tutorial material. Our aims are:   1. Conduct research to design and implement a semi-automated system using machine learning and   information retrieval methods to identify relevant abstracts in order to improve the accuracy and efficiency of systematic reviews.   2. Develop Abstrackr, an open-source system with a Graphical User Interface (GUI) for screening abstracts, that applies the methods developed in Aim 1 to automatically exclude irrelevant abstracts/articles.   3. Evaluate the performance of the active learning model developed in Aim 1 and the functionality of   Abstrackr developed in Aim 2 through application to a collection of manually screened datasets of   biomedical abstracts that will subsequently be made publicly available for use as a repository to spur   research in the machine learning and information retrieval communities.           Systematic reviewing is a scientific approach to objectively summarizing the effectiveness and safety of existing treatments for diseases, a prerequisite for informed healthcare decision-making. Systematic reviewers must read many thousands of medical study abstracts, the vast majority of which are completely irrelevant to the review at hand. This is hugely laborious and time consuming. We propose to build a computerized system that automatically excludes a large number of the irrelevant abstracts, thereby accelerating the process and expediting the application of the systematic review findings to patient care.",Semi-Automated Abstract Screening for Comparative Effectiveness Reviews,8115129,R01HS018494,[' '],AHRQ,TUFTS MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2011,136978,0.008977148879678017

"Continued Development and Evaluation of caTIES    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose to further develop, test, evaluate and support caTIES - an existing software system for developing networked repositories of sharable de-identified surgical pathology reports. The caTIES system creates a repository of de-identified, structured, and concept-coded clinical reports derived from large corpora of clinical free-text. Documents are automatically coded against a controlled terminology such as the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS), SNOMED-CT, or NCI Metathesaurus. Users construct queries to identify specific kinds of documents and tissue specimens based on the associated clinical report. For example, a researcher studying genetic variation in metastatic breast cancers can identify cases of invasive ductal carcinoma of the breast, followed by metastatic ductal cancer in bone at an interval of three years or greater from the original diagnosis. The caTIES system also supports acquisition and ordering of tissues, using an honest broker model. Through this mechanism, de-identified data and access to tissue can be shared among institutions, enabling multi-center collaborative research. The caTIES system has already been implemented at seven US Cancer Centers, and is being considered for adoption by numerous other institutions including cancer centers, university hospitals and private hospitals. Initial development of caTIES was funded by the Cancer Biomedical Informatics Grid (caBIG). However, interest in the application has far exceeded our expectations and the limitations of caBIG. This grant will allow us to further extend the capabilities of the system by (a) improving the portability of the system and extending the types of documents that can be processed, (b) evaluating the system's NLP performance and usability, (c) building a user community to support this open-source application, and (d) piloting interoperability of caTIES with other enterprise and research systems. This work will preserve and extend a highly novel platform for development of massive repositories of de-identified clinical data that can be used for research within and across institutions. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This grant will fund the further development and evaluation of a system that takes identified clinical documents and converts them into de-identified, concept-coded, structured data. The system enables researchers to access remainder tissues and clinical report data for research purposes within and across institution.

"HealthMap: Knowledge Management for Emerging Infectious Disease Intelligence    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):      Even as many developed countries strengthen their traditional clinically-based surveillance capacity, a basic level of health information infrastructure is still lacking in many parts of the developing world, including areas that are most vulnerable to emerging health threats. To help fill this gap, electronic news outlets, disease reporting networks, discussion sites, and blogs are proving to be invaluable data sources for a new generation of public health surveillance systems that operate across international borders- almost all major outbreaks investigated by WHO, including SARS, are first identified by these informal online sources. These data sources provide local and timely information about disease outbreaks and related events around the world, including areas relatively invisible to day-to-day global public health efforts due to lack of infrastructure or political suppression of information. However, since this information is dispersed and largely unstructured, there is lack of organization and integration between sources, precluding a global view of all ongoing disease threats. In order to construct such an integrated view of current emerging infections, we deployed an early prototype called Health Map, a freely available multi-stream real-time knowledge management system that aggregates and maps health alerts across numerous key data sources, including WHO alerts, newswires, mailing lists. Leveraging our previous National Library of Medicine funded work in real-time health monitoring; we propose extensive development of this new digital resource to address technological and methodological barriers to achieving a synthesized, comprehensive, and customized view of global health. The principal objective of Health Map development is to provide access to the greatest amount of possibly useful information across the widest variety of geographical areas and disease agents, without overwhelming the user with an excess of information, or obscuring important and urgent elements. We will specifically address the challenge of providing structure to unstructured data while still enabling the astute user to notice the subtle pattern that could be an early indication of a significant outbreak. Development of Health Map will proceed along the four key components of surveillance: (1) data acquisition (evaluation and integration of multiple electronic sources) (2) information characterization (disease and location categorization and severity rating of unstructured data), (3) signal interpretation (multi-stream signal detection, spatiotemporal modeling and risk assessment) and (4) knowledge dissemination (tiered dissemination of global infectious disease alerts and flexible data visualization tools). In each area, we will make critical enhancements to the existing prototype. We plan rigorous evaluation to ensure that Health Map successfully leverages electronic sources for surveillance, communication, and intervention. We will also conduct comprehensive user testing, usability studies, user behavior analysis as part of our effort. Our goal is to make Health Map a vital knowledge resource tailored for both the general public and public health decision-makers.        Although an enormous amount of information about current infectious disease outbreaks is found in Web- accessible information sources, this information is dispersed and not well-organized, making it almost impossible for public health officials and concerned citizens to know about all ongoing emerging disease threats.

"Temporal relation discovery for clinical text    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overarching long-term vision of our research is to create novel technologies for processing clinical free text. Such technologies will enable sophisticated and efficient indexing, retrieval and data mining over the ever increasing amounts of electronic clinical data. Processing free text poses a number of challenges to which the fields of Artificial intelligence, natural language processing and computer science in general have made advances. Methods for processing free text are informed by linguistic theory combined with the power of statistical inferencing. A key component to the next step, natural language understanding, is discovering events and their relations on a timeline. Temporal relations are of prime importance in biomedicine as they are intrinsically linked to diseases, signs and symptoms, and treatments. Understanding the timeline of clinically relevant events is key to the next generation of translational research where the importance of generalizing over large amounts of data holds the promise of deciphering biomedical puzzles.        The goal of our current proposal is to discover temporal relations from clinical free text through achieving four specific aims:        Specific Aim 1: Develop (1) a temporal relation annotation schema and guidelines for clinical free text based on TimeML, which will require extensions to Treebank, PropBank and VerbNet annotation guidelines to the clinical domain, (2) an annotated corpus following the temporal relations schema with additions to Treebank, PropBank and VerbNet, (3) a descriptive study comparing temporal relations in the clinical and general domains.        Specific Aim 2: Extend and evaluate existing methods and/or develop new algorithms for temporal relation discovery in the clinical domain. Component-level evaluation        Specific Aim 3: Integrate best method and/or a variety of methods for temporal relation discovery into the open source Mayo Clinic IE pipeline and release as open source annotators in the pipeline. Functional testing. Dissemination activities.        Specific Aim 4: System-level evaluation. Test the functionality of the enhanced Mayo Clinic IE pipeline on translational research use cases, e.g. the progression of colon cancer as documented in clinical notes and pathology reports, the progression of brain tumor as documented in radiology reports.        The methods we will use for the temporal relation discovery are based on machine learning, e.g., Support Vector Machine technology. Such methods require the annotation of a reference standard from which the computations are derived. The best methods will be released as part of the Mayo Clinic Information Extraction System for the larger community to use and contribute to. We will test the methods against biomedical queries.           Relevance (max 2-3 sentences) Temporal relations are of prime importance in biomedicine as they are intrinsically linked to diseases, signs and symptoms, and treatments.

"USE OF NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING TO IDENTIFY LINGUISTIC MARKERS OF COPING    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Understanding mechanisms of action is key to improving psychosocial interventions for cancer and other chronic disease conditions. In cancer, emotional expression has been identified as one possible mediator of the effect of psychosocial intervention on patient-reported outcomes. However, scientific evaluations of psychological mechanisms of adjustment to cancer and other chronic diseases are constrained by limitations associated with self-report measures. Because self-care resources, peer-to-peer networks, and more recent forms of psychosocial intervention are increasingly being delivered online, linguistic and behavioral data can be used to characterize internal coping processes, social interactions, and other manifest behaviors. Few tools are currently available for harnessing text as a potential data source, and signal detection indices of existing tools leave room for considerable improvement in these methodologies (Bantum & Owen, 2009). In the present study, natural language processing and other tools of computational linguistics will be used to develop a machine-learning classifier to identify emotional expression in electronic text data. The aims of the study are: 1) to annotate a large text corpus from cancer survivors using an objective and reliable emotion-coding procedure, 2) to incorporate linguistic and psychological features into a machine-learning classification method and identify which of these features are most strongly associated with codes assigned by trained human raters, and 3) to develop combined psychological and natural language processing (NLP) methods for identifying linguistic markers of emotional coping behaviors. To accomplish these aims, a comprehensive corpus of emotionally-laden cancer communications will be developed from 5 existing linguistic datasets. Five raters will be selected and undergo a rigorous training procedure for coding emotional expression using an emotion-coding system previously developed by the research. Coding will take place using an Internet-based coding interface that will allow the investigators to continuously monitor inter-rater reliability. Simultaneous with the coding process, the investigators will link the electronic text data with key linguistic and psychological features, including Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC), Affective Norms for English Words (ANEW), WordNet, part of speech tags, patterns of capitalization and punctuation, emoticons, and textual context. A machine-learning classifier, using tools of natural language processing, will then be applied to the text/feature data and validated against human-rated emotion codes. The long-term objective of this research is to advance a methodology for objectively identifying coping behavior, particularly emotional expression, in order to supplement self-report measures and improve scientific understanding of adjustment to chronic disease, trauma, or other psychological conditions. This work is essential for identifying mechanisms of action in psychosocial interventions for cancer survivors and others and has significance for the fields of medicine, psychology, computational linguistics, and artificial intelligence.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Identifying specific emotional, cognitive, and behavioral factors that contribute to adjustment to cancer and other chronic diseases is essential for being able to develop and improve effective interventions to promote health and well-being. To date, the study of these factors as mechanisms of action has been limited to self-report measures that may not correlate well with other more objective indicators. The proposed study will improve our ability to identify mechanisms of action by supplementing self-report measures with objectively identified markers of coping behaviors such as emotional expression in natural language used by individuals living with cancer.           Identifying specific emotional, cognitive, and behavioral factors that contribute to adjustment to cancer and other chronic diseases is essential for being able to develop and improve effective interventions to promote health and well-being.

"A Hybrid General Natural Language Processing Architecture    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Electronic medical records and exchanges offer new opportunities for the analysis of population health data; however, new methods in natural language processing (NLP) must first be developed to structure and codify these records, since most medical data is in the form of free text which cannot be stored and manipulated by computers. Once this is accomplished, population health data can be analyzed which will lead to better treatment guidelines, targeted drug therapy, and more cost effective care. Logical Semantics, Inc. (LSI) proposes to develop new statistical NLP methods for analyzing large scale medical domains. These methods will leverage LSI's semantic annotation technology, which has created the largest semantically annotated clinical corpus in the world. LSI's goal is to semantically index large medical record repositories accurately against propositions arranged in knowledge ontologies and make these indices available for text mining applications. The phase one research is focused on three specific aims that will lead to breakthroughs in the science of NLP: (1) Develop new statistical NLP algorithms employing a large semantically annotated medical corpus, (2) Semi-automate knowledge ontology generation, and (3) Develop and combine rule based with statistical NLP algorithms to create a superior hybrid NLP system. The achievement of these aims will result in computer systems that can extract the meaning from free text medical records so researchers, policy makers, and clinicians can use health analytics to improve healthcare.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Natural language processing (NLP) has been successful in extracting specific findings and diagnoses from free text medical records.

"Real-time Disambiguation of Abbreviations in Clinical Notes    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A key prerequisite for high-quality healthcare delivery is effective communication within and across healthcare settings. However, communication can be hampered by the pervasive use of abbreviations in clinical notes. Clinicians use abbreviations to save time during documentation. While abbreviations may seem unambiguous to their authors, they often cause confusion to other readers, including healthcare providers, patients, and natural language processing (NLP) systems attempting to extract clinical terms from text. While the understanding that abbreviations can cause errors is widespread, few have deployed pragmatic solutions for this important problem. The proposed project will develop, evaluate, and share a systematic approach to Clinical Abbreviation Recognition and Disambiguation (CARD), and in doing so substantially aims to benefit existing NLP systems and to improve computer-based documentation systems by reducing ambiguities in electronic records in real-time. The study includes the following five Specific Aims: 1) Develop automated methods to detect abbreviations and their senses from clinical text corpora and build a comprehensive knowledge base of clinical abbreviations; 2) Develop and evaluate three automated word sense disambiguation (WSD) classifiers, and establish methods to combine those classifiers to maximize both their performance and coverage; 3) Develop the CARD system, and demonstrate its effectiveness by integrating it with two established NLP systems (MedLEE and KnowledgeMap); 4) Integrate CARD with an institutional clinical documentation system (Vanderbilt's StarNotes) and evaluate its ability to expand abbreviations in real-time as clinicians generate records; 5) Distribute the CARD knowledge base and software for non-commercial uses.              Project Narrative Abbreviations are widely used throughout all types of clinical documents and they cause confusion to both healthcare providers and patients and limit effective communications within and across care settings. This proposed study will develop informatics methods to automatically detect abbreviations and their possible meanings from large clinical text and to disambiguate abbreviations that have multiple meanings. We will also integrate those methods with clinical documentation systems so that abbreviations will be expanded in real-time when physicians entering clinical notes, thus to improve the quality of health records.",Real-time Disambiguation of Abbreviations in Clinical Notes,7866149,R01LM010681,"['Abbreviations', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Computer Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Confusion', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Disease', 'Documentation', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronics', 'Equipment and supply inventories', 'Frequencies', 'Health Personnel', 'Healthcare', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Joints', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Medical Records', 'Methods', 'Names', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nitroglycerin', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Reader', 'Records', 'Serious Adverse Event', 'Solutions', 'System', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Time', 'Work', 'Writing', 'acronyms', 'base', 'health care delivery', 'health record', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'knowledge base', 'novel', 'phrases', 'satisfaction']",NLM,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,R01,2010,387500,-0.004776294447103208
"Multi-source clinical Question Answering system    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   / Abstract (Limit: 1 page) Our proposal addresses the following challenge area: 06-LM-101* Intelligent Search Tool for Answering Clinical Questions. Develop new computational approaches to information retrieval that would allow a clinician or clinical researcher to pose a single query that would result in search of multiple data sources to produce a coherent response that highlights key relevant information which may signal new insights for clinical research or patient care. Information that could help a clinician diagnose or manage a health condition, or help a clinical researcher explore the significance of issues that arise during a clinical trial, is scattered across many different types of resources, such as paper or electronic charts, trial protocols, published biomedical articles, or best-practice guidelines for care. Develop artificial intelligence and information retrieval approaches that allow a clinician or researcher confronting complex patient problems to pose a single query that will result in a search that appears to ""understand"" the question, a search that inspects multiple databases and brings findings together into a useful answer. Clinical question answering (cQA) systems focus on the physician needs usually at the point of care, or the investigator in the lab. The questions usually asked either require information highly specific to their patient, e.g. the patient's lab results or previous history, answered by the patient's health record, or a more general type of information usually answered through generally available information sources. QA systems enhance the results of search engines by providing a concise summary of relevant information along with source hits. PubMed (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/) is the most ubiquitous biomedical search engine, however because it is a search engine the information retrieved is based on keyword searches and is not presented in a form for immediate consumption; the user has to drill down into the content of the webpages to find the facts/statements of interest. Moreover, the information that the clinician needs is likely to be of different types, for example a definition of a syndrome in combination with specific actions triggered by a particular diagnosis for a particular patient. Such information resides in different sources - encyclopedic and the EMR - and has to be dynamically accessed and presented to the user in an easily digestible format. We propose to develop a unified platform for clinical QA from multiple sources of clinical and biomedical narrative that implements semantic processing of the questions by fusing two existing technologies - the Mayo clinical Text Analysis and Knowledge Extraction System and the University of Colorado's Question Answering System. The specific research questions we are aiming to answer are: ""How much effort is required to port a general semantic QA system to the clinical domain? How much additional domain-specific training is required? ""What is the accuracy of such a system? Question Answering in the clinical domain is an emerging area of research. The challenges in the field are mainly attributed to the number of components that require domain specific training along with strict system requirements in terms of high precision and recall complemented by an accessible and user-friendly presentation. Our approach to overcome them is to re-use components already in place as part of Mayo clinical Text Analysis and Knowledge Extraction System and the University of Colorado's Question Answering System. Our approach is innovative in bringing together information from encyclopedic sources and the EMR to present it into a unified form to the clinician at the point of care or the investigator in the lab. The technology for that is based on semantic language processing which aims at ""understanding"" the meaning of the question and the narrative. Our proposed system holds the potential to impact quality of healthcare and translational research. Our approach is feasible because it uses content already in the EMR at the Mayo Clinic along with general medical knowledge from multiple readily-available resources. The proposed system will be built off mature and tested components allowing a fast and robust delivery cycle. Our unique integration of technologies together with sophisticated statistical machine learning algorithms applied to rich linguistic knowledge about events, contradictions, semantic structure, and question-types, will allow us to build a system which significantly extends the range of possible question types and responses available to clinicians, and seamlessly fuses these to generate a response. Our proposed work represents a high impact area that has the potential to improve healthcare delivery because it addresses needs that have been well-documented and studied (Ely et al., 2005). We aim to provide a unified multi-source solution for semantic retrieval, access and summarization of relevant information at the point of care or the lab. As such, the proposed cQA has the potential to play a vital and important decision- support role for the physician or the biomedical investigator. (max 2-3 sentences) Clinical question answering (cQA) systems focus on the physician needs usually at the point of care, or the investigator in the lab.

"Adapting Natural Language Processing Tools for Biosurveillance    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Early detection of disease outbreaks can decrease patient morbidity and mortality and minimize the spread of diseases. Early detection requires accurate classification of patient symptoms early in the course of their illness. One approach is biosurveillance, in which electronic symptom data are captured early in the course of illness, and analyzed for signals that might indicate an outbreak requiring investigation and response by the public health system. Emergency department (ED) patient records are particularly useful for biosurveillance, given their timely, electronic availability. ED data elements used in surveillance systems include the chief complaint (a brief description of the patient's primary symptom(s)), and triage nurses' note (also known as history of present illness).The chief complaint is the most widely used ED data element, because it is recorded electronically by the majority of EDs. One study showed that adding triage notes increased the sensitivity of biosurveillance case detection. The increased sensitivity is because the triage note increases the amount of data available: instead of one symptom in a chief complaint (e.g., fever), triage notes may contain multiple symptoms (e.g., ""fever, cough & shortness of breath for 12 hours""). Surveillance efforts are hampered, however, by the wide variability of free text data in ED chief complaints and triage notes. They often include misspellings, abbreviations, acronyms and other lexical and semantic variants that are difficult to group into symptom clusters (e.g., fever, temp 104, fvr, febrile). Tools are needed to address the lexical and semantic variation in symptom terms in ED data in order to improve biosurveillance. Natural language processing tools have been shown to facilitate concept extraction from more structured clinical data such as radiology reports, but there has been limited application of these techniques to free text ED triage notes. The project team developed the Emergency Medical Text Processor (EMT-P) to preprocess the chief complaint. EMT-P cleans and normalizes brief chief complaint entries and then extracts standardized concepts, but it is not sufficient in its current state to preprocess longer, more complex text passages such as triage notes. This proposed project will further strengthen biosurveillance by adapting EMT-P and other statistical and classical natural language processing tools to develop a system that extracts concepts from triage notes for biosurveillance.           Project Narrative Relevance: The public health system is responsible for monitoring large amounts of timely, electronic health data and needs more sophisticated tools to faciliate detection of, and response to, emerging infectious diseases and potential bioterrorism threats. The proposed project addresses this need by developing a system to extract relevant information from emergency department records.",Adapting Natural Language Processing Tools for Biosurveillance,7921455,G08LM009787,"['Abbreviations', 'Accident and Emergency department', 'Acute', 'Address', 'American', 'Avian Influenza', 'Bioterrorism', 'Bird Flu vaccine', 'Breathing', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Code', 'Collection', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Contracts', 'Coughing', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Element', 'Data Quality', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Electronics', 'Emergency Medicine', 'Emergency Situation', 'Emerging Communicable Diseases', 'Epidemiologist', 'Epidemiology', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Fever', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Health Services', 'Health system', 'Hour', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Natural Language Processing', 'North Carolina', 'Nurses', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pertussis', 'Physicians', 'Predictive Value', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Recording of previous events', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Sampling', 'Screening procedure', 'Semantics', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Shortness of Breath', 'Signal Transduction', 'Smallpox', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Temperature', 'Text', 'Translating', 'Triage', 'Variant', 'acronyms', 'base', 'experience', 'improved', 'lexical', 'mortality', 'pandemic disease', 'population based', 'prototype', 'research to practice', 'response', 'satisfaction', 'syntax', 'tool']",NLM,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,G08,2010,148350,-0.0017640963781276344
"Natural Language Processing for Cancer Research Network Surveillance Studies    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application addresses Broad Challenge Area: (10) Information Technology for Processing Health Care Data and specific Challenge Topic: 10-CA-107 Expand Spectrum of Cancer Surveillance through Informatics Approaches. The proposed project launches a collaborative effort to advance adoption within the HMO Cancer Research Network (CRN) of ""industrial-strength"" natural language processing (NLP) systems useful for mining valuable, research-grade information from unstructured clinical text. Such text is available for processing, now in the electronic medical record (EMR) systems of affiliated CRN health plans. The proposed NLP methods   will create ongoing capacity to tap what has recently been described as ""a treasure trove of historical   unstructured data that provides essential information for the study of disease progression, treatment   effectiveness and long-term outcomes"" (5). The vision of advancing widespread NLP capacity across the CRN, as well as the approach we present here for implementing it, grew out of an in-depth strategic planning effort we completed in December 2008. That effort involved participants from six CRN sites guided by a blue-ribbon panel of NLP experts from three of the nation's leading centers of clinical NLP research: University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, Vanderbilt University, and Mayo Clinic. The vision is to deploy a powerful NLP system locally, manage it with newly hired and trained local NLP technical staff, and conduct NLP-based research projects initiated by local investigators, in consultation with higher-level external NLP experts. Our planning efforts suggest this collaborative model is feasible; we will test the model in the context of the proposed project. An important development in April 2009 yielded what we believe is a potentially transformative opportunity to accelerate adoption of NLP capacity in applied research settings: release of the open-source Clinical Text Analysis and Knowledge Extraction System (cTAKES) software. This software was the result of a collaborative effort between IBM and Mayo Clinic. Built on the same framework Mayo Clinic currently uses to process its repository of over 40 million clinical documents, cTAKES dramatically lowers the cost of adopting a comprehensive and flexible NLP system. Deployment and use of such systems was previously only feasible in institutions with large, academically-oriented biomedical informatics research programs.   Still, other deployment challenges and the need to acquire NLP training for local staff present residual   barriers to adopting comprehensive NLP systems such as cTAKES. In collaboration with five other CRN sites the proposed project mitigates these challenges in two ways: 1) it develops configurable open-source software modules needed to streamline and therefore reduce the cost of deploying cTAKES, and 2) it presents and tests a model for training local staff through hands-on NLP projects overseen by outside NLP expert consultants. The potential impact of this project is evident most clearly in the vast untapped opportunities for text mining represented in CRN-affiliated health plans, where EMR systems have been in place since at least 2005, and whose patients represent 4% of the U.S. population. Clinical text mining offers the potential to provide new or improved data elements for cancer surveillance and other types of research requiring information about patient functional status, medication side-effects, details of therapeutic approaches, and differential information about clinical findings. Another significant impact of this project is its plan to integrate into the cTAKES system   an open-source de-identification tool based on state of the art, best of breed NLP approaches developed by the MITRE Corporation. De-identification of clinical text will make it easier for researchers to get access to clinical text, and will also facilitate multi-site collaborations while protecting patient privacy. Finally, if successful, the NLP algorithm we propose as a proof-of-principle project at Group Health-which will classify sets of patient charts as either containing or not containing a diagnosis of recurrent breast cancer-could dramatically reduce the cost of research in this area; currently all recurrent breast cancer endpoints must be established through costly manual chart abstraction.   Novel aspects of the proposed project include its talented and transdisciplinary research team,   including national experts in NLP, and its resourceful strategy for building the technical resources and ""human capital"" needed to support an ongoing program of applied NLP research. Natural language processing is itself a highly innovative technology; when successfully established in multiple CRN in the future it will represent a watershed moment in the CRN's already impressive history of exploiting data systems to support innovative research. Newly hired staff positions total approximately 2.0 FTE in each project year, most of which we anticipate will be supported by ongoing new research programs after the proposed project concludes. Project narrative The proposed project develops new measurement technologies for extracting information about disease processes and treatment, currently documented only in clinical text, based on natural language processing approaches. Because these methods are generic they will potentially contribute to public health by advancing research in a wide variety of areas. The ""proof of principle"" algorithm developed in the project to identify recurrent breast cancer diagnoses will advance epidemiologic and clinical research pertaining to the 2.5 million women currently living with breast cancer.           Project narrative The proposed project develops new measurement technologies for extracting information about disease processes and treatment, currently documented only in clinical text, based on natural language processing approaches.

"ADAPTIVE PERSONALIZED INFORMATION MANAGEMENT FOR BIOLOGISTS    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  We propose development of an adaptive, personalizable, information management tool, which can be configured and trained by an individual biologist to most effectively exploit the particular knowledge bases and document collections that are most useful for him or her. The proposed tool represents a novel approach for monitoring scientific progress in biology, which has become a formidable task. We will exploit recent advances in machine learning and database systems to develop a useful approximation to a personalized biological knowledge base f.i.i.e., single information resource that would include all the knowledge sources on which a biologist relies. More specifically, we propose a scheme for loosely integrating both structured information and unstructured text, and then querying the integrated information using easily-formulated similarity queries. The system will also learn from every episode in which a biologist seeks information. The research team on this project includes a computer scientist and two biologists. The proposed work will make systems for monitoring scientific progress in biology more effective. This will make biologists, clinicians and medical researchers better able to track advances in the biomedical literature that are relevant to their work.          n/a",ADAPTIVE PERSONALIZED INFORMATION MANAGEMENT FOR BIOLOGISTS,7851323,R01GM081293,"['Address', 'Biological', 'Biological Phenomena', 'Biology', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Computers', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Eukaryota', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Individual', 'Information Management', 'Information Resources', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Metric', 'Monitor', 'Output', 'Persons', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Publications', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Ribosomes', 'Role', 'Scheme', 'Scientist', 'Solutions', 'Source', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'Work', 'base', 'design', 'experience', 'knowledge base', 'man', 'novel strategies', 'programs', 'tool']",NIGMS,CARNEGIE-MELLON UNIVERSITY,R01,2010,278345,-0.03242837269011791
"Integrated discovery and hypothesis testing of new associations in rare diseases    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Rare diseases are studied in isolated laboratories, forgotten by main stream pharmacological companies, and considered almost academic curiosities. Finding variables that correlate/cause rare diseases (a condition is rare when it affects less than 1 person per 2,000) is a difficult task. The low number of cases and the sparse nature of the reports make it difficult to obtain significant/meaningful statistical results. There are two ways to avoid these problems. The first is to integrate reported cases and associations to generate enough statistical power. The second way is to have an independent data set, big enough to cover rare cases. Each of the two methods has intrinsic problems. For instance, the search in the literature puts together different studies, each of them with their own biases in population, methodology and objectives. On the other hand, blind searches for associations in big databases introduce a large number of false positives due to multiple hypothesis testing.       These problems could be avoided by developing innovative methods that allow the integration of information and methodologies in the literature and longitudinal databases. To achieve this goal, we propose a team that combines expertise in natural language processing systems (Carol Friedman), electronic health records (George Hripcsak), statistics in combined databases and computational virology (Raul Rabadan). This team will generate an interdisciplinary approach to mine and integrate the literature and the dataset collected at Columbia/New York Presbyterian hospital. Identifying unusual correlations in rare diseases is the first step to understanding the origin of the diseases and to finding a cure for them.

"Development of a Research-Ready Pregnancy and Newborn Biobank in California    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Development of a Research-Ready Pregnancy and Newborn Biobank in California Population-based biobanks are a critical resource for identifying disease mechanisms and developing screening tests for biomarkers associated with certain disorders. The California Department of Public Health has been banking newborn specimens statewide since 1982 (N~14 million) and maternal prenatal specimens for a portion of the state since 2000 (N~1 million), creating one of the largest, if not the largest single biological specimen banks with linked data in the world. With the fast pace of new knowledge in genetics and laboratory methods, the demand for specimens and data from researchers around the world now far surpasses the Department's ability to fill them. The goal of this infrastructure development project is to create an efficient, high throughput, low cost newborn screening and prenatal/maternal screening specimen biobank and linked data base that could be used by large numbers of researchers around the world for a wide range of studies through the following aims: (1) establishment of highly efficient protocols and procurement and integration of automated systems for pulling and processing specimens; (2) development of an integrated specimen tracking system into the Department's existing web-based Screening Information System; (3) development of a computerized system to track application requests for specimens and data; and (4) development of a linked screening program-vital records database that is organized into a life course, client based system. These aims will be accomplished through expansion of the Department's award-winning Screening Integration System to include web-based tracking of specimens and research requests, and use of an innovative machine-learning record matching application for high-performance linkages. After the 2 year grant period is completed, the California Research Ready Biospecimen Bank will be able to provide researchers with valuable biological specimens in a timely, cost-effective manner, thereby enabling a dramatic expansion of epidemiological research nationwide.

"Bridging the Semantic Gap Between Research Eligibility Criteria and Clinical Data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Our long-term objective is to enlarge the scope and efficiency of clinical research through enhanced use of clinical data to support clinical research decisions. This proposal aims to improve the use of electronic health records (EHR) to automate clinical trials eligibility screening by developing a new semantic alignment framework. Clinical trials research is an important step for translating breakthroughs in basic biomedical sciences into knowledge that will benefit clinical practice and human health. However, a significant obstacle is identifying eligible participants. Eighty-six percent of all clinical trials are delayed in patient recruitment for from one to six months and 13% are delayed by more than six months. Enrollment delay is expensive. In a recent large, multi-center trial, about 86.8 staff hours and more than $1000 was spent to enroll each participant. Ineffective enrollment also produces a big social cost in that up to 60% of patients can miss being identified. The broad deployment of EHR systems has created unprecedented opportunities to solve the problem because EHR systems contain a rich source of information about potential participants. However, it is often a knowledge-intensive, time-consuming, and inefficient manual procedure to match eligibility criteria such as ""renal in- sufficiency"" to clinical data such as ""serum creatinine = 1.0 mg/dl for an 80-year old white female patient."" This enduring challenge is partly caused by the disconnection between abstract and ambiguous eligibility criteria and highly specific clinical data manifestations; we call this a semantic gap.

"Annotation, development and evaluation for clinical information extraction    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Much of the clinical information required for accurate clinical research, active decision support, and broad-coverage surveillance is locked in text files in an electronic medical record (EMR). The only feasible way to leverage this information for translational science is to extract and encode the information using natural language processing (NLP). Over the last two decades, several research groups have developed NLP tools for clinical notes, but a major bottleneck preventing progress in clinical NLP is the lack of standard, annotated data sets for training and evaluating NLP applications. Without these standards, individual NLP applications abound without the ability to train different algorithms on standard annotations, share and integrate NLP modules, or compare performance. We propose to develop standards and infrastructure that can enable technology to extract scientific information from textual medical records, and we propose the research as a collaborative effort involving NLP experts across the U.S. To accomplish this goal, we will address three specific aims: Aim 1: Extend existing standards and develop new consensus standards for annotating clinical text in a way that is interoperable, extensible, and usable. Aim 2: Apply existing methods and tools, and develop new methods and tools where necessary for manually annotating a set of publicly available clinical texts in a way that is efficient and accurate. Aim 3: Develop a publicly available toolkit for automatically annotating clinical text and perform a shared evaluation to evaluate the toolkit, using evaluation metrics that are multidimensional and flexible.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In this project, we will develop a publicly available corpus of annotated clinical texts for NLP research. We will experiment with methods for increasing the efficiency of annotation and will annotate de-identified reports of nine types for linguistic and clinical information. In addition, we will create an NLP toolkit that can be shared and will evaluate it against other NLP systems in a shared task evaluation with the community.           Project narrative: In this project, we will develop a publicly available corpus of annotated clinical texts for NLP research.

"Evidence-based Diagnostic Tools for Translational and Clinical Research (eTfor2)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The eTfor2 project will develop and evaluate open-source programs and knowledge representations to better characterize patients for translational and clinical research studies. The project addresses National Library of Medicine (NLM) RFA initiatives for: (a) information & knowledge processing, including natural language processing and text summarization, (b) approaches for linking phenomic and genomic information, and (c) integration of information from heterogeneous sources. Translational studies correlate clinical patient descriptors (phenome) with results of genomic investigations, e.g., genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Standard methods for defining phenotypes require costly, labor-intensive cohort enrollments to identify patients with diseases and appropriate controls. Recently, translational and clinical researchers have used electronic medical record (EMR) data as an alternative to identifying patient characteristics. However, EMR case extraction requires substantial manual review and ""tuning"" for case selection, due to the inaccuracies inherent in ICD9 billing codes. While relevant and useful natural language processing (NLP) approaches to facilitate EMR text extraction have proliferated, the target patient descriptors these approaches employ typically remain non-standard and locally defined, and vary from disease to disease, project to project and institution to institution. At best, such NLP applications use standard terminology descriptors such as SNOMED-CT as EMR extraction targets. Yet, there is no generally utilized ""standard"" knowledge base that links such ""extractable"" descriptors to an academic-quality knowledge source detailing what findings have been reliably reported to occur in each disease. To facilitate translational and clinical research, the eTfor2 project will make available an open-source, evidence-based, electronic clinical knowledge base (KB) and related NLP tools enabling researchers at any site to extract a standard ""target"" set of EMR-based phenomic descriptors at both the finding and disease levels. It will further include diagnostic decision support logic to confirm the degree of support for patients' diagnoses in their EMR records. The eTfor2 project will decrease effort required to harvest EMR patient descriptors for clinical and translational studies, and enable new translational work that identifies genomic associations at both finding and disease levels. The eTfor2 resources should improve the quality and cross-institutional validity of EMR-based translational and clinical studies.           Evidence-based Diagnostic Tools for Translational and Clinical Research (eTfor2) Project Narrative When completed successfully, the eTfor2 project will enable researchers at disparate institutions to extract from their respective EMR systems a shared ""target"" set of common phenomic descriptors, in a standard, reproducible manner.

"Online Social Networking as an Alternative Information Source for Clinical Resear    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Clinical trials and patient records have been the main information sources for clinical research. While well- designed clinical trials can produce high quality data, they are generally very expensive and time consuming. Prior studies have also shown that patients enrolled in clinical trials are not necessarily representative of the general patient population. Chart reviews, which rely on the patient records, avoid some of the drawbacks of the clinical trials approach. Although chart review studies are more labor intensive, new developments in structured data entry and natural language processing (NLP) are helping to automate the process. However, studies which use chart reviews are limited by the accuracy and completeness of the data in the records.       In the past decade, online social networks have grown exponentially. Some health-focused social network sites have attracted large numbers of users and begun accumulating large quantities of detailed clinical information. The PatientsLikeMe site, for instance, has about 3,200 amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) patients worldwide, and includes about 5% of the ALS population in the US. Information gathered by online social networks is primarily intended for patients to share with each other. Such information has also begun to attract the attention of medical researchers.[3, 4]       Because using information from online social networks for medical research is a fairly new phenomenon, the value and limitation of this type of information source have not been systematically examined. To do so, we propose to conduct a comparison study of patient-contributed information from PatientsLikeMe and records from a large medical record data repository - the Research Patient Data Registry (RPDR) of the Partners Healthcare Systems. The proposed study will focus on ALS, multiple sclerosis (MS), and Parkinson's disease (PD). The general goal is to explore how the medical record and online networking data differ, and if and how online networking data could complement the medical record data. The specific aims are:    1) Extract symptom and treatment information from the two different data sources.    2) Compare the prevalence of symptoms and treatments from the two information sources and analyze the difference.    3) Extract treatment response of prescription medications from PatientsLikeMe and analyze the confounding effect of the misunderstanding of medication indication.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed project will investigate an emerging data source for clinical research: online social network. This data source may complement and supplement the data from clinical trials and medical records, with a unique emphasis on patients' experience and perspectives.           The proposed project will investigate an emerging data source for clinical research: online social network.

"Informatics Infrastructure for vector-based neuroanatomical atlases    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The adage:  'all data is spatial' is especially pertinent in the field of neuroscience, since neuronal data must be indexed by the neuroanatomical location of phenomena or entities under study.  Brain atlases are very widely used as laboratory tools, being some of the most highly cited publications in science.  This proposal seeks to use brain atlases as a method for indexing data from the literature in a neuroinformatics system.  This data includes both textual and graphical information, ranging from highly detailed maps constructed from vector- based spatial primitives, histological photographs and drawings, to textual reports of experimental findings in the literature (which we will analyze on a large scale).  These data represent a significant scientific investment that are currently locked away in previously published journal articles (and the detailed data-sets and drawings from researchers that were used to write the articles).  A prototype that summarizes the last fifteen years' output of one of the world's most prominent neuroanatomy laboratories is immediately available.  This project will develop a collaborative environment to enable neuroscientists to use these valuable maps within the community as a whole by contributing data to a shared system with an open-source system (called 'NeuARt II') that permits querying, overlaying, viewing and annotating such data in an integrated manner.  We will also use Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to index neuroanatomical references in large numbers of journal articles to be accessible within our infrastructure.  As an initial text corpus, we over 110,000 documents taken from last 35 years of published information from the primary neuroanatomical literature.  We will construct a neuroanatomical interface that conceptually resembles the 'Google Maps' system, permitting users to use an intuitive spatial interface to browse large amounts of biomedical data in spatial register.  The proposed infrastructure will also provide new opportunities to compare and synthesize the anatomical components of neuroscience data multiple modalities (physiological, behavioral, clinical, genetic, molecular, etc.).PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Given the scope of the use of neuroanatomical maps from the rat and mouse in the study of neurobiological disease, we expect our research impact scientists working in almost all subfields of the subject.  Our collaborators who form the early adopters of this approach are neuroendocrinology researchers studying the mechanisms of stress and anxiety disorders which are estimated to affect 19.1 million people in the USA, costing $42 billion in health care costs per year (source:  Anxiety Disorders Association of America).

"Vanderbilt Genome-Electronic Records Project    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  VGER: The Vanderbilt Genome-Electronic Record project An important potential enabling resource for Personalized Medicine is the combination of a DNA repository with Electronic Medical Record (EMR) systems sufficiently robust to provide excellence in clinical care and to serve as resources for analysis of disease susceptibility and therapeutic outcomes across patient populations. The Vanderbilt EMR is a state of the art clinical and research tool (that includes >1.4 million records), and is associated with a DNA repository which has been in development for over 3 years; these are the key components of VGER, the Vanderbilt Genome-Electronic Records project proposed here. The VGER model acquires DNA from discarded blood samples collected from routine patient care, and can link these to de-identified data extracted and readily updated from the EMR. The phenotype we will analyze here is the QRS duration on the electrocardiogram, since slow conduction (indicated by longer QRS duration) is a marker of arrhythmia susceptibility. This will not only exploit the power of Genome-Wide Association (GWA) approaches to generate new biologic knowledge that impacts an area of public health concern, but also provides a platform for the development of tools, such as Natural Language Processing approaches, to optimally mine EMRs. This project brings together a team of investigators with nationally recognized records of accomplishment in genome science, medical ethics, bioinformatics, de-identification science, and translational and cardiovascular medicine to address four Specific Aims: (1) perform a GWA comparing samples from subjects with QRS durations at the extremes of the normal range, and validate by genotyping high likelihood associations in prospectively ascertained clinical trial sets for QRS duration and for arrhythmia susceptibility; (2) evaluate the validity and utility of structured and unstructured components of EMR data for genome-phenome correlations; (3) assess the ethical, scientific, and societal advantages and disadvantages of the VGER model, and determine best practices for oversight, community involvement, and communication as the resource grows; and (4) develop and evaluate formal privacy protection models for data derived from databanks and EMRs, establishing data sharing and integration practices. We also include here a proposal to develop the Administrative Coordinating Center whose mission will be to facilitate communication and collaboration among nodes in this network, the NHGRI, and external advisors. We subscribe to a vision of Personalized Medicine in which genomic and other patient-specific information drives personalized, predictive, preemptive, and participatory health care, and VGER represents an important step in that direction.           n/a",Vanderbilt Genome-Electronic Records Project,7893787,U01HG004603,"['Address', 'Area', 'Arrhythmia', 'Arts', 'Bioinformatics', 'Blood specimen', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Commit', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disadvantaged', 'Disease', 'Disease susceptibility', 'EKG QRS Complex', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Electronics', 'Ethics', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Healthcare', 'Heart Diseases', 'Institution', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Legal', 'Link', 'Measures', 'Medical Ethics', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'National Human Genome Research Institute', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Normal Range', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Predisposition', 'Privacy', 'Public Health', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Ethics Committees', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Translational Research', 'Update', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Vision', 'clinical care', 'clinical practice', 'data modeling', 'data sharing', 'egg', 'endophenotype', 'genome wide association study', 'heart rhythm', 'indexing', 'patient population', 'phenome', 'repository', 'tool', 'tool development']",NHGRI,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,U01,2010,1512082,-0.013535278914862461
"Translational refinement of adaptive communication system for locked-in patients    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proliferation of brain-computer interface (BCI) technology promises locked-in patients potential ways to communicate successfully. Most BCI systems either involve selection from among a set of simultaneously presented stimuli, requiring extensive control of the interface; or use binary stimulus selection mechanisms that fail to achieve high communication rates because of slow intent detection or a fixed (context independent) ordering of stimuli. We propose a new interface using binary selection of text input via rapid serial visual presentation of natural language components. Individuals with severe speech and physical impairments (SSPI) resulting from acquired neurological disorders (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, brainstem stroke, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, spinal cord injury) and neurodevelopmental disorders (cerebral palsy, muscular dystrophy) drive the proposed research. Four laboratories form an alliance for this translational research project: basic research (Erdogmus, engineering; Roark, computer science and natural language processing), and clinical research (Oken, neurology/neurophysiology; Fried-Oken, augmentative communication/neurogenic communication disorders). Our aims are (1) to develop an innovative EEG-based BCI that achieves increased communication rates with fewer errors and greater satisfaction for the target SSPI populations; (2) to iteratively refine the system in the laboratory with user feedback from healthy subjects and expert LIS users of marketed AAC systems; (3) to evaluate the performance of the system within the natural clinical settings of SSPI patients. The innovative BCI is the RSVP Keyboard with three essential features: (1) rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP) of linguistic components ranging from letters to words to phrases; (2) a detection mechanism that employs multichannel electroencephalography (EEG) and/or other suitable response mechanisms that can reliably indicate the binary intent of the user and adapt based on individualized neurophysiologic data of the user; and (3) an open-vocabulary natural language model with a capability for accurate predictions of upcoming text. Theoretical framework is based on a solid Bayesian foundation; clinical usability is based on the WHO ICF (WHO, 2001) and an Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC) model of participation. Rigorous experimental scrutiny in both clinical laboratory and natural settings will be obtained with able-bodied subjects and SSPI patients. Measures of learning rate, speed of message production, error rate and user satisfaction for different iterations of the RSVP keyboard will be obtained using an hypothesis-driven crossover design for 36 healthy subjects, and alternating treatment randomization design for 40 patients with SSPI. Descriptions of the motor, cognitive, and language skills of LIS patients using the novel system in their natural environments will inform clinical guidelines and functional device adaptations to better individualize treatment for children and adults with SSPI. The collaborative nature of the proposed translational research is expected to yield new knowledge for both BCI development and clinical AAC use.    Relevance: The populations of patients with locked-in syndrome are increasing as medical technologies advance and successfully support life. These individuals with limited to no movement could potentially contribute to their medical decision making, informed consent, and daily care giving if they had faster, more reliable means to interface with communication systems. The RSVP keyboard and proposed language models are innovative technological discoveries that are being applied to clinical augmentative communication tools so that patients and their families can participate in daily activities and advocate for improvements in standard clinical care. The proposed project stresses the translation of basic computer science into clinical care, supporting the proposed NIH Roadmap and public health initiatives.              Public health relevance statement: The populations of patients with locked-in syndrome are increasing as medical technologies advance and successfully support life.

"Enhancing Clinical Effectiveness Research with Natural Language Processing of EMR    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): To successfully use large linked clinical databases for comparative effectiveness research (CER) requires addressing some key informatics challenges associated with distributed, heterogeneous clinical data. Electronic networks of researchers are part of the solution because they can bridge the physical and organizational divides created by distinct health systems' individual electronic medical records (EMRs). In addition, informatics research has demonstrated the feasibility of automatically coding clinical text, enhancing the capacity to integrate both unstructured and non-standardized clinical data from EMRs. With this study, we propose to develop CER infrastructure, make broadly available the proven MediClass technology for automated classification of EMRs containing both coded data and text clinical notes, and demonstrate the potential of this infrastructure for addressing CER questions within the asthma and tobacco-using patient populations of 6 diverse health systems. Asthma and smoking each impose huge and modifiable burdens on the healthcare system, and multiple morbidities related to asthma and smoking have been targeted by the IOM and AHRQ as priority areas in efforts to improve the healthcare system through comparative effectiveness research. We propose to develop, deploy, operate and evaluate the CER HUB, an Internet-based platform for conducting CER, and to demonstrate its utility in studying clinical interventions in asthma and smoking. Researchers who register to use the HUB, beginning with the research team from the 6 participating study sites, will be able to use a secure website to configure and download MediClass applications addressing CER questions within their respective healthcare organizations, to contribute these IRB-approved, processed datasets back to a centralized data coordinating center to be pooled with data similarly processed from other healthcare organizations, and to use the pooled database to answer diverse comparative effectiveness questions of large, real-world populations. A central function of the CER HUB will be facilitating (through online, interactive tools) development of a shared library of MediClass knowledge modules that afford uniform, standardized coding of EMR data. This shared library of knowledge modules could permit researchers to assess effectiveness in multiple areas of healthcare and gain access to data otherwise locked away in text clinical notes. A goal of the CER HUB is to accelerate creation of standardized knowledge used to normalize heterogeneous EMR data as representations of clinical events for CER. During the project period we will conduct 2 studies using this infrastructure to address the effectiveness of interventions for asthmatics and tobacco users across the 6 participating health systems. As an ongoing resource, the HUB will provide a collaborative development platform for enhancing comparative effectiveness research in potentially any health care domain.      CER researchers can build software applications that will process their EMRs, creating standardized datasets permitting CER using a secure website to configure and download MediClass applications addressing CER questions within their respective healthcare organizations, to contribute these IRB-approved, processed datasets back to a centralized data coordinating center to be pooled with data similarly processed from other healthcare organizations, and to use the pooled database to answer diverse comparative effectiveness questions of large, real-world populations      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Comparative effectiveness research (CER) requires that clinical data be in standard forms allowing multiple, large databases to be efficiently combined, and requires that all of the data be coded so that automated summarization of the data is possible. However, much of the clinical data necessary for CER is in the text clinical notes written by clinicians when caring for patients. We will build a centralized website where CER researchers can build software applications that will process their electronic medical records, including both the text and coded data, creating standardized datasets permitting comparative effectiveness research. We will demonstrate the utility of this infrastructure by conducting CER studies investigating the effectiveness of interventions in asthma and smoking, across the 6 participating health systems.           PROJECT NARRATIVE Comparative effectiveness research (CER) requires that clinical data be in standard forms allowing multiple, large databases to be efficiently combined, and requires that all of the data be coded so that automated summarization of the data is possible.

"Semi-Automated Abstract Screening for Comparative Effectiveness Reviews    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In this three-year project, we aim to apply state-of-the-art information analysis technologies to assist the production of systematic reviews and meta-analyses that are increasingly being used as a foundation for evidence-based medicine (EBM) and comparative effectiveness reviews. We plan to develop a human guided computerized abstract screening tool to greatly reduce the need to perform a tedious but crucial step of manually screening many thousands of abstracts generated by literature searches in order to retrieve a small fraction potentially relevant for further analysis. This tool will combine proven machine learning techniques with a new open source tool that enables management of the screening process. This new technology will enable investigators to screen abstracts in a small fraction of the time compared to the current manual process. It will reduce the time and cost of producing systematic reviews, provide clear documentation of the process and potentially perform the task more accurately. With the acceptance of EBM and increasing demands for systematic reviews, there is a great need for tools to assist in generating new systematic reviews and in updating them. This need cannot be more pressing. The recent passage of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act and the $1.1 billion allocated for comparative effectiveness research have created an unprecedented need for systematic reviews and opportunities to improve the methodologies and efficiency of their conduct.   We herein propose the development of novel, open-source software to help systematic reviewers better   cope with these torrents of data. The research and development of this tool will be carried out by a highly experienced team of systematic review investigators with computer scientists at Tufts University who began to collaborate last year as a result of Tufts being awarded one of the NIH Clinical Translational Science Awards (CTSA). We will pursue dissemination of the new technology through numerous channels including, but not limited to publication, presentation at conferences, exploring interest in its adoption by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) Evidence-based Practice Center (EPC) Program, Cochrane Collaboration, CTSA network, and other groups conducting systematic reviews, and production of tutorial material. Our aims are:   1. Conduct research to design and implement a semi-automated system using machine learning and   information retrieval methods to identify relevant abstracts in order to improve the accuracy and efficiency of systematic reviews.   2. Develop Abstrackr, an open-source system with a Graphical User Interface (GUI) for screening abstracts, that applies the methods developed in Aim 1 to automatically exclude irrelevant abstracts/articles.   3. Evaluate the performance of the active learning model developed in Aim 1 and the functionality of   Abstrackr developed in Aim 2 through application to a collection of manually screened datasets of   biomedical abstracts that will subsequently be made publicly available for use as a repository to spur   research in the machine learning and information retrieval communities.           Systematic reviewing is a scientific approach to objectively summarizing the effectiveness and safety of existing treatments for diseases, a prerequisite for informed healthcare decision-making. Systematic reviewers must read many thousands of medical study abstracts, the vast majority of which are completely irrelevant to the review at hand. This is hugely laborious and time consuming. We propose to build a computerized system that automatically excludes a large number of the irrelevant abstracts, thereby accelerating the process and expediting the application of the systematic review findings to patient care.",Semi-Automated Abstract Screening for Comparative Effectiveness Reviews,7933715,R01HS018494,[' '],AHRQ,TUFTS MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2010,388462,0.008977148879678017
"Improving Outpatient Medication Lists Using Temporal Reasoning and Clinical Texts    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Accurate and complete medication lists are critical inputs to effective medication reconciliation to prevent medication prescribing and administration errors. Previous research aggregated structured medication data form multiple sources to generate and maintain a reconciled medication list. Medications documented in clinical texts also need to be reconciled. However, most reconciliation methods currently have limited capability to process textual data and temporal information (e.g., dates, duration and status). Our goal is to pilot and test methodologies and applications in the fields of natural language processing (NLP) and temporal reasoning to facilitate the use of electronic clinical texts in order to improve the ""correctness"" and ""completeness"" of medication lists. Clinic notes and free-text ""comments"" fields in medication lists in an ambulatory electronic medical record system will be considered in the study. An NLP system and a temporal reasoning system will be adapted to automatically extract medication and associated temporal information from clinical texts and encode the medications using a controlled terminology. Multiple knowledge bases will be used to develop a mechanism to represent the timing of medication use, detect the changes (e.g., active or inactive), and then to organize medications into appropriate groups (e.g., by ingredient or by status). The feasibility and efficiency of the proposed methods and tools in improving the process of medication   reconciliation will be assessed. Domain experts will serve as judges to assess the success of capturing, coding, and organizing the medications and temporal information and also to evaluate whether our methods are complementary to those currently used for medication management.           Accurate and complete medication information at the point of care is crucial for delivery of high-quality care and prevention of adverse events. Most previous studies aggregated structured medication data from EMR and CPOE (Computerized Physician Order Entry) systems to generate and maintain a reconciled medication list. However, medications in non-structured narrative sources (such as clinic notes and free-text comments) must also be reconciled. Structured data presented in a standard, predictable form can be easily processed by a computer. By contrast, narrative data does not have a well-defined structure, so processing such data is very challenging. Our goal is to pilot and test methodologies and applications in the fields of natural language processing (any system that manipulates text) and temporal reasoning (e.g., identifying the timing of medication use) to facilitate the use of electronic clinical texts in order to improve the ""correctness"" and ""completeness"" of medication lists.

"Annotation, development and evaluation for clinical information extraction    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Much of the clinical information required for accurate clinical research, active decision support, and broad-coverage surveillance is locked in text files in an electronic medical record (EMR). The only feasible way to leverage this information for translational science is to extract and encode the information using natural language processing (NLP). Over the last two decades, several research groups have developed NLP tools for clinical notes, but a major bottleneck preventing progress in clinical NLP is the lack of standard, annotated data sets for training and evaluating NLP applications. Without these standards, individual NLP applications abound without the ability to train different algorithms on standard annotations, share and integrate NLP modules, or compare performance. We propose to develop standards and infrastructure that can enable technology to extract scientific information from textual medical records, and we propose the research as a collaborative effort involving NLP experts across the U.S. To accomplish this goal, we will address three specific aims: Aim 1: Extend existing standards and develop new consensus standards for annotating clinical text in a way that is interoperable, extensible, and usable. Aim 2: Apply existing methods and tools, and develop new methods and tools where necessary for manually annotating a set of publicly available clinical texts in a way that is efficient and accurate. Aim 3: Develop a publicly available toolkit for automatically annotating clinical text and perform a shared evaluation to evaluate the toolkit, using evaluation metrics that are multidimensional and flexible.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In this project, we will develop a publicly available corpus of annotated clinical texts for NLP research.

"Continued Development and Evaluation of caTIES    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose to further develop, test, evaluate and support caTIES - an existing software system for developing networked repositories of sharable de-identified surgical pathology reports. The caTIES system creates a repository of de-identified, structured, and concept-coded clinical reports derived from large corpora of clinical free-text. Documents are automatically coded against a controlled terminology such as the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS), SNOMED-CT, or NCI Metathesaurus. Users construct queries to identify specific kinds of documents and tissue specimens based on the associated clinical report. For example, a researcher studying genetic variation in metastatic breast cancers can identify cases of invasive ductal carcinoma of the breast, followed by metastatic ductal cancer in bone at an interval of three years or greater from the original diagnosis. The caTIES system also supports acquisition and ordering of tissues, using an honest broker model. Through this mechanism, de-identified data and access to tissue can be shared among institutions, enabling multi-center collaborative research. The caTIES system has already been implemented at seven US Cancer Centers, and is being considered for adoption by numerous other institutions including cancer centers, university hospitals and private hospitals. Initial development of caTIES was funded by the Cancer Biomedical Informatics Grid (caBIG). However, interest in the application has far exceeded our expectations and the limitations of caBIG. This grant will allow us to further extend the capabilities of the system by (a) improving the portability of the system and extending the types of documents that can be processed, (b) evaluating the system's NLP performance and usability, (c) building a user community to support this open-source application, and (d) piloting interoperability of caTIES with other enterprise and research systems. This work will preserve and extend a highly novel platform for development of massive repositories of de-identified clinical data that can be used for research within and across institutions.

"HealthMap: Knowledge Management for Emerging Infectious Disease Intelligence    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):      Even as many developed countries strengthen their traditional clinically-based surveillance capacity, a basic level of health information infrastructure is still lacking in many parts of the developing world, including areas that are most vulnerable to emerging health threats. To help fill this gap, electronic news outlets, disease reporting networks, discussion sites, and blogs are proving to be invaluable data sources for a new generation of public health surveillance systems that operate across international borders- almost all major outbreaks investigated by WHO, including SARS, are first identified by these informal online sources. These data sources provide local and timely information about disease outbreaks and related events around the world, including areas relatively invisible to day-to-day global public health efforts due to lack of infrastructure or political suppression of information. However, since this information is dispersed and largely unstructured, there is lack of organization and integration between sources, precluding a global view of all ongoing disease threats. In order to construct such an integrated view of current emerging infections, we deployed an early prototype called Health Map, a freely available multi-stream real-time knowledge management system that aggregates and maps health alerts across numerous key data sources, including WHO alerts, newswires, mailing lists. Leveraging our previous National Library of Medicine funded work in real-time health monitoring; we propose extensive development of this new digital resource to address technological and methodological barriers to achieving a synthesized, comprehensive, and customized view of global health. The principal objective of Health Map development is to provide access to the greatest amount of possibly useful information across the widest variety of geographical areas and disease agents, without overwhelming the user with an excess of information, or obscuring important and urgent elements. We will specifically address the challenge of providing structure to unstructured data while still enabling the astute user to notice the subtle pattern that could be an early indication of a significant outbreak. Development of Health Map will proceed along the four key components of surveillance: (1) data acquisition (evaluation and integration of multiple electronic sources) (2) information characterization (disease and location categorization and severity rating of unstructured data), (3) signal interpretation (multi-stream signal detection, spatiotemporal modeling and risk assessment) and (4) knowledge dissemination (tiered dissemination of global infectious disease alerts and flexible data visualization tools). In each area, we will make critical enhancements to the existing prototype. We plan rigorous evaluation to ensure that Health Map successfully leverages electronic sources for surveillance, communication, and intervention. We will also conduct comprehensive user testing, usability studies, user behavior analysis as part of our effort. Our goal is to make Health Map a vital knowledge resource tailored for both the general public and public health decision-makers.        Although an enormous amount of information about current infectious disease outbreaks is found in Web- accessible information sources, this information is dispersed and not well-organized, making it almost impossible for public health officials and concerned citizens to know about all ongoing emerging disease threats. Through rigorous development of our online HealthMap system, we plan to provide a synthesized, timely and comprehensive view of current global infectious disease outbreaks by acquiring, integrating and disseminating a wide variety of Internet-based information sources.

"Bioconductor: an open computing resource for genomics    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Bioconductor project provides an open resource for the development and distribution of innovative reliable software for computational biology and bioinformatics. The range of available software is broad and rapidly growing as are both the user community and the developer community. The project maintains a web portal for delivering software and documentation to end users as well as an active mailing list. Additional services for developers include a software archive, mailing list and assistance and advice program development and design      We propose an active development strategy designed to meet new challenges while simultaneously providing user and developer support for existing tools and methods. In particular we emphasize a design strategy that accommodates the imperfect, yet evolving nature of biological knowledge and the relatively rapid development of new experimental technologies. Software solutions must be able to rapidly adapt and to facilitate new problems when they arise.      CRITQUE 1:      The Bioconductor project began in 2001. In 2002 it was awarded a BISTI grant for three years 2003-2006). During this time the project has expanded and provided support for a world wide community of researchers. This is a proposal for continued development for Bioconductor, which is a set of statistical programs which are specifically tailored to the computatational biology community. Bioconductor is composed of over 130 R packages that have been contributed by a large number of developers. The software packages range from state of the art statistical methods which typically are used in microarray analysis, to annotation tools, to plotting functions, GUIs, to sequence alignment and data management packages. Contributions to and usage of Bioconductor is growing rapidly and the applicants are requesting support to continue its development as well as general logistical support for software distribution and quality assurance. The proposal includes a research component for Bioconductor which will involve the development of analysis techniques. This will include optimization of the R statistical analyses, statistical processing of Affymetrix data, analysis of SNP data, improved standards, data storage, retreivals from NCBI, sequence management, machine learning, web services and distributed computing.      SCIENTIFIC MERIT   The applicants address many issues that are crucial to the success of a large open source project with multiple contributors. Examples of training, scientific publication, documentation and resource development run throughout the proposal. Many tangible examples were given on the usage of the system by the scientific community.        EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN   This is a description of their management workflow for the project which does a good job of demonstrating the technical excellence brought to the project by this group. 1) Build annotation packages every three months, Integrate changes in annotation source data structure into annotation package building code. 2) Maintain project website, mailing lists, source control archive. Organize web resources for short course and conferences. 3) Improve existing software. 4) Sustain automated nightly builds. Work with developers whose packages fail to pass QA. 5) Resolve cross-platform issues. 6) Review new submissions. Answer questions on the mailing lists. 7) Use software engineering best practices. Develop unit testing strategies. Design appropriate classes and methods for new data types. Refactor existing code for better interoperability and extensibility. 8) Develop and organize training materials and documentation.      Extensive detail on testing, build procedures, interoperability, quality assurance and project management is given elsewhere in the document. They clearly have dealt with many issues necessary for a project of this size. They state that one of the biggest cost items is support of this package to run on multiple platforms. They point out that many contributors focus on a single platform, much of their work is track down cross-platform bugs. This is time well-spent, given the platforms used are in sync with the needs of the greater bioinformatics community.        ORIGINALITY   While a high degree of originality is not a particularly critical element of open source software development project, there are certainly areas in the proposal that are unique. Most importantly, it is safe to say that there is not another project which has this blend of statistical analysis systems specifically tailored to a important research bioinformatics area that can be deployed on a number of different computer environments.      INVESTIGATOR AND CO-INVESTIGATORS   Dr. Gentleman is the founder and leader of the Bioconductor project. Dr. Gentlemen was an Associate Professor in the Department of Biostatistics, Harvard School of Public Health and Department of Biostatistics and Computational Biology, Dana Farber Cancer Institute. In 2004 he became Program Head, Computational Biology, at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle. He has on the order of ten publications relating to Bioconductor or related statistical analysis. He implemented the original versions of the R programming language jointly with another co-founder. He is PI or Investigator of a number of research grants, at least two are directly related to this work. He and other members of the proposal have taught a number of courses and given lectures on Bioconductor, the amount of these courses certainly indicate significant dedication to the project.  A review of the PI and Co-PI activities related to this project are shown on Table 3 on page 42 of the application. The roles and time allocations assigned to each participant appear to be reasonable.  Dr. Gentleman will serve as project leader and will manage the programmers, coordinating the project, and investigating new computational methods and approaches.  Dr. Vincent Carey, as co Principal Investigator has 20% time allocated for the project.  In 2005 he became Associate Professor of Medicine (Biostatistics). Carey is a senior member of the Bioconductor development core. He will improve interoperability to allow Bioconductor reuse of external modules in Java, Perl and other languages as well as strengthen interfaces between high throughput experimental workflows and machine learning tools, and ontology capture.  An administrative assistant will assist Dr. Carey with administrative requirements, including call coordination, manuscript preparation and distribution, scheduling and budget management.  Dr. Rafael Irizarry as co-PI will spend 30% effort on the project.  Dr. Irizarry has four years experience developing methods for microarray data analysis and in the Department of Biostatistics serving as faculty liaison to the Johns Hopkins Medical Institution's Microarray Core.  He will supervize all efforts to support preprocessing on all platforms and support for microarray related consortiums such as the ERCC, GEO, and ArrayExpress.      Programmers will be responsible for the project website, managing email lists, maintaining training materials, upgrading software, refactoring and other code enhancements, managing the svn archive, and Bioconductor releases. They will handle checking all submitted packages, developing unit tests, and simplifying downloads, nightly build procedures, cross-platform issues, data technologies as well as integrating resources found in other languages (e.g. large C libraries of routines for string handling, machine learning and so on). Programmers have familiarity with R packages and systems for database management and for parallel and distributed computing. They will be responsible for managing the annotation data including package building and liaising with organism specific and other data providers.      SIGNIFICANCE   Given the scope of the proposal, and the size of the Bioconductor project in general the request for the above resources is appropriate. There is an excellent mix of grounded project management along with development of newer state of the art techniques that will benifit many members of the bioinformatics community. There is a high probability that funding this project will help to maintain and advance this important community resource.      ENVIRONMENT   The computer infrastructure, and the local departments of the PI and Co-PIs, as well as the work with the larger scientific community are all excellent environments to support this project.      IN SUMMARY   This is a terrific resource.  It is a well managed large open source project with very well crafted QA testing, documentation and training.  Continuation of this is a three year project. Beyond that period, a statement of long term stated goals is needed. The PI should articulate the strategic goals, as well as their research motivation and translate that into an action plan. They should also use that context to describe how they would go about choosing packages that are put into the Bioconductor system; Table 3 only listed the names of the packages made by the applicants, it could have gone further to give the reader more information for choosing packages.  A simple example would have been if they stated in the document: ""Given our assessment of the microarray state of the art, we ultimately aim to overlay annotation data, ontological information, and other forms of meta data onto a statistical framework for expression data."" The resulting research plan would then justify a five year project, but it was not strong enough in this application.       It should be noted that many of the benificiaries to this system are not just users that download the system.  In many cases a centralized informatics service downloads their system and then performs analysis for other members of the campus or the wider www community. While that type of ""success measure"" is hard to assess, more effort in this area in subsequent proposals would be helpful.           n/a",Bioconductor: an open computing resource for genomics,7910730,P41HG004059,[' '],NHGRI,FRED HUTCHINSON CANCER RESEARCH CENTER,P41,2010,1093220,-0.022401988497672838
"Discovering and Applying Knowledge in Clinical Databases    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The ongoing goal of our project, ""Discovering and applying knowledge in clinical databases,"" is to develop and apply methods to exploit electronic medical record data for decision support, with an emphasis on narrative data. Since the inception of our project as an R29 in 1994, we have been developing methods for preparing raw electronic medical record data, applying and evaluating natural language processing, developing data mining techniques including machine learning, and putting the results to use for clinical care and research.       In this competing continuation, we propose to address the temporal information in the electronic medical record and to apply natural language processing and temporal processing to the task of syndromic surveillance in collaboration with the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (NYC DOHMH).       We have begun work on a temporal processing system. It extracts temporal assertions stated in narrative reports, uses the MedLEE natural language processor to parse the non-temporal information, infers implicit temporal assertions based on a knowledge base, and produces the information in the form of a simple temporal constraint satisfaction problem. The latter can be used to answer questions about the time of events and the temporal relation between pairs of events. We propose to complete the system, expand the knowledge base, speed computation, address the uncertainty of temporal assertions, incorporate temporal information from structured data, and evaluate the system.       NYC DOHMH has a mature syndromic surveillance system that watches over almost eight million persons, and it has as-yet unexploited data sources in the form of narrative and structured electronic medical records. We propose to apply natural language processing and our proposed temporal processing to convert the data to a form appropriate for surveillance. We will evaluate the incremental benefit of structured data, narrative data, and temporally processed narrative data.           n/a",Discovering and Applying Knowledge in Clinical Databases,7933293,R01LM006910,"['Address', 'Area', 'Cities', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Event', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'New York City', 'Persons', 'Preparation', 'Process', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Uncertainty', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical care', 'data mining', 'improved', 'knowledge base', 'natural language', 'satisfaction', 'syndromic surveillance']",NLM,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2009,152617,-0.010372977622591508
"Answering Information Needs in Workflow    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Needs for information arise continuously during the course of clinical practice, especially for physicians in training, e.g. when examining a patient or participating in rounds. In most of these situations, it is difficult or impossible for the clinician to immediately access appropriate information resources. Most needs are never adequately articulated or recorded, and consequently are forgotten by the end of the day. Moreover, when clinicians do recall information needs, they don't act on them, due to the significant limitations of current retrieval systems and the exigencies of clinical practice. The specific aims of the proposed project are: 1) to capture information needs in a convenient manner at the moment they occur using different modalities such as text input and voice capture on hand-held devices, 2) to translate high-level information needs into complex search strategies that adapt to user needs and are tuned to the capabilities of resources, and 3) to deliver relevant materials to the clinician in an accessible format and in a timely manner. The project will develop a central hub for addressing the information needs of medical students and residents, to be transmitted electronically as they occur in the field. A unique feature of the project is the use of natural language processing technology to identify context, goals and preferences in clinicians' questions. The major innovation is the generation of complex search strategies that exploit this contextual information, based on studies of human searching experts (reference librarians).              n/a",Answering Information Needs in Workflow,7918614,R01LM008799,"['Address', 'Biological Models', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Face', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Human', 'Information Resources', 'Knowledge', 'Librarians', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medical Errors', 'Medical Students', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Process', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Retrieval', 'Software Tools', 'System', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Textbooks', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Voice', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'forgetting', 'innovation', 'natural language', 'preference', 'speech processing', 'symposium']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,R01,2009,185745,0.00195407884567279
"Extracting Semantic Knowledge from Clinical Reports    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Analyzing and processing free-text medical reports for data mining and clinical data interchange is one of the most challenging problems in medical informatics, yet it is crucial for continued research advances and improvements in clinical care. Natural language processing (NLP) is an important enabling technology, but has been held back because it is difficult to understand human language, since it requires extensive domain knowledge. In Phase I, we developed new statistical and machine learning methods that apply domain specific knowledge to the semantic analysis of free-text radiology reports. The methods enabled the creation of two new prototype applications - a SNOMED CT (Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine--Clinical Terms) coding service called SnomedCoder, and a text mining tool for analyzing a large corpus of medical reports, called DataMiner. In Phase II, we will accomplish the following specific aims: 1) Improve the semantic extraction methods developed in Phase I, 2) Expand the semantic knowledge base and classify at least two million new unique sentences from multiple medical institutions, 3) Provide a SNOMED CT auto coding service (alpha service) to participating Indiana Health Information Exchange hospitals, and 4) Build a commercial version of the DataMiner software, and test its functionality using researchers at the Regenstrief Institute.       These scientific innovations will revolutionize the ability of health care researchers to analyze vast repositories of clinical information currently locked up in electronic medical records, and correlate this data with new biomedical discoveries in proteonomics and genomics. The ability to codify text rapidly will extend the potential for clinical decision support beyond its narrow base of numeric and structured medical data, and enable SNOMED CT to become a useful coding standard. Phase III will offer coding and data mining services to healthcare payers (both private and government), pharmaceuticals, and academic researchers. A key advantage of our approach over other NLP systems is that we attempt to codify all the information in the report and not just a limited subset, and insist on expert validation which provides a high degree of confidence in the accuracy of the coded data.Project Narrative           n/a",Extracting Semantic Knowledge from Clinical Reports,7554153,R44RR024929,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Back', 'Bioinformatics', 'Body of uterus', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Code', 'Collection', 'Computer software', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Effectiveness', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Government', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Indiana', 'Institutes', 'Institution', 'Journals', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medical Informatics', 'Medical Records', 'Methods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Paper', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Phase', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Science', 'Semantics', 'Services', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'System', 'Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Trees', 'Trust', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'United States National Library of Medicine', 'Validation', 'base', 'clinical care', 'computerized', 'data mining', 'health care quality', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'knowledge base', 'novel strategies', 'patient safety', 'prototype', 'repository', 'research and development', 'success', 'text searching', 'tool']",NCRR,"LOGICAL SEMANTICS, INC.",R44,2009,422728,-0.0029338304494155405
"Multi-source clinical Question Answering system    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   / Abstract (Limit: 1 page) Our proposal addresses the following challenge area: 06-LM-101* Intelligent Search Tool for Answering Clinical Questions. Develop new computational approaches to information retrieval that would allow a clinician or clinical researcher to pose a single query that would result in search of multiple data sources to produce a coherent response that highlights key relevant information which may signal new insights for clinical research or patient care. Information that could help a clinician diagnose or manage a health condition, or help a clinical researcher explore the significance of issues that arise during a clinical trial, is scattered across many different types of resources, such as paper or electronic charts, trial protocols, published biomedical articles, or best-practice guidelines for care. Develop artificial intelligence and information retrieval approaches that allow a clinician or researcher confronting complex patient problems to pose a single query that will result in a search that appears to ""understand"" the question, a search that inspects multiple databases and brings findings together into a useful answer. Clinical question answering (cQA) systems focus on the physician needs usually at the point of care, or the investigator in the lab. The questions usually asked either require information highly specific to their patient, e.g. the patient's lab results or previous history, answered by the patient's health record, or a more general type of information usually answered through generally available information sources. QA systems enhance the results of search engines by providing a concise summary of relevant information along with source hits. PubMed (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/) is the most ubiquitous biomedical search engine, however because it is a search engine the information retrieved is based on keyword searches and is not presented in a form for immediate consumption; the user has to drill down into the content of the webpages to find the facts/statements of interest. Moreover, the information that the clinician needs is likely to be of different types, for example a definition of a syndrome in combination with specific actions triggered by a particular diagnosis for a particular patient. Such information resides in different sources - encyclopedic and the EMR - and has to be dynamically accessed and presented to the user in an easily digestible format. We propose to develop a unified platform for clinical QA from multiple sources of clinical and biomedical narrative that implements semantic processing of the questions by fusing two existing technologies - the Mayo clinical Text Analysis and Knowledge Extraction System and the University of Colorado's Question Answering System. The specific research questions we are aiming to answer are: ""How much effort is required to port a general semantic QA system to the clinical domain? How much additional domain-specific training is required? ""What is the accuracy of such a system? Question Answering in the clinical domain is an emerging area of research. The challenges in the field are mainly attributed to the number of components that require domain specific training along with strict system requirements in terms of high precision and recall complemented by an accessible and user-friendly presentation. Our approach to overcome them is to re-use components already in place as part of Mayo clinical Text Analysis and Knowledge Extraction System and the University of Colorado's Question Answering System. Our approach is innovative in bringing together information from encyclopedic sources and the EMR to present it into a unified form to the clinician at the point of care or the investigator in the lab. The technology for that is based on semantic language processing which aims at ""understanding"" the meaning of the question and the narrative. Our proposed system holds the potential to impact quality of healthcare and translational research. Our approach is feasible because it uses content already in the EMR at the Mayo Clinic along with general medical knowledge from multiple readily-available resources. The proposed system will be built off mature and tested components allowing a fast and robust delivery cycle. Our unique integration of technologies together with sophisticated statistical machine learning algorithms applied to rich linguistic knowledge about events, contradictions, semantic structure, and question-types, will allow us to build a system which significantly extends the range of possible question types and responses available to clinicians, and seamlessly fuses these to generate a response. Our proposed work represents a high impact area that has the potential to improve healthcare delivery because it addresses needs that have been well-documented and studied (Ely et al., 2005). We aim to provide a unified multi-source solution for semantic retrieval, access and summarization of relevant information at the point of care or the lab. As such, the proposed cQA has the potential to play a vital and important decision- support role for the physician or the biomedical investigator. (max 2-3 sentences) Clinical question answering (cQA) systems focus on the physician needs usually at the point of care, or the investigator in the lab. The questions usually asked either require information highly specific to their patient, e.g. the patient's lab results or previous history, answered by the patient's health record, or a more general type of information usually answered through generally available information sources.

"Adapting Natural Language Processing Tools for Biosurveillance    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Early detection of disease outbreaks can decrease patient morbidity and mortality and minimize the spread of diseases. Early detection requires accurate classification of patient symptoms early in the course of their illness. One approach is biosurveillance, in which electronic symptom data are captured early in the course of illness, and analyzed for signals that might indicate an outbreak requiring investigation and response by the public health system. Emergency department (ED) patient records are particularly useful for biosurveillance, given their timely, electronic availability. ED data elements used in surveillance systems include the chief complaint (a brief description of the patient's primary symptom(s)), and triage nurses' note (also known as history of present illness).The chief complaint is the most widely used ED data element, because it is recorded electronically by the majority of EDs. One study showed that adding triage notes increased the sensitivity of biosurveillance case detection. The increased sensitivity is because the triage note increases the amount of data available: instead of one symptom in a chief complaint (e.g., fever), triage notes may contain multiple symptoms (e.g., ""fever, cough & shortness of breath for 12 hours""). Surveillance efforts are hampered, however, by the wide variability of free text data in ED chief complaints and triage notes. They often include misspellings, abbreviations, acronyms and other lexical and semantic variants that are difficult to group into symptom clusters (e.g., fever, temp 104, fvr, febrile). Tools are needed to address the lexical and semantic variation in symptom terms in ED data in order to improve biosurveillance. Natural language processing tools have been shown to facilitate concept extraction from more structured clinical data such as radiology reports, but there has been limited application of these techniques to free text ED triage notes. The project team developed the Emergency Medical Text Processor (EMT-P) to preprocess the chief complaint. EMT-P cleans and normalizes brief chief complaint entries and then extracts standardized concepts, but it is not sufficient in its current state to preprocess longer, more complex text passages such as triage notes. This proposed project will further strengthen biosurveillance by adapting EMT-P and other statistical and classical natural language processing tools to develop a system that extracts concepts from triage notes for biosurveillance.           Project Narrative Relevance: The public health system is responsible for monitoring large amounts of timely, electronic health data and needs more sophisticated tools to faciliate detection of, and response to, emerging infectious diseases and potential bioterrorism threats.

"Natural Language Processing for Cancer Research Network Surveillance Studies    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application addresses Broad Challenge Area: (10) Information Technology for Processing Health Care Data and specific Challenge Topic: 10-CA-107 Expand Spectrum of Cancer Surveillance through Informatics Approaches. The proposed project launches a collaborative effort to advance adoption within the HMO Cancer Research Network (CRN) of ""industrial-strength"" natural language processing (NLP) systems useful for mining valuable, research-grade information from unstructured clinical text. Such text is available for processing, now in the electronic medical record (EMR) systems of affiliated CRN health plans. The proposed NLP methods   will create ongoing capacity to tap what has recently been described as ""a treasure trove of historical   unstructured data that provides essential information for the study of disease progression, treatment   effectiveness and long-term outcomes"" (5). The vision of advancing widespread NLP capacity across the CRN, as well as the approach we present here for implementing it, grew out of an in-depth strategic planning effort we completed in December 2008. That effort involved participants from six CRN sites guided by a blue-ribbon panel of NLP experts from three of the nation's leading centers of clinical NLP research: University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, Vanderbilt University, and Mayo Clinic. The vision is to deploy a powerful NLP system locally, manage it with newly hired and trained local NLP technical staff, and conduct NLP-based research projects initiated by local investigators, in consultation with higher-level external NLP experts. Our planning efforts suggest this collaborative model is feasible; we will test the model in the context of the proposed project. An important development in April 2009 yielded what we believe is a potentially transformative opportunity to accelerate adoption of NLP capacity in applied research settings: release of the open-source Clinical Text Analysis and Knowledge Extraction System (cTAKES) software. This software was the result of a collaborative effort between IBM and Mayo Clinic. Built on the same framework Mayo Clinic currently uses to process its repository of over 40 million clinical documents, cTAKES dramatically lowers the cost of adopting a comprehensive and flexible NLP system. Deployment and use of such systems was previously only feasible in institutions with large, academically-oriented biomedical informatics research programs.   Still, other deployment challenges and the need to acquire NLP training for local staff present residual   barriers to adopting comprehensive NLP systems such as cTAKES. In collaboration with five other CRN sites the proposed project mitigates these challenges in two ways: 1) it develops configurable open-source software modules needed to streamline and therefore reduce the cost of deploying cTAKES, and 2) it presents and tests a model for training local staff through hands-on NLP projects overseen by outside NLP expert consultants. The potential impact of this project is evident most clearly in the vast untapped opportunities for text mining represented in CRN-affiliated health plans, where EMR systems have been in place since at least 2005, and whose patients represent 4% of the U.S. population. Clinical text mining offers the potential to provide new or improved data elements for cancer surveillance and other types of research requiring information about patient functional status, medication side-effects, details of therapeutic approaches, and differential information about clinical findings. Another significant impact of this project is its plan to integrate into the cTAKES system   an open-source de-identification tool based on state of the art, best of breed NLP approaches developed by the MITRE Corporation. De-identification of clinical text will make it easier for researchers to get access to clinical text, and will also facilitate multi-site collaborations while protecting patient privacy. Finally, if successful, the NLP algorithm we propose as a proof-of-principle project at Group Health-which will classify sets of patient charts as either containing or not containing a diagnosis of recurrent breast cancer-could dramatically reduce the cost of research in this area; currently all recurrent breast cancer endpoints must be established through costly manual chart abstraction.   Novel aspects of the proposed project include its talented and transdisciplinary research team,   including national experts in NLP, and its resourceful strategy for building the technical resources and ""human capital"" needed to support an ongoing program of applied NLP research. Natural language processing is itself a highly innovative technology; when successfully established in multiple CRN in the future it will represent a watershed moment in the CRN's already impressive history of exploiting data systems to support innovative research. Newly hired staff positions total approximately 2.0 FTE in each project year, most of which we anticipate will be supported by ongoing new research programs after the proposed project concludes. Project narrative The proposed project develops new measurement technologies for extracting information about disease processes and treatment, currently documented only in clinical text, based on natural language processing approaches. Because these methods are generic they will potentially contribute to public health by advancing research in a wide variety of areas. The ""proof of principle"" algorithm developed in the project to identify recurrent breast cancer diagnoses will advance epidemiologic and clinical research pertaining to the 2.5 million women currently living with breast cancer.           Project narrative The proposed project develops new measurement technologies for extracting information about disease processes and treatment, currently documented only in clinical text, based on natural language processing approaches.

"Assisting Systematic Review Preparation Using Automated Document Classification    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       The work proposed in this new investigator initiated project studies the hypothesis that machine learning-based text classification techniques can add significant efficiencies to the process of updating systematic reviews (SRs). Because new information constantly becomes available, medicine is constantly changing, and SRs must undergo periodic updates in order to correctly represent the best available medical knowledge at a given time.       To support studying this hypothesis, the work proposed here will undertake four specific aims:   1. Refinement and further development of text classification algorithms optimized for use in classifying   literature for the update of systematic reviews on a variety of therapeutic domains. Comparative analysis using several different machine learning techniques and strategies will be studied, as well as various means of representing the journal articles as feature vectors input to the process.   2. Identification and evaluation of systematic review expert preferences and trade offs between high recall and high precision classification systems. There are several opportunities for including this technology in the process of creating SRs. Each of these applications has separate and unique precision and recall tradeoff thresholds that will be studied based on the benefit to systematic reviews.   3. Prospective evaluation of text classification algorithms. We will verify that our approach performs as   expected on future data.   4. Development of comprehensive gold standard test and training sets to motivate and evaluate the   proposed and future work in this area.      The long term relevance of this research to public health is that automated document classification will   enable more efficient use of expert resources to create systematic reviews. This will increase both the   number and quality of reviews for a given level of public support. Since up-to-date systematic reviews are essential for establishing widespread high quality practice standards and guidelines, the overall public health will benefit from this work.          n/a",Assisting Systematic Review Preparation Using Automated Document Classification,7664538,R01LM009501,"['Algorithms', 'Area', 'Classification', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Evaluation', 'Future', 'Gold', 'Guidelines', 'Human', 'Knowledge', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Paper', 'Performance', 'Preparation', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Training', 'Triage', 'Update', 'Work', 'base', 'comparative', 'expectation', 'journal article', 'preference', 'programs', 'prospective', 'systematic review', 'text searching', 'vector']",NLM,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,R01,2009,318898,0.010163507450679163
"Investigating the generalizability of natural language processing of EMR data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       The electronic medical record (EMR) offers impressive opportunities for increasing care quality, but challenges stand in the way of realizing this vision. For example, coded EMR data readily available for analysis typically are incomplete (due to the prevalence of free-text clinical notes in EMR implementations), and data from different EMRs are often incommensurate due to differences in standard vocabularies and system implementations. While informatics research has shown the feasibility of automatically coding specific aspects of clinical text using Natural Language Processing (NLP), challenges remain for translating these informatics developments into large-scale care quality assessments. To date, successful NLP solutions for automated quality assessment have tended to be applications that are specific to (a) the target problem or clinical focus, (b) the EMR data system, and (c) the person or team that implements the NLP solution. In this study, we propose to begin addressing the problem of implementation team specificity by developing, evaluating, and making freely available a generalizable NLP development tool suite. The tools will enable widespread adoption of NLP systems to extract and code data from free text clinical notes. The Knowledge Editing Toolkit will simplify development of problem-specific knowledge by helping the user define the rules, concepts, and terms that constitute a domain-specific knowledge module, thus allowing any informaticist to develop an NLP application. The NLP Application Validation Toolkit will allow rapid testing and evaluation of the application against a gold standard of independently-coded test records from any EMR. To evaluate the effects of the toolkits on NLP generalizability, we will have three clinical informaticists each build two NLP applications (for a total of six distinct applications). One of their applications will identify a constellation of common clinical signs or symptoms (e.g., ""persistent cough"") that are relatively discrete concepts using simple language terms for many different clinical purposes. Their second application will assess behavioral counseling (e.g., ""alcohol counseling""), which uses complex language constructs for dedicated clinical purposes. We will describe and evaluate the accuracy of the solutions against independently coded test sets of medical records. We will quantify and compare the difficulty of creating these solutions as measured by the time, number of iterations required to build the applications, and the number of concepts and rules employed, as well as analyze variability in content and accuracy of the solutions created. In addition, we will use qualitative techniques to assess the ease of using the development tools; the difficulty in learning the tools; and specific types of problems, limitations, and bugs encountered. Such an NLP development tool suite has the potential to allow simple, elegant, and reliably good NLP solutions regardless of the clinical problem domain or the person developing the solution.           n/a",Investigating the generalizability of natural language processing of EMR data,7691692,R21LM009728,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Alcohols', 'Architecture', 'Behavioral', 'Caring', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Computer Systems Development', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Coughing', 'Counseling', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Event', 'Gold', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Human Resources', 'Informatics', 'Information Systems', 'Information Technology', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical Records', 'Modification', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Proliferating', 'Quality of Care', 'Records', 'Research', 'Running', 'Solutions', 'Source', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Translating', 'United States National Academy of Sciences', 'Ursidae Family', 'Validation', 'Vision', 'Vocabulary', 'care delivery', 'cost', 'design', 'evaluation/testing', 'experience', 'health care quality', 'stem', 'success', 'tool', 'tool development', 'web site']",NLM,KAISER FOUNDATION RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R21,2009,177750,0.007923909326098662

"ADAPTIVE PERSONALIZED INFORMATION MANAGEMENT FOR BIOLOGISTS    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  We propose development of an adaptive, personalizable, information management tool, which can be configured and trained by an individual biologist to most effectively exploit the particular knowledge bases and document collections that are most useful for him or her. The proposed tool represents a novel approach for monitoring scientific progress in biology, which has become a formidable task. We will exploit recent advances in machine learning and database systems to develop a useful approximation to a personalized biological knowledge base f.i.i.e., single information resource that would include all the knowledge sources on which a biologist relies. More specifically, we propose a scheme for loosely integrating both structured information and unstructured text, and then querying the integrated information using easily-formulated similarity queries. The system will also learn from every episode in which a biologist seeks information. The research team on this project includes a computer scientist and two biologists. The proposed work will make systems for monitoring scientific progress in biology more effective.

"HERMES - Help physicians to Extract and aRticulate Multimedia information from li    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Physicians have many questions when seeing patients. Primary care physicians are reported to generate between 0.7 and 18.5 questions for every 10 patient visits. The published medical literature is an important resource helping physicians to access up-to-date clinical information and thereby to enhance the quality of patient care. For example, the case study in the above example (i.e., diagnostic procedures and treatment for cellulites) was published in a ""Clinical Practice"" article in the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM). Although PubMed is frequently used by physicians in large hospitals, it does not return answers to specific questions. Frequently, PubMed returns a large number of articles in response to a specific user query. Physicians have limited time for browsing the articles retrieved; it has been found that physicians spend on average two minutes or less seeking an answer to a question, and that if a search takes longer it is likely to be abandoned. An evaluation study has shown that it takes an average of more than 30 minutes for a healthcare provider to search for answer from PubMed, which makes ""information seeking ... practical only `after hours' and not in the clinical setting."" It has been concluded that a lack of time is the most common obstacle resulting in many unanswered medical questions.       The importance of answering physicians' questions at the point of patient care has been widely recognized by the medical community. Many medical databases (e.g., UpToDate and Thomson MICROMEDEX) provide summaries to answer important medical questions related to patient care. However, most of the summaries are written by medical experts who manually review the literature information. The databases are limited in their scope and timeliness.       We hypothesize that we can develop medical language processing (MLP) approaches to build a fully automated system HERMES - Help physicians to Extract and aRticulate Multimedia information from literature to answer their ad-hoc medical quEstionS. HERMES will automatically retrieve, extract, analyze, and integrate text, image, and video from the literature and formulate them as answers to ad-hoc medical questions posed by physicians. Our preliminary results show that even a limited HERMES working system outperformed other information retrieval systems and can generate answers within a timeframe necessary to meet the demands of physicians. HERMES promise to assist physicians for practicing evidence-based medicine (EBM), the medical practice that involves the explicit use of current best evidence, i.e., high-quality patient-centered clinical research reported in the primary medical literature.       Our specific aims are:       1) Identify information needs from ad-hoc medical questions. We will incorporate rich semantic, statistical, and machine learning approaches to map ad-hoc medical questions to their component question types automatically.

"Development of a Research-Ready Pregnancy and Newborn Biobank in California    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Development of a Research-Ready Pregnancy and Newborn Biobank in California Population-based biobanks are a critical resource for identifying disease mechanisms and developing screening tests for biomarkers associated with certain disorders. The California Department of Public Health has been banking newborn specimens statewide since 1982 (N~14 million) and maternal prenatal specimens for a portion of the state since 2000 (N~1 million), creating one of the largest, if not the largest single biological specimen banks with linked data in the world. With the fast pace of new knowledge in genetics and laboratory methods, the demand for specimens and data from researchers around the world now far surpasses the Department's ability to fill them. The goal of this infrastructure development project is to create an efficient, high throughput, low cost newborn screening and prenatal/maternal screening specimen biobank and linked data base that could be used by large numbers of researchers around the world for a wide range of studies through the following aims: (1) establishment of highly efficient protocols and procurement and integration of automated systems for pulling and processing specimens; (2) development of an integrated specimen tracking system into the Department's existing web-based Screening Information System; (3) development of a computerized system to track application requests for specimens and data; and (4) development of a linked screening program-vital records database that is organized into a life course, client based system. These aims will be accomplished through expansion of the Department's award-winning Screening Integration System to include web-based tracking of specimens and research requests, and use of an innovative machine-learning record matching application for high-performance linkages. After the 2 year grant period is completed, the California Research Ready Biospecimen Bank will be able to provide researchers with valuable biological specimens in a timely, cost-effective manner, thereby enabling a dramatic expansion of epidemiological research nationwide. The continuity of the system will be ensured by codifying human subjects-sensitive policies and procedures into Departmental regulations and by charging researchers modest fees for specimens, data and other research services.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Development of a research-ready pregnancy and newborn biobank in California This proposal funds infrastructure development to create a research-ready, efficient, high- throughput, and low-cost prenatal and newborn biobank in California. Specimens spanning 28 years will be linked to existing records of fetal death, live birth, death, prenatal and newborn screening to develop a rich, client-based, cross-generational, life- course database. Specimens and linked data from the California Research-Ready Biospecimen Bank will be made available to researchers in the U.S. and around the world to enable a broad and expanded array of studies.           Program Narrative Development of a research-ready pregnancy and newborn biobank in California This proposal funds infrastructure development to create a research-ready, efficient, high- throughput, and low-cost prenatal and newborn biobank in California.

"Improving Health Outcomes through Computer Generation of Reader-Appropriate Texts    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Many studies have shown that the readability of the health information provided to consumers does not match their general reading levels (Rudd, Moeykens et al. 2000). Even with the efforts of healthcare providers and writers to make materials more readable, today most patient-oriented Web sites, pamphlets, drug-labels, and discharge instructions still require the consumer to have a tenth grade reading level or higher (Nielsen-Bohlman, Panzer et al. 2004). Not infrequently, however, consumer reading levels are as low as fourth grade. To address this problem, we propose developing a computer-based method for providing texts of appropriate readability to a consumer. Recent progress in statistical natural language processing techniques (Barzilay 2003; Barzilay and Elhadad 2003; Elhadad, McKeown et al. 2005) lead us to believe that computer programs can be developed to dramatically increase the range and amount of readable content available to consumers. It may also help improve comprehension, self management and eventually clinical outcome. The general goal of this project is to provide consumers with readable content through the automated translation of content from difficult to understand to easy to understand. The specific aims are 1. To develop a computerized instrument for assessing the readability of health texts. We will enhance existing readability instruments (Zakaluk and Samuels March 1, 1988) by including measurements of health term difficulty, text cohesion, and content organization and layout. 2. To develop a ""Plain English"" tool for translating complex health texts into new versions at targeted readability levels with no critical information loss, using statistical natural language processing techniques. 3. To conduct an evaluation study to verify that providing content with appropriate readability has a positive impact on reader comprehension. We will use as a test bed for our system a general internal medicine clinic and its diabetes patients. We will provide self-care materials to these patients. Relevance to public health: The proposed development of a readability assessment instrument and ""Plain English"" tool will help translating complex health materials into reader-appropriate texts. It has the potential of making the vast amount of available information in the health domain more accessible to the lay public.              n/a",Improving Health Outcomes through Computer Generation of Reader-Appropriate Texts,7672256,R01DK075837,"['Address', 'Beds', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Comprehension', 'Computers', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Drug Labeling', 'Evaluation Studies', 'Exercise', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Health education', 'Home environment', 'Instruction', 'Internal Medicine', 'Lead', 'Measurement', 'Metabolic Control', 'Methods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nursing Faculty', 'Outcome', 'Pamphlets', 'Patients', 'Public Health', 'Readability', 'Reader', 'Reading', 'Self Care', 'Self Management', 'Smog', 'Software Tools', 'System', 'Teaching Materials', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Weight maintenance regimen', 'Work', 'Writing', 'base', 'cohesion', 'computer program', 'computerized', 'fourth grade', 'improved', 'instrument', 'literacy', 'ninth grade', 'patient oriented', 'prevent', 'programs', 'tenth grade', 'tool', 'web site']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,R01,2009,398216,-0.006416188012984192
"Integrated discovery and hypothesis testing of new associations in rare diseases    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Rare diseases are studied in isolated laboratories, forgotten by main stream pharmacological companies, and considered almost academic curiosities. Finding variables that correlate/cause rare diseases (a condition is rare when it affects less than 1 person per 2,000) is a difficult task. The low number of cases and the sparse nature of the reports make it difficult to obtain significant/meaningful statistical results. There are two ways to avoid these problems. The first is to integrate reported cases and associations to generate enough statistical power. The second way is to have an independent data set, big enough to cover rare cases. Each of the two methods has intrinsic problems. For instance, the search in the literature puts together different studies, each of them with their own biases in population, methodology and objectives. On the other hand, blind searches for associations in big databases introduce a large number of false positives due to multiple hypothesis testing.       These problems could be avoided by developing innovative methods that allow the integration of information and methodologies in the literature and longitudinal databases. To achieve this goal, we propose a team that combines expertise in natural language processing systems (Carol Friedman), electronic health records (George Hripcsak), statistics in combined databases and computational virology (Raul Rabadan). This team will generate an interdisciplinary approach to mine and integrate the literature and the dataset collected at Columbia/New York Presbyterian hospital. Identifying unusual correlations in rare diseases is the first step to understanding the origin of the diseases and to finding a cure for them. We hypothesize that we will develop effective methods aimed at improving our understanding of rare diseases by combining hypothesis testing and hypothesis discovery, and by integrating information from the literature and from the patient record to obtain increased statistical power. This will involve using natural language processing and statistical methods to mine both the literature and the electronic health record (EHR).           Project Narrative We will test reported associations in rare diseases and discover new ones by integrating information from the literature and from Electronic Health Records in hospitals.",Integrated discovery and hypothesis testing of new associations in rare diseases,7727710,R01LM010140,"['Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome', 'Affect', 'Case Study', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Computer software', 'Curiosities', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Electronics', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Evaluation', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Hospitals', 'Immunocompromised Host', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Inequality', 'Informatics', 'Information Theory', 'Kaposi Sarcoma', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Laboratories', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Liver diseases', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'New York', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Population', 'Presbyterian Church', 'Process', 'PubMed', 'Rare Diseases', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Source', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stratification', 'Stream', 'Stress', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Transplantation', 'Unified Medical Language System', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'United States National Library of Medicine', 'Virus', 'Work', 'Writing', 'abstracting', 'base', 'blind', 'data mining', 'forgetting', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'longitudinal database', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'repository', 'research study', 'statistics', 'text searching', 'tool', 'virology', 'web site']",NLM,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2009,533007,-0.02070971503089946
"Bridging the Semantic Gap Between Research Eligibility Criteria and Clinical Data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Our long-term objective is to enlarge the scope and efficiency of clinical research through enhanced use of clinical data to support clinical research decisions. This proposal aims to improve the use of electronic health records (EHR) to automate clinical trials eligibility screening by developing a new semantic alignment framework. Clinical trials research is an important step for translating breakthroughs in basic biomedical sciences into knowledge that will benefit clinical practice and human health. However, a significant obstacle is identifying eligible participants. Eighty-six percent of all clinical trials are delayed in patient recruitment for from one to six months and 13% are delayed by more than six months. Enrollment delay is expensive. In a recent large, multi-center trial, about 86.8 staff hours and more than $1000 was spent to enroll each participant. Ineffective enrollment also produces a big social cost in that up to 60% of patients can miss being identified. The broad deployment of EHR systems has created unprecedented opportunities to solve the problem because EHR systems contain a rich source of information about potential participants. However, it is often a knowledge-intensive, time-consuming, and inefficient manual procedure to match eligibility criteria such as ""renal in- sufficiency"" to clinical data such as ""serum creatinine = 1.0 mg/dl for an 80-year old white female patient."" This enduring challenge is partly caused by the disconnection between abstract and ambiguous eligibility criteria and highly specific clinical data manifestations; we call this a semantic gap. Despite earlier work on computer-based clinical guidelines and protocols, limited effort has been devoted to support automatic matching between concepts and their manifestations in patient phenotypes such as signs and symptoms.       We hypothesize that we can characterize the semantic gap and design a knowledge-based, natural-language processing assisted semantic alignment framework to bridge the semantic gap. Therefore, our specific aims are: (1) to investigate the semantic gap between clinical trials eligibility criteria and clinical data; (2) to design a concept-based, computable knowledge representation for eligibility criteria; (3) to design a semantic alignment framework linking an eligibility criteria knowledge base and a clinical data warehouse to generate semantic queries for eligibility identification; and (4) to evaluate the utility of the semantic alignment framework.       This research is novel and unique in that (1) there are no prior studies about the semantic gap between eligibility criteria and clinical data; and (2) for the first time, we design a semantic alignment framework to automatically match eligibility criteria to clinical data. The research team comprising expertise from the Department of Biomedical Informatics at Columbia University and the Division of General Medicine from UCSF are uniquely positioned to carry out this research, given the experience of the team (medical knowledge representation, natural language processing, controlled clinical terminology, ontology-based semantic reasoning, data mining, statistics, health data organization, semantic harmonization, and clinical trials), the availability of a repository of 13 years of data on 2 million patients, and the availability of a natural language processor called MedLEE to convert millions of narrative reports into richly coded clinical data.            This research has the potential to improve process efficiency and accuracy, as well as to reduce cost and required human skills for clinical trials eligibility screening. The ultimate goal is to accelerate scientific discovery of more effective treatments for illness.",Bridging the Semantic Gap Between Research Eligibility Criteria and Clinical Data,7653874,R01LM009886,"['Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'Creatinine', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Drug Formulations', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Eligibility Determination', 'Enrollment', 'Female', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Failure', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Manuals', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Ontology', 'Participant', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Population Surveillance', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Problem Solving', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Science', 'Screening procedure', 'Semantics', 'Serum', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Source', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Terminology', 'Text', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Universities', 'Work', 'abstracting', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinical practice', 'cost', 'data mining', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'eligible participant', 'experience', 'improved', 'information organization', 'knowledge base', 'natural language', 'novel', 'repository', 'skills', 'social', 'statistics']",NLM,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2009,357875,-0.013784890449165465
"Bioconductor: an open computing resource for genomics    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Bioconductor project provides an open resource for the development and distribution of innovative reliable software for computational biology and bioinformatics. The range of available software is broad and rapidly growing as are both the user community and the developer community. The project maintains a web portal for delivering software and documentation to end users as well as an active mailing list. Additional services for developers include a software archive, mailing list and assistance and advice program development and design      We propose an active development strategy designed to meet new challenges while simultaneously providing user and developer support for existing tools and methods. In particular we emphasize a design strategy that accommodates the imperfect, yet evolving nature of biological knowledge and the relatively rapid development of new experimental technologies. Software solutions must be able to rapidly adapt and to facilitate new problems when they arise.      CRITQUE 1:      The Bioconductor project began in 2001. In 2002 it was awarded a BISTI grant for three years 2003-2006). During this time the project has expanded and provided support for a world wide community of researchers. This is a proposal for continued development for Bioconductor, which is a set of statistical programs which are specifically tailored to the computatational biology community. Bioconductor is composed of over 130 R packages that have been contributed by a large number of developers. The software packages range from state of the art statistical methods which typically are used in microarray analysis, to annotation tools, to plotting functions, GUIs, to sequence alignment and data management packages. Contributions to and usage of Bioconductor is growing rapidly and the applicants are requesting support to continue its development as well as general logistical support for software distribution and quality assurance. The proposal includes a research component for Bioconductor which will involve the development of analysis techniques. This will include optimization of the R statistical analyses, statistical processing of Affymetrix data, analysis of SNP data, improved standards, data storage, retreivals from NCBI, sequence management, machine learning, web services and distributed computing.      SCIENTIFIC MERIT   The applicants address many issues that are crucial to the success of a large open source project with multiple contributors. Examples of training, scientific publication, documentation and resource development run throughout the proposal. Many tangible examples were given on the usage of the system by the scientific community.        EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN   This is a description of their management workflow for the project which does a good job of demonstrating the technical excellence brought to the project by this group. 1) Build annotation packages every three months, Integrate changes in annotation source data structure into annotation package building code. 2) Maintain project website, mailing lists, source control archive. Organize web resources for short course and conferences. 3) Improve existing software. 4) Sustain automated nightly builds. Work with developers whose packages fail to pass QA. 5) Resolve cross-platform issues. 6) Review new submissions. Answer questions on the mailing lists. 7) Use software engineering best practices. Develop unit testing strategies. Design appropriate classes and methods for new data types. Refactor existing code for better interoperability and extensibility. 8) Develop and organize training materials and documentation.      Extensive detail on testing, build procedures, interoperability, quality assurance and project management is given elsewhere in the document. They clearly have dealt with many issues necessary for a project of this size. They state that one of the biggest cost items is support of this package to run on multiple platforms. They point out that many contributors focus on a single platform, much of their work is track down cross-platform bugs. This is time well-spent, given the platforms used are in sync with the needs of the greater bioinformatics community.        ORIGINALITY   While a high degree of originality is not a particularly critical element of open source software development project, there are certainly areas in the proposal that are unique. Most importantly, it is safe to say that there is not another project which has this blend of statistical analysis systems specifically tailored to a important research bioinformatics area that can be deployed on a number of different computer environments.      INVESTIGATOR AND CO-INVESTIGATORS   Dr. Gentleman is the founder and leader of the Bioconductor project. Dr. Gentlemen was an Associate Professor in the Department of Biostatistics, Harvard School of Public Health and Department of Biostatistics and Computational Biology, Dana Farber Cancer Institute. In 2004 he became Program Head, Computational Biology, at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle. He has on the order of ten publications relating to Bioconductor or related statistical analysis. He implemented the original versions of the R programming language jointly with another co-founder. He is PI or Investigator of a number of research grants, at least two are directly related to this work. He and other members of the proposal have taught a number of courses and given lectures on Bioconductor, the amount of these courses certainly indicate significant dedication to the project.  A review of the PI and Co-PI activities related to this project are shown on Table 3 on page 42 of the application. The roles and time allocations assigned to each participant appear to be reasonable.  Dr. Gentleman will serve as project leader and will manage the programmers, coordinating the project, and investigating new computational methods and approaches.  Dr. Vincent Carey, as co Principal Investigator has 20% time allocated for the project.  In 2005 he became Associate Professor of Medicine (Biostatistics). Carey is a senior member of the Bioconductor development core. He will improve interoperability to allow Bioconductor reuse of external modules in Java, Perl and other languages as well as strengthen interfaces between high throughput experimental workflows and machine learning tools, and ontology capture.  An administrative assistant will assist Dr. Carey with administrative requirements, including call coordination, manuscript preparation and distribution, scheduling and budget management.  Dr. Rafael Irizarry as co-PI will spend 30% effort on the project.  Dr. Irizarry has four years experience developing methods for microarray data analysis and in the Department of Biostatistics serving as faculty liaison to the Johns Hopkins Medical Institution's Microarray Core.  He will supervize all efforts to support preprocessing on all platforms and support for microarray related consortiums such as the ERCC, GEO, and ArrayExpress.      Programmers will be responsible for the project website, managing email lists, maintaining training materials, upgrading software, refactoring and other code enhancements, managing the svn archive, and Bioconductor releases. They will handle checking all submitted packages, developing unit tests, and simplifying downloads, nightly build procedures, cross-platform issues, data technologies as well as integrating resources found in other languages (e.g. large C libraries of routines for string handling, machine learning and so on). Programmers have familiarity with R packages and systems for database management and for parallel and distributed computing. They will be responsible for managing the annotation data including package building and liaising with organism specific and other data providers.      SIGNIFICANCE   Given the scope of the proposal, and the size of the Bioconductor project in general the request for the above resources is appropriate. There is an excellent mix of grounded project management along with development of newer state of the art techniques that will benifit many members of the bioinformatics community. There is a high probability that funding this project will help to maintain and advance this important community resource.      ENVIRONMENT   The computer infrastructure, and the local departments of the PI and Co-PIs, as well as the work with the larger scientific community are all excellent environments to support this project.      IN SUMMARY   This is a terrific resource.

"Bioconductor: an open computing resource for genomics    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Bioconductor project provides an open resource for the development and distribution of innovative reliable software for computational biology and bioinformatics. The range of available software is broad and rapidly growing as are both the user community and the developer community. The project maintains a web portal for delivering software and documentation to end users as well as an active mailing list. Additional services for developers include a software archive, mailing list and assistance and advice program development and design      We propose an active development strategy designed to meet new challenges while simultaneously providing user and developer support for existing tools and methods. In particular we emphasize a design strategy that accommodates the imperfect, yet evolving nature of biological knowledge and the relatively rapid development of new experimental technologies. Software solutions must be able to rapidly adapt and to facilitate new problems when they arise.      CRITQUE 1:      The Bioconductor project began in 2001. In 2002 it was awarded a BISTI grant for three years 2003-2006). During this time the project has expanded and provided support for a world wide community of researchers. This is a proposal for continued development for Bioconductor, which is a set of statistical programs which are specifically tailored to the computatational biology community. Bioconductor is composed of over 130 R packages that have been contributed by a large number of developers. The software packages range from state of the art statistical methods which typically are used in microarray analysis, to annotation tools, to plotting functions, GUIs, to sequence alignment and data management packages. Contributions to and usage of Bioconductor is growing rapidly and the applicants are requesting support to continue its development as well as general logistical support for software distribution and quality assurance. The proposal includes a research component for Bioconductor which will involve the development of analysis techniques. This will include optimization of the R statistical analyses, statistical processing of Affymetrix data, analysis of SNP data, improved standards, data storage, retreivals from NCBI, sequence management, machine learning, web services and distributed computing.      SCIENTIFIC MERIT   The applicants address many issues that are crucial to the success of a large open source project with multiple contributors. Examples of training, scientific publication, documentation and resource development run throughout the proposal. Many tangible examples were given on the usage of the system by the scientific community.        EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN   This is a description of their management workflow for the project which does a good job of demonstrating the technical excellence brought to the project by this group. 1) Build annotation packages every three months, Integrate changes in annotation source data structure into annotation package building code. 2) Maintain project website, mailing lists, source control archive. Organize web resources for short course and conferences. 3) Improve existing software. 4) Sustain automated nightly builds. Work with developers whose packages fail to pass QA. 5) Resolve cross-platform issues. 6) Review new submissions. Answer questions on the mailing lists. 7) Use software engineering best practices. Develop unit testing strategies. Design appropriate classes and methods for new data types. Refactor existing code for better interoperability and extensibility. 8) Develop and organize training materials and documentation.      Extensive detail on testing, build procedures, interoperability, quality assurance and project management is given elsewhere in the document. They clearly have dealt with many issues necessary for a project of this size. They state that one of the biggest cost items is support of this package to run on multiple platforms. They point out that many contributors focus on a single platform, much of their work is track down cross-platform bugs. This is time well-spent, given the platforms used are in sync with the needs of the greater bioinformatics community.        ORIGINALITY   While a high degree of originality is not a particularly critical element of open source software development project, there are certainly areas in the proposal that are unique. Most importantly, it is safe to say that there is not another project which has this blend of statistical analysis systems specifically tailored to a important research bioinformatics area that can be deployed on a number of different computer environments.      INVESTIGATOR AND CO-INVESTIGATORS   Dr. Gentleman is the founder and leader of the Bioconductor project. Dr. Gentlemen was an Associate Professor in the Department of Biostatistics, Harvard School of Public Health and Department of Biostatistics and Computational Biology, Dana Farber Cancer Institute. In 2004 he became Program Head, Computational Biology, at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle. He has on the order of ten publications relating to Bioconductor or related statistical analysis. He implemented the original versions of the R programming language jointly with another co-founder. He is PI or Investigator of a number of research grants, at least two are directly related to this work. He and other members of the proposal have taught a number of courses and given lectures on Bioconductor, the amount of these courses certainly indicate significant dedication to the project.  A review of the PI and Co-PI activities related to this project are shown on Table 3 on page 42 of the application. The roles and time allocations assigned to each participant appear to be reasonable.  Dr. Gentleman will serve as project leader and will manage the programmers, coordinating the project, and investigating new computational methods and approaches.  Dr. Vincent Carey, as co Principal Investigator has 20% time allocated for the project.  In 2005 he became Associate Professor of Medicine (Biostatistics). Carey is a senior member of the Bioconductor development core. He will improve interoperability to allow Bioconductor reuse of external modules in Java, Perl and other languages as well as strengthen interfaces between high throughput experimental workflows and machine learning tools, and ontology capture.  An administrative assistant will assist Dr. Carey with administrative requirements, including call coordination, manuscript preparation and distribution, scheduling and budget management.  Dr. Rafael Irizarry as co-PI will spend 30% effort on the project.  Dr. Irizarry has four years experience developing methods for microarray data analysis and in the Department of Biostatistics serving as faculty liaison to the Johns Hopkins Medical Institution's Microarray Core.  He will supervize all efforts to support preprocessing on all platforms and support for microarray related consortiums such as the ERCC, GEO, and ArrayExpress.      Programmers will be responsible for the project website, managing email lists, maintaining training materials, upgrading software, refactoring and other code enhancements, managing the svn archive, and Bioconductor releases. They will handle checking all submitted packages, developing unit tests, and simplifying downloads, nightly build procedures, cross-platform issues, data technologies as well as integrating resources found in other languages (e.g. large C libraries of routines for string handling, machine learning and so on). Programmers have familiarity with R packages and systems for database management and for parallel and distributed computing. They will be responsible for managing the annotation data including package building and liaising with organism specific and other data providers.      SIGNIFICANCE   Given the scope of the proposal, and the size of the Bioconductor project in general the request for the above resources is appropriate. There is an excellent mix of grounded project management along with development of newer state of the art techniques that will benifit many members of the bioinformatics community. There is a high probability that funding this project will help to maintain and advance this important community resource.      ENVIRONMENT   The computer infrastructure, and the local departments of the PI and Co-PIs, as well as the work with the larger scientific community are all excellent environments to support this project.      IN SUMMARY   This is a terrific resource.  It is a well managed large open source project with very well crafted QA testing, documentation and training.  Continuation of this is a three year project. Beyond that period, a statement of long term stated goals is needed. The PI should articulate the strategic goals, as well as their research motivation and translate that into an action plan.

"New Resources for e-Patients    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): ""New Resources for e-Patients"" addresses the unmet medical needs of consumers who search for health and healthcare information online, currently a population of more than 160 million people in the U.S. It will fill gaps and address deficiencies in currently available online health information resources. It will maximize the value of public domain health information from U.S. Government sources. Textual consumer health information will be collected from NIH, FDA and other government sources. This information will be subjected to automated topic analysis and classification using methods of natural language processing and statistical text-mining to discover and extract topics on i) diseases and conditions; ii) treatments, benefits and risks; and iii) genomic risks and responses. These topics will be integrated and mapped to the most frequent health topics of interest to consumers. Personally-controlled electronic health records and personal genotypes will be studied for their potential contributions to personalized medicine for e-patients. Phase I of this project will achieve proof-of-principle and develop an advanced prototype as a foundation for construction of a new web-based resource in Phase II.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project addresses the unmet medical needs of consumers who search for health and healthcare information online, currently a population of more than 160 million people in the U.S. It will fill gaps and address deficiencies in current online health information resources and also target new opportunities in genomic and personalized medicine. In the process we will create consumer-friendly, automated systems that make online information search and retrieval more efficient more efficient and maximize the value of public domain health information from U.S. Government sources.

"Improving Public Health Grey Literature Access for the Public Health Workforce    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term objective of the proposed project is to provide the public health (PH) workforce with improved access to high quality, relevant PH grey literature reports in order to positively impact the planning, conducting, and evaluating of PH interventions. The project will consist of two components: 1) continuation of user-focused technical system development, and 2) deployment and evaluation of this system's impact on the tasks of the PH workforce in county health departments.      The system will automatically harvest web-based grey literature reports (utilizing rules trained on input from PH professionals) and then produce rich summaries of PH grey literature reports using the model of essential elements of PH intervention reports validated by PH specialists (Turner et al, In Press). After developing a user interface that capitalizes on both natural language querying and the display of search results in a structured, model-based summary, the system will be introduced into several county health departments and evaluated to determine its impact on information flows and uses.      The project will include intrinsic evaluations of: 1) the appropriateness of the grey literature reports harvested by the system; 2) the quality and sufficiency of summaries representing the full reports based on the PH intervention model and; 3) retrieval results for users' queries using metrics of precision and recall. Extrinsic evaluation will be done in PH departments participating in the New York Academy of Medicine's ongoing study of the relationship between information and effectiveness. The research will provide baseline measures. We will evaluate: 1) the ease and frequency of use, perceptions of currency, accuracy, and completeness of retrieved reports by county PH personnel, and; 2) impact of the system's usage on information flows and uses based on internal outcome measures within the county health departments.      The work proposed here shares both the missions of public health and the National Library of Medicine   through the design of an information system that exploits natural language processing technology to   efficiently collect and provide access to quality public health grey literature for the public health workforce.         n/a",Improving Public Health Grey Literature Access for the Public Health Workforce,7908946,G08LM008983,"['Academy', 'Address', 'Basic Science', 'Collection', 'Computer Systems Development', 'County', 'Digital Libraries', 'Effectiveness', 'Elements', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Gray unit of radiation dose', 'Harvest', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Health Professional', 'Health Sciences', 'Improve Access', 'Information Systems', 'Intervention', 'Librarians', 'Life', 'Literature', 'MEDLINE', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Metric', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'New York', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome Measure', 'Perception', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Retrieval', 'Source', 'Specialist', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'United States National Library of Medicine', 'Update', 'Wood material', 'Work', 'base', 'cost', 'design', 'digital', 'experience', 'feeding', 'improved', 'meetings', 'natural language', 'population based', 'research to practice', 'tool']",NLM,SYRACUSE UNIVERSITY,G08,2009,71200,0.003039332096763364
"Online Social Networking as an Alternative Information Source for Clinical Resear    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Clinical trials and patient records have been the main information sources for clinical research. While well- designed clinical trials can produce high quality data, they are generally very expensive and time consuming. Prior studies have also shown that patients enrolled in clinical trials are not necessarily representative of the general patient population. Chart reviews, which rely on the patient records, avoid some of the drawbacks of the clinical trials approach. Although chart review studies are more labor intensive, new developments in structured data entry and natural language processing (NLP) are helping to automate the process. However, studies which use chart reviews are limited by the accuracy and completeness of the data in the records.       In the past decade, online social networks have grown exponentially. Some health-focused social network sites have attracted large numbers of users and begun accumulating large quantities of detailed clinical information. The PatientsLikeMe site, for instance, has about 3,200 amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) patients worldwide, and includes about 5% of the ALS population in the US. Information gathered by online social networks is primarily intended for patients to share with each other. Such information has also begun to attract the attention of medical researchers.[3, 4]       Because using information from online social networks for medical research is a fairly new phenomenon, the value and limitation of this type of information source have not been systematically examined. To do so, we propose to conduct a comparison study of patient-contributed information from PatientsLikeMe and records from a large medical record data repository - the Research Patient Data Registry (RPDR) of the Partners Healthcare Systems. The proposed study will focus on ALS, multiple sclerosis (MS), and Parkinson's disease (PD). The general goal is to explore how the medical record and online networking data differ, and if and how online networking data could complement the medical record data. The specific aims are:    1) Extract symptom and treatment information from the two different data sources.    2) Compare the prevalence of symptoms and treatments from the two information sources and analyze the difference.    3) Extract treatment response of prescription medications from PatientsLikeMe and analyze the confounding effect of the misunderstanding of medication indication.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed project will investigate an emerging data source for clinical research: online social network. This data source may complement and supplement the data from clinical trials and medical records, with a unique emphasis on patients' experience and perspectives.           The proposed project will investigate an emerging data source for clinical research: online social network.

"Informatics Infrastructure for vector-based neuroanatomical atlases    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The adage:  'all data is spatial' is especially pertinent in the field of neuroscience, since neuronal data must be indexed by the neuroanatomical location of phenomena or entities under study.  Brain atlases are very widely used as laboratory tools, being some of the most highly cited publications in science.  This proposal seeks to use brain atlases as a method for indexing data from the literature in a neuroinformatics system.  This data includes both textual and graphical information, ranging from highly detailed maps constructed from vector- based spatial primitives, histological photographs and drawings, to textual reports of experimental findings in the literature (which we will analyze on a large scale).  These data represent a significant scientific investment that are currently locked away in previously published journal articles (and the detailed data-sets and drawings from researchers that were used to write the articles).  A prototype that summarizes the last fifteen years' output of one of the world's most prominent neuroanatomy laboratories is immediately available.  This project will develop a collaborative environment to enable neuroscientists to use these valuable maps within the community as a whole by contributing data to a shared system with an open-source system (called 'NeuARt II') that permits querying, overlaying, viewing and annotating such data in an integrated manner.  We will also use Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to index neuroanatomical references in large numbers of journal articles to be accessible within our infrastructure.  As an initial text corpus, we over 110,000 documents taken from last 35 years of published information from the primary neuroanatomical literature.  We will construct a neuroanatomical interface that conceptually resembles the 'Google Maps' system, permitting users to use an intuitive spatial interface to browse large amounts of biomedical data in spatial register.  The proposed infrastructure will also provide new opportunities to compare and synthesize the anatomical components of neuroscience data multiple modalities (physiological, behavioral, clinical, genetic, molecular, etc.).PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Given the scope of the use of neuroanatomical maps from the rat and mouse in the study of neurobiological disease, we expect our research impact scientists working in almost all subfields of the subject.  Our collaborators who form the early adopters of this approach are neuroendocrinology researchers studying the mechanisms of stress and anxiety disorders which are estimated to affect 19.1 million people in the USA, costing $42 billion in health care costs per year (source:  Anxiety Disorders Association of America).  A better understanding of the neuronal mechanisms underlying these disorders could lead to new, effective therapies and treatments.        Narrative Given the scope of the use of neuroanatomical maps from the rat and mouse in the study of neurobiological disease, we expect our research impact scientists working in almost all subfields of the subject.

"Vanderbilt Genome-Electronic Records Project    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  VGER: The Vanderbilt Genome-Electronic Record project An important potential enabling resource for Personalized Medicine is the combination of a DNA repository with Electronic Medical Record (EMR) systems sufficiently robust to provide excellence in clinical care and to serve as resources for analysis of disease susceptibility and therapeutic outcomes across patient populations. The Vanderbilt EMR is a state of the art clinical and research tool (that includes >1.4 million records), and is associated with a DNA repository which has been in development for over 3 years; these are the key components of VGER, the Vanderbilt Genome-Electronic Records project proposed here. The VGER model acquires DNA from discarded blood samples collected from routine patient care, and can link these to de-identified data extracted and readily updated from the EMR. The phenotype we will analyze here is the QRS duration on the electrocardiogram, since slow conduction (indicated by longer QRS duration) is a marker of arrhythmia susceptibility. This will not only exploit the power of Genome-Wide Association (GWA) approaches to generate new biologic knowledge that impacts an area of public health concern, but also provides a platform for the development of tools, such as Natural Language Processing approaches, to optimally mine EMRs. This project brings together a team of investigators with nationally recognized records of accomplishment in genome science, medical ethics, bioinformatics, de-identification science, and translational and cardiovascular medicine to address four Specific Aims: (1) perform a GWA comparing samples from subjects with QRS durations at the extremes of the normal range, and validate by genotyping high likelihood associations in prospectively ascertained clinical trial sets for QRS duration and for arrhythmia susceptibility; (2) evaluate the validity and utility of structured and unstructured components of EMR data for genome-phenome correlations; (3) assess the ethical, scientific, and societal advantages and disadvantages of the VGER model, and determine best practices for oversight, community involvement, and communication as the resource grows; and (4) develop and evaluate formal privacy protection models for data derived from databanks and EMRs, establishing data sharing and integration practices. We also include here a proposal to develop the Administrative Coordinating Center whose mission will be to facilitate communication and collaboration among nodes in this network, the NHGRI, and external advisors.

The Vanderbilt EMR is a state of the art clinical and research tool (that includes >1.4 million records), and is associated with a DNA repository which has been in development for over 3 years; these are the key components of VGER, the Vanderbilt Genome-Electronic Records project proposed here. The VGER model acquires DNA from discarded blood samples collected from routine patient care, and can link these to de-identified data extracted and readily updated from the EMR. The phenotype we will analyze here is the QRS duration on the electrocardiogram, since slow conduction (indicated by longer QRS duration) is a marker of arrhythmia susceptibility. This will not only exploit the power of Genome-Wide Association (GWA) approaches to generate new biologic knowledge that impacts an area of public health concern, but also provides a platform for the development of tools, such as Natural Language Processing approaches, to optimally mine EMRs. This project brings together a team of investigators with nationally recognized records of accomplishment in genome science, medical ethics, bioinformatics, de-identification science, and translational and cardiovascular medicine to address four Specific Aims: (1) perform a GWA comparing samples from subjects with QRS durations at the extremes of the normal range, and validate by genotyping high likelihood associations in prospectively ascertained clinical trial sets for QRS duration and for arrhythmia susceptibility; (2) evaluate the validity and utility of structured and unstructured components of EMR data for genome-phenome correlations; (3) assess the ethical, scientific, and societal advantages and disadvantages of the VGER model, and determine best practices for oversight, community involvement, and communication as the resource grows; and (4) develop and evaluate formal privacy protection models for data derived from databanks and EMRs, establishing data sharing and integration practices.

"Increasing Clinical Trial Enrollment: A Semi-Automated Patient Centered Approach    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       The long-term objective of this research is to increase the clinical trial enrollment of US patients via a semi- automated, Natural Language Processing (NLP) based, interactive and patient-centered informatics application. The study design is prospective observational study. Scope is limited to cancer patients. There are three specific aims for this project. The first aim is to identify concepts that overlap between the electronic medical record's (EMR) clinical notes and the free text of clinical trial announcements. The PI will use the concepts to develop mapping frames that connect concepts in the text of trial announcements to those found in clinical notes in the medical record. When he has the mapping frames he will build the NLP module for the application. In the software development work he will utilize as many publicly available software components as possible. He will experiment with UIMA, GATE, MetaMap, Stanford Parser, NegEx algorithm and others. The PI will develop the tool around the National Library of Medicine's Unified Medical Language System knowledgebase. He will use Java for programming. The second aim is to create an algorithm that automatically generates questions to request information directly from the patient if the information is not available or accessible in the records. The third aim is to evaluate the in-vitro, laboratory performance of the application. For performance evaluation purposes the PI will recruit cancer care specialists to generate the gold standard lists of eligible clinical trials for study patients. He will publicly release the developed code at the end of the grant period. This K99/R00 project will serve the foundation for future R01 grant applications. The PI is fully committed to become faculty in the Clinical Research Informatics domain with a specialization in biomedical NLP. The support of the K99/R00 grant will enable him to acquire substantial formal training in Computational Linguistics while contributing to the body of knowledge of the Clinical Research Informatics field. The five-year grant support will ensure success in his endeavor. The proposed work is highly significant because the dismal clinical trial accrual rates (2-4 % nationally) hampers timely development of new drugs. In addition, studies show that physicians have statistically significant bias against elderly and minority patients to invite participation in clinical trials. The proposed project is synergistic with physician-centered efforts but the goal is to provide individualized, EMR based clinical trial recommendations directly to the patients. The results of this research will empower the patients and elevate their role in the decision making process.           Relevance The long-term objective of this research is to increase the clinical trial enrollment of US patients via a semi- automated, Natural Language Processing (NLP) based, interactive and patient-centered informatics application.

"Optimal Micro-Data Switching: An Enhanced Framework and Decision Tool for Confid    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The objective of this project is the development of an innovative technique to avoid disclosure of confidential data in public use tabular data. Our proposed technique, called Optimal Data Switching (OS), overcomes the limitations and disadvantages found in currently deployed disclosure limitation methods. Statistical databases for public use pose a critical problem of identifying how to make the data available for analysis without disclosing information that would infringe on privacy, violate confidentiality, or endanger national security. Organizations in both the public and private sectors have a major stake in this confidentiality protection problem, given the fact that access to data is essential for advancing research and formulating policy. Yet, the possibility of extracting certain sensitive elements of information from the data can jeopardize the welfare of these organizations and potentially, in some instances, the welfare of the society in which they operate. The challenge is, therefore, to represent the data in a form that permits accurate analysis for supporting research, decision-making and policy initiatives, while preventing an unscrupulous or ill-intentioned party from exploiting the data for harmful consequences. Our goal is to build on the latest advances in optimization, to which the OptTek Systems, Inc. (OptTek) research team has made pioneering contributions, to provide a framework based on optimal data switching, enabling the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and other organizations to effectively meet the challenge of confidentiality protection. The framework we propose is structured to be easy to use in a wide array of application settings and diverse user environments, from client-server to web-based, regardless of whether the micro-data is continuous, ordinal, binary, or any combination of these types. The successful development of such a framework, and the computer-based method for implementing it, is badly needed and will be of value to many types of organizations, not only in the public sector but also in the private sector, for whom the incentive to publish data is both economic as well as scientific. Examples in the public sector are evident, where organizations like CDC and the U.S. Census Bureau exist for the purpose of collecting, analyzing and publishing data for analysis by other parties. Numerous examples are also encountered in the private sector, notably in banking and financial services, healthcare (including drug companies and medical research institutions), market research, oil exploration, computational biology, renewable and sustainable energy, retail sales, product development, and a wide variety of other areas. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In the process of accumulating and disseminating public health data for reporting purposes, various uses, and statistical analysis, we must guarantee that individual records describing each person or establishment are protected. Organizations in both the public and private sectors have a major stake in this confidentiality protection problem, given the fact that access to data is essential for advancing research and formulating policy. This project proposes the development of a robust methodology and practical framework to deliver an efficient and effective tool to protect the confidentiality in published tabular data.                      n/a",Optimal Micro-Data Switching: An Enhanced Framework and Decision Tool for Confid,7790821,R43MH086138,"['Accounting', 'American', 'Area', 'Cells', 'Censuses', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Client', 'Computational Biology', 'Confidentiality', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Reporting', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Disadvantaged', 'Disclosure', 'Economics', 'Elements', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Goals', 'Health Personnel', 'Healthcare', 'Incentives', 'Individual', 'Inferior', 'Institution', 'Machine Learning', 'Market Research', 'Medical Research', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'National Security', 'Oils', 'Online Systems', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Policies', 'Policy Making', 'Privacy', 'Private Sector', 'Problem Solving', 'Process', 'Property', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Public Sector', 'Publishing', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Support', 'Respondent', 'Sales', 'Services', 'Social Welfare', 'Societies', 'Solutions', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'base', 'computer framework', 'data mining', 'flexibility', 'innovation', 'interest', 'meetings', 'prevent', 'product development', 'public health relevance', 'tool']",NIMH,"OPTTEK SYSTEMS, INC.",R43,2009,4047,-0.007945695835310414
"Translational refinement of adaptive communication system for locked-in patients    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proliferation of brain-computer interface (BCI) technology promises locked-in patients potential ways to communicate successfully. Most BCI systems either involve selection from among a set of simultaneously presented stimuli, requiring extensive control of the interface; or use binary stimulus selection mechanisms that fail to achieve high communication rates because of slow intent detection or a fixed (context independent) ordering of stimuli. We propose a new interface using binary selection of text input via rapid serial visual presentation of natural language components. Individuals with severe speech and physical impairments (SSPI) resulting from acquired neurological disorders (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, brainstem stroke, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, spinal cord injury) and neurodevelopmental disorders (cerebral palsy, muscular dystrophy) drive the proposed research. Four laboratories form an alliance for this translational research project: basic research (Erdogmus, engineering; Roark, computer science and natural language processing), and clinical research (Oken, neurology/neurophysiology; Fried-Oken, augmentative communication/neurogenic communication disorders). Our aims are (1) to develop an innovative EEG-based BCI that achieves increased communication rates with fewer errors and greater satisfaction for the target SSPI populations; (2) to iteratively refine the system in the laboratory with user feedback from healthy subjects and expert LIS users of marketed AAC systems; (3) to evaluate the performance of the system within the natural clinical settings of SSPI patients. The innovative BCI is the RSVP Keyboard with three essential features: (1) rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP) of linguistic components ranging from letters to words to phrases; (2) a detection mechanism that employs multichannel electroencephalography (EEG) and/or other suitable response mechanisms that can reliably indicate the binary intent of the user and adapt based on individualized neurophysiologic data of the user; and (3) an open-vocabulary natural language model with a capability for accurate predictions of upcoming text. Theoretical framework is based on a solid Bayesian foundation; clinical usability is based on the WHO ICF (WHO, 2001) and an Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC) model of participation. Rigorous experimental scrutiny in both clinical laboratory and natural settings will be obtained with able-bodied subjects and SSPI patients. Measures of learning rate, speed of message production, error rate and user satisfaction for different iterations of the RSVP keyboard will be obtained using an hypothesis-driven crossover design for 36 healthy subjects, and alternating treatment randomization design for 40 patients with SSPI. Descriptions of the motor, cognitive, and language skills of LIS patients using the novel system in their natural environments will inform clinical guidelines and functional device adaptations to better individualize treatment for children and adults with SSPI. The collaborative nature of the proposed translational research is expected to yield new knowledge for both BCI development and clinical AAC use.    Relevance: The populations of patients with locked-in syndrome are increasing as medical technologies advance and successfully support life. These individuals with limited to no movement could potentially contribute to their medical decision making, informed consent, and daily care giving if they had faster, more reliable means to interface with communication systems. The RSVP keyboard and proposed language models are innovative technological discoveries that are being applied to clinical augmentative communication tools so that patients and their families can participate in daily activities and advocate for improvements in standard clinical care. The proposed project stresses the translation of basic computer science into clinical care, supporting the proposed NIH Roadmap and public health initiatives.              Public health relevance statement: The populations of patients with locked-in syndrome are increasing as medical technologies advance and successfully support life.

"NLP Foundational Studies & Ontologies for Syndromic Surveillance from ED Reports    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Many NLP applications have been successfully developed to extract information from text. Most of the   applications have focused on identifying individual clinical conditions in textual records, which is the first step in making the conditions available to computerized applications. However, identifying individual instances of clinical conditions is not sufficient for many medical informatics tasks - the context surrounding the condition is crucial for integrating the information within the text to determine the clinical state of a patient. We propose to perform in-depth studies on NLP issues requiring knowledge of the context of clinical conditions in clinical records. We will focus our research by using syndromic surveillance from emergency department (ED) reports as a case study.      For this proposal, we will test the following hypothesis: An NLP system that indexes clinical concepts and integrates contextual information modifying the concepts can identify acute clinical conditions from ED reports as well as physicians can.      We will identify clinical concepts necessary for surveillance of seven syndromes, including respiratory,   gastrointestinal, neurological, rash, hemorrhagic, constitutional, and botulinic. To evaluate the hypothesis, we will perform the following specific aims:      Aim 1. Perform in-depth, foundational studies on four NLP topics to gain a deeper understanding of the      pertinent NLP research capabilities required for identification of acute clinical conditions from ED reports, including negation, uncertainty, temporal discrimination, and finding validation;      Aim 2. Apply the knowledge learned from the foundational studies to develop and evaluate an automated application for ED reports that will determine the values for clinical variables relevant to identifying patients with any of seven syndromes.      The research is innovative, because it will generate an in-depth study of multiple NLP topics crucial to   understanding a patient's clinical state from textual records and will focus on contextual understanding and analysis. The research will be guided by linguistic principles, by the semantics and discourse structure of ED reports, and by the application area of biosurveillance. Because we will develop research methods and tools that are customized to a particular domain, we will constrain the research space, which will provide direction and enhance the chance for success.

"Semi-Automated Abstract Screening for Comparative Effectiveness Reviews    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In this three-year project, we aim to apply state-of-the-art information analysis technologies to assist the production of systematic reviews and meta-analyses that are increasingly being used as a foundation for evidence-based medicine (EBM) and comparative effectiveness reviews. We plan to develop a human guided computerized abstract screening tool to greatly reduce the need to perform a tedious but crucial step of manually screening many thousands of abstracts generated by literature searches in order to retrieve a small fraction potentially relevant for further analysis. This tool will combine proven machine learning techniques with a new open source tool that enables management of the screening process. This new technology will enable investigators to screen abstracts in a small fraction of the time compared to the current manual process. It will reduce the time and cost of producing systematic reviews, provide clear documentation of the process and potentially perform the task more accurately. With the acceptance of EBM and increasing demands for systematic reviews, there is a great need for tools to assist in generating new systematic reviews and in updating them. This need cannot be more pressing. The recent passage of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act and the $1.1 billion allocated for comparative effectiveness research have created an unprecedented need for systematic reviews and opportunities to improve the methodologies and efficiency of their conduct.   We herein propose the development of novel, open-source software to help systematic reviewers better   cope with these torrents of data. The research and development of this tool will be carried out by a highly experienced team of systematic review investigators with computer scientists at Tufts University who began to collaborate last year as a result of Tufts being awarded one of the NIH Clinical Translational Science Awards (CTSA). We will pursue dissemination of the new technology through numerous channels including, but not limited to publication, presentation at conferences, exploring interest in its adoption by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) Evidence-based Practice Center (EPC) Program, Cochrane Collaboration, CTSA network, and other groups conducting systematic reviews, and production of tutorial material. Our aims are:   1. Conduct research to design and implement a semi-automated system using machine learning and   information retrieval methods to identify relevant abstracts in order to improve the accuracy and efficiency of systematic reviews.   2. Develop Abstrackr, an open-source system with a Graphical User Interface (GUI) for screening abstracts, that applies the methods developed in Aim 1 to automatically exclude irrelevant abstracts/articles.   3.

"Improving Outpatient Medication Lists Using Temporal Reasoning and Clinical Texts    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Accurate and complete medication lists are critical inputs to effective medication reconciliation to prevent medication prescribing and administration errors. Previous research aggregated structured medication data form multiple sources to generate and maintain a reconciled medication list. Medications documented in clinical texts also need to be reconciled. However, most reconciliation methods currently have limited capability to process textual data and temporal information (e.g., dates, duration and status). Our goal is to pilot and test methodologies and applications in the fields of natural language processing (NLP) and temporal reasoning to facilitate the use of electronic clinical texts in order to improve the ""correctness"" and ""completeness"" of medication lists. Clinic notes and free-text ""comments"" fields in medication lists in an ambulatory electronic medical record system will be considered in the study. An NLP system and a temporal reasoning system will be adapted to automatically extract medication and associated temporal information from clinical texts and encode the medications using a controlled terminology. Multiple knowledge bases will be used to develop a mechanism to represent the timing of medication use, detect the changes (e.g., active or inactive), and then to organize medications into appropriate groups (e.g., by ingredient or by status). The feasibility and efficiency of the proposed methods and tools in improving the process of medication   reconciliation will be assessed. Domain experts will serve as judges to assess the success of capturing, coding, and organizing the medications and temporal information and also to evaluate whether our methods are complementary to those currently used for medication management.           Accurate and complete medication information at the point of care is crucial for delivery of high-quality care and prevention of adverse events. Most previous studies aggregated structured medication data from EMR and CPOE (Computerized Physician Order Entry) systems to generate and maintain a reconciled medication list. However, medications in non-structured narrative sources (such as clinic notes and free-text comments) must also be reconciled. Structured data presented in a standard, predictable form can be easily processed by a computer. By contrast, narrative data does not have a well-defined structure, so processing such data is very challenging. Our goal is to pilot and test methodologies and applications in the fields of natural language processing (any system that manipulates text) and temporal reasoning (e.g., identifying the timing of medication use) to facilitate the use of electronic clinical texts in order to improve the ""correctness"" and ""completeness"" of medication lists.

"Continued Development and Evaluation of caTIES    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose to further develop, test, evaluate and support caTIES - an existing software system for developing networked repositories of sharable de-identified surgical pathology reports. The caTIES system creates a repository of de-identified, structured, and concept-coded clinical reports derived from large corpora of clinical free-text. Documents are automatically coded against a controlled terminology such as the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS), SNOMED-CT, or NCI Metathesaurus. Users construct queries to identify specific kinds of documents and tissue specimens based on the associated clinical report. For example, a researcher studying genetic variation in metastatic breast cancers can identify cases of invasive ductal carcinoma of the breast, followed by metastatic ductal cancer in bone at an interval of three years or greater from the original diagnosis. The caTIES system also supports acquisition and ordering of tissues, using an honest broker model. Through this mechanism, de-identified data and access to tissue can be shared among institutions, enabling multi-center collaborative research. The caTIES system has already been implemented at seven US Cancer Centers, and is being considered for adoption by numerous other institutions including cancer centers, university hospitals and private hospitals. Initial development of caTIES was funded by the Cancer Biomedical Informatics Grid (caBIG). However, interest in the application has far exceeded our expectations and the limitations of caBIG. This grant will allow us to further extend the capabilities of the system by (a) improving the portability of the system and extending the types of documents that can be processed, (b) evaluating the system's NLP performance and usability, (c) building a user community to support this open-source application, and (d) piloting interoperability of caTIES with other enterprise and research systems. This work will preserve and extend a highly novel platform for development of massive repositories of de-identified clinical data that can be used for research within and across institutions. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This grant will fund the further development and evaluation of a system that takes identified clinical documents and converts them into de-identified, concept-coded, structured data. The system enables researchers to access remainder tissues and clinical report data for research purposes within and across institution. This project is important because it will greatly increase the access of researchers to important data and materials while maintaining patient privacy.          n/a",Continued Development and Evaluation of caTIES,7558128,R01CA132672,"['Access to Information', 'Adoption', 'Body of uterus', 'Cancer Center', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Community Developments', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Reporting', 'Database Management Systems', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Documentation', 'Ductal', 'Electronic Mail', 'Eligibility Determination', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genomics', 'Grant', 'Information Retrieval', 'Institution', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methods', 'Metric', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Operating System', 'Pathology Report', 'Performance', 'Private Hospitals', 'Process', 'Report (document)', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Services', 'Specimen', 'Structure', 'Surgical Pathology', 'System', 'Terminology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Unified Medical Language System', 'University Hospitals', 'Vocabulary', 'Work', 'base', 'bone', 'cancer Biomedical Informatics Grid', 'clinical phenotype', 'computer human interaction', 'ductal breast carcinoma', 'expectation', 'flexibility', 'improved', 'interest', 'interoperability', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'meetings', 'metathesaurus', 'novel', 'open source', 'patient privacy', 'portability', 'public health relevance', 'repository', 'software development', 'software systems', 'systems research', 'tool', 'usability']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2009,314363,-0.050867515758251186

"HealthMap: Knowledge Management for Emerging Infectious Disease Intelligence    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):      Even as many developed countries strengthen their traditional clinically-based surveillance capacity, a basic level of health information infrastructure is still lacking in many parts of the developing world, including areas that are most vulnerable to emerging health threats. To help fill this gap, electronic news outlets, disease reporting networks, discussion sites, and blogs are proving to be invaluable data sources for a new generation of public health surveillance systems that operate across international borders- almost all major outbreaks investigated by WHO, including SARS, are first identified by these informal online sources. These data sources provide local and timely information about disease outbreaks and related events around the world, including areas relatively invisible to day-to-day global public health efforts due to lack of infrastructure or political suppression of information. However, since this information is dispersed and largely unstructured, there is lack of organization and integration between sources, precluding a global view of all ongoing disease threats. In order to construct such an integrated view of current emerging infections, we deployed an early prototype called Health Map, a freely available multi-stream real-time knowledge management system that aggregates and maps health alerts across numerous key data sources, including WHO alerts, newswires, mailing lists. Leveraging our previous National Library of Medicine funded work in real-time health monitoring; we propose extensive development of this new digital resource to address technological and methodological barriers to achieving a synthesized, comprehensive, and customized view of global health. The principal objective of Health Map development is to provide access to the greatest amount of possibly useful information across the widest variety of geographical areas and disease agents, without overwhelming the user with an excess of information, or obscuring important and urgent elements. We will specifically address the challenge of providing structure to unstructured data while still enabling the astute user to notice the subtle pattern that could be an early indication of a significant outbreak. Development of Health Map will proceed along the four key components of surveillance: (1) data acquisition (evaluation and integration of multiple electronic sources) (2) information characterization (disease and location categorization and severity rating of unstructured data), (3) signal interpretation (multi-stream signal detection, spatiotemporal modeling and risk assessment) and (4) knowledge dissemination (tiered dissemination of global infectious disease alerts and flexible data visualization tools). In each area, we will make critical enhancements to the existing prototype. We plan rigorous evaluation to ensure that Health Map successfully leverages electronic sources for surveillance, communication, and intervention. We will also conduct comprehensive user testing, usability studies, user behavior analysis as part of our effort. Our goal is to make Health Map a vital knowledge resource tailored for both the general public and public health decision-makers.        Although an enormous amount of information about current infectious disease outbreaks is found in Web- accessible information sources, this information is dispersed and not well-organized, making it almost impossible for public health officials and concerned citizens to know about all ongoing emerging disease threats.

"Discovering and Applying Knowledge in Clinical Databases    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The ongoing goal of our project, ""Discovering and applying knowledge in clinical databases,"" is to develop and apply methods to exploit electronic medical record data for decision support, with an emphasis on narrative data. Since the inception of our project as an R29 in 1994, we have been developing methods for preparing raw electronic medical record data, applying and evaluating natural language processing, developing data mining techniques including machine learning, and putting the results to use for clinical care and research.       In this competing continuation, we propose to address the temporal information in the electronic medical record and to apply natural language processing and temporal processing to the task of syndromic surveillance in collaboration with the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (NYC DOHMH).       We have begun work on a temporal processing system. It extracts temporal assertions stated in narrative reports, uses the MedLEE natural language processor to parse the non-temporal information, infers implicit temporal assertions based on a knowledge base, and produces the information in the form of a simple temporal constraint satisfaction problem. The latter can be used to answer questions about the time of events and the temporal relation between pairs of events. We propose to complete the system, expand the knowledge base, speed computation, address the uncertainty of temporal assertions, incorporate temporal information from structured data, and evaluate the system.       NYC DOHMH has a mature syndromic surveillance system that watches over almost eight million persons, and it has as-yet unexploited data sources in the form of narrative and structured electronic medical records. We propose to apply natural language processing and our proposed temporal processing to convert the data to a form appropriate for surveillance. We will evaluate the incremental benefit of structured data, narrative data, and temporally processed narrative data.           n/a",Discovering and Applying Knowledge in Clinical Databases,7495030,R01LM006910,"['Address', 'Area', 'Caring', 'Cities', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Event', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical Surveillance', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'New York City', 'Persons', 'Preparation', 'Process', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Uncertainty', 'Work', 'base', 'data mining', 'improved', 'knowledge base', 'satisfaction', 'syndromic surveillance']",NLM,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2008,338600,-0.010372977622591508
"Answering Information Needs in Workflow    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Needs for information arise continuously during the course of clinical practice, especially for physicians in training, e.g. when examining a patient or participating in rounds. In most of these situations, it is difficult or impossible for the clinician to immediately access appropriate information resources. Most needs are never adequately articulated or recorded, and consequently are forgotten by the end of the day. Moreover, when clinicians do recall information needs, they don't act on them, due to the significant limitations of current retrieval systems and the exigencies of clinical practice. The specific aims of the proposed project are: 1) to capture information needs in a convenient manner at the moment they occur using different modalities such as text input and voice capture on hand-held devices, 2) to translate high-level information needs into complex search strategies that adapt to user needs and are tuned to the capabilities of resources, and 3) to deliver relevant materials to the clinician in an accessible format and in a timely manner. The project will develop a central hub for addressing the information needs of medical students and residents, to be transmitted electronically as they occur in the field. A unique feature of the project is the use of natural language processing technology to identify context, goals and preferences in clinicians' questions. The major innovation is the generation of complex search strategies that exploit this contextual information, based on studies of human searching experts (reference librarians).              n/a",Answering Information Needs in Workflow,7675157,R01LM008799,"['Address', 'Biological Models', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Face', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Human', 'Information Resources', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Librarians', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medical Errors', 'Medical Students', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Process', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Retrieval', 'Software Tools', 'System', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Textbooks', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Voice', 'Work', 'base', 'day', 'forgetting', 'innovation', 'preference', 'speech processing', 'symposium']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,R01,2008,354823,0.00195407884567279
"Extracting Semantic Knowledge from Clinical Reports    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Analyzing and processing free-text medical reports for data mining and clinical data interchange is one of the most challenging problems in medical informatics, yet it is crucial for continued research advances and improvements in clinical care. Natural language processing (NLP) is an important enabling technology, but has been held back because it is difficult to understand human language, since it requires extensive domain knowledge. In Phase I, we developed new statistical and machine learning methods that apply domain specific knowledge to the semantic analysis of free-text radiology reports. The methods enabled the creation of two new prototype applications - a SNOMED CT (Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine--Clinical Terms) coding service called SnomedCoder, and a text mining tool for analyzing a large corpus of medical reports, called DataMiner. In Phase II, we will accomplish the following specific aims: 1) Improve the semantic extraction methods developed in Phase I, 2) Expand the semantic knowledge base and classify at least two million new unique sentences from multiple medical institutions, 3) Provide a SNOMED CT auto coding service (alpha service) to participating Indiana Health Information Exchange hospitals, and 4) Build a commercial version of the DataMiner software, and test its functionality using researchers at the Regenstrief Institute.       These scientific innovations will revolutionize the ability of health care researchers to analyze vast repositories of clinical information currently locked up in electronic medical records, and correlate this data with new biomedical discoveries in proteonomics and genomics. The ability to codify text rapidly will extend the potential for clinical decision support beyond its narrow base of numeric and structured medical data, and enable SNOMED CT to become a useful coding standard. Phase III will offer coding and data mining services to healthcare payers (both private and government), pharmaceuticals, and academic researchers. A key advantage of our approach over other NLP systems is that we attempt to codify all the information in the report and not just a limited subset, and insist on expert validation which provides a high degree of confidence in the accuracy of the coded data.Project Narrative           n/a",Extracting Semantic Knowledge from Clinical Reports,7394699,R44RR024929,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Back', 'Bioinformatics', 'Body of uterus', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Code', 'Collection', 'Computer software', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Data Reporting', 'Decision Making', 'Effectiveness', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Government', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Indiana', 'Institutes', 'Institution', 'Journals', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medical Informatics', 'Medical Records', 'Methods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Paper', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Phase', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Science', 'Semantics', 'Services', 'Speed', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Structure', 'System', 'Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Thinking', 'Trees', 'Trust', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'United States National Library of Medicine', 'Validation', 'base', 'computerized', 'data mining', 'health care quality', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'knowledge base', 'novel strategies', 'patient safety', 'prototype', 'repository', 'research and development', 'success', 'text searching', 'tool']",NCRR,"LOGICAL SEMANTICS, INC.",R44,2008,429955,-0.0029338304494155405
"Semantic and Machine Learning Methods for Mining Connections in the UMLS    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       The Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) is an invaluable resource for the biomedical community.   One of the intended uses of the UMLS Metathesaurus is to support the translation of terms from a source terminology into terms in a target terminology. It is evident from the research literature on the UMLS that users generally need to perform more broader types of ""translations"" that involve finding terms with closest meaning to source term (mapping), finding terms that are related to source term and can serve as proxy for various functions (e.g. information retrieval, knowledge discovery) or finding target terms that satisfy some structural or semantic constraint (e.g. information theoretic distance). The methods for finding such ""translations"" or connections between terms in Meta (other than the case of one-to-one synonymy) are not at all clear. Previous attempts to exploit such connections have depended on either manual selection of relevant connections, or problem-specific algorithms that use expert knowledge about the relative suitability of various inter-concept relationships. We believe that machine learning techniques offer automated, generalizable approaches that are appropriate for use with the UMLS, given the large set of potential connections and the need for a problem-independent approach. We hypothesize that learning strategies that exploit the relational features, scale free properties and probabilistic dependencies of connections in the UMLS will identify meaningful inter-term relationships and that a combined approach will perform better across different problem domains when compared to any of the approaches in isolation. We will evaluate the proposed learning algorithms with training connections from a variety of problem domains in biomedicine. We will disseminate the successful algorithms via the UMLS Knowledge Source API toolkit for mining and visualizing the connections. We believe that the UMLS provides a unique fertile ground to develop novel semantic relational mining methods and advance our understanding of mining large biomedical concept graphs.             n/a",Semantic and Machine Learning Methods for Mining Connections in the UMLS,7498449,R21LM009638,"['Algorithms', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dependency', 'Disease', 'Graph', 'Healthcare', 'Information Retrieval', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Nature', 'Ontology', 'Organism', 'Pathway interactions', 'Property', 'Proxy', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Retrieval', 'Sampling', 'Semantics', 'Social Network', 'Solutions', 'Source', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Terminology', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Unified Medical Language System', 'Work', 'base', 'biomedical resource', 'concept', 'interest', 'metathesaurus', 'microbial alkaline proteinase inhibitor', 'novel', 'success']",NLM,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R21,2008,153203,-0.02672105552847615
"Feasibility of a Natural Language Processing-based Dental Charting Application    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The absence of a flexible, robust, and accurate natural language interface is a significant barrier to the direct use of computer-based patient records by dental clinicians. While providing patient care, dentists, hygienists and assistants are handicapped in using a keyboard and mouse to interact with a computer, primarily because of infection control concerns. The objective of this proposal is to develop and evaluate a prototype dental charting system with a speech-driven interface that will allow the dentist to chart dental conditions using natural language. The system will use Natural Language Processing (NLP) to extract the key concepts associated with 16 dental conditions from transcribed dental examinations. These concepts, coded using the standardized terminologies, would provide a structured summary of a patient's initial dental exam. The proposal has two aims: 1) evaluate the accuracy of speech recognition technology for clinical dental examinations; and 2) develop and evaluate an NLP application for mapping transcribed text to a structured dental chart. This proposal describes a new, exploratory and innovative research project that could radically impact the practice of dental charting. Expected outcomes for this proposal include: 1) an understanding of the accuracy of speech recognition for real-time dictated dental exams; and 2) NLP-based tools to automatically chart restorative and periodontal conditions for each tooth into a structured dental chart. This developmental work will provide a strong foundation for developing a chairside NLP-based dental charting application that would automatically generate a structured dental chart suitable for chairside decision support.          n/a",Feasibility of a Natural Language Processing-based Dental Charting Application,7478824,R21DE018158,"['Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Code', 'Computerized Patient Records', 'Computers', 'Condition', 'Data', 'Dental', 'Dental Dictionaries', 'Dental General Practice', 'Dental Hygienists', 'Dental Informatics', 'Dental Offices', 'Dental Records', 'Dentistry', 'Dentists', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Disabled Persons', 'Documentation', 'Evaluation', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Human Resources', 'Infection Control', 'Language', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Medical', 'Medical Transcription', 'Mus', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Numbers', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Reference Standards', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Services', 'Speech', 'Speech Recognition Software', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Technology', 'Terminology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Tooth structure', 'Training', 'Transcript', 'Universities', 'Vocabulary', 'Work', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'concept', 'dental structure', 'design', 'digital', 'experience', 'handicapping condition', 'improved', 'innovation', 'prevent', 'prototype', 'restoration', 'speech recognition', 'tool']",NIDCR,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R21,2008,177729,-0.022068771692337126
"Investigating the generalizability of natural language processing of EMR data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       The electronic medical record (EMR) offers impressive opportunities for increasing care quality, but challenges stand in the way of realizing this vision. For example, coded EMR data readily available for analysis typically are incomplete (due to the prevalence of free-text clinical notes in EMR implementations), and data from different EMRs are often incommensurate due to differences in standard vocabularies and system implementations. While informatics research has shown the feasibility of automatically coding specific aspects of clinical text using Natural Language Processing (NLP), challenges remain for translating these informatics developments into large-scale care quality assessments. To date, successful NLP solutions for automated quality assessment have tended to be applications that are specific to (a) the target problem or clinical focus, (b) the EMR data system, and (c) the person or team that implements the NLP solution. In this study, we propose to begin addressing the problem of implementation team specificity by developing, evaluating, and making freely available a generalizable NLP development tool suite. The tools will enable widespread adoption of NLP systems to extract and code data from free text clinical notes. The Knowledge Editing Toolkit will simplify development of problem-specific knowledge by helping the user define the rules, concepts, and terms that constitute a domain-specific knowledge module, thus allowing any informaticist to develop an NLP application. The NLP Application Validation Toolkit will allow rapid testing and evaluation of the application against a gold standard of independently-coded test records from any EMR. To evaluate the effects of the toolkits on NLP generalizability, we will have three clinical informaticists each build two NLP applications (for a total of six distinct applications). One of their applications will identify a constellation of common clinical signs or symptoms (e.g., ""persistent cough"") that are relatively discrete concepts using simple language terms for many different clinical purposes. Their second application will assess behavioral counseling (e.g., ""alcohol counseling""), which uses complex language constructs for dedicated clinical purposes. We will describe and evaluate the accuracy of the solutions against independently coded test sets of medical records. We will quantify and compare the difficulty of creating these solutions as measured by the time, number of iterations required to build the applications, and the number of concepts and rules employed, as well as analyze variability in content and accuracy of the solutions created. In addition, we will use qualitative techniques to assess the ease of using the development tools; the difficulty in learning the tools; and specific types of problems, limitations, and bugs encountered. Such an NLP development tool suite has the potential to allow simple, elegant, and reliably good NLP solutions regardless of the clinical problem domain or the person developing the solution.           n/a",Investigating the generalizability of natural language processing of EMR data,7529967,R21LM009728,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Alcohols', 'Architecture', 'Behavioral', 'Caring', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Computer Systems Development', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Coughing', 'Counseling', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Event', 'Gold', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Human Resources', 'Informatics', 'Information Systems', 'Information Technology', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical Records', 'Modification', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Numbers', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Proliferating', 'Purpose', 'Quality of Care', 'Records', 'Research', 'Running', 'Solutions', 'Source', 'Specificity', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Translating', 'United States National Academy of Sciences', 'Ursidae Family', 'Validation', 'Vision', 'Vocabulary', 'care delivery', 'concept', 'cost', 'design', 'evaluation/testing', 'experience', 'health care quality', 'stem', 'success', 'tool', 'tool development']",NLM,KAISER FOUNDATION RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R21,2008,213300,0.007923909326098662
"Assisting Systematic Review Preparation Using Automated Document Classification    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       The work proposed in this new investigator initiated project studies the hypothesis that machine learning-based text classification techniques can add significant efficiencies to the process of updating systematic reviews (SRs). Because new information constantly becomes available, medicine is constantly changing, and SRs must undergo periodic updates in order to correctly represent the best available medical knowledge at a given time.       To support studying this hypothesis, the work proposed here will undertake four specific aims:   1. Refinement and further development of text classification algorithms optimized for use in classifying   literature for the update of systematic reviews on a variety of therapeutic domains. Comparative analysis using several different machine learning techniques and strategies will be studied, as well as various means of representing the journal articles as feature vectors input to the process.   2. Identification and evaluation of systematic review expert preferences and trade offs between high recall and high precision classification systems. There are several opportunities for including this technology in the process of creating SRs. Each of these applications has separate and unique precision and recall tradeoff thresholds that will be studied based on the benefit to systematic reviews.   3. Prospective evaluation of text classification algorithms. We will verify that our approach performs as   expected on future data.   4. Development of comprehensive gold standard test and training sets to motivate and evaluate the   proposed and future work in this area.      The long term relevance of this research to public health is that automated document classification will   enable more efficient use of expert resources to create systematic reviews. This will increase both the   number and quality of reviews for a given level of public support. Since up-to-date systematic reviews are essential for establishing widespread high quality practice standards and guidelines, the overall public health will benefit from this work.          n/a",Assisting Systematic Review Preparation Using Automated Document Classification,7468470,R01LM009501,"['Algorithms', 'Area', 'Classification', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Evaluation', 'Future', 'Gold', 'Guidelines', 'Human', 'Knowledge', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Numbers', 'Paper', 'Performance', 'Preparation', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Review, Systematic (PT)', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Training', 'Triage', 'Update', 'Work', 'base', 'comparative', 'expectation', 'journal article', 'preference', 'programs', 'prospective', 'text searching', 'vector']",NLM,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,R01,2008,286582,0.010163507450679163

"ADAPTIVE PERSONALIZED INFORMATION MANAGEMENT FOR BIOLOGISTS    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  We propose development of an adaptive, personalizable, information management tool, which can be configured and trained by an individual biologist to most effectively exploit the particular knowledge bases and document collections that are most useful for him or her. The proposed tool represents a novel approach for monitoring scientific progress in biology, which has become a formidable task. We will exploit recent advances in machine learning and database systems to develop a useful approximation to a personalized biological knowledge base f.i.i.e., single information resource that would include all the knowledge sources on which a biologist relies. More specifically, we propose a scheme for loosely integrating both structured information and unstructured text, and then querying the integrated information using easily-formulated similarity queries. The system will also learn from every episode in which a biologist seeks information. The research team on this project includes a computer scientist and two biologists. The proposed work will make systems for monitoring scientific progress in biology more effective. This will make biologists, clinicians and medical researchers better able to track advances in the biomedical literature that are relevant to their work.          n/a",ADAPTIVE PERSONALIZED INFORMATION MANAGEMENT FOR BIOLOGISTS,7432910,R01GM081293,"['Address', 'Biological', 'Biological Phenomena', 'Biology', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Computers', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Eukaryota', 'Eukaryotic Cell', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Individual', 'Information Management', 'Information Resources', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Metric', 'Monitor', 'Output', 'Persons', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Publications', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Ribosomes', 'Role', 'Scheme', 'Scientist', 'Solutions', 'Source', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'Work', 'base', 'design', 'desire', 'experience', 'knowledge base', 'man', 'novel strategies', 'programs', 'tool']",NIGMS,CARNEGIE-MELLON UNIVERSITY,R01,2008,273906,-0.03242837269011791
"Using Natural Language Processing to Monitor Product Claims Compliance for FDA    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Linguastat, Inc. proposes to develop a means to automate the process of monitoring and identifying companies engaged in false advertising and deceptive practices in the marketing of drugs, dietary supplements, and/or food products. By leveraging state of the art approaches in computational linguistics such as Information Extraction and Natural Language Processing, it should be feasible, with some adaptation, to use this technology to: 1) automatically and continuously monitor the websites, TV transcripts, press releases and other electronic marketing text communications of tens of thousands of companies for various claims and product information 2) automatically ""red-flag"" instances in which claims have a high likelihood of potential harm to consumers, according to FDA priorities 3) automatically identify and extract the companies, products and claims embedded in electronic product information and electronic promotional materials to create a database easily searchable by the FDA and 4) automatically capture web-based or other electronic content for human review and store it as ""evidence."" Such automated technology would enable the FDA to significantly stretch its limited human resource to more effectively and comprehensively identify noncompliant product information, detect deceptive ads and other illegal practices, successfully prosecute offenders, and prevent harm to American consumers. For this Phase I SBIR project we propose to assess the feasibility of automated claims monitoring in three steps: In the first step, we will train information extraction and natural language processing algorithms to extract product marketing claims from text. In the second, step we will apply data mining and rules-based algorithms to assess which claims are likely to be non-compliant and merit further attention by FDA staff. In the third step, we will design and build a database of product claims that allows analysts to search, organize, and prioritize product claims based on the type of claim (e.g. what ailments does the product claim to treat), the type of product, and the likelihood of non- compliance. This technology will enable regulators and consumers to better monitor and detect cases of false, misleading, or deceptive advertising and product information. By enabling more effective enforcement of FDA regulations and giving consumers tools to make better buying decisions, the public health can be better protected by minimizing the impact of products that cause harm, give false hope, or entice consumers to forgo conventional remedies.          n/a",Using Natural Language Processing to Monitor Product Claims Compliance for FDA,7677599,R43FD003406,[' '],FDA,"LINGUASTAT, INC.",R43,2008,20000,-0.0020229688384810476
"HERMES - Help physicians to Extract and aRticulate Multimedia information from li    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Physicians have many questions when seeing patients. Primary care physicians are reported to generate between 0.7 and 18.5 questions for every 10 patient visits. The published medical literature is an important resource helping physicians to access up-to-date clinical information and thereby to enhance the quality of patient care. For example, the case study in the above example (i.e., diagnostic procedures and treatment for cellulites) was published in a ""Clinical Practice"" article in the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM). Although PubMed is frequently used by physicians in large hospitals, it does not return answers to specific questions. Frequently, PubMed returns a large number of articles in response to a specific user query. Physicians have limited time for browsing the articles retrieved; it has been found that physicians spend on average two minutes or less seeking an answer to a question, and that if a search takes longer it is likely to be abandoned. An evaluation study has shown that it takes an average of more than 30 minutes for a healthcare provider to search for answer from PubMed, which makes ""information seeking ... practical only `after hours' and not in the clinical setting."" It has been concluded that a lack of time is the most common obstacle resulting in many unanswered medical questions.       The importance of answering physicians' questions at the point of patient care has been widely recognized by the medical community. Many medical databases (e.g., UpToDate and Thomson MICROMEDEX) provide summaries to answer important medical questions related to patient care. However, most of the summaries are written by medical experts who manually review the literature information. The databases are limited in their scope and timeliness.       We hypothesize that we can develop medical language processing (MLP) approaches to build a fully automated system HERMES - Help physicians to Extract and aRticulate Multimedia information from literature to answer their ad-hoc medical quEstionS. HERMES will automatically retrieve, extract, analyze, and integrate text, image, and video from the literature and formulate them as answers to ad-hoc medical questions posed by physicians. Our preliminary results show that even a limited HERMES working system outperformed other information retrieval systems and can generate answers within a timeframe necessary to meet the demands of physicians. HERMES promise to assist physicians for practicing evidence-based medicine (EBM), the medical practice that involves the explicit use of current best evidence, i.e., high-quality patient-centered clinical research reported in the primary medical literature.       Our specific aims are:       1) Identify information needs from ad-hoc medical questions. We will incorporate rich semantic, statistical, and machine learning approaches to map ad-hoc medical questions to their component question types automatically. A component question type is a generic, simple question type that requires an answer strategy that is different from other component question types.       2) Develop new information retrieval models that integrate domain-specific knowledge for retrieving relevant documents in response to an ad-hoc medical question.       3) Extract relevant text, images, and videos from the retrieved documents in response to an ad-hoc medical question.       4) Integrate text, images, and videos, fusing information to generate a short and coherent multimedia summary.       5) Design a usability study to measure efficacy, accuracy and perceived ease of use of HERMES and to compare HERMES with other information systems.          n/a",HERMES - Help physicians to Extract and aRticulate Multimedia information from li,7502749,R01LM009836,"['Area', 'Back', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Case Study', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Communities', 'Databases', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Edema', 'Erythema', 'Evaluation Studies', 'Evidence Based Medicine', 'Generic Drugs', 'Health Personnel', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Image', 'Information Retrieval', 'Information Retrieval Systems', 'Information Systems', 'Journals', 'Knowledge', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Medicine', 'Modeling', 'Multimedia', 'New England', 'Numbers', 'Pain', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Primary Care Physician', 'PubMed', 'Publishing', 'Redness', 'Reporting', 'Resources', 'Review Literature', 'Semantics', 'System', 'Text', 'Time', 'Toes', 'Ultrasonography', 'Visit', 'Work', 'Writing', 'design', 'foot', 'journal article', 'language processing', 'mecarzole', 'older men', 'patient oriented', 'response', 'usability']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN MILWAUKEE,R01,2008,352226,0.004548762699004601
"Improving Health Outcomes through Computer Generation of Reader-Appropriate Texts    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Many studies have shown that the readability of the health information provided to consumers does not match their general reading levels (Rudd, Moeykens et al. 2000). Even with the efforts of healthcare providers and writers to make materials more readable, today most patient-oriented Web sites, pamphlets, drug-labels, and discharge instructions still require the consumer to have a tenth grade reading level or higher (Nielsen-Bohlman, Panzer et al. 2004). Not infrequently, however, consumer reading levels are as low as fourth grade. To address this problem, we propose developing a computer-based method for providing texts of appropriate readability to a consumer. Recent progress in statistical natural language processing techniques (Barzilay 2003; Barzilay and Elhadad 2003; Elhadad, McKeown et al. 2005) lead us to believe that computer programs can be developed to dramatically increase the range and amount of readable content available to consumers. It may also help improve comprehension, self management and eventually clinical outcome. The general goal of this project is to provide consumers with readable content through the automated translation of content from difficult to understand to easy to understand. The specific aims are 1. To develop a computerized instrument for assessing the readability of health texts. We will enhance existing readability instruments (Zakaluk and Samuels March 1, 1988) by including measurements of health term difficulty, text cohesion, and content organization and layout. 2. To develop a ""Plain English"" tool for translating complex health texts into new versions at targeted readability levels with no critical information loss, using statistical natural language processing techniques. 3. To conduct an evaluation study to verify that providing content with appropriate readability has a positive impact on reader comprehension. We will use as a test bed for our system a general internal medicine clinic and its diabetes patients. We will provide self-care materials to these patients.

"Improving Public Health Grey Literature Access for the Public Health Workforce    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term objective of the proposed project is to provide the public health (PH) workforce with improved access to high quality, relevant PH grey literature reports in order to positively impact the planning, conducting, and evaluating of PH interventions. The project will consist of two components: 1) continuation of user-focused technical system development, and 2) deployment and evaluation of this system's impact on the tasks of the PH workforce in county health departments.      The system will automatically harvest web-based grey literature reports (utilizing rules trained on input from PH professionals) and then produce rich summaries of PH grey literature reports using the model of essential elements of PH intervention reports validated by PH specialists (Turner et al, In Press). After developing a user interface that capitalizes on both natural language querying and the display of search results in a structured, model-based summary, the system will be introduced into several county health departments and evaluated to determine its impact on information flows and uses.      The project will include intrinsic evaluations of: 1) the appropriateness of the grey literature reports harvested by the system; 2) the quality and sufficiency of summaries representing the full reports based on the PH intervention model and; 3) retrieval results for users' queries using metrics of precision and recall. Extrinsic evaluation will be done in PH departments participating in the New York Academy of Medicine's ongoing study of the relationship between information and effectiveness. The research will provide baseline measures. We will evaluate: 1) the ease and frequency of use, perceptions of currency, accuracy, and completeness of retrieved reports by county PH personnel, and; 2) impact of the system's usage on information flows and uses based on internal outcome measures within the county health departments.      The work proposed here shares both the missions of public health and the National Library of Medicine   through the design of an information system that exploits natural language processing technology to   efficiently collect and provide access to quality public health grey literature for the public health workforce.         n/a",Improving Public Health Grey Literature Access for the Public Health Workforce,7414601,G08LM008983,"['Academy', 'Address', 'Basic Science', 'Collection', 'Computer Systems Development', 'County', 'Digital Libraries', 'Effectiveness', 'Elements', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Gray unit of radiation dose', 'Harvest', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Health Professional', 'Health Sciences', 'Improve Access', 'Information Systems', 'Intervention', 'Language', 'Librarians', 'Life', 'Literature', 'MEDLINE', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Metric', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'New York', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome Measure', 'Perception', 'Population', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Retrieval', 'Source', 'Specialist', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Today', 'Training', 'Translating', 'United States National Library of Medicine', 'Update', 'Wood material', 'Work', 'base', 'cost', 'design', 'digital', 'experience', 'feeding', 'improved', 'research to practice', 'tool']",NLM,SYRACUSE UNIVERSITY,G08,2008,142400,0.003039332096763364
"Vanderbilt Genome-Electronic Records Project    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  VGER: The Vanderbilt Genome-Electronic Record project An important potential enabling resource for Personalized Medicine is the combination of a DNA repository with Electronic Medical Record (EMR) systems sufficiently robust to provide excellence in clinical care and to serve as resources for analysis of disease susceptibility and therapeutic outcomes across patient populations. The Vanderbilt EMR is a state of the art clinical and research tool (that includes >1.4 million records), and is associated with a DNA repository which has been in development for over 3 years; these are the key components of VGER, the Vanderbilt Genome-Electronic Records project proposed here. The VGER model acquires DNA from discarded blood samples collected from routine patient care, and can link these to de-identified data extracted and readily updated from the EMR. The phenotype we will analyze here is the QRS duration on the electrocardiogram, since slow conduction (indicated by longer QRS duration) is a marker of arrhythmia susceptibility. This will not only exploit the power of Genome-Wide Association (GWA) approaches to generate new biologic knowledge that impacts an area of public health concern, but also provides a platform for the development of tools, such as Natural Language Processing approaches, to optimally mine EMRs. This project brings together a team of investigators with nationally recognized records of accomplishment in genome science, medical ethics, bioinformatics, de-identification science, and translational and cardiovascular medicine to address four Specific Aims: (1) perform a GWA comparing samples from subjects with QRS durations at the extremes of the normal range, and validate by genotyping high likelihood associations in prospectively ascertained clinical trial sets for QRS duration and for arrhythmia susceptibility; (2) evaluate the validity and utility of structured and unstructured components of EMR data for genome-phenome correlations; (3) assess the ethical, scientific, and societal advantages and disadvantages of the VGER model, and determine best practices for oversight, community involvement, and communication as the resource grows; and (4) develop and evaluate formal privacy protection models for data derived from databanks and EMRs, establishing data sharing and integration practices. We also include here a proposal to develop the Administrative Coordinating Center whose mission will be to facilitate communication and collaboration among nodes in this network, the NHGRI, and external advisors. We subscribe to a vision of Personalized Medicine in which genomic and other patient-specific information drives personalized, predictive, preemptive, and participatory health care, and VGER represents an important step in that direction.           n/a",Vanderbilt Genome-Electronic Records Project,7502672,U01HG004603,"['Address', 'Area', 'Arrhythmia', 'Arts', 'Bioinformatics', 'Blood specimen', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Commit', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disadvantaged', 'Disease', 'Disease susceptibility', 'EKG QRS Complex', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Electronics', 'Ethics', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Healthcare', 'Heart Diseases', 'Institution', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Legal', 'Link', 'Measures', 'Medical Ethics', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Normal Range', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Privacy', 'Public Health', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Ethics Committees', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Translational Research', 'Update', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Vision', 'concept', 'data modeling', 'egg', 'endophenotype', 'genome wide association study', 'heart rhythm', 'indexing', 'repository', 'tool', 'tool development']",NHGRI,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,U01,2008,1432331,-0.013535278914862461
"Optimal Micro-Data Switching: An Enhanced Framework and Decision Tool for Confid    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The objective of this project is the development of an innovative technique to avoid disclosure of confidential data in public use tabular data. Our proposed technique, called Optimal Data Switching (OS), overcomes the limitations and disadvantages found in currently deployed disclosure limitation methods. Statistical databases for public use pose a critical problem of identifying how to make the data available for analysis without disclosing information that would infringe on privacy, violate confidentiality, or endanger national security. Organizations in both the public and private sectors have a major stake in this confidentiality protection problem, given the fact that access to data is essential for advancing research and formulating policy. Yet, the possibility of extracting certain sensitive elements of information from the data can jeopardize the welfare of these organizations and potentially, in some instances, the welfare of the society in which they operate. The challenge is, therefore, to represent the data in a form that permits accurate analysis for supporting research, decision-making and policy initiatives, while preventing an unscrupulous or ill-intentioned party from exploiting the data for harmful consequences. Our goal is to build on the latest advances in optimization, to which the OptTek Systems, Inc. (OptTek) research team has made pioneering contributions, to provide a framework based on optimal data switching, enabling the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and other organizations to effectively meet the challenge of confidentiality protection. The framework we propose is structured to be easy to use in a wide array of application settings and diverse user environments, from client-server to web-based, regardless of whether the micro-data is continuous, ordinal, binary, or any combination of these types. The successful development of such a framework, and the computer-based method for implementing it, is badly needed and will be of value to many types of organizations, not only in the public sector but also in the private sector, for whom the incentive to publish data is both economic as well as scientific. Examples in the public sector are evident, where organizations like CDC and the U.S. Census Bureau exist for the purpose of collecting, analyzing and publishing data for analysis by other parties. Numerous examples are also encountered in the private sector, notably in banking and financial services, healthcare (including drug companies and medical research institutions), market research, oil exploration, computational biology, renewable and sustainable energy, retail sales, product development, and a wide variety of other areas. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In the process of accumulating and disseminating public health data for reporting purposes, various uses, and statistical analysis, we must guarantee that individual records describing each person or establishment are protected. Organizations in both the public and private sectors have a major stake in this confidentiality protection problem, given the fact that access to data is essential for advancing research and formulating policy. This project proposes the development of a robust methodology and practical framework to deliver an efficient and effective tool to protect the confidentiality in published tabular data.                      n/a",Optimal Micro-Data Switching: An Enhanced Framework and Decision Tool for Confid,7535414,R43MH086138,"['Accounting', 'American', 'Area', 'Cells', 'Censuses', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Client', 'Computational Biology', 'Confidentiality', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Reporting', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Analysis', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Disadvantaged', 'Disclosure', 'Economics', 'Elements', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Goals', 'Health Personnel', 'Healthcare', 'Incentives', 'Individual', 'Inferior', 'Institution', 'Machine Learning', 'Market Research', 'Medical Research', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'National Security', 'Oils', 'Online Systems', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Policies', 'Policy Making', 'Privacy', 'Private Sector', 'Problem Solving', 'Process', 'Property', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Public Sector', 'Publishing', 'Purpose', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Respondent', 'Sales', 'Services', 'Social Welfare', 'Societies', 'Solutions', 'Structure', 'Support of Research', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'base', 'computer framework', 'data mining', 'desire', 'innovation', 'interest', 'prevent', 'tool']",NIMH,"OPTTEK SYSTEMS, INC.",R43,2008,99843,-0.007945695835310414
"NLP Foundational Studies & Ontologies for Syndromic Surveillance from ED Reports    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Many NLP applications have been successfully developed to extract information from text. Most of the   applications have focused on identifying individual clinical conditions in textual records, which is the first step in making the conditions available to computerized applications. However, identifying individual instances of clinical conditions is not sufficient for many medical informatics tasks - the context surrounding the condition is crucial for integrating the information within the text to determine the clinical state of a patient. We propose to perform in-depth studies on NLP issues requiring knowledge of the context of clinical conditions in clinical records. We will focus our research by using syndromic surveillance from emergency department (ED) reports as a case study.      For this proposal, we will test the following hypothesis: An NLP system that indexes clinical concepts and integrates contextual information modifying the concepts can identify acute clinical conditions from ED reports as well as physicians can.      We will identify clinical concepts necessary for surveillance of seven syndromes, including respiratory,   gastrointestinal, neurological, rash, hemorrhagic, constitutional, and botulinic. To evaluate the hypothesis, we will perform the following specific aims:      Aim 1. Perform in-depth, foundational studies on four NLP topics to gain a deeper understanding of the      pertinent NLP research capabilities required for identification of acute clinical conditions from ED reports, including negation, uncertainty, temporal discrimination, and finding validation;      Aim 2. Apply the knowledge learned from the foundational studies to develop and evaluate an automated application for ED reports that will determine the values for clinical variables relevant to identifying patients with any of seven syndromes.      The research is innovative, because it will generate an in-depth study of multiple NLP topics crucial to   understanding a patient's clinical state from textual records and will focus on contextual understanding and analysis. The research will be guided by linguistic principles, by the semantics and discourse structure of ED reports, and by the application area of biosurveillance. Because we will develop research methods and tools that are customized to a particular domain, we will constrain the research space, which will provide direction and enhance the chance for success. However, the methods and tools generated by this research should be extensible to other clinical report types and to other domain applications, because we will explicitly specify and study NLP concepts and relationships that are common to many application areas.             n/a",NLP Foundational Studies & Ontologies for Syndromic Surveillance from ED Reports,7469551,R01LM009427,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Acute', 'Area', 'Case Study', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Condition', 'Constitutional', 'Depth', 'Detection', 'Discrimination', 'Exanthema', 'Exhibits', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Linguistics', 'Medical Informatics', 'Medical Informatics Applications', 'Medical Surveillance', 'Methods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neurologic', 'Ontology', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Semantics', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Structure', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Uncertainty', 'Validation', 'computerized', 'concept', 'gastrointestinal', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'quality assurance', 'respiratory', 'success', 'syndromic surveillance', 'tool']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2008,392337,0.0022075791383727337
"Informatics Core for the Collaborative Initiative on Fetal Alcohol Spectrum disor    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Informatics Core is part of the Consortium for the ""Collaborative Initiative on Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders"" (CIFASD). The theme of this collaborative initiative is a cross-cultural assessment of ""fetal alcohol spectrum disorder"" (FASD). The CIFASD will coordinate basic, behavioral, and clinical investigators in a multidisciplinary research project to better inform approaches aimed at developing effective intervention and treatment approaches for FASD. It will involve the input and contributions from basic researchers, behavioral scientists, and clinical investigators with the willingness to utilize novel and cutting-edge techniques so as not to simply replicate previous or ongoing work, but rather to try and move it forward in a rigorous fashion. The Informatics Core will develop and maintain the CIFASD Data Repository, which will be used to collect, maintain and distribute data generated by the various participants in the consortium. The Informatics Core will be responsible for working with the other consortium participants to define a Data Dictionary to be used in standardizing data collection, enabling the transfer of data to and from the CIFASD Data Repository, consulting on how to establish local data management systems, providing both software tools and consulting to consortium participants, and producing status reports about the progress of the various projects within the consortium. The Informatics Core draws on a wealth of resources, experience, and expertise at Indiana University in information technology infrastructure and data management, The CIFASD Data Repository will be developed on Indiana University's state-of-the-art central supercomputing facilities, taking advantage of Indiana University's strong commitment to institutional computational resources. Resources that will be used to implement the CIFASD Data Repository include multiple supercomputers, an array of readily available database and statistical software, and a high- speed, secure, robust data archiving system capable of storing duplicate copies in multiple physical locations separated by more than fifty miles. The Informatics Core will use these extraordinary computational resources to provide a single, highly secure location for consortium participants to obtain the cross-cultural data that will enable the CIFASD to meet its goals of developing novel techniques for intervention and treatment of FASD.           n/a",Informatics Core for the Collaborative Initiative on Fetal Alcohol Spectrum disor,7502758,U24AA014818,"['Address', 'Adolescent', 'Affect', 'Africa', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohol-Related Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Alcohols', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Archives', 'Arts', 'Basic Science', 'Behavioral', 'Binding Sites', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Choline', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Computer software', 'Condition', 'Consult', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Data Storage and Retrieval', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dictionary', 'Dietary Intervention', 'Drug Design', 'Dysmorphology', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Elements', 'Emotional', 'Ethanol', 'Ethnic group', 'Face', 'Fetal Alcohol Exposure', 'Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder', 'Fetal Alcohol Syndrome', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Indiana', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Infant Development', 'Informal Social Control', 'Informatics', 'Information Storage', 'Information Technology', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Language', 'Language Development', 'Life', 'Location', 'Los Angeles', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Moscow', 'Mothers', 'Mus', 'Names', 'Neonatal', 'Neural Cell Adhesion Molecule L1', 'Neurobiology', 'New Mexico', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Population', 'Pregnancy', 'Principal Investigator', 'Range', 'Rattus', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Request for Applications', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Schools', 'Scientist', 'Secure', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Sheep', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Software Tools', 'Specificity', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'Sum', 'Supercomputing', 'Supplementation', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Time', 'Toddler', 'Ukraine', 'Ultrasonography', 'Universities', 'Woman', 'Work', 'alcohol exposure', 'alcohol sensitivity', 'analog', 'brain behavior', 'brain morphology', 'cognitive control', 'critical developmental period', 'data integration', 'data management', 'distributed data', 'drinking', 'experience', 'fetal', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'in utero', 'infancy', 'literacy', 'mouse model', 'multidisciplinary', 'neurobehavioral', 'northern plains', 'novel', 'prenatal', 'programs', 'prospective', 'quality assurance', 'reconstruction', 'repository', 'social', 'supercomputer', 'three dimensional structure', 'transmission process', 'willingness']",NIAAA,INDIANA UNIVERSITY BLOOMINGTON,U24,2008,186589,-0.06618220815884561
"Statistical NLP Analysis of Cross-discipline Clinical Text emerging trend in computational linguistics is melding natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML) to help computers make sense of human-generated free text. The blending of these disciplines is relatively rare in biomedical inforrnatics. Past medical NLP/ML research work is biased heavily towards linguistic methods that attempt to reason about grammar and syntax aided by a domain-focal knowledge base (e.g., one for radiology or one for clinical pathology). The aim of the work proposed here takes a different tack: exploring the utility of a statistical approach to clinical NLP, one augmented by machine learning and concentrating on general progress notes from across multiple clinical domains. The specific clinical goal will be to identify adverse drug events described implicitly or explicitly in inpatient progress notes. Rather than relying on a narrow domain focus to provide enough context restriction to make text interpretation tractable, this approach will use statistical patterns in note author information (e.g., profession, note type, treating ward) and patient information (e.g., admit diagnosis, procedures performed, temporal note relationships) for context restriction. The research component of this proposal is divided into two categories: three small-scale projects designed to rapidly hone new skills developed under the training component, and a large-scale project that assesses the feasibility of cross-discipline clinical text analysis. n/a",Statistical NLP Analysis of Cross-discipline Clinical Text,6944955,F38LM008478,"['Categories', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Pathology', 'Computers', 'Coupled', 'Diagnosis', 'Discipline', 'Event', 'Fellowship', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Inpatients', 'Linguistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Procedures', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Research', 'Statistical Study', 'Text', 'Training', 'Work', 'Writing', 'design', 'experience', 'knowledge base', 'skills', 'syntax', 'theories', 'tool', 'trend', 'ward']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,F38,2007,38768,-0.005211664956575054
"Discovering and Applying Knowledge in Clinical Databases    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The ongoing goal of our project, ""Discovering and applying knowledge in clinical databases,"" is to develop and apply methods to exploit electronic medical record data for decision support, with an emphasis on narrative data. Since the inception of our project as an R29 in 1994, we have been developing methods for preparing raw electronic medical record data, applying and evaluating natural language processing, developing data mining techniques including machine learning, and putting the results to use for clinical care and research.       In this competing continuation, we propose to address the temporal information in the electronic medical record and to apply natural language processing and temporal processing to the task of syndromic surveillance in collaboration with the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (NYC DOHMH).       We have begun work on a temporal processing system. It extracts temporal assertions stated in narrative reports, uses the MedLEE natural language processor to parse the non-temporal information, infers implicit temporal assertions based on a knowledge base, and produces the information in the form of a simple temporal constraint satisfaction problem. The latter can be used to answer questions about the time of events and the temporal relation between pairs of events. We propose to complete the system, expand the knowledge base, speed computation, address the uncertainty of temporal assertions, incorporate temporal information from structured data, and evaluate the system.       NYC DOHMH has a mature syndromic surveillance system that watches over almost eight million persons, and it has as-yet unexploited data sources in the form of narrative and structured electronic medical records. We propose to apply natural language processing and our proposed temporal processing to convert the data to a form appropriate for surveillance. We will evaluate the incremental benefit of structured data, narrative data, and temporally processed narrative data.           n/a",Discovering and Applying Knowledge in Clinical Databases,7288319,R01LM006910,"['Address', 'Area', 'Caring', 'Cities', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Event', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical Surveillance', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'New York City', 'Persons', 'Preparation', 'Process', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Uncertainty', 'Work', 'base', 'data mining', 'improved', 'knowledge base', 'satisfaction', 'syndromic surveillance']",NLM,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2007,345833,-0.010372977622591508
"Answering Information Needs in Workflow    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Needs for information arise continuously during the course of clinical practice, especially for physicians in training, e.g. when examining a patient or participating in rounds. In most of these situations, it is difficult or impossible for the clinician to immediately access appropriate information resources. Most needs are never adequately articulated or recorded, and consequently are forgotten by the end of the day. Moreover, when clinicians do recall information needs, they don't act on them, due to the significant limitations of current retrieval systems and the exigencies of clinical practice. The specific aims of the proposed project are: 1) to capture information needs in a convenient manner at the moment they occur using different modalities such as text input and voice capture on hand-held devices, 2) to translate high-level information needs into complex search strategies that adapt to user needs and are tuned to the capabilities of resources, and 3) to deliver relevant materials to the clinician in an accessible format and in a timely manner. The project will develop a central hub for addressing the information needs of medical students and residents, to be transmitted electronically as they occur in the field. A unique feature of the project is the use of natural language processing technology to identify context, goals and preferences in clinicians' questions. The major innovation is the generation of complex search strategies that exploit this contextual information, based on studies of human searching experts (reference librarians).              n/a",Answering Information Needs in Workflow,7217497,R01LM008799,"['Address', 'Biological Models', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Face', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Human', 'Information Resources', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Librarians', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medical Errors', 'Medical Students', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Process', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Retrieval', 'Software Tools', 'System', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Textbooks', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Voice', 'Work', 'base', 'day', 'forgetting', 'innovation', 'preference', 'speech processing', 'symposium']",NLM,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2007,361696,0.00195407884567279
"Semantic and Machine Learning Methods for Mining Connections in the UMLS    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       The Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) is an invaluable resource for the biomedical community.   One of the intended uses of the UMLS Metathesaurus is to support the translation of terms from a source terminology into terms in a target terminology. It is evident from the research literature on the UMLS that users generally need to perform more broader types of ""translations"" that involve finding terms with closest meaning to source term (mapping), finding terms that are related to source term and can serve as proxy for various functions (e.g. information retrieval, knowledge discovery) or finding target terms that satisfy some structural or semantic constraint (e.g. information theoretic distance). The methods for finding such ""translations"" or connections between terms in Meta (other than the case of one-to-one synonymy) are not at all clear. Previous attempts to exploit such connections have depended on either manual selection of relevant connections, or problem-specific algorithms that use expert knowledge about the relative suitability of various inter-concept relationships. We believe that machine learning techniques offer automated, generalizable approaches that are appropriate for use with the UMLS, given the large set of potential connections and the need for a problem-independent approach. We hypothesize that learning strategies that exploit the relational features, scale free properties and probabilistic dependencies of connections in the UMLS will identify meaningful inter-term relationships and that a combined approach will perform better across different problem domains when compared to any of the approaches in isolation. We will evaluate the proposed learning algorithms with training connections from a variety of problem domains in biomedicine. We will disseminate the successful algorithms via the UMLS Knowledge Source API toolkit for mining and visualizing the connections. We believe that the UMLS provides a unique fertile ground to develop novel semantic relational mining methods and advance our understanding of mining large biomedical concept graphs.             n/a",Semantic and Machine Learning Methods for Mining Connections in the UMLS,7299922,R21LM009638,"['Algorithms', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dependency', 'Disease', 'Graph', 'Healthcare', 'Information Retrieval', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Nature', 'Ontology', 'Organism', 'Pathway interactions', 'Property', 'Proxy', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Retrieval', 'Sampling', 'Semantics', 'Social Network', 'Solutions', 'Source', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Terminology', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Unified Medical Language System', 'Work', 'base', 'biomedical resource', 'concept', 'interest', 'metathesaurus', 'microbial alkaline proteinase inhibitor', 'novel', 'success']",NLM,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R21,2007,181125,-0.02672105552847615
"Technology Development for a MolBio Knowledge-Base Since the introduction of the Mycin system more than 25 years ago, it has widely been hypothesized that extensive, well-represented computer knowledge-bases will facilitate a wide variety of scientific and clinical tasks. Driven by growing knowledge-management challenges adsing from the proliferation of high- throughput instrumentation, recently created knowledge-bases in areas related to genomics and related aspects of contemporary biology, such as the Gene Ontology, EcoCyc and PharmGKB, have begun to become integrated into the laboratory practices of a growing number of molecular biologists. However, these successful molecular biology knowledge-bases (MBKBs) have two drawbacks which impede their more general application: each has been narrowed to a particular special purpose, either in its domain of applicability or in the scope of knowledge represented, and each of these knowledge-bases was constructed largely on the basis of enormous human effort. Given the current state of molecular biology data and recent iadvances in database integration and information extraction technology, we proposed to test the following hypothesis: Current computational technology and existing human-curated knowledge resources are sufficient to build an extensive, high-quality computational knowledge-base of molecular biology. To test this hypothesis we propose to first create tools which can (a) automatically link incommensurate knowledge sources using semantic linking, and (b) use natural language processing techniques to extract new information from NCBrs GeneRIFs and from the GO definitions fields; and second, to evaluate the results of these methods by carefully quantifying the degree to which the induced linkages and extracted assertions are complete, consistent and correct. Although we propose to construct a broad and rich knowledge-base in order to develop and test the adequacy of largely automated methods to leverage existing human-curated collections, we do not propose to build a comprehensive MBKB. n/a",Technology Development for a MolBio Knowledge-Base,7473405,R01LM008111,"['Address', 'Area', 'Biology', 'Class', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Evaluation', 'Facility Construction Funding Category', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Human', 'Indium', 'Informatics', 'Information Resources', 'Information Resources Management', 'Investments', 'Knowledge', 'Knowledge Base (Computer)', 'Laboratories', 'Language', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Metric System', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Biology', 'Mus', 'Names', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Numbers', 'Ontology', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Plug-in', 'Proteins', 'Purpose', 'Semantics', 'Source', 'SwissProt', 'System', 'Taxonomy', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Training', 'Work', 'base', 'concept', 'data integration', 'gene function', 'heuristics', 'instrumentation', 'knowledge base', 'success', 'technology development', 'tool']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,R01,2007,234058,-0.03316844314741296
"Feasibility of a Natural Language Processing-based Dental Charting Application    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The absence of a flexible, robust, and accurate natural language interface is a significant barrier to the direct use of computer-based patient records by dental clinicians. While providing patient care, dentists, hygienists and assistants are handicapped in using a keyboard and mouse to interact with a computer, primarily because of infection control concerns. The objective of this proposal is to develop and evaluate a prototype dental charting system with a speech-driven interface that will allow the dentist to chart dental conditions using natural language. The system will use Natural Language Processing (NLP) to extract the key concepts associated with 16 dental conditions from transcribed dental examinations. These concepts, coded using the standardized terminologies, would provide a structured summary of a patient's initial dental exam. The proposal has two aims: 1) evaluate the accuracy of speech recognition technology for clinical dental examinations; and 2) develop and evaluate an NLP application for mapping transcribed text to a structured dental chart. This proposal describes a new, exploratory and innovative research project that could radically impact the practice of dental charting. Expected outcomes for this proposal include: 1) an understanding of the accuracy of speech recognition for real-time dictated dental exams; and 2) NLP-based tools to automatically chart restorative and periodontal conditions for each tooth into a structured dental chart. This developmental work will provide a strong foundation for developing a chairside NLP-based dental charting application that would automatically generate a structured dental chart suitable for chairside decision support.          n/a",Feasibility of a Natural Language Processing-based Dental Charting Application,7305430,R21DE018158,"['Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Code', 'Computerized Patient Records', 'Computers', 'Condition', 'Data', 'Dental', 'Dental Dictionaries', 'Dental General Practice', 'Dental Hygienists', 'Dental Informatics', 'Dental Offices', 'Dental Records', 'Dentistry', 'Dentists', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Disabled Persons', 'Documentation', 'Evaluation', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Human Resources', 'Infection Control', 'Language', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Medical', 'Medical Transcription', 'Mus', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Numbers', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Reference Standards', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Services', 'Speech', 'Speech Recognition Software', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Technology', 'Terminology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Tooth structure', 'Training', 'Transcript', 'Universities', 'Vocabulary', 'Work', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'concept', 'dental structure', 'design', 'digital', 'experience', 'handicapping condition', 'improved', 'innovation', 'prevent', 'prototype', 'restoration', 'speech recognition', 'tool']",NIDCR,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R21,2007,229030,-0.022068771692337126
"Assisting Systematic Review Preparation Using Automated Document Classification    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       The work proposed in this new investigator initiated project studies the hypothesis that machine learning-based text classification techniques can add significant efficiencies to the process of updating systematic reviews (SRs). Because new information constantly becomes available, medicine is constantly changing, and SRs must undergo periodic updates in order to correctly represent the best available medical knowledge at a given time.       To support studying this hypothesis, the work proposed here will undertake four specific aims:   1. Refinement and further development of text classification algorithms optimized for use in classifying   literature for the update of systematic reviews on a variety of therapeutic domains. Comparative analysis using several different machine learning techniques and strategies will be studied, as well as various means of representing the journal articles as feature vectors input to the process.   2. Identification and evaluation of systematic review expert preferences and trade offs between high recall and high precision classification systems. There are several opportunities for including this technology in the process of creating SRs. Each of these applications has separate and unique precision and recall tradeoff thresholds that will be studied based on the benefit to systematic reviews.   3. Prospective evaluation of text classification algorithms. We will verify that our approach performs as   expected on future data.   4. Development of comprehensive gold standard test and training sets to motivate and evaluate the   proposed and future work in this area.      The long term relevance of this research to public health is that automated document classification will   enable more efficient use of expert resources to create systematic reviews.

"Using Natural Language Processing to Monitor Product Claims Compliance for FDA    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Linguastat, Inc. proposes to develop a means to automate the process of monitoring and identifying companies engaged in false advertising and deceptive practices in the marketing of drugs, dietary supplements, and/or food products. By leveraging state of the art approaches in computational linguistics such as Information Extraction and Natural Language Processing, it should be feasible, with some adaptation, to use this technology to: 1) automatically and continuously monitor the websites, TV transcripts, press releases and other electronic marketing text communications of tens of thousands of companies for various claims and product information 2) automatically ""red-flag"" instances in which claims have a high likelihood of potential harm to consumers, according to FDA priorities 3) automatically identify and extract the companies, products and claims embedded in electronic product information and electronic promotional materials to create a database easily searchable by the FDA and 4) automatically capture web-based or other electronic content for human review and store it as ""evidence."" Such automated technology would enable the FDA to significantly stretch its limited human resource to more effectively and comprehensively identify noncompliant product information, detect deceptive ads and other illegal practices, successfully prosecute offenders, and prevent harm to American consumers. For this Phase I SBIR project we propose to assess the feasibility of automated claims monitoring in three steps: In the first step, we will train information extraction and natural language processing algorithms to extract product marketing claims from text. In the second, step we will apply data mining and rules-based algorithms to assess which claims are likely to be non-compliant and merit further attention by FDA staff. In the third step, we will design and build a database of product claims that allows analysts to search, organize, and prioritize product claims based on the type of claim (e.g. what ailments does the product claim to treat), the type of product, and the likelihood of non- compliance. This technology will enable regulators and consumers to better monitor and detect cases of false, misleading, or deceptive advertising and product information. By enabling more effective enforcement of FDA regulations and giving consumers tools to make better buying decisions, the public health can be better protected by minimizing the impact of products that cause harm, give false hope, or entice consumers to forgo conventional remedies.          n/a",Using Natural Language Processing to Monitor Product Claims Compliance for FDA,7326883,R43FD003406,[' '],FDA,"LINGUASTAT, INC.",R43,2007,99773,-0.0020229688384810476
"HERMES - Help physicians to Extract and aRticulate Multimedia information from li    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Physicians have many questions when seeing patients. Primary care physicians are reported to generate between 0.7 and 18.5 questions for every 10 patient visits. The published medical literature is an important resource helping physicians to access up-to-date clinical information and thereby to enhance the quality of patient care. For example, the case study in the above example (i.e., diagnostic procedures and treatment for cellulites) was published in a ""Clinical Practice"" article in the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM). Although PubMed is frequently used by physicians in large hospitals, it does not return answers to specific questions. Frequently, PubMed returns a large number of articles in response to a specific user query. Physicians have limited time for browsing the articles retrieved; it has been found that physicians spend on average two minutes or less seeking an answer to a question, and that if a search takes longer it is likely to be abandoned. An evaluation study has shown that it takes an average of more than 30 minutes for a healthcare provider to search for answer from PubMed, which makes ""information seeking ... practical only `after hours' and not in the clinical setting."" It has been concluded that a lack of time is the most common obstacle resulting in many unanswered medical questions.       The importance of answering physicians' questions at the point of patient care has been widely recognized by the medical community. Many medical databases (e.g., UpToDate and Thomson MICROMEDEX) provide summaries to answer important medical questions related to patient care. However, most of the summaries are written by medical experts who manually review the literature information. The databases are limited in their scope and timeliness.       We hypothesize that we can develop medical language processing (MLP) approaches to build a fully automated system HERMES - Help physicians to Extract and aRticulate Multimedia information from literature to answer their ad-hoc medical quEstionS. HERMES will automatically retrieve, extract, analyze, and integrate text, image, and video from the literature and formulate them as answers to ad-hoc medical questions posed by physicians. Our preliminary results show that even a limited HERMES working system outperformed other information retrieval systems and can generate answers within a timeframe necessary to meet the demands of physicians. HERMES promise to assist physicians for practicing evidence-based medicine (EBM), the medical practice that involves the explicit use of current best evidence, i.e., high-quality patient-centered clinical research reported in the primary medical literature.       Our specific aims are:       1) Identify information needs from ad-hoc medical questions. We will incorporate rich semantic, statistical, and machine learning approaches to map ad-hoc medical questions to their component question types automatically. A component question type is a generic, simple question type that requires an answer strategy that is different from other component question types.       2) Develop new information retrieval models that integrate domain-specific knowledge for retrieving relevant documents in response to an ad-hoc medical question.       3) Extract relevant text, images, and videos from the retrieved documents in response to an ad-hoc medical question.       4) Integrate text, images, and videos, fusing information to generate a short and coherent multimedia summary.       5) Design a usability study to measure efficacy, accuracy and perceived ease of use of HERMES and to compare HERMES with other information systems.          n/a",HERMES - Help physicians to Extract and aRticulate Multimedia information from li,7380099,R01LM009836,"['Area', 'Back', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Case Study', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Communities', 'Databases', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Edema', 'Erythema', 'Evaluation Studies', 'Evidence Based Medicine', 'Generic Drugs', 'Health Personnel', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Image', 'Information Retrieval', 'Information Retrieval Systems', 'Information Systems', 'Journals', 'Knowledge', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Medicine', 'Modeling', 'Multimedia', 'New England', 'Numbers', 'Pain', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Primary Care Physician', 'PubMed', 'Publishing', 'Redness', 'Reporting', 'Resources', 'Review Literature', 'Semantics', 'System', 'Text', 'Time', 'Toes', 'Ultrasonography', 'Visit', 'Work', 'Writing', 'design', 'foot', 'journal article', 'language processing', 'mecarzole', 'older men', 'patient oriented', 'response', 'usability']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN MILWAUKEE,R01,2007,383550,0.004548762699004601
"Improving Health Outcomes through Computer Generation of Reader-Appropriate Texts    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Many studies have shown that the readability of the health information provided to consumers does not match their general reading levels (Rudd, Moeykens et al. 2000). Even with the efforts of healthcare providers and writers to make materials more readable, today most patient-oriented Web sites, pamphlets, drug-labels, and discharge instructions still require the consumer to have a tenth grade reading level or higher (Nielsen-Bohlman, Panzer et al. 2004). Not infrequently, however, consumer reading levels are as low as fourth grade. To address this problem, we propose developing a computer-based method for providing texts of appropriate readability to a consumer. Recent progress in statistical natural language processing techniques (Barzilay 2003; Barzilay and Elhadad 2003; Elhadad, McKeown et al. 2005) lead us to believe that computer programs can be developed to dramatically increase the range and amount of readable content available to consumers. It may also help improve comprehension, self management and eventually clinical outcome. The general goal of this project is to provide consumers with readable content through the automated translation of content from difficult to understand to easy to understand. The specific aims are 1. To develop a computerized instrument for assessing the readability of health texts. We will enhance existing readability instruments (Zakaluk and Samuels March 1, 1988) by including measurements of health term difficulty, text cohesion, and content organization and layout. 2. To develop a ""Plain English"" tool for translating complex health texts into new versions at targeted readability levels with no critical information loss, using statistical natural language processing techniques. 3. To conduct an evaluation study to verify that providing content with appropriate readability has a positive impact on reader comprehension. We will use as a test bed for our system a general internal medicine clinic and its diabetes patients. We will provide self-care materials to these patients. Relevance to public health: The proposed development of a readability assessment instrument and ""Plain English"" tool will help translating complex health materials into reader-appropriate texts. It has the potential of making the vast amount of available information in the health domain more accessible to the lay public.              n/a",Improving Health Outcomes through Computer Generation of Reader-Appropriate Texts,7303652,R01DK075837,"['Address', 'Beds', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Comprehension', 'Computers', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Drug Labeling', 'Evaluation Studies', 'Exercise', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Health education', 'Home environment', 'Instruction', 'Internal Medicine', 'Internet', 'Lead', 'Measurement', 'Metabolic Control', 'Methods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nursing Faculty', 'Outcome', 'Pamphlets', 'Patients', 'Public Health', 'Range', 'Readability', 'Reader', 'Reading', 'Score', 'Self Care', 'Self Management', 'Site', 'Smog', 'Software Tools', 'System', 'Teaching Materials', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Today', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Weight maintenance regimen', 'Work', 'Writing', 'base', 'cohesion', 'computer program', 'computerized', 'improved', 'instrument', 'literacy', 'patient oriented', 'prevent', 'programs', 'tool']",NIDDK,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2007,435682,-0.006416188012984192

"Improving Public Health Grey Literature Access for the Public Health Workforce    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term objective of the proposed project is to provide the public health (PH) workforce with improved access to high quality, relevant PH grey literature reports in order to positively impact the planning, conducting, and evaluating of PH interventions. The project will consist of two components: 1) continuation of user-focused technical system development, and 2) deployment and evaluation of this system's impact on the tasks of the PH workforce in county health departments.      The system will automatically harvest web-based grey literature reports (utilizing rules trained on input from PH professionals) and then produce rich summaries of PH grey literature reports using the model of essential elements of PH intervention reports validated by PH specialists (Turner et al, In Press). After developing a user interface that capitalizes on both natural language querying and the display of search results in a structured, model-based summary, the system will be introduced into several county health departments and evaluated to determine its impact on information flows and uses.      The project will include intrinsic evaluations of: 1) the appropriateness of the grey literature reports harvested by the system; 2) the quality and sufficiency of summaries representing the full reports based on the PH intervention model and; 3) retrieval results for users' queries using metrics of precision and recall. Extrinsic evaluation will be done in PH departments participating in the New York Academy of Medicine's ongoing study of the relationship between information and effectiveness. The research will provide baseline measures. We will evaluate: 1) the ease and frequency of use, perceptions of currency, accuracy, and completeness of retrieved reports by county PH personnel, and; 2) impact of the system's usage on information flows and uses based on internal outcome measures within the county health departments.      The work proposed here shares both the missions of public health and the National Library of Medicine   through the design of an information system that exploits natural language processing technology to   efficiently collect and provide access to quality public health grey literature for the public health workforce.         n/a",Improving Public Health Grey Literature Access for the Public Health Workforce,7195053,G08LM008983,"['Academy', 'Address', 'Basic Science', 'Collection', 'Computer Systems Development', 'County', 'Digital Libraries', 'Effectiveness', 'Elements', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Gray unit of radiation dose', 'Harvest', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Health Professional', 'Health Sciences', 'Improve Access', 'Information Systems', 'Intervention', 'Language', 'Librarians', 'Life', 'Literature', 'MEDLINE', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Metric', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'New York', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome Measure', 'Perception', 'Population', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Retrieval', 'Source', 'Specialist', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Today', 'Training', 'Translating', 'United States National Library of Medicine', 'Update', 'Wood material', 'Work', 'base', 'cost', 'design', 'digital', 'experience', 'feeding', 'improved', 'research to practice', 'tool']",NLM,SYRACUSE UNIVERSITY,G08,2007,145510,0.003039332096763364
"Bioconductor: an open computing resource for genomics    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Bioconductor project provides an open resource for the development and distribution of innovative reliable software for computational biology and bioinformatics. The range of available software is broad and rapidly growing as are both the user community and the developer community. The project maintains a web portal for delivering software and documentation to end users as well as an active mailing list. Additional services for developers include a software archive, mailing list and assistance and advice program development and design      We propose an active development strategy designed to meet new challenges while simultaneously providing user and developer support for existing tools and methods. In particular we emphasize a design strategy that accommodates the imperfect, yet evolving nature of biological knowledge and the relatively rapid development of new experimental technologies. Software solutions must be able to rapidly adapt and to facilitate new problems when they arise.      CRITQUE 1:      The Bioconductor project began in 2001. In 2002 it was awarded a BISTI grant for three years 2003-2006). During this time the project has expanded and provided support for a world wide community of researchers. This is a proposal for continued development for Bioconductor, which is a set of statistical programs which are specifically tailored to the computatational biology community. Bioconductor is composed of over 130 R packages that have been contributed by a large number of developers. The software packages range from state of the art statistical methods which typically are used in microarray analysis, to annotation tools, to plotting functions, GUIs, to sequence alignment and data management packages. Contributions to and usage of Bioconductor is growing rapidly and the applicants are requesting support to continue its development as well as general logistical support for software distribution and quality assurance. The proposal includes a research component for Bioconductor which will involve the development of analysis techniques. This will include optimization of the R statistical analyses, statistical processing of Affymetrix data, analysis of SNP data, improved standards, data storage, retreivals from NCBI, sequence management, machine learning, web services and distributed computing.      SCIENTIFIC MERIT   The applicants address many issues that are crucial to the success of a large open source project with multiple contributors. Examples of training, scientific publication, documentation and resource development run throughout the proposal. Many tangible examples were given on the usage of the system by the scientific community.        EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN   This is a description of their management workflow for the project which does a good job of demonstrating the technical excellence brought to the project by this group. 1) Build annotation packages every three months, Integrate changes in annotation source data structure into annotation package building code. 2) Maintain project website, mailing lists, source control archive. Organize web resources for short course and conferences. 3) Improve existing software. 4) Sustain automated nightly builds. Work with developers whose packages fail to pass QA. 5) Resolve cross-platform issues. 6) Review new submissions. Answer questions on the mailing lists. 7) Use software engineering best practices. Develop unit testing strategies. Design appropriate classes and methods for new data types. Refactor existing code for better interoperability and extensibility. 8) Develop and organize training materials and documentation.      Extensive detail on testing, build procedures, interoperability, quality assurance and project management is given elsewhere in the document. They clearly have dealt with many issues necessary for a project of this size. They state that one of the biggest cost items is support of this package to run on multiple platforms. They point out that many contributors focus on a single platform, much of their work is track down cross-platform bugs. This is time well-spent, given the platforms used are in sync with the needs of the greater bioinformatics community.        ORIGINALITY   While a high degree of originality is not a particularly critical element of open source software development project, there are certainly areas in the proposal that are unique. Most importantly, it is safe to say that there is not another project which has this blend of statistical analysis systems specifically tailored to a important research bioinformatics area that can be deployed on a number of different computer environments.      INVESTIGATOR AND CO-INVESTIGATORS   Dr. Gentleman is the founder and leader of the Bioconductor project. Dr. Gentlemen was an Associate Professor in the Department of Biostatistics, Harvard School of Public Health and Department of Biostatistics and Computational Biology, Dana Farber Cancer Institute. In 2004 he became Program Head, Computational Biology, at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle. He has on the order of ten publications relating to Bioconductor or related statistical analysis. He implemented the original versions of the R programming language jointly with another co-founder. He is PI or Investigator of a number of research grants, at least two are directly related to this work. He and other members of the proposal have taught a number of courses and given lectures on Bioconductor, the amount of these courses certainly indicate significant dedication to the project.  A review of the PI and Co-PI activities related to this project are shown on Table 3 on page 42 of the application. The roles and time allocations assigned to each participant appear to be reasonable.  Dr. Gentleman will serve as project leader and will manage the programmers, coordinating the project, and investigating new computational methods and approaches.  Dr. Vincent Carey, as co Principal Investigator has 20% time allocated for the project.  In 2005 he became Associate Professor of Medicine (Biostatistics). Carey is a senior member of the Bioconductor development core. He will improve interoperability to allow Bioconductor reuse of external modules in Java, Perl and other languages as well as strengthen interfaces between high throughput experimental workflows and machine learning tools, and ontology capture.  An administrative assistant will assist Dr. Carey with administrative requirements, including call coordination, manuscript preparation and distribution, scheduling and budget management.  Dr. Rafael Irizarry as co-PI will spend 30% effort on the project.  Dr. Irizarry has four years experience developing methods for microarray data analysis and in the Department of Biostatistics serving as faculty liaison to the Johns Hopkins Medical Institution's Microarray Core.  He will supervize all efforts to support preprocessing on all platforms and support for microarray related consortiums such as the ERCC, GEO, and ArrayExpress.      Programmers will be responsible for the project website, managing email lists, maintaining training materials, upgrading software, refactoring and other code enhancements, managing the svn archive, and Bioconductor releases. They will handle checking all submitted packages, developing unit tests, and simplifying downloads, nightly build procedures, cross-platform issues, data technologies as well as integrating resources found in other languages (e.g. large C libraries of routines for string handling, machine learning and so on). Programmers have familiarity with R packages and systems for database management and for parallel and distributed computing. They will be responsible for managing the annotation data including package building and liaising with organism specific and other data providers.      SIGNIFICANCE   Given the scope of the proposal, and the size of the Bioconductor project in general the request for the above resources is appropriate. There is an excellent mix of grounded project management along with development of newer state of the art techniques that will benifit many members of the bioinformatics community. There is a high probability that funding this project will help to maintain and advance this important community resource.      ENVIRONMENT   The computer infrastructure, and the local departments of the PI and Co-PIs, as well as the work with the larger scientific community are all excellent environments to support this project.      IN SUMMARY   This is a terrific resource.  It is a well managed large open source project with very well crafted QA testing, documentation and training.  Continuation of this is a three year project. Beyond that period, a statement of long term stated goals is needed. The PI should articulate the strategic goals, as well as their research motivation and translate that into an action plan. They should also use that context to describe how they would go about choosing packages that are put into the Bioconductor system; Table 3 only listed the names of the packages made by the applicants, it could have gone further to give the reader more information for choosing packages.  A simple example would have been if they stated in the document: ""Given our assessment of the microarray state of the art, we ultimately aim to overlay annotation data, ontological information, and other forms of meta data onto a statistical framework for expression data."" The resulting research plan would then justify a five year project, but it was not strong enough in this application.       It should be noted that many of the benificiaries to this system are not just users that download the system.  In many cases a centralized informatics service downloads their system and then performs analysis for other members of the campus or the wider www community. While that type of ""success measure"" is hard to assess, more effort in this area in subsequent proposals would be helpful.           n/a",Bioconductor: an open computing resource for genomics,7293650,P41HG004059,"['Address', 'Archives', 'Area', 'Arts', 'Award', 'Bioconductor', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Biometry', 'Budgets', 'Building Codes', 'Class', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational Biology', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Dana-Farber Cancer Institute', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Sources', 'Data Storage and Retrieval', 'Database Management Systems', 'Dedications', 'Development', 'Discipline', 'Documentation', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Electronic Mail', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Evolution', 'Experimental Designs', 'Faculty', 'Familiarity', 'FarGo', 'Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center', 'Funding', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Head', 'Human Genome', 'Human Resources', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Institution', 'Internet', 'Investigation', 'Java', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Mails', 'Manuscripts', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Microarray Analysis', 'Motivation', 'Names', 'Nature', 'Numbers', 'Occupations', 'Ontology', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Organism', 'Participant', 'Policies', 'Preparation', 'Principal Investigator', 'Probability', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Program Development', 'Programming Languages', 'Provider', 'Public Health Schools', 'Publications', 'Range', 'Reader', 'Request for Proposals', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resource Development', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Running', 'Schedule', 'Scientist', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Services', 'Software Design', 'Software Engineering', 'Solutions', 'Source', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Statistical Methods', 'System', 'Systems Analysis', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Work', 'cluster computing', 'computing resources', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'data management', 'data structure', 'design', 'experience', 'falls', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interoperability', 'lectures', 'member', 'model development', 'open source', 'originality', 'professor', 'programs', 'quality assurance', 'research study', 'size', 'software development', 'success', 'symposium', 'tool', 'tool development', 'web-accessible']",NHGRI,FRED HUTCHINSON CAN RES CTR,P41,2007,796910,-0.022401988497672838
"Engineering Approach to Individually Tailored Medicine DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Technological advances in medicine, particularly imaging, have resulted in early detection, objective documentation, and overall better insight into medical conditions. These advances, however, have also led to an increasingly complex medical record. Physicians now spend a significant portion of their time retrieving, structuring, organizing, and analyzing patient data, inaccurately and inefficiently: current information management systems in clinical medicine do not adequately support these functions, critical to the real-world practice of evidence-based medicine. Objective evidence, tailored to an individual patient, must be readily available to physicians as part of routine practice if true evidence-based medical practice is to become a reality. This proposal details the development and evaluation of several innovative technologies, providing solutions for the information management problems faced by physicians: 1) a distributed XML-based peer-to-peer medical record architecture, to enable portability and accessibility of patient information, regardless of geographical location; 2) a natural language processing (NLP) system for free-text medical reports, to automatically structure and characterize the contents of medical documents; 3) a phenomenon-centric data model, which supports the problem-solving tasks of the physician through explicit linking of objective findings (e.g., images, lab values) to medical problems; and 4) a time-based, problem-centric, context-sensitive visualization of the medical record, supporting a ""gestalt"" view of the patient, with access to detailed patient data when needed. Together, these technologies will form a comprehensive system facilitating evidence-based medicine in a real-world environment. System evaluation will proceed in two parts. Technical evaluation focuses on each of the proposed technologies individually, gauging classical performance metrics: scalability of the distributed medical record; NLP precision/recall; expressibility/comprehensibility of the data model; and the usability of the new medical record user interface. Clinical evaluation will follow a time series study design (""off-on-off""), with implementation of the entire system in a real-world clinical environment, the UCLA Clark Urological Center. Clinical evaluation will measure the effectiveness of the system as a whole on intermediate outcomes (process of care) including the number of visits, number of procedures performed, and time to final diagnosis (disposition), as well as the impact on physician efficiency (time required to gather information and review charts). n/a",Engineering Approach to Individually Tailored Medicine,7249382,R01EB000362,"['Address', 'Architecture', 'Caring', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Complex', 'Computer Architectures', 'Condition', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Documentation', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Effectiveness', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Evidence Based Medicine', 'Extensible Markup Language', 'Geographic Locations', 'Healthcare', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Individual', 'Information Management', 'Laboratories', 'Language', 'Link', 'Management Information Systems', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Records', 'Medicine', 'Methodology', 'Metric', 'Multimedia', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Numbers', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Problem Solving', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Series', 'Services', 'Solutions', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'TimeLine', 'United States', 'Urology', 'Visit', 'base', 'concept', 'cost', 'data acquisition', 'data management', 'data modeling', 'improved', 'information gathering', 'innovation', 'innovative technologies', 'insight', 'peer', 'point of care', 'portability', 'research clinical testing', 'urologic', 'usability']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2007,517331,0.008093271828865257
"Vanderbilt Genome-Electronic Records Project    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  VGER: The Vanderbilt Genome-Electronic Record project An important potential enabling resource for Personalized Medicine is the combination of a DNA repository with Electronic Medical Record (EMR) systems sufficiently robust to provide excellence in clinical care and to serve as resources for analysis of disease susceptibility and therapeutic outcomes across patient populations. The Vanderbilt EMR is a state of the art clinical and research tool (that includes >1.4 million records), and is associated with a DNA repository which has been in development for over 3 years; these are the key components of VGER, the Vanderbilt Genome-Electronic Records project proposed here. The VGER model acquires DNA from discarded blood samples collected from routine patient care, and can link these to de-identified data extracted and readily updated from the EMR. The phenotype we will analyze here is the QRS duration on the electrocardiogram, since slow conduction (indicated by longer QRS duration) is a marker of arrhythmia susceptibility. This will not only exploit the power of Genome-Wide Association (GWA) approaches to generate new biologic knowledge that impacts an area of public health concern, but also provides a platform for the development of tools, such as Natural Language Processing approaches, to optimally mine EMRs. This project brings together a team of investigators with nationally recognized records of accomplishment in genome science, medical ethics, bioinformatics, de-identification science, and translational and cardiovascular medicine to address four Specific Aims: (1) perform a GWA comparing samples from subjects with QRS durations at the extremes of the normal range, and validate by genotyping high likelihood associations in prospectively ascertained clinical trial sets for QRS duration and for arrhythmia susceptibility; (2) evaluate the validity and utility of structured and unstructured components of EMR data for genome-phenome correlations; (3) assess the ethical, scientific, and societal advantages and disadvantages of the VGER model, and determine best practices for oversight, community involvement, and communication as the resource grows; and (4) develop and evaluate formal privacy protection models for data derived from databanks and EMRs, establishing data sharing and integration practices. We also include here a proposal to develop the Administrative Coordinating Center whose mission will be to facilitate communication and collaboration among nodes in this network, the NHGRI, and external advisors. We subscribe to a vision of Personalized Medicine in which genomic and other patient-specific information drives personalized, predictive, preemptive, and participatory health care, and VGER represents an important step in that direction.           n/a",Vanderbilt Genome-Electronic Records Project,7427367,U01HG004603,"['Address', 'Area', 'Arrhythmia', 'Arts', 'Bioinformatics', 'Blood specimen', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Commit', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disadvantaged', 'Disease', 'Disease susceptibility', 'EKG QRS Complex', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Electronics', 'Ethics', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Healthcare', 'Heart Diseases', 'Institution', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Legal', 'Link', 'Measures', 'Medical Ethics', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Normal Range', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Privacy', 'Public Health', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Ethics Committees', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Translational Research', 'Update', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Vision', 'concept', 'data modeling', 'egg', 'endophenotype', 'genome wide association study', 'heart rhythm', 'indexing', 'repository', 'tool', 'tool development']",NHGRI,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MED CTR,U01,2007,1463449,-0.013535278914862461

"Biosurveillance Utilizing SNOMED-CT Based Natural Language Processing Bioterrorism remains a significant threat to our public health. Early identification of an increased rate of occurance of patient presentations consistent with an exposure to an agent of bioterrorism is one important method to contain bioterror attacks and effect more rapid treatment of exposed individuals. Often presentations consistent with an exposure to an agent of bioterrorism occur in significant numbers prior to the recognition that a bioterrorism related exposure has occurred. This presents an opportunity to capture and analyze signals from patient records. We propose to provide an abstraction of automated clinical information from the clinical record (section by section) that will be coded using SNOMED-CT which can serve as the substrate for surveillance data. We believe that this data (sets of codes by section of the clinical record) which holds the important and salient medical facts (codes) regarding the patients' presentation, findings, medications, allergies and co-morbidities could be abstracted from clinical records. In this study, we will analyze SNOMED-CT's ability to provide adequate content coverage for constellations of symptoms associated with exposures to agents of bioterrorism (i.e. Anthrax, Small Pox, Ricin, and Radiation exposure). Our method builds on the considerable body of research already available within our laboratory. We have been researching methods for codifying medical content using controlled medical vocabularies since 1987. For this study, we will employ the Mayo Vocabulary Server (MVS) developed in the Mayo Laboratory of Biomedical Informatics and has been used at Mayo, Johns Hopkins University and the VA medical centers all with great success. Our performanc2 of the MVS toolkit has been validated for diagnoses where we showed a sensitivity of 99.7% and a specificity of 97.9%. This proposal deals with practical issues that lead the way toward interoperable data. The fruits of this research will assist our national initiatives to pave the way toward a safe and effective BioSecure biosurveillance solution. n/a",Biosurveillance Utilizing SNOMED-CT Based Natural Language Processing,7790142,R01PH000022,[' '],PHPPO,MOUNT SINAI SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R01,2007,677278,-0.006505328979088343
"Wayfinding for the blind & visually impaired using passive environmental labels    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The objective of this proposal is to tackle the problem of way finding (finding one's way in an environment), faced by blind and severely visually impaired persons who are unable to find or read signs, landmarks and locations. We propose a novel and very inexpensive environmental labeling system to provide this population with access to information needed for indoor way finding (where GPS is not available). The system uses simple passive landmark symbols printed on paper or other material, placed next to text, Braille signs or barcode at locations of interest (offices, bathrooms, etc.) in an environment such as an office building. These printed patterns contain spatial and semantic information that is detected using computer vision algorithms running on a standard camera cell phone. By scanning the environment with the device, which detects all landmark symbols in its line of sight up to distances of 10 meters, the user can determine his or her approximate location in the environment as well as the information encoded near each landmark symbol. The system extracts this information in real-time and communicates it to the user by sound, synthesized speech and/or tactile feedback. This information includes spatial (e.g. audio tones to indicate the presence and direction of a label in the camera's field of view) and semantic information (""Mr. Johnson's office, room 429, at 11 o'clock""). The research proposed here will produce a prototype system that will be tested by blind and low vision subjects. Our team includes a blind expert on psychoacoustics (and other in-house blind staff) and an expert consultant on low-vision way finding and navigation to help optimize the user interface and guide development into a practical, easy-to-use system.              n/a",Wayfinding for the blind & visually impaired using passive environmental labels,7295688,R21EY017003,"['Access to Information', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Auditory', 'Bar Codes', 'Canes', 'Canis familiaris', 'Cellular Phone', 'Clutterings', 'Cognitive', 'Color', 'Complement component C1s', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Condition', 'Consultations', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Education', 'Elderly', 'Employment', 'Environment', 'Exhibits', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Home environment', 'Housing', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Instruction', 'Label', 'Localized', 'Location', 'Modality', 'Museums', 'Paper', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Population', 'Printing', 'Psychoacoustics', 'Quality of life', 'Range', 'Rate', 'Reading', 'Research', 'Running', 'Scanning', 'Semantics', 'Shapes', 'Source', 'Speech', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Stress', 'System', 'Tactile', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'United States', 'Vision', 'Visual impairment', 'Visually Impaired Persons', 'Work', 'age group', 'base', 'blind', 'braille', 'concept', 'cost', 'design', 'interest', 'legally blind', 'meter', 'novel', 'optical character recognition', 'programs', 'prototype', 'research study', 'size', 'skills', 'sound', 'success', 'symposium', 'way finding']",NEI,SMITH-KETTLEWELL EYE RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R21,2007,193398,-0.01254202790811312
"CENTER OF EXCELLENCE IN PUBLIC HEALTH INFORMATICS The University of Washington proposes to establish the Center of Excellence in Public Health Informatics: Improving the Public's Health through Information Integration. Partners include the Washington Department of Health, Kitsap County Health District, the Public Health Informatics Institute, and Inland Northwest Health Services. This Center will focus on three research topics: Project 1 (Surveillance Integration and Decision Support) will develop public health surveillance methodswithin the emerging health information infrastructure. We will: 1) develop methods by which regional health information organizations can enhance public health surveillance; 2) develop and evaluate a probabilistic decision support system classifier for disease surveillance; and 3) investigate the usability of a web survey-assessment system for population tracking and disease reporting. Project 2 (Customizable Knowledge Management Repository System for Prevention: Design, Development, and Evaluation) will develop an interactive digital knowledge management system to support the collection, management, and retrieval of public health documents, data,  earning objects, and tools. The focus will be the development of tools, including concept mapping services that will provide rapid access to answers from a variety of key resources, including the ""gray literature"". The system will focus on the application of natural language processing and information visualization techniques. Components will include a knowledge repository system, integrative web services and a role-based user  nterface to support access to information resources for enhanced decision-making by practitioners. The ong-term goal is to create an environment in which practitioners can pose questions in ""plain English"" and receive answers to their questions rather than simply a list of possible places to look for answers.

"The BioSense Initiative to Improve Early Event Detection RTI International, in partnership with the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC-CH), and in collaboration with the North Carolina Division of Public Health (NC-DPH), is submitting this application to work with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to improve early detection of disease outbreaks of public health significance. Rapid detection of disease outbreaks rests on a foundation of accurate classification of patient symptoms early in the course of their illness. The overarching objective of this research is to define, evaluate, and standardize a methodology for creating useful case definitions designed for the early detection of intentional and naturally occurring disease outbreaks. The specific aim of this research proposal is to develop and test methods for increasing the sensitivity and specificity of syndrome definitions using timely emergency department data. Improved case definitions will enhance CDC's capacity to detect and investigate threats to the health of the population, which CDC undertakes as part of its mission. Emergency department data may serve as a rich source for early signals of health threats to the population, but case definitions have not been standardized, and new methods are needed to process and use the textual information found within the emergency record. To address these challenges, we propose an innovative and iterative research plan that leverages RTI's and UNC-CH's capabilities to best serveCDC and the public health community. We will use emergency department data captured through North Carolina's Bioterrorism and Emerging Infections PreventiveService, the operational syndromic surveillance system used by NC-DPH to monitor the state. After (1) developing a gold standard data set of ED visits for evaluating syndrometest characteristics, we will (2) evaluate natural language processing for preprocessing chief complaints; (3) explore use of semantic networking tools for developing definitions; (4) apply a reverse engineering process using ICD-9-CMcode groupings; and (5) assess the applicability of early event detection for creating situational awareness following detection of an event. These methods will make use of information within the emergency record and create syndrome definitions with acceptable sensitivity, specificity, and positisve predictive value. Valid syndromedefinitions will enable public health officials to operate a national monitoring system that can automatically detect signals that may represent disease outbreaks or other potential threats to health. Operation of this system will protect the public health and will strengthen the capacity of public health officials to investigate and respond to these threats rapidly. n/a",The BioSense Initiative to Improve Early Event Detection,7428896,R01PH000038,[' '],PHPPO,RESEARCH TRIANGLE INSTITUTE,R01,2007,415565,-0.019989231738696676

"Discovering and Applying Knowledge in Clinical Databases    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The ongoing goal of our project, ""Discovering and applying knowledge in clinical databases,"" is to develop and apply methods to exploit electronic medical record data for decision support, with an emphasis on narrative data. Since the inception of our project as an R29 in 1994, we have been developing methods for preparing raw electronic medical record data, applying and evaluating natural language processing, developing data mining techniques including machine learning, and putting the results to use for clinical care and research.       In this competing continuation, we propose to address the temporal information in the electronic medical record and to apply natural language processing and temporal processing to the task of syndromic surveillance in collaboration with the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (NYC DOHMH).       We have begun work on a temporal processing system. It extracts temporal assertions stated in narrative reports, uses the MedLEE natural language processor to parse the non-temporal information, infers implicit temporal assertions based on a knowledge base, and produces the information in the form of a simple temporal constraint satisfaction problem. The latter can be used to answer questions about the time of events and the temporal relation between pairs of events. We propose to complete the system, expand the knowledge base, speed computation, address the uncertainty of temporal assertions, incorporate temporal information from structured data, and evaluate the system.       NYC DOHMH has a mature syndromic surveillance system that watches over almost eight million persons, and it has as-yet unexploited data sources in the form of narrative and structured electronic medical records.

"Technology Development for a MolBio Knowledge-Base   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Since the introduction of the Mycin system more than 25 years ago, it has widely been hypothesized that extensive, well-represented computer knowledge-bases will facilitate a wide variety of scientific and clinical tasks. Driven by growing knowledge-management challenges arising from the proliferation of high throughput instrumentation, recently created knowledge-bases in areas related to genomics and related aspects of contemporary biology, such as the Gene Ontology, EcoCyc and PharmGKB, have begun to become integrated into the laboratory practices of a growing number of molecular biologists. However, these successful molecular biology knowledge-bases (MBKBs) have two drawbacks which impede their more general application: each has been narrowed to a particular special purpose, either in its domain of applicability or in the scope of knowledge represented, and each of these knowledge-bases was constructed largely on the basis of enormous human effort. Given the current state of molecular biology data and recent advances in database integration and information extraction technology, we proposed to test the following hypothesis: Current computational technology and existing human-curated knowledge resources are sufficient to build an extensive, high-quality computational knowledge-base of molecular biology. To test this hypothesis we propose to first create tools which can (a) automatically link incommensurate knowledge sources using semantic linking, and (b) use natural language processing techniques to extract new information from NCBrs GeneRIFs and from the GO definitions fields; and second, to evaluate the results of these methods by carefully quantifying the degree to which the induced linkages and extracted assertions are complete, consistent and correct. Although we propose to construct a broad and rich knowledge-base in order to develop and test the adequacy of largely automated methods to leverage existing human-curated collections, we do not propose to build a comprehensive MBKB.            n/a",Technology Development for a MolBio Knowledge-Base,7123058,R01LM008111,"['artificial intelligence', 'bioinformatics', 'biomedical automation', 'computational biology', 'computer program /software', 'functional /structural genomics', 'information retrieval', 'molecular biology information system', 'technology /technique development']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,R01,2006,611872,-0.03336152686444338

The system extracts this information in real-time and communicates it to the user by sound, synthesized speech and/or tactile feedback. This information includes spatial (e.g. audio tones to indicate the presence and direction of a label in the camera's field of view) and semantic information (""Mr. Johnson's office, room 429, at 11 o'clock""). The research proposed here will produce a prototype system that will be tested by blind and low vision subjects. Our team includes a blind expert on psychoacoustics (and other in-house blind staff) and an expert consultant on low-vision way finding and navigation to help optimize the user interface and guide development into a practical, easy-to-use system.              n/a",Wayfinding for the blind & visually impaired using passive environmental labels,7143942,R21EY017003,"['clinical research', 'computers', 'reading', 'semantics', 'touch', 'vision']",NEI,SMITH-KETTLEWELL EYE RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R21,2006,224601,-0.01254202790811312

"Nurse Practitioner Access to Genetics Health Literature    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This training proposal describes a research plan which tests the application of a computer science solution to a clinical problem encountered by nurse practitioners (NPs). As our understanding of genetics health increases, NPs will need to provide care and create health promotion regimens mindful of each client's genetic profile. Access to the rapidly developing genetics health literature is critical for this practice model, but may be difficult, because existing search methods lead to many irrelevant results, and may retrieve the proper result only when precise keywords are used. The NP searching for information that would guide her practice may be forced to make a decision with less than complete or current information. This proposal outlines three studies, which investigate how the semantic web concepts of linking related ideas and terms can improve NPs' access to the genetics health literature. Study 1 explores NPs' genetics health information needs. Study 2 tests the applicability of existing ontologies (terminologies coupled with machine-readable statements about the meanings and relationships of the terms) to nursing. Study 3 tests a prototype intelligent agent employing ontology to retrieve literature relevant to NPs' genetics health information needs.         n/a",Nurse Practitioner Access to Genetics Health Literature,7122136,F37LM008636,"['artificial intelligence', 'clinical research', 'genetics', 'human subject', 'informatics', 'information retrieval', 'nurse practitioners', 'patient care management', 'predoctoral investigator', 'publications', 'semantics', 'young adult human (21-34)']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN MADISON,F37,2006,39750,-0.041173614407442057
"Collaborative Brain Mapping: Tools for Sharing    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Sharing data between research centers is increasingly important for contemporary brain imaging studies because they involve large numbers of subjects and complex analysis protocols that require highly specialized expertise. Our long-term objective is to facilitate brain-imaging research by enabling remote researchers to pool data between institutions and to analyze data using the appropriate algorithms executing on distributed resources. There are a number of difficult data management and technology challenges that have limited the success of data sharing environments. Rather than attempt to develop a comprehensive and general solution, we propose to develop a set of open, interoperable, and portable software tools that address critical issues currently limiting efforts to share and analyze brain-imaging data. Building upon years of providing brain-mapping expertise to collaborators, we propose to solve problems that we repeatedly encounter and that currently limit progress in brain imaging research. We propose to develop validated tools that enable collaborators to remotely access a variety of data analysis methods and databases. We will create web-based tools to perform multi-institutional studies, and provide access to complex data processing protocols executing on distributed computing resources. There are three specific aims. 1) Enable the web based acquisition and management of data utilizing an access control system that includes consideration of subject consent limits and investigator imposed conditions to facilitate data pooling for multi-institutional studies. This system will convert data files between different formats and schemas so that data can be used consistently between analysis programs and databases. It will also anonymize images and metadata according to institution-specific protocols. 2) Develop a system that is aware of data type and provenance so that it may act intelligently to arbitrate between different analysis programs. This system will capture the expertise of experienced lab personnel in the usage of various tools and assist new users in designing appropriate analytic strategies. 3) Create meta-algorithms that improve the robustness of techniques for neuroimaging analysis by intelligently combining the results from multiple algorithms. The proposed approach will provide a set of tools that address significant problems in data sharing and utilization. The resulting information technology will be scalable and applicable to other scientific data sharing problems.         n/a",Collaborative Brain Mapping: Tools for Sharing,7109207,R01MH071940,"['Internet', 'artificial intelligence', 'bioimaging /biomedical imaging', 'brain imaging /visualization /scanning', 'brain mapping', 'computer data analysis', 'computer program /software', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'confidentiality', 'data management', 'information dissemination', 'information systems', 'mathematics']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2006,649537,-0.0019333741492717738
"CREATION AND APPLICATION OF A DIABETES KNOWLEDGE BASE CREATION AND APPLICATION OF A DIABETES KNOWLEDGE BASE   The applicant is an Instructor in Pediatrics at Harvard Medical School and an associate in bioinformatics and pediatric endocrinology at Children's Hospital, Boston. The applicant completed an NLM-funded fellowship in informatics and received a Masters Degree in Medical Informatics from MIT. Since completing his fellowship less than two years ago, he has first-authored six publications, co-authored eight publications, senior authored two publications, and co-authored a book on microarray analysis. The applicant plans to pursue a career in basic research in diabetes genomics and bioinformatics, with a joint appointment in both an academic pediatric endocrinology department and a medical informatics program. The mentor is Dr. Isaac Kohane, director of the Children's Hospital Informatics Program with a staff of 20 including 10 faculty and extensive computational resources, funded through several NIH grants.       The past 10 years have led to a variety of measurements tools in molecular biology that are near comprehensive in nature. For example, RNA expression detection microarrays can provide systematic quantitative information on the expression of over 40,000 unique RNAs within cells. Yet microarrays are just one of at least 30 large-scale measurement or experimental modalities available to investigators in molecular biology. We see scientific value in being able to integrate multiple large-scale data sets from all biological modalities to address biomedical questions that could otherwise not be answered. We recognize that the full agenda of working out the details for all possible inferential processes between all near-comprehensive modalities is too large. The goal of this project is to serve as a model automated system for gathering data related to particular experimental characteristic and perform inferential operators on these data. For this application, we are focusing on a pragmatic subset. Specifically, we propose intersecting near comprehensive data sets by phenotype, and intersecting lists of significant and related genes within these data sets in an automated manner.      The central hypothesis for this application is that integrating large-scale data sets across measurement  modalities is a synergistic process to create new knowledge and testable hypothesis in the area of diabetes, and inferential processes involving intersection across genes can be automated. n/a",CREATION AND APPLICATION OF A DIABETES KNOWLEDGE BASE,7007706,K22LM008261,"['RNA interference', 'adipocytes', 'artificial intelligence', 'automated data processing', 'cell differentiation', 'clinical research', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'diabetes mellitus genetics', 'human data', 'information systems', 'insulin sensitivity /resistance', 'noninsulin dependent diabetes mellitus', 'obesity', 'phenotype', 'quantitative trait loci', 'vocabulary', 'weight gain']",NLM,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,K22,2006,153843,-0.018394321031978404
"The PharmGKB: Catalyzing Research in Pharmacogenetics    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Pharmacogenetics and pharmacogenomics Knowledge Base (PharmGKB) is designed to catalyze research on how genetic variation contributes to variation in drug response.

"Answering Information Needs in Workflow    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Needs for information arise continuously during the course of clinical practice, especially for physicians in training, e.g. when examining a patient or participating in rounds. In most of these situations, it is difficult or impossible for the clinician to immediately access appropriate information resources. Most needs are never adequately articulated or recorded, and consequently are forgotten by the end of the day. Moreover, when clinicians do recall information needs, they don't act on them, due to the significant limitations of current retrieval systems and the exigencies of clinical practice. The specific aims of the proposed project are: 1) to capture information needs in a convenient manner at the moment they occur using different modalities such as text input and voice capture on hand-held devices, 2) to translate high-level information needs into complex search strategies that adapt to user needs and are tuned to the capabilities of resources, and 3) to deliver relevant materials to the clinician in an accessible format and in a timely manner. The project will develop a central hub for addressing the information needs of medical students and residents, to be transmitted electronically as they occur in the field. A unique feature of the project is the use of natural language processing technology to identify context, goals and preferences in clinicians' questions. The major innovation is the generation of complex search strategies that exploit this contextual information, based on studies of human searching experts (reference librarians).              n/a",Answering Information Needs in Workflow,7101997,R01LM008799,"['clinical research', 'human', 'language', 'memory disorders', 'model', 'physicians', 'training', 'voice']",NLM,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2006,372499,0.00195407884567279

"The RPI Exploratory Center for Cheminformatics (RMI) The purpose of this Exploratory Center for Cheminformatics Research (ECCR) P20 planning grant is to develop a mechanism for bringing together and stimulating collaborative pilot projects among a constantly-evolving nucleus of experts in Cheminformatics-related fields ranging from methods of encoding and capturing molecular information, to machine learning and data mining techniques, to predictive model development, validation, interpretation and utilization. In addition to these research efforts, the Center will bring together a set of domain specialists and application scientists who will serve as both data generators and end users of the knowledge provided by the molecular property models and modeling methods developed during the course of the grant. This group will also test the new Cheminformatics software that will constitute a tangible, deliverable product from this work. Ten application project modules that exemplify possible interactions between various groups and areas of expertise within the Center are presented as part of this proposal. The unifying vision behind the proposed Center is that much of what is done in each of the subdisciplines represented here can be expressed in a Cheminformatics context: The many diverse project areas can be grouped into one or more overlapping categories: ""Data Generators"" (those who use either theoretical or experimental methods for creating or extracting knowledge), ""Machine Learning and Datamining"" groups (who perform model validation, feature selection, pattern recognition, generation of potentials of mean force and knowledge-based potential work), as well as ""Property-Prediction"" groups (who perform chemically-aware model building, molecular property descriptor generation, Quantitative Structure-Property Relationship modeling, validation, and interpretation), and ""Application"" groups who utilize the information made available using the new tools and methods that are developed as part of the Center. It is our strong belief that these areas of expertise can be brought together within this Planning Grant proposal to generate something larger than the sum of the parts. The Exploratory Center will seed new interdisciplinary projects and train graduate students in these areas.

"Improving Public Health Grey Literature Access for the Public Health Workforce    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term objective of the proposed project is to provide the public health (PH) workforce with improved access to high quality, relevant PH grey literature reports in order to positively impact the planning, conducting, and evaluating of PH interventions. The project will consist of two components: 1) continuation of user-focused technical system development, and 2) deployment and evaluation of this system's impact on the tasks of the PH workforce in county health departments.      The system will automatically harvest web-based grey literature reports (utilizing rules trained on input from PH professionals) and then produce rich summaries of PH grey literature reports using the model of essential elements of PH intervention reports validated by PH specialists (Turner et al, In Press). After developing a user interface that capitalizes on both natural language querying and the display of search results in a structured, model-based summary, the system will be introduced into several county health departments and evaluated to determine its impact on information flows and uses.      The project will include intrinsic evaluations of: 1) the appropriateness of the grey literature reports harvested by the system; 2) the quality and sufficiency of summaries representing the full reports based on the PH intervention model and; 3) retrieval results for users' queries using metrics of precision and recall. Extrinsic evaluation will be done in PH departments participating in the New York Academy of Medicine's ongoing study of the relationship between information and effectiveness. The research will provide baseline measures. We will evaluate: 1) the ease and frequency of use, perceptions of currency, accuracy, and completeness of retrieved reports by county PH personnel, and; 2) impact of the system's usage on information flows and uses based on internal outcome measures within the county health departments.      The work proposed here shares both the missions of public health and the National Library of Medicine   through the design of an information system that exploits natural language processing technology to   efficiently collect and provide access to quality public health grey literature for the public health workforce.         n/a",Improving Public Health Grey Literature Access for the Public Health Workforce,7019753,G08LM008983,"['clinical research', 'public health']",NLM,SYRACUSE UNIVERSITY,G08,2006,149472,0.003039332096763364
"Capturing and linking genomic and clinical information DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The long-term aim of this project is to use natural language processing (NLP) to build a high throughput tool for facilitating cancer research by automatically extracting and organizing clinical and genetic information from the Electronic Medical Record (EMR) and from journal articles.  Our research involves advanced NLP techniques to:  1) enable the mining of phenotypic and genotypic data in the EMR; 2) automatically amass knowledge concerned with cancer and biomolecular relationships from journals; 3) develop a WEB-enabled visualization tool for researchers that will present diverse views of the knowledge; and 4) develop an Infrastructure that will link to the clinical data warehouse at New York Presbyterian Hospital (NYPH) and to GeneWays, a related project that allows researchers to visualize pathways.   More specifically, MedLEE (the NLP system we developed that extracts and encodes clinical and environmental information from the EMR) will be extended to extract genetic information contained in the EMR; subsequently, twelve years of patient reports will be processed and the extracted data added to the warehouse.  In addition, a new system, PhenoGenes, will be developed based on MedLEE and GeneWays (which contains another NLP system we developed that extracts and codifies biomolecular relations from journal articles).  PhenoGenes will capture biomolecular interactions directly associated with the treatment, diagnosis, and prognosis of cancer.  It will also generate an XML knowledge base that will integrate and organize the information that will be captured, and a Web-enabled tool that will allow users to browse and view the knowledge clustered according to different orientations (e.g. gene, disease, tissue, interaction, etc.).  The knowledge base will be linked to the GeneWays system, so that relevant pathways can be visualized.   MedLEE is utilized operationally at NYPH.  It also has been demonstrated that both NLP systems are highly effective.  This current project builds upon our experience and success with these systems.  The availability of related compatible clinical and biomolecular NLP systems, provide an exceptional opportunity to pave the way for capture, integration and organization of phenotypic and genotypic data and knowledge that will be used to radically improve patient care. n/a",Capturing and linking genomic and clinical information,7110256,R01LM007659,"['cancer information system', 'clinical research', 'data collection', 'health science research', 'human data', 'informatics', 'library', 'medical records', 'molecular biology information system']",NLM,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2006,478733,0.01034576266144463
"Engineering Approach to Individually Tailored Medicine DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Technological advances in medicine, particularly imaging, have resulted in early detection, objective documentation, and overall better insight into medical conditions. These advances, however, have also led to an increasingly complex medical record. Physicians now spend a significant portion of their time retrieving, structuring, organizing, and analyzing patient data, inaccurately and inefficiently: current information management systems in clinical medicine do not adequately support these functions, critical to the real-world practice of evidence-based medicine. Objective evidence, tailored to an individual patient, must be readily available to physicians as part of routine practice if true evidence-based medical practice is to become a reality. This proposal details the development and evaluation of several innovative technologies, providing solutions for the information management problems faced by physicians: 1) a distributed XML-based peer-to-peer medical record architecture, to enable portability and accessibility of patient information, regardless of geographical location; 2) a natural language processing (NLP) system for free-text medical reports, to automatically structure and characterize the contents of medical documents; 3) a phenomenon-centric data model, which supports the problem-solving tasks of the physician through explicit linking of objective findings (e.g., images, lab values) to medical problems; and 4) a time-based, problem-centric, context-sensitive visualization of the medical record, supporting a ""gestalt"" view of the patient, with access to detailed patient data when needed. Together, these technologies will form a comprehensive system facilitating evidence-based medicine in a real-world environment. System evaluation will proceed in two parts. Technical evaluation focuses on each of the proposed technologies individually, gauging classical performance metrics: scalability of the distributed medical record; NLP precision/recall; expressibility/comprehensibility of the data model; and the usability of the new medical record user interface. Clinical evaluation will follow a time series study design (""off-on-off""), with implementation of the entire system in a real-world clinical environment, the UCLA Clark Urological Center. Clinical evaluation will measure the effectiveness of the system as a whole on intermediate outcomes (process of care) including the number of visits, number of procedures performed, and time to final diagnosis (disposition), as well as the impact on physician efficiency (time required to gather information and review charts). n/a",Engineering Approach to Individually Tailored Medicine,7083613,R01EB000362,"['automated medical record system', 'clinical research', 'computer assisted medical decision making', 'data collection methodology /evaluation', 'human data', 'informatics', 'information display', 'information system analysis', 'mathematical model', 'medical records', 'outcomes research', 'patient care management', 'performance']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2006,535569,0.008093271828865257

"Biosurveillance/SNOMED-CT Natural Language Processing Bioterrorism remains a significant threat to our public health. Early identification of an increased rate of occurance of patient presentations consistent with an exposure to an agent of bioterrorism is one important method to contain bioterror attacks and effect more rapid treatment of exposed individuals. Often presentations consistent with an exposure to an agent of bioterrorism occur in significant numbers prior to the recognition that a bioterrorism related exposure has occurred. This presents an opportunity to capture and analyze signals from patient records. We propose to provide an abstraction of automated clinical information from the clinical record (section by section) that will be coded using SNOMED-CT which can serve as the substrate for surveillance data. We believe that this data (sets of codes by section of the clinical record) which holds the important and salient medical facts (codes) regarding the patients' presentation, findings, medications, allergies and co-morbidities could be abstracted from clinical records. In this study, we will analyze SNOMED-CT's ability to provide adequate content coverage for constellations of symptoms associated with exposures to agents of bioterrorism (i.e. Anthrax, Small Pox, Ricin, and Radiation exposure). Our method builds on the considerable body of research already available within our laboratory. We have been researching methods for codifying medical content using controlled medical vocabularies since 1987. For this study, we will employ the Mayo Vocabulary Server (MVS) developed in the Mayo Laboratory of Biomedical Informatics and has been used at Mayo, Johns Hopkins University and the VA medical centers all with great success.

"Technology Development for a MolBio Knowledge-Base   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Since the introduction of the Mycin system more than 25 years ago, it has widely been hypothesized that extensive, well-represented computer knowledge-bases will facilitate a wide variety of scientific and clinical tasks. Driven by growing knowledge-management challenges arising from the proliferation of high throughput instrumentation, recently created knowledge-bases in areas related to genomics and related aspects of contemporary biology, such as the Gene Ontology, EcoCyc and PharmGKB, have begun to become integrated into the laboratory practices of a growing number of molecular biologists. However, these successful molecular biology knowledge-bases (MBKBs) have two drawbacks which impede their more general application: each has been narrowed to a particular special purpose, either in its domain of applicability or in the scope of knowledge represented, and each of these knowledge-bases was constructed largely on the basis of enormous human effort. Given the current state of molecular biology data and recent advances in database integration and information extraction technology, we proposed to test the following hypothesis: Current computational technology and existing human-curated knowledge resources are sufficient to build an extensive, high-quality computational knowledge-base of molecular biology. To test this hypothesis we propose to first create tools which can (a) automatically link incommensurate knowledge sources using semantic linking, and (b) use natural language processing techniques to extract new information from NCBrs GeneRIFs and from the GO definitions fields; and second, to evaluate the results of these methods by carefully quantifying the degree to which the induced linkages and extracted assertions are complete, consistent and correct. Although we propose to construct a broad and rich knowledge-base in order to develop and test the adequacy of largely automated methods to leverage existing human-curated collections, we do not propose to build a comprehensive MBKB.            n/a",Technology Development for a MolBio Knowledge-Base,6953701,R01LM008111,"['artificial intelligence', 'bioinformatics', 'biomedical automation', 'computational biology', 'computer program /software', 'functional /structural genomics', 'information retrieval', 'molecular biology information system', 'technology /technique development']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,R01,2005,613495,-0.03336152686444338
"Discovering and Applying Knowledge in Clinical Databases DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     With the advent of improved clinical information system products (e.g., ambulatory systems, order entry  systems), improved data entry technologies (e.g., speech recognition, text processing techniques), and  further adoption of data interchange standards, more institutions are generating electronic medical records, and these records will expand in breadth, depth, and degree of coding in the future. The records are used mainly for individual patient care, but exploiting the records for clinical research and quality functions has lagged behind. Major challenges include the wide range of complex data and missing and inaccurate data.      We propose to continue our work to develop and test methods to mine a clinical data repository. A  special emphasis will be to exploit the vast amount of information in the repository (latent associations and knowledge) and to use computer intensive techniques and advances in data representation and manipulation to better interpret what is in the database and to overcome the challenges of complex, missing, and inaccurate data. We hypothesize that data mining techniques can be applied to a repository to generate accurate clinical interpretations. We further hypothesize that associations latent in a clinically rich repository can be used to improve the classification of cases in that repository.      We aim to develop methods to prepare data for mining; to characterize the information in the clinical data repository; to develop similarity measures based on manipulation of natural language processor output and on information retrieval techniques; to apply nearest neighbor technique and case-based reasoning to improve classification; to develop a statistically based method to improve classification of cases with incomplete or inaccurate data; and to apply our methods to real clinical research questions and carry out additional data mining research.      The researchers in the Department of Medical Informatics at Columbia University are uniquely positioned to carry out this research, given the experience of the team (data mining, statistics, health data organization, health knowledge representation, natural language processing), the availability of a repository of 13 years of data on 2 million patients, and the availability of a natural language processor called MedLEE to convert millions of narrative reports into richly coded clinical data. n/a",Discovering and Applying Knowledge in Clinical Databases,6892934,R01LM006910,"['artificial intelligence', 'classification', 'clinical research', 'computer assisted medical decision making', 'computer assisted patient care', 'computer program /software', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'data collection methodology /evaluation', 'health care facility information system', 'human data', 'information system analysis', 'method development', 'vocabulary development for information system']",NLM,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2005,384538,0.006915542245600526
"The BioSense Initiative to Improve Early Event Detection RTI International, in partnership with the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC-CH), and in collaboration with the North Carolina Division of Public Health (NC-DPH), is submitting this application to work with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to improve early detection of disease outbreaks of public health significance. Rapid detection of disease outbreaks rests on a foundation of accurate classification of patient symptoms early in the course of their illness. The overarching objective of this research is to define, evaluate, and standardize a methodology for creating useful case definitions designed for the early detection of intentional and naturally occurring disease outbreaks. The specific aim of this research proposal is to develop and test methods for increasing the sensitivity and specificity of syndrome definitions using timely emergency department data. Improved case definitions will enhance CDC's capacity to detect and investigate threats to the health of the population, which CDC undertakes as part of its mission. Emergency department data may serve as a rich source for early signals of health threats to the population, but case definitions have not been standardized, and new methods are needed to process and use the textual information found within the emergency record. To address these challenges, we propose an innovative and iterative research plan that leverages RTI's and UNC-CH's capabilities to best serve CDC and the public health community. We will use emergency department data captured through North Carolina's Bioterrorism and Emerging Infections Preventive Service, the operational syndromic surveillance system used by NC-DPH to monitor the state. After (1) developing a gold standard data set of ED visits for evaluating syndrome test characteristics, we will (2) evaluate natural language processing for preprocessing chief complaints; (3) explore use of semantic networking tools for developing definitions; (4) apply a reverse engineering process using ICD-9-CM code groupings; and (5) assess the applicability of early event detection for creating situational awareness following detection of an event. These methods will make use of information within the emergency record and create syndrome definitions with acceptable sensitivity, specificity, and positisve predictive value. Valid syndrome definitions will enable public health officials to operate a national monitoring system that can automatically detect signals that may represent disease outbreaks or other potential threats to health. Operation of this system will protect the public health and will strengthen the capacity of public health officials to investigate and respond to these threats rapidly.  n/a",The BioSense Initiative to Improve Early Event Detection,7097771,R01PH000038,"['artificial intelligence', 'biohazard detection', 'bioterrorism /chemical warfare', 'communicable disease diagnosis', 'computer assisted diagnosis', 'diagnosis design /evaluation', 'diagnosis quality /standard', 'disease /disorder classification', 'disease outbreaks', 'early diagnosis', 'emergency health services', 'emerging infectious disease', 'environmental health', 'health services research tag', 'human data', 'informatics', 'interdisciplinary collaboration', 'public health', 'rapid diagnosis', 'vocabulary development for information system']",PHPPO,RESEARCH TRIANGLE INSTITUTE,R01,2005,412947,-0.019026398861656538
"Information Integration of Heterogeneous Data Sources    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of this proposal is to develop an information integration architecture and associated tools to support rapid integration of data and knowledge from distributed heterogeneous data sources. The architecture aims to play a significant role in extracting coherent knowledge bases for biomedical research and improving the accuracy, completeness and quality of the extracted knowledge. Towards achieving these goals, the proposed scalable architecture includes new innovative generalized integration algorithms and tools for the generation of mediators to capture the functional behavior of data sources, semantic representation of data sources to support automated generation of integration agents, and optimization of integrated data queries. The information integration architecture keeps pace with the evolving Internet-based XML electronic data interchange, semantic web services, and web services discovery standards. Thus, leveraging the Internet technologies and standards for the purpose of providing lasting state-of-the-art solutions for information integration. In addition, the proposed architecture is inherently scalable in terms of the number of data sources that can be integrated, the number of users of the integrated system, and the range of biomedical problems that can be tackled. During phase I of the project, prototypes of the proposed integration algorithms and tools will be developed as proofs of concept and to form the foundation for evaluation and pilot testing of the proposed integration mechanisms, using private and public data sources, in terms of scalability and integration capabilities.         n/a",Information Integration of Heterogeneous Data Sources,6881960,R43RR018667,"['artificial intelligence', 'computer data analysis', 'computer program /software', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'data collection methodology /evaluation', 'information retrieval', 'information system analysis', 'information systems', 'mathematics']",NCRR,"INFOTECH SOFT, INC.",R43,2005,260661,-0.024974517300663857
"Nurse Practitioner Access to Genetics Health Literature    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This training proposal describes a research plan which tests the application of a computer science solution to a clinical problem encountered by nurse practitioners (NPs). As our understanding of genetics health increases, NPs will need to provide care and create health promotion regimens mindful of each client's genetic profile. Access to the rapidly developing genetics health literature is critical for this practice model, but may be difficult, because existing search methods lead to many irrelevant results, and may retrieve the proper result only when precise keywords are used. The NP searching for information that would guide her practice may be forced to make a decision with less than complete or current information. This proposal outlines three studies, which investigate how the semantic web concepts of linking related ideas and terms can improve NPs' access to the genetics health literature. Study 1 explores NPs' genetics health information needs. Study 2 tests the applicability of existing ontologies (terminologies coupled with machine-readable statements about the meanings and relationships of the terms) to nursing.

"Collaborative Brain Mapping: Tools for Sharing    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Sharing data between research centers is increasingly important for contemporary brain imaging studies because they involve large numbers of subjects and complex analysis protocols that require highly specialized expertise. Our long-term objective is to facilitate brain-imaging research by enabling remote researchers to pool data between institutions and to analyze data using the appropriate algorithms executing on distributed resources. There are a number of difficult data management and technology challenges that have limited the success of data sharing environments. Rather than attempt to develop a comprehensive and general solution, we propose to develop a set of open, interoperable, and portable software tools that address critical issues currently limiting efforts to share and analyze brain-imaging data. Building upon years of providing brain-mapping expertise to collaborators, we propose to solve problems that we repeatedly encounter and that currently limit progress in brain imaging research. We propose to develop validated tools that enable collaborators to remotely access a variety of data analysis methods and databases. We will create web-based tools to perform multi-institutional studies, and provide access to complex data processing protocols executing on distributed computing resources. There are three specific aims. 1) Enable the web based acquisition and management of data utilizing an access control system that includes consideration of subject consent limits and investigator imposed conditions to facilitate data pooling for multi-institutional studies. This system will convert data files between different formats and schemas so that data can be used consistently between analysis programs and databases. It will also anonymize images and metadata according to institution-specific protocols. 2) Develop a system that is aware of data type and provenance so that it may act intelligently to arbitrate between different analysis programs. This system will capture the expertise of experienced lab personnel in the usage of various tools and assist new users in designing appropriate analytic strategies. 3) Create meta-algorithms that improve the robustness of techniques for neuroimaging analysis by intelligently combining the results from multiple algorithms. The proposed approach will provide a set of tools that address significant problems in data sharing and utilization. The resulting information technology will be scalable and applicable to other scientific data sharing problems.         n/a",Collaborative Brain Mapping: Tools for Sharing,6953037,R01MH071940,"['Internet', 'artificial intelligence', 'bioimaging /biomedical imaging', 'brain imaging /visualization /scanning', 'brain mapping', 'computer data analysis', 'computer program /software', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'confidentiality', 'data management', 'information dissemination', 'information systems', 'mathematics']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2005,647432,-0.0019333741492717738
"CREATION AND APPLICATION OF A DIABETES KNOWLEDGE BASE CREATION AND APPLICATION OF A DIABETES KNOWLEDGE BASE   The applicant is an Instructor in Pediatrics at Harvard Medical School and an associate in bioinformatics and pediatric endocrinology at Children's Hospital, Boston. The applicant completed an NLM-funded fellowship in informatics and received a Masters Degree in Medical Informatics from MIT. Since completing his fellowship less than two years ago, he has first-authored six publications, co-authored eight publications, senior authored two publications, and co-authored a book on microarray analysis. The applicant plans to pursue a career in basic research in diabetes genomics and bioinformatics, with a joint appointment in both an academic pediatric endocrinology department and a medical informatics program. The mentor is Dr. Isaac Kohane, director of the Children's Hospital Informatics Program with a staff of 20 including 10 faculty and extensive computational resources, funded through several NIH grants.       The past 10 years have led to a variety of measurements tools in molecular biology that are near comprehensive in nature. For example, RNA expression detection microarrays can provide systematic quantitative information on the expression of over 40,000 unique RNAs within cells. Yet microarrays are just one of at least 30 large-scale measurement or experimental modalities available to investigators in molecular biology. We see scientific value in being able to integrate multiple large-scale data sets from all biological modalities to address biomedical questions that could otherwise not be answered. We recognize that the full agenda of working out the details for all possible inferential processes between all near-comprehensive modalities is too large. The goal of this project is to serve as a model automated system for gathering data related to particular experimental characteristic and perform inferential operators on these data. For this application, we are focusing on a pragmatic subset. Specifically, we propose intersecting near comprehensive data sets by phenotype, and intersecting lists of significant and related genes within these data sets in an automated manner.      The central hypothesis for this application is that integrating large-scale data sets across measurement  modalities is a synergistic process to create new knowledge and testable hypothesis in the area of diabetes, and inferential processes involving intersection across genes can be automated. n/a",CREATION AND APPLICATION OF A DIABETES KNOWLEDGE BASE,7125331,K22LM008261,"['RNA interference', 'adipocytes', 'artificial intelligence', 'automated data processing', 'cell differentiation', 'clinical research', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'diabetes mellitus genetics', 'human data', 'information systems', 'insulin sensitivity /resistance', 'noninsulin dependent diabetes mellitus', 'obesity', 'phenotype', 'quantitative trait loci', 'vocabulary', 'weight gain']",NLM,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,K22,2005,152083,-0.018394321031978404

"Extracting Semantic Knowledge from Clinical Data Sources DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Electronic medical record systems (EMR) contain a wealth of clinical data that is invaluable for biomedical research, but because there are no satisfactory methods to build coherent specialized knowledge bases, which represent the information in free text medical records, data mining and clinical discovery are held back. Medical Reporting Solutions, Inc. has developed advanced technology, which we propose to extend, refine, and test for constructing specialized semantic knowledge bases. These knowledge bases will encode the clinical information in medical reports, and enable automated natural language processing systems for extracting clinical knowledge.      Our research and development uses methods in corpus linguistics and sentential logic to represent the knowledge in free-text medical reports in an efficient, codeable manner. We have created tools to map sentences in a medical domain to unique codeable propositions. Our method for creating knowledge ontologies makes it easy for biomedical researchers to get semantic information at the appropriate level of detail. The knowledge base and mapping tables allow us to analyze medical reports in near real-time. One knowledge base, under development, is derived from hundreds of thousands of reports in the radiology domain, and we intend to analyze other medical domains using the methods we have pioneered.      Our phase one project plan includes further improving our knowledge editing tools, substantially enlarging our semantic knowledge base to cover over 60-70% of the radiology domain, and extensively test our knowledge representation schema against actual radiology reports. We plan to make the knowledge base freely accessible to the biomedical research community, while providing commercial services to codify free text reports found in EMRs. n/a",Extracting Semantic Knowledge from Clinical Data Sources,6988908,R43LM008974,"['automated medical record system', 'clinical research', 'computer data analysis', 'computer program /software', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'human data', 'informatics', 'information retrieval']",NLM,"LOGICAL SEMANTICS, INC.",R43,2005,100000,-0.044464994023778924
"The RPI Exploratory Center for Cheminformatics(RMI) The purpose of this Exploratory Center for Cheminformatics Research (ECCR) P20 planning grant is to develop a mechanism for bringing together and stimulating collaborative pilot projects among a constantly-evolving nucleus of experts in Cheminformatics-related fields ranging from methods of encoding and capturing molecular information, to machine learning and data mining techniques, to predictive model development, validation, interpretation and utilization. In addition to these research efforts, the Center will bring together a set of domain specialists and application scientists who will serve as both data generators and end users of the knowledge provided by the molecular property models and modeling methods developed during the course of the grant. This group will also test the new Cheminformatics software that will constitute a tangible, deliverable product from this work. Ten application project modules that exemplify possible interactions between various groups and areas of expertise within the Center are presented as part of this proposal. The unifying vision behind the proposed Center is that much of what is done in each of the subdisciplines represented here can be expressed in a Cheminformatics context: The many diverse project areas can be grouped into one or more overlapping categories: ""Data Generators"" (those who use either theoretical or experimental methods for creating or extracting knowledge), ""Machine Learning and Datamining"" groups (who perform model validation, feature selection, pattern recognition, generation of potentials of mean force and knowledge-based potential work), as well as ""Property-Prediction"" groups (who perform chemically-aware model building, molecular property descriptor generation, Quantitative Structure-Property Relationship modeling, validation, and interpretation), and ""Application"" groups who utilize the information made available using the new tools and methods that are developed as part of the Center.

"Capturing and linking genomic and clinical information DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The long-term aim of this project is to use natural language processing (NLP) to build a high throughput tool for facilitating cancer research by automatically extracting and organizing clinical and genetic information from the Electronic Medical Record (EMR) and from journal articles.  Our research involves advanced NLP techniques to:  1) enable the mining of phenotypic and genotypic data in the EMR; 2) automatically amass knowledge concerned with cancer and biomolecular relationships from journals; 3) develop a WEB-enabled visualization tool for researchers that will present diverse views of the knowledge; and 4) develop an Infrastructure that will link to the clinical data warehouse at New York Presbyterian Hospital (NYPH) and to GeneWays, a related project that allows researchers to visualize pathways.   More specifically, MedLEE (the NLP system we developed that extracts and encodes clinical and environmental information from the EMR) will be extended to extract genetic information contained in the EMR; subsequently, twelve years of patient reports will be processed and the extracted data added to the warehouse.  In addition, a new system, PhenoGenes, will be developed based on MedLEE and GeneWays (which contains another NLP system we developed that extracts and codifies biomolecular relations from journal articles).  PhenoGenes will capture biomolecular interactions directly associated with the treatment, diagnosis, and prognosis of cancer.  It will also generate an XML knowledge base that will integrate and organize the information that will be captured, and a Web-enabled tool that will allow users to browse and view the knowledge clustered according to different orientations (e.g. gene, disease, tissue, interaction, etc.).  The knowledge base will be linked to the GeneWays system, so that relevant pathways can be visualized.   MedLEE is utilized operationally at NYPH.  It also has been demonstrated that both NLP systems are highly effective.  This current project builds upon our experience and success with these systems.

"Engineering Approach to Individually Tailored Medicine DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Technological advances in medicine, particularly imaging, have resulted in early detection, objective documentation, and overall better insight into medical conditions. These advances, however, have also led to an increasingly complex medical record. Physicians now spend a significant portion of their time retrieving, structuring, organizing, and analyzing patient data, inaccurately and inefficiently: current information management systems in clinical medicine do not adequately support these functions, critical to the real-world practice of evidence-based medicine. Objective evidence, tailored to an individual patient, must be readily available to physicians as part of routine practice if true evidence-based medical practice is to become a reality. This proposal details the development and evaluation of several innovative technologies, providing solutions for the information management problems faced by physicians: 1) a distributed XML-based peer-to-peer medical record architecture, to enable portability and accessibility of patient information, regardless of geographical location; 2) a natural language processing (NLP) system for free-text medical reports, to automatically structure and characterize the contents of medical documents; 3) a phenomenon-centric data model, which supports the problem-solving tasks of the physician through explicit linking of objective findings (e.g., images, lab values) to medical problems; and 4) a time-based, problem-centric, context-sensitive visualization of the medical record, supporting a ""gestalt"" view of the patient, with access to detailed patient data when needed. Together, these technologies will form a comprehensive system facilitating evidence-based medicine in a real-world environment. System evaluation will proceed in two parts. Technical evaluation focuses on each of the proposed technologies individually, gauging classical performance metrics: scalability of the distributed medical record; NLP precision/recall; expressibility/comprehensibility of the data model; and the usability of the new medical record user interface. Clinical evaluation will follow a time series study design (""off-on-off""), with implementation of the entire system in a real-world clinical environment, the UCLA Clark Urological Center. Clinical evaluation will measure the effectiveness of the system as a whole on intermediate outcomes (process of care) including the number of visits, number of procedures performed, and time to final diagnosis (disposition), as well as the impact on physician efficiency (time required to gather information and review charts). n/a",Engineering Approach to Individually Tailored Medicine,6917854,R01EB000362,"['automated medical record system', 'clinical research', 'computer assisted medical decision making', 'data collection methodology /evaluation', 'human data', 'informatics', 'information display', 'information system analysis', 'mathematical model', 'medical records', 'outcomes research', 'patient care management', 'performance']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2005,593264,0.008093271828865257

"Technology Development for a MolBio Knowledge-Base   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Since the introduction of the Mycin system more than 25 years ago, it has widely been hypothesized that extensive, well-represented computer knowledge-bases will facilitate a wide variety of scientific and clinical tasks. Driven by growing knowledge-management challenges arising from the proliferation of high throughput instrumentation, recently created knowledge-bases in areas related to genomics and related aspects of contemporary biology, such as the Gene Ontology, EcoCyc and PharmGKB, have begun to become integrated into the laboratory practices of a growing number of molecular biologists. However, these successful molecular biology knowledge-bases (MBKBs) have two drawbacks which impede their more general application: each has been narrowed to a particular special purpose, either in its domain of applicability or in the scope of knowledge represented, and each of these knowledge-bases was constructed largely on the basis of enormous human effort. Given the current state of molecular biology data and recent advances in database integration and information extraction technology, we proposed to test the following hypothesis: Current computational technology and existing human-curated knowledge resources are sufficient to build an extensive, high-quality computational knowledge-base of molecular biology. To test this hypothesis we propose to first create tools which can (a) automatically link incommensurate knowledge sources using semantic linking, and (b) use natural language processing techniques to extract new information from NCBrs GeneRIFs and from the GO definitions fields; and second, to evaluate the results of these methods by carefully quantifying the degree to which the induced linkages and extracted assertions are complete, consistent and correct. Although we propose to construct a broad and rich knowledge-base in order to develop and test the adequacy of largely automated methods to leverage existing human-curated collections, we do not propose to build a comprehensive MBKB.            n/a",Technology Development for a MolBio Knowledge-Base,6822280,R01LM008111,"['artificial intelligence', 'bioinformatics', 'biomedical automation', 'computational biology', 'computer program /software', 'functional /structural genomics', 'information retrieval', 'molecular biology information system', 'technology /technique development']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,R01,2004,577307,-0.03336152686444338
"Discovering and Applying Knowledge in Clinical Databases DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     With the advent of improved clinical information system products (e.g., ambulatory systems, order entry  systems), improved data entry technologies (e.g., speech recognition, text processing techniques), and  further adoption of data interchange standards, more institutions are generating electronic medical records, and these records will expand in breadth, depth, and degree of coding in the future. The records are used mainly for individual patient care, but exploiting the records for clinical research and quality functions has lagged behind. Major challenges include the wide range of complex data and missing and inaccurate data.      We propose to continue our work to develop and test methods to mine a clinical data repository. A  special emphasis will be to exploit the vast amount of information in the repository (latent associations and knowledge) and to use computer intensive techniques and advances in data representation and manipulation to better interpret what is in the database and to overcome the challenges of complex, missing, and inaccurate data. We hypothesize that data mining techniques can be applied to a repository to generate accurate clinical interpretations. We further hypothesize that associations latent in a clinically rich repository can be used to improve the classification of cases in that repository.      We aim to develop methods to prepare data for mining; to characterize the information in the clinical data repository; to develop similarity measures based on manipulation of natural language processor output and on information retrieval techniques; to apply nearest neighbor technique and case-based reasoning to improve classification; to develop a statistically based method to improve classification of cases with incomplete or inaccurate data; and to apply our methods to real clinical research questions and carry out additional data mining research.      The researchers in the Department of Medical Informatics at Columbia University are uniquely positioned to carry out this research, given the experience of the team (data mining, statistics, health data organization, health knowledge representation, natural language processing), the availability of a repository of 13 years of data on 2 million patients, and the availability of a natural language processor called MedLEE to convert millions of narrative reports into richly coded clinical data. n/a",Discovering and Applying Knowledge in Clinical Databases,6754395,R01LM006910,"['artificial intelligence', 'classification', 'clinical research', 'computer assisted medical decision making', 'computer assisted patient care', 'computer program /software', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'data collection methodology /evaluation', 'health care facility information system', 'human data', 'information system analysis', 'method development', 'vocabulary development for information system']",NLM,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2004,380979,0.006915542245600526
"Statistical NLP Analysis of Cross-discipline Clinical Text DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     An emerging trend in computational linguistics is melding natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML) to help computers make sense of human-generated free text. The blending of these disciplines is relatively rare in biomedical informatics. Past medical NLP/ML research work is biased heavily towards linguistic methods that attempt to reason about grammar and syntax aided by a domain-focal knowledge base (e.g., one for radiology or one for clinical pathology). The aim of the work proposed here takes a different tack: exploring the utility of a statistical approach to clinical NLP, one augmented by machine learning and concentrating on general progress notes from across multiple clinical domains. The specific clinical goal will be to identify adverse drug events described implicitly or explicitly in inpatient progress notes. Rather than relying on a narrow domain focus to provide enough context restriction to make text interpretation tractable, this approach will use statistical patterns in note author information (e.g., profession, note type, treating ward) and patient information (e.g., admit diagnosis, procedures performed, temporal note relationships) for context restriction. The research component of this proposal is divided into two categories: three small-scale projects designed to rapidly hone new skills developed under the training component, and a large-scale project that assesses the feasibility of cross-discipline clinical text analysis. n/a",Statistical NLP Analysis of Cross-discipline Clinical Text,6836781,F38LM008478,"['bioinformatics', 'clinical research', 'computational biology', 'human data', 'library', 'mathematical model', 'public health', 'statistics /biometry']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,F38,2004,94545,-0.005863167740218554
"Nurse Practitioner Access to Genetics Health Literature    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This training proposal describes a research plan which tests the application of a computer science solution to a clinical problem encountered by nurse practitioners (NPs). As our understanding of genetics health increases, NPs will need to provide care and create health promotion regimens mindful of each client's genetic profile. Access to the rapidly developing genetics health literature is critical for this practice model, but may be difficult, because existing search methods lead to many irrelevant results, and may retrieve the proper result only when precise keywords are used. The NP searching for information that would guide her practice may be forced to make a decision with less than complete or current information. This proposal outlines three studies, which investigate how the semantic web concepts of linking related ideas and terms can improve NPs' access to the genetics health literature. Study 1 explores NPs' genetics health information needs. Study 2 tests the applicability of existing ontologies (terminologies coupled with machine-readable statements about the meanings and relationships of the terms) to nursing. Study 3 tests a prototype intelligent agent employing ontology to retrieve literature relevant to NPs' genetics health information needs.         n/a",Nurse Practitioner Access to Genetics Health Literature,6837265,F37LM008636,"['artificial intelligence', 'clinical research', 'genetics', 'human subject', 'informatics', 'information retrieval', 'nurse practitioners', 'patient care management', 'predoctoral investigator', 'publications', 'semantics', 'young adult human (21-34)']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN MADISON,F37,2004,38596,-0.041173614407442057
"Collaborative Brain Mapping: Tools for Sharing    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Sharing data between research centers is increasingly important for contemporary brain imaging studies because they involve large numbers of subjects and complex analysis protocols that require highly specialized expertise. Our long-term objective is to facilitate brain-imaging research by enabling remote researchers to pool data between institutions and to analyze data using the appropriate algorithms executing on distributed resources. There are a number of difficult data management and technology challenges that have limited the success of data sharing environments. Rather than attempt to develop a comprehensive and general solution, we propose to develop a set of open, interoperable, and portable software tools that address critical issues currently limiting efforts to share and analyze brain-imaging data. Building upon years of providing brain-mapping expertise to collaborators, we propose to solve problems that we repeatedly encounter and that currently limit progress in brain imaging research. We propose to develop validated tools that enable collaborators to remotely access a variety of data analysis methods and databases. We will create web-based tools to perform multi-institutional studies, and provide access to complex data processing protocols executing on distributed computing resources. There are three specific aims. 1) Enable the web based acquisition and management of data utilizing an access control system that includes consideration of subject consent limits and investigator imposed conditions to facilitate data pooling for multi-institutional studies. This system will convert data files between different formats and schemas so that data can be used consistently between analysis programs and databases. It will also anonymize images and metadata according to institution-specific protocols. 2) Develop a system that is aware of data type and provenance so that it may act intelligently to arbitrate between different analysis programs. This system will capture the expertise of experienced lab personnel in the usage of various tools and assist new users in designing appropriate analytic strategies. 3) Create meta-algorithms that improve the robustness of techniques for neuroimaging analysis by intelligently combining the results from multiple algorithms. The proposed approach will provide a set of tools that address significant problems in data sharing and utilization. The resulting information technology will be scalable and applicable to other scientific data sharing problems.         n/a",Collaborative Brain Mapping: Tools for Sharing,6802141,R01MH071940,"['Internet', 'artificial intelligence', 'bioimaging /biomedical imaging', 'brain imaging /visualization /scanning', 'brain mapping', 'computer data analysis', 'computer program /software', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'confidentiality', 'data management', 'information dissemination', 'information systems', 'mathematics']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2004,668796,-0.0019333741492717738
"Preserving Privacy in Medical Data Sets Privacy is a fundamental right and needs to be protected.  For health care related d information, there are regulations for disclosure.  These regulations were motivated by the public's concern of breaches of confidentiality that might result in discrimination.  The recent progress in electronic medical record technology, the Internet, and the genetic revolution, together with media reports on violations of privacy have generated increasing interest in this topic.  A common belief is that sensitive information is more easily available with the use of networked computers. Since total lack of disclosure is not realistic, current regulations require that the ""minimal amount"" of information be given to a certain party.  A thorough study on what constitutes ""minimal"" for particular types of applications and a ""usefulness index"" is lacking.  An exact quantification of the potential for privacy breach in de-identified or anonymized databases is also lacking.  Definition and quantification of these indices is important for decision-making.  As we demonstrate, de-identified data sets can still be used for inference and therefore may disclose sensitive information.  The use of machine learning methods to verify the remaining functional dependencies in a de- identified data set leads to better understanding of the possible inferences.  Anonymization techniques based on logic, statistics, database theory, and machine learning methods can help in the protection of privacy. We will formally define and study anonymity in databases, from a theoretical and a practical standpoint.  We will develop and implement algorithms to anonymize data sets that will be in accordance with the balance of anonymity and ""usefulness"" of the disclosed data sets.  We will also develop and implement algorithms to verify the anonymity of a given data set and indicate the type of records that are at highest risk for a privacy attack.

"Using Narrative Data to Enrich the Online Medical Record  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Narrative information is vital to health care, because it enables physicians to synthesize the raw facts and provide a context and interpretation for them.  Electronic medical record systems contain a wealth of clinical data, but typically lack the clinical narrative found in paper records, e.g., the patient history and progress notes.  Numerous barriers prevent the timely acquisition of narrative data, and most computer systems are unable to use such information productively.  Current approaches offer a tradeoff, capture of rich clinical data that lacks structure (using transcription services or speech technology), versus entry of structured data that lacks flexibility and expressiveness (using template systems).  Natural language processing can integrate these approaches by allowing physicians full freedom of expression while producing structured documents that preserve the richness and enable further computer processing.   This proposal seeks to capture and structure narrative in the online medical record in order to improve entry time, completeness, information content and consistency of clinical documentation.  The specific aims of this proposal are:  1) Maintain the continuity of the medical record; a lengthy medical record requires significant time to review and digest.  Many facts from past narratives remain true in the present or persist with minor changes.  By automatically bringing these facts forward into the current narrative, the system can reduce the time to enter the document, and improve the completeness of documentation by maintaining continuity of what is known about a patient; 2) Integrate the medical record:  Electronic medical records contain a vast amount of data.  However, most of these data are raw facts.  By helping the physician to connect, interpret and summarize these facts, the system can improve the usefulness of the information in the record, and reduce the time to enter documents by performing some syntheses automatically; and 3) Harmonize the medical record; the multidisciplinary nature of health care creates the potential for the differing perspectives and interpretations in the medical record, and even contradictions.  By bringing possible discrepancies to the attention of the physician, the system can help resolve the inconsistencies.     n/a",Using Narrative Data to Enrich the Online Medical Record,6802698,R01LM007268,"['automated medical record system', 'clinical research', 'computer data analysis', 'data collection methodology /evaluation', 'human data', 'information systems', 'medical records', 'online computer', 'primary care physician', 'vocabulary']",NLM,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2004,437194,-0.011674168665679946
"Capturing and linking genomic and clinical information DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The long-term aim of this project is to use natural language processing (NLP) to build a high throughput tool for facilitating cancer research by automatically extracting and organizing clinical and genetic information from the Electronic Medical Record (EMR) and from journal articles.  Our research involves advanced NLP techniques to:  1) enable the mining of phenotypic and genotypic data in the EMR; 2) automatically amass knowledge concerned with cancer and biomolecular relationships from journals; 3) develop a WEB-enabled visualization tool for researchers that will present diverse views of the knowledge; and 4) develop an Infrastructure that will link to the clinical data warehouse at New York Presbyterian Hospital (NYPH) and to GeneWays, a related project that allows researchers to visualize pathways.   More specifically, MedLEE (the NLP system we developed that extracts and encodes clinical and environmental information from the EMR) will be extended to extract genetic information contained in the EMR; subsequently, twelve years of patient reports will be processed and the extracted data added to the warehouse.  In addition, a new system, PhenoGenes, will be developed based on MedLEE and GeneWays (which contains another NLP system we developed that extracts and codifies biomolecular relations from journal articles).  PhenoGenes will capture biomolecular interactions directly associated with the treatment, diagnosis, and prognosis of cancer.  It will also generate an XML knowledge base that will integrate and organize the information that will be captured, and a Web-enabled tool that will allow users to browse and view the knowledge clustered according to different orientations (e.g. gene, disease, tissue, interaction, etc.).  The knowledge base will be linked to the GeneWays system, so that relevant pathways can be visualized.   MedLEE is utilized operationally at NYPH.  It also has been demonstrated that both NLP systems are highly effective.  This current project builds upon our experience and success with these systems.  The availability of related compatible clinical and biomolecular NLP systems, provide an exceptional opportunity to pave the way for capture, integration and organization of phenotypic and genotypic data and knowledge that will be used to radically improve patient care. n/a",Capturing and linking genomic and clinical information,6781785,R01LM007659,"['cancer information system', 'clinical research', 'data collection', 'health science research', 'human data', 'informatics', 'library', 'medical records', 'molecular biology information system']",NLM,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2004,468590,0.01034576266144463
"Engineering Approach to Individually Tailored Medicine DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Technological advances in medicine, particularly imaging, have resulted in early detection, objective documentation, and overall better insight into medical conditions. These advances, however, have also led to an increasingly complex medical record. Physicians now spend a significant portion of their time retrieving, structuring, organizing, and analyzing patient data, inaccurately and inefficiently: current information management systems in clinical medicine do not adequately support these functions, critical to the real-world practice of evidence-based medicine. Objective evidence, tailored to an individual patient, must be readily available to physicians as part of routine practice if true evidence-based medical practice is to become a reality. This proposal details the development and evaluation of several innovative technologies, providing solutions for the information management problems faced by physicians: 1) a distributed XML-based peer-to-peer medical record architecture, to enable portability and accessibility of patient information, regardless of geographical location; 2) a natural language processing (NLP) system for free-text medical reports, to automatically structure and characterize the contents of medical documents; 3) a phenomenon-centric data model, which supports the problem-solving tasks of the physician through explicit linking of objective findings (e.g., images, lab values) to medical problems; and 4) a time-based, problem-centric, context-sensitive visualization of the medical record, supporting a ""gestalt"" view of the patient, with access to detailed patient data when needed. Together, these technologies will form a comprehensive system facilitating evidence-based medicine in a real-world environment. System evaluation will proceed in two parts. Technical evaluation focuses on each of the proposed technologies individually, gauging classical performance metrics: scalability of the distributed medical record; NLP precision/recall; expressibility/comprehensibility of the data model; and the usability of the new medical record user interface. Clinical evaluation will follow a time series study design (""off-on-off""), with implementation of the entire system in a real-world clinical environment, the UCLA Clark Urological Center. Clinical evaluation will measure the effectiveness of the system as a whole on intermediate outcomes (process of care) including the number of visits, number of procedures performed, and time to final diagnosis (disposition), as well as the impact on physician efficiency (time required to gather information and review charts). n/a",Engineering Approach to Individually Tailored Medicine,6749459,R01EB000362,"['automated medical record system', 'clinical research', 'computer assisted medical decision making', 'data collection methodology /evaluation', 'human data', 'informatics', 'information display', 'information system analysis', 'mathematical model', 'medical records', 'outcomes research', 'patient care management', 'performance']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2004,594553,0.008093271828865257

"Access to distributed de-identified imaging data DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    The widespread adoption of picture archiving and communications systems (PACS) in radiology and the implementation and deployment of the DICOM communication standard represent an opportunity to link multiple PACS at multiple sites into a distributed data warehouse of great potential utility for investigators in oncology research and epidemiology. Where the federal HIPAA privacy regulations have largely been seen as an emerging impediment to oncology research from the creation, management and use of cancer registries to large-scale retrospective studies addressing rarer forms of neoplasia, in fact the digital nature of PACS-based imaging data lends itself to automated de-identification that could transform multiple distributed clinical information systems into a readily accessible treasure trove of research data that falls within the ""safe harbor"" provisions of HIPAA's privacy regulations. Our firm has developed a platform, originally intended for clinical use, to securely link multiple PACS and RIS from multiple vendors beneath a web interface giving users transparent access to a ""virtual archive"" spanning an arbitrary number of institutions. In this Phase I SBIR application, we propose to explore the feasibility of extending our system to grant researchers access to large volumes of dynamically de-identified imaging data while surmounting each of the major criticisms of the viability of such data for research purposes. We propose developing an open web-services architecture that will enable straightforward integration with any other information system and propose a design that adheres to existing industry standards while laying the groundwork for compliance with future standards and informatics initiatives.

"PACS INFRASTRUCTURE TO SUPPORT-BASED MEDICAL PRACTICE The broad, tong-term objective of this Program Project Grant is to develop an effective imaging-based information and health care delivery system to support clinical practice, research, and education. The specific aims of the grant are to: (1) evolve PACS into an effective infrastructure that promotes the objectification of subjective patient clinical symptoms, (2) develop methods for improving the characterization of medical data through structured data collection, natural language processing of medical reports (NLP) and parametric summarization for medical images, (3) provide flexible, patient -specific presentation methods of medical images, timelines, and structured medical data. The objectification, intelligent access, and flexible presentation of medical data provide better information, which will facilitate the evidence-based practice of medicine and enhance research and evaluation. Five integrated projects employ novel techniques to address specific elements of the system. Intelligently selected imaging protocols are used to objectify patient symptoms. Well-defined information units capture and structure diverse forms of data, whether directly or indirectly through NP for text of parametric summarization for images. Patient medical records are correlated with medical literature by content. Timelines organize the data into a format that allow medical events, their dependencies, and conditional trends to be easily visualized (Project 3). Scenario-based proxies provide up-to-date access to relevant medical information. Relaxation broadens queries to medical information when exact matches are not found.

"UMLS ENHANCED DYNAMIC AGENTS TO MANAGE MEDICAL KNOWLEDGE   DESCRIPTION (adapted from the Abstract):                                             With the explosion of medical information accessible via the Internet, there         is a growing need for development of better access to the online medical             literature databases through user-friendly systems and interface.  The               proliferation of online information and the diversity of interfaces to data          collections has led to a medical information gap between medical researchers         and the accessibility of medical literature databases.  Users who need access        to such information must visit a variety of sources, which can be both               excessively time consuming and potentially dangerous if the information is           needed for treatment decisions.  In addition, information generated by using         existing search engines is often too general or inaccurate.  Particularly            frustrating is that simple queries can result in an excessive number of              documents retrieved - too many to search through to determine which are and          which are not relevant.                                                                                                                                                   The goal of this research is to extend a bridge across the medical information       gap by creating easy-to-use interfaces to medical literature databases based         on UMLS-enhanced Semantic Parsing and Personalized Medical Agent (PMA):                                                                                                   (1)  UMLS-enhanced Semantic Parsing: Our first goal will be to combine noun          phrasing and co-occurrence analysis techniques recently developed by The             University of Arizona Artificial Intelligence Lab (AI Lab) for the NSF-funded        Illinois Digital Library Initiative (DLI) project with existing components           found in the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) developed by NLM.

"Discovering and Applying Knowledge in Clinical Databases DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     With the advent of improved clinical information system products (e.g., ambulatory systems, order entry  systems), improved data entry technologies (e.g., speech recognition, text processing techniques), and  further adoption of data interchange standards, more institutions are generating electronic medical records, and these records will expand in breadth, depth, and degree of coding in the future. The records are used mainly for individual patient care, but exploiting the records for clinical research and quality functions has lagged behind. Major challenges include the wide range of complex data and missing and inaccurate data.      We propose to continue our work to develop and test methods to mine a clinical data repository. A  special emphasis will be to exploit the vast amount of information in the repository (latent associations and knowledge) and to use computer intensive techniques and advances in data representation and manipulation to better interpret what is in the database and to overcome the challenges of complex, missing, and inaccurate data. We hypothesize that data mining techniques can be applied to a repository to generate accurate clinical interpretations. We further hypothesize that associations latent in a clinically rich repository can be used to improve the classification of cases in that repository.      We aim to develop methods to prepare data for mining; to characterize the information in the clinical data repository; to develop similarity measures based on manipulation of natural language processor output and on information retrieval techniques; to apply nearest neighbor technique and case-based reasoning to improve classification; to develop a statistically based method to improve classification of cases with incomplete or inaccurate data; and to apply our methods to real clinical research questions and carry out additional data mining research.      The researchers in the Department of Medical Informatics at Columbia University are uniquely positioned to carry out this research, given the experience of the team (data mining, statistics, health data organization, health knowledge representation, natural language processing), the availability of a repository of 13 years of data on 2 million patients, and the availability of a natural language processor called MedLEE to convert millions of narrative reports into richly coded clinical data. n/a",Discovering and Applying Knowledge in Clinical Databases,6630735,R01LM006910,"['artificial intelligence', ' classification', ' clinical research', ' computer assisted medical decision making', ' computer assisted patient care', ' computer program /software', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' data collection methodology /evaluation', ' health care facility information system', ' human data', ' information system analysis', ' method development', ' vocabulary development for information system']",NLM,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2003,377617,0.006915542245600526
"Intelligent Information Systems for Systems Biology DESCRIPTION (Provided by Applicant): Our Center will attack the challenges created by the large quantity of data generated from new high throughput technologies. We have teamed biologists, computer scientists and computational scientists from several Universities to build an experienced and distinguished team. Our first major tool building project will be an Object Oriented Framework for the integration of data and tools for genomics, proteomics, DNA arrays and protein-protein interactions. This tool will follow the data from the source through model building. It will build on existing open source tools such as a data acquisition package from particle physics (ROOT), a public database system (MYSQL or PostgreSQL), statistics tools (""R""), graphics libraries, a variety of software tools that have been developed at ISB and new tools needed for the new technologies. We stress the use of an open source system as a means to build the community, creating a functioning system that can be tailored for research and education. We then propose to augment this system with tools for analysis, visualization and model building. We will use yeast as a model system owing to the wide range of data that it available for it.

"Preserving Privacy in Medical Data Sets Privacy is a fundamental right and needs to be protected.  For health care related d information, there are regulations for disclosure.  These regulations were motivated by the public's concern of breaches of confidentiality that might result in discrimination.  The recent progress in electronic medical record technology, the Internet, and the genetic revolution, together with media reports on violations of privacy have generated increasing interest in this topic.  A common belief is that sensitive information is more easily available with the use of networked computers. Since total lack of disclosure is not realistic, current regulations require that the ""minimal amount"" of information be given to a certain party.  A thorough study on what constitutes ""minimal"" for particular types of applications and a ""usefulness index"" is lacking.  An exact quantification of the potential for privacy breach in de-identified or anonymized databases is also lacking.  Definition and quantification of these indices is important for decision-making.  As we demonstrate, de-identified data sets can still be used for inference and therefore may disclose sensitive information.  The use of machine learning methods to verify the remaining functional dependencies in a de- identified data set leads to better understanding of the possible inferences.  Anonymization techniques based on logic, statistics, database theory, and machine learning methods can help in the protection of privacy. We will formally define and study anonymity in databases, from a theoretical and a practical standpoint.  We will develop and implement algorithms to anonymize data sets that will be in accordance with the balance of anonymity and ""usefulness"" of the disclosed data sets.  We will also develop and implement algorithms to verify the anonymity of a given data set and indicate the type of records that are at highest risk for a privacy attack.  We will make our methods and documented tools freely available to researchers via the WWW. n/a",Preserving Privacy in Medical Data Sets,6620783,R01LM007273,"['Internet', ' behavioral /social science research tag', ' computer program /software', ' computer simulation', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' data management', ' decision making', ' health care facility information system', ' health care policy', ' human data', ' human rights', ' information dissemination', ' information retrieval', ' mathematical model', ' medical records', ' model design /development', ' patient oriented research', ' statistics /biometry']",NLM,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2003,380761,-0.0007715827211194191
"Using Narrative Data to Enrich the Online Medical Record  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Narrative information is vital to health care, because it enables physicians to synthesize the raw facts and provide a context and interpretation for them.  Electronic medical record systems contain a wealth of clinical data, but typically lack the clinical narrative found in paper records, e.g., the patient history and progress notes.  Numerous barriers prevent the timely acquisition of narrative data, and most computer systems are unable to use such information productively.  Current approaches offer a tradeoff, capture of rich clinical data that lacks structure (using transcription services or speech technology), versus entry of structured data that lacks flexibility and expressiveness (using template systems).  Natural language processing can integrate these approaches by allowing physicians full freedom of expression while producing structured documents that preserve the richness and enable further computer processing.   This proposal seeks to capture and structure narrative in the online medical record in order to improve entry time, completeness, information content and consistency of clinical documentation.  The specific aims of this proposal are:  1) Maintain the continuity of the medical record; a lengthy medical record requires significant time to review and digest.  Many facts from past narratives remain true in the present or persist with minor changes.  By automatically bringing these facts forward into the current narrative, the system can reduce the time to enter the document, and improve the completeness of documentation by maintaining continuity of what is known about a patient; 2) Integrate the medical record:  Electronic medical records contain a vast amount of data.  However, most of these data are raw facts.  By helping the physician to connect, interpret and summarize these facts, the system can improve the usefulness of the information in the record, and reduce the time to enter documents by performing some syntheses automatically; and 3) Harmonize the medical record; the multidisciplinary nature of health care creates the potential for the differing perspectives and interpretations in the medical record, and even contradictions.  By bringing possible discrepancies to the attention of the physician, the system can help resolve the inconsistencies.     n/a",Using Narrative Data to Enrich the Online Medical Record,6665504,R01LM007268,"['automated medical record system', ' clinical research', ' computer data analysis', ' data collection methodology /evaluation', ' human data', ' information systems', ' medical records', ' online computer', ' primary care physician', ' vocabulary']",NLM,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2003,424735,-0.011674168665679946
"Capturing and linking genomic and clinical information DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The long-term aim of this project is to use natural language processing (NLP) to build a high throughput tool for facilitating cancer research by automatically extracting and organizing clinical and genetic information from the Electronic Medical Record (EMR) and from journal articles.  Our research involves advanced NLP techniques to:  1) enable the mining of phenotypic and genotypic data in the EMR; 2) automatically amass knowledge concerned with cancer and biomolecular relationships from journals; 3) develop a WEB-enabled visualization tool for researchers that will present diverse views of the knowledge; and 4) develop an Infrastructure that will link to the clinical data warehouse at New York Presbyterian Hospital (NYPH) and to GeneWays, a related project that allows researchers to visualize pathways.   More specifically, MedLEE (the NLP system we developed that extracts and encodes clinical and environmental information from the EMR) will be extended to extract genetic information contained in the EMR; subsequently, twelve years of patient reports will be processed and the extracted data added to the warehouse.  In addition, a new system, PhenoGenes, will be developed based on MedLEE and GeneWays (which contains another NLP system we developed that extracts and codifies biomolecular relations from journal articles).  PhenoGenes will capture biomolecular interactions directly associated with the treatment, diagnosis, and prognosis of cancer.  It will also generate an XML knowledge base that will integrate and organize the information that will be captured, and a Web-enabled tool that will allow users to browse and view the knowledge clustered according to different orientations (e.g. gene, disease, tissue, interaction, etc.).  The knowledge base will be linked to the GeneWays system, so that relevant pathways can be visualized.   MedLEE is utilized operationally at NYPH.  It also has been demonstrated that both NLP systems are highly effective.  This current project builds upon our experience and success with these systems.  The availability of related compatible clinical and biomolecular NLP systems, provide an exceptional opportunity to pave the way for capture, integration and organization of phenotypic and genotypic data and knowledge that will be used to radically improve patient care. n/a",Capturing and linking genomic and clinical information,6558664,R01LM007659,"['cancer information system', ' clinical research', ' data collection', ' health science research', ' human data', ' informatics', ' library', ' medical records', ' molecular biology information system']",NLM,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2003,464049,0.01034576266144463
"Engineering Approach to Individually Tailored Medicine DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Technological advances in medicine, particularly imaging, have resulted in early detection, objective documentation, and overall better insight into medical conditions. These advances, however, have also led to an increasingly complex medical record. Physicians now spend a significant portion of their time retrieving, structuring, organizing, and analyzing patient data, inaccurately and inefficiently: current information management systems in clinical medicine do not adequately support these functions, critical to the real-world practice of evidence-based medicine. Objective evidence, tailored to an individual patient, must be readily available to physicians as part of routine practice if true evidence-based medical practice is to become a reality. This proposal details the development and evaluation of several innovative technologies, providing solutions for the information management problems faced by physicians: 1) a distributed XML-based peer-to-peer medical record architecture, to enable portability and accessibility of patient information, regardless of geographical location; 2) a natural language processing (NLP) system for free-text medical reports, to automatically structure and characterize the contents of medical documents; 3) a phenomenon-centric data model, which supports the problem-solving tasks of the physician through explicit linking of objective findings (e.g., images, lab values) to medical problems; and 4) a time-based, problem-centric, context-sensitive visualization of the medical record, supporting a ""gestalt"" view of the patient, with access to detailed patient data when needed. Together, these technologies will form a comprehensive system facilitating evidence-based medicine in a real-world environment. System evaluation will proceed in two parts. Technical evaluation focuses on each of the proposed technologies individually, gauging classical performance metrics: scalability of the distributed medical record; NLP precision/recall; expressibility/comprehensibility of the data model; and the usability of the new medical record user interface. Clinical evaluation will follow a time series study design (""off-on-off""), with implementation of the entire system in a real-world clinical environment, the UCLA Clark Urological Center. Clinical evaluation will measure the effectiveness of the system as a whole on intermediate outcomes (process of care) including the number of visits, number of procedures performed, and time to final diagnosis (disposition), as well as the impact on physician efficiency (time required to gather information and review charts). n/a",Engineering Approach to Individually Tailored Medicine,6678913,R01EB000362,"['automated medical record system', ' clinical research', ' computer assisted medical decision making', ' data collection methodology /evaluation', ' human data', ' informatics', ' information display', ' information system analysis', ' mathematical model', ' medical records', ' outcomes research', ' patient care management', ' performance']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2003,572597,0.008093271828865257

"Access to distributed de-identified imaging data DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    The widespread adoption of picture archiving and communications systems (PACS) in radiology and the implementation and deployment of the DICOM communication standard represent an opportunity to link multiple PACS at multiple sites into a distributed data warehouse of great potential utility for investigators in oncology research and epidemiology. Where the federal HIPAA privacy regulations have largely been seen as an emerging impediment to oncology research from the creation, management and use of cancer registries to large-scale retrospective studies addressing rarer forms of neoplasia, in fact the digital nature of PACS-based imaging data lends itself to automated de-identification that could transform multiple distributed clinical information systems into a readily accessible treasure trove of research data that falls within the ""safe harbor"" provisions of HIPAA's privacy regulations. Our firm has developed a platform, originally intended for clinical use, to securely link multiple PACS and RIS from multiple vendors beneath a web interface giving users transparent access to a ""virtual archive"" spanning an arbitrary number of institutions. In this Phase I SBIR application, we propose to explore the feasibility of extending our system to grant researchers access to large volumes of dynamically de-identified imaging data while surmounting each of the major criticisms of the viability of such data for research purposes. We propose developing an open web-services architecture that will enable straightforward integration with any other information system and propose a design that adheres to existing industry standards while laying the groundwork for compliance with future standards and informatics initiatives. This study will also involve examining the regulation of re-identification through the use of threshold cryptography, as well as the feasibility of a probabilistic sampling search engine intended to prevent unauthorized identification of patients through multiple intersecting queries on narrowing criteria, while still permitting researchers to choose the appropriate resolving power of the engine to suit a particular investigation. These studies will include benchmarking the performance of these dynamic processes, quantifying the load they place on live clinical information systems, and optimizing the design to minimize such impact. Should feasibility be demonstrated, Phase II would involve a proof-of-concept demonstration across multiple academic medical institutions as well as steps to prepare for commercialization including indexing studies based on structured reporting and natural language processing, content-based information retrieval, refinement and usability testing of the web interfaces, and extension of the system to permit IRB-approved research on individually-identifiable data.

"PACS INFRASTRUCTURE TO SUPPORT-BASED MEDICAL PRACTICE The broad, tong-term objective of this Program Project Grant is to develop an effective imaging-based information and health care delivery system to support clinical practice, research, and education. The specific aims of the grant are to: (1) evolve PACS into an effective infrastructure that promotes the objectification of subjective patient clinical symptoms, (2) develop methods for improving the characterization of medical data through structured data collection, natural language processing of medical reports (NLP) and parametric summarization for medical images, (3) provide flexible, patient -specific presentation methods of medical images, timelines, and structured medical data. The objectification, intelligent access, and flexible presentation of medical data provide better information, which will facilitate the evidence-based practice of medicine and enhance research and evaluation. Five integrated projects employ novel techniques to address specific elements of the system. Intelligently selected imaging protocols are used to objectify patient symptoms. Well-defined information units capture and structure diverse forms of data, whether directly or indirectly through NP for text of parametric summarization for images. Patient medical records are correlated with medical literature by content. Timelines organize the data into a format that allow medical events, their dependencies, and conditional trends to be easily visualized (Project 3).

Together, they form a unique infrastructure that provides broad and intelligently customized access to well-defined structured data and up-to-date literature. This, in addition to patient-specific relevant data, expert opinion, and similar cases with known outcome, will promote the evidence-based practice of medicine. Five integrated projects employ novel techniques to address specific elements of the system. Intelligently secreted imaging protocols are used to objectify patient symptoms. Well-defined information units capture and structure diverse forms of data, whether directly or indirectly through NLP for text or parametric summarization for images. Patient medical records are correlated with medical literature by content. Timelines organize the data into a format that allow medical events, their dependencies, and conditional trends to be easily visualized (Project 3). Scenario-based proxies provide up-to-date access to relevant medical information. Relaxation broadens queries to medical information when exact matches are not found.

Although a formal cost-effectiveness study is not proposed, the foundation is laid for these measurements when these PACs technologies mature. These measurements will be facilitated by recording resource utilization, determining of imaging-based episodes of care, and counter- specific information related to a chief complaint.  n/a",PACS INFRASTRUCTURE TO SUPPORT-BASED MEDICAL PRACTICE,6682850,P01EB000216,"['automated medical record system', ' health care facility information system', ' radiology', ' telemedicine']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,P01,2003,1645392,0.004469752969579626
"DISCOVERING AND APPLYING KNOWLEDGE IN CLINICAL DATABASES A real-time clinical repository contains a wealth of detailed information useful for clinical care, research, and administration.  In their raw form, however, the data are difficult to use there is too much volume, too much detail, missing values, and inaccuracies. Clinicians, researchers, and administrators require higher level interpretations that address their questions. For example, a clinician may need to know whether a patient is at sufficient risk for having active tuberculosis to warrant respiratory isolation. The answer to the question may be spread around the clinical repository in chest radiographs, laboratory tests, medication histories, vital signs, and physician's notes. Translating from these raw data to the interpretation (at risk or not) is a difficult and laborious task. The hypothesis of this proposal is that data mining techniques can be applied to a real-time clinical repository to discover knowledge and generate accurate clinical interpretations, and that these interpretations can be automated. The project differs from earlier machine learning studies in its emphasis on a real clinical repository and the use of natural language processing to supply coded clinical data. The specific aims are: (l) Select clinical domains--Several clinical domains with interesting, non-trivial clinical problems will be selected. Problems for which a gold standard answer can or has been assembled for a retrospective cohort will be chosen. (2) Prepare raw clinical data for mining--The raw data from a clinical repository will be transformed into a structure that facilitates data mining. The data will be flattened, pivoted, summarized, and mapped as needed for the domains. Narrative data will be coded using the MedLEE natural language processor. The preparation process will be automated. (3) Use data mining algorithms to discover knowledge- Several data mining algorithms will be applied to the selected clinical domains. Algorithms will include decision tree generation, rule discovery, neural networks, nearest neighbor, logistic regression, and composite algorithms (for variable reduction). The algorithms will be trained on a training set for each domain, and their predictive accuracy will be measured and compared to each other and to expert-written rules. The performance of human experts writing rules using manual data mining visualization techniques (which does not require an explicit training set) will also be measured. (4) Study the dependence of data mining on the training set--The performance of data mining algorithms depends on the data used the train them. The sensitivity of the algorithms to noise (inaccurate data), missing data, and training set size will be measured. (5) Use the discovered knowledge to generate real-time interpretations-- The output of the algorithms (decision tree, rules, neural network equation, or logistic regression equation, but not nearest neighbor) along with the necessary data preparation steps will be encoded in Arden Syntax Medical Logic Modules. They will be run against the clinical repository to verify that the interpretation can be automated in real time. (6) Disseminate the methods and results--The methods and results will be disseminated via publications and a Web site, and tools will be made available.  n/a",DISCOVERING AND APPLYING KNOWLEDGE IN CLINICAL DATABASES,6538211,R01LM006910,"['Internet', ' artificial intelligence', ' clinical research', ' computer assisted medical decision making', ' computer assisted patient care', ' computer program /software', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' data collection methodology /evaluation', ' health care facility information system', ' human data', ' information dissemination', ' information system analysis', ' vocabulary development for information system']",NLM,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2002,403006,6.200040570531547e-05
"UMLS ENHANCED DYNAMIC AGENTS TO MANAGE MEDICAL KNOWLEDGE   DESCRIPTION (adapted from the Abstract):                                             With the explosion of medical information accessible via the Internet, there         is a growing need for development of better access to the online medical             literature databases through user-friendly systems and interface.  The               proliferation of online information and the diversity of interfaces to data          collections has led to a medical information gap between medical researchers         and the accessibility of medical literature databases.  Users who need access        to such information must visit a variety of sources, which can be both               excessively time consuming and potentially dangerous if the information is           needed for treatment decisions.  In addition, information generated by using         existing search engines is often too general or inaccurate.  Particularly            frustrating is that simple queries can result in an excessive number of              documents retrieved - too many to search through to determine which are and          which are not relevant.

"INFORMATICS TOOLS & MEDICAL PERINATAL KNOWLEDGE BUILDING DESCRIPTION (Taken from application abstract):  This proposed study will         replicate and extend methodology used in earlier studies and will use            extensive clinical data repositories, informatics tools, and expert              practitioners for perinatal medical knowledge building.                                                                                                           Clinical Data Repository:  Duke University's Medical Center (DUMC) TMR (The      Medical Record) data repository will be used for this study, and contains        45,922 electronic medical records for both low and high-risk pregnant women      (and their infants) who have received prenatal care at DUMC, and its             affiliated regional clinics, between 1/1/86 and 12/3l/95.  Each patient's        electronic data is used for clinical patient care and contains a potential       4000 variables per record.  This volume of data requires new approaches for      data analysis and medical decision support, since human information              processing limitations become quickly overloaded by both an individual           patient s data and the aggregate information collected for the perinatal         patient population.                                                                                                                                               lnformatics Tools:  Informatics techniques for knowledge acquisition and         data mining will use machine learning programs, statistical analysis, and        domain expert input to articulate relationships between the data and             perinatal patent outcomes.  The goal is to provide decision support for          perinatal care providers to accurately identify patients at risk and assist      them with modifiable preterm birth ask factors.  An expert system will use       data-generated and verified knowledge bases to test its predictive validity      when new patient cases are induced to the expert system.  Earlier studies        found 53-90% predictive accuracies for an expert system prototype, as            compared to 17-38% accuracies, reported in the literature, using current         manual techniques.  Mapping the expert system's knowledge base terms to          medical library resources will be explored for additional decision support.

"Intelligent Information Systems for Systems Biology DESCRIPTION (Provided by Applicant): Our Center will attack the challenges created by the large quantity of data generated from new high throughput technologies. We have teamed biologists, computer scientists and computational scientists from several Universities to build an experienced and distinguished team. Our first major tool building project will be an Object Oriented Framework for the integration of data and tools for genomics, proteomics, DNA arrays and protein-protein interactions. This tool will follow the data from the source through model building. It will build on existing open source tools such as a data acquisition package from particle physics (ROOT), a public database system (MYSQL or PostgreSQL), statistics tools (""R""), graphics libraries, a variety of software tools that have been developed at ISB and new tools needed for the new technologies. We stress the use of an open source system as a means to build the community, creating a functioning system that can be tailored for research and education. We then propose to augment this system with tools for analysis, visualization and model building. We will use yeast as a model system owing to the wide range of data that it available for it.

"Preserving Privacy in Medical Data Sets Privacy is a fundamental right and needs to be protected.  For health care related d information, there are regulations for disclosure.  These regulations were motivated by the public's concern of breaches of confidentiality that might result in discrimination.  The recent progress in electronic medical record technology, the Internet, and the genetic revolution, together with media reports on violations of privacy have generated increasing interest in this topic.  A common belief is that sensitive information is more easily available with the use of networked computers. Since total lack of disclosure is not realistic, current regulations require that the ""minimal amount"" of information be given to a certain party.  A thorough study on what constitutes ""minimal"" for particular types of applications and a ""usefulness index"" is lacking.  An exact quantification of the potential for privacy breach in de-identified or anonymized databases is also lacking.  Definition and quantification of these indices is important for decision-making.  As we demonstrate, de-identified data sets can still be used for inference and therefore may disclose sensitive information.  The use of machine learning methods to verify the remaining functional dependencies in a de- identified data set leads to better understanding of the possible inferences.  Anonymization techniques based on logic, statistics, database theory, and machine learning methods can help in the protection of privacy. We will formally define and study anonymity in databases, from a theoretical and a practical standpoint.  We will develop and implement algorithms to anonymize data sets that will be in accordance with the balance of anonymity and ""usefulness"" of the disclosed data sets.  We will also develop and implement algorithms to verify the anonymity of a given data set and indicate the type of records that are at highest risk for a privacy attack.

"Using Narrative Data to Enrich the Online Medical Record  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Narrative information is vital to health care, because it enables physicians to synthesize the raw facts and provide a context and interpretation for them.  Electronic medical record systems contain a wealth of clinical data, but typically lack the clinical narrative found in paper records, e.g., the patient history and progress notes.  Numerous barriers prevent the timely acquisition of narrative data, and most computer systems are unable to use such information productively.  Current approaches offer a tradeoff, capture of rich clinical data that lacks structure (using transcription services or speech technology), versus entry of structured data that lacks flexibility and expressiveness (using template systems).  Natural language processing can integrate these approaches by allowing physicians full freedom of expression while producing structured documents that preserve the richness and enable further computer processing.   This proposal seeks to capture and structure narrative in the online medical record in order to improve entry time, completeness, information content and consistency of clinical documentation.  The specific aims of this proposal are:  1) Maintain the continuity of the medical record; a lengthy medical record requires significant time to review and digest.  Many facts from past narratives remain true in the present or persist with minor changes.  By automatically bringing these facts forward into the current narrative, the system can reduce the time to enter the document, and improve the completeness of documentation by maintaining continuity of what is known about a patient; 2) Integrate the medical record:  Electronic medical records contain a vast amount of data.  However, most of these data are raw facts.  By helping the physician to connect, interpret and summarize these facts, the system can improve the usefulness of the information in the record, and reduce the time to enter documents by performing some syntheses automatically; and 3) Harmonize the medical record; the multidisciplinary nature of health care creates the potential for the differing perspectives and interpretations in the medical record, and even contradictions.  By bringing possible discrepancies to the attention of the physician, the system can help resolve the inconsistencies.     n/a",Using Narrative Data to Enrich the Online Medical Record,6535939,R01LM007268,"['automated medical record system', ' clinical research', ' computer data analysis', ' data collection methodology /evaluation', ' human data', ' information systems', ' medical records', ' online computer', ' primary care physician', ' vocabulary']",NLM,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2002,395391,-0.011674168665679946
"Dynamic Language Modeling for Transcription Systems The high cost of data entry is a critical issue that has challenged the evolution of computerized patient record systems. Development of dynamic language models is proposed for significantly improving the cost performance of medical transcription systems. The innovative use of speech recognition, computer telephony integration, and the Internet is proposed for the management and transcription of physician dictation. Results of Phase I research demonstrate significant cost savings to healthcare organizations. Our goal in Phase II is to apply multiple dynamic language models to both improve accuracy and the robustness of the system. We propose to create a physician specific mapping of historical transcriptions to their spoken counterparts. We then propose to explore different methodologies for building language models for specific physician work-type combinations using a database of processed historical transcriptions based on dictations from over 1,500 physicians. In addition, the output of the recognition system will be processed by a natural language processing engine to transform it into a formatted, styled draft transcription for review and editing by a transcriptionist. Our unique approach integrates seamlessly into a physician's workflow and does not require the alteration of physician work patterns. We expect this research and development will result in a commercially viable transcription system that significantly reduces costs associated with medical transcription. eScription has obtained three paying pilot customers with whom we are working closely with to develop this system. These customers have/will provide eScription with textual data, audio data, and medical transcriptionists who will test the final system. All have expressed a keen interest in becoming corporate partners for Phase III. Two are currently using our prototype system in their production environments today. We are submitting this grant request to partially cover the cost of constructing and testing the system. PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS: eScription focuses on alleviating significant healthcare cost pressures associated with transcription of medical dictation. We apply new technologies such as speech recognition, computer telephony and Internet communications, which are not commonly used for medical transcription. We will directly sell our software products and services to Integrated Delivery Networks (IDNs) and to Transcription Services Companies.  n/a",Dynamic Language Modeling for Transcription Systems,6528412,R44LM006930,"['computer assisted patient care', ' computer program /software', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' language', ' medical records', ' speech recognition', ' telemedicine', ' vocabulary development for information system']",NLM,"ESCRIPTION, INC.",R44,2002,325555,-0.028611764531876367
"UNLOCKING DATA FROM MEDICAL RECORDS WITH TEXT PROCESSING   DESCRIPTION (adapted from the Abstract):                                              The long-term aim of this project is to use natural language processing (NLP)        to help realize the full potential of the Electronic Medical Record (EMR).           Our research involves advanced NLP techniques to: 1) extract and encode              information in textual reports; 2) map terms to an authoritative vocabulary;         3) obtain comprehensive domain coverage based on the processing of domain            corpora; and 4) facilitate vocabulary development by providing visualization         tools using the Extensible Markup Language (XML).  It has already been               demonstrated that MedLEE, the NLP system we developed, accurately extracts and       codifies information in the EMR.  This current project builds upon our               experience with MedLEE and uses it to accomplish the latter three goals              concerning vocabulary development and standardization.                                                                                                                    More specifically, MedLEE will be used to map source terms to UMLS concepts.         MedLEE will process and structure the source terms and candidate UMLS                concepts.  Suitable matches will be found based on structural similarity             between components of the source term and candidate concepts.  This should           enhance current methods because knowledge of the type of modifiers that match        should improve the quality of the matches.  We will also use MedLEE to process       a large corpus and generate structured output in XML format.  Statistics based       on the structured output will be computed, and then clinically relevant              composite terms will be detected based on frequencies of the structures              containing the more elementary terms.  Our method differs from other discovery       methods because we use NLP techniques that identify semantic modifiers and           complex relations even if the terms are distant from each other, whereas other       methods use statistical co-occurrence data based on adjacency.  The individual       XML structures and statistics will be combined and mapped into a single XML          tree.  It will be possible to visualize the tree and frequencies using an XML        tree viewer, to navigate the tree, to manipulate the tree, and to reorganize         the tree according to different axes (i.e., procedure, body location,                finding).                                                                                                                                                                 The use of a sophisticated NLP system, such as MedLEE, is ideal as a                 foundation for our proposed work in vocabulary development and                       standardization; medical terminology is an integral part of medical language         and a state of the art NLP system is especially equipped to handle the               inherent complexities of language. n/a",UNLOCKING DATA FROM MEDICAL RECORDS WITH TEXT PROCESSING,6490773,R01LM006274,"['abstracting', ' automated medical record system', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' human data', ' information retrieval', ' method development', ' vocabulary development for information system']",NLM,QUEENS COLLEGE,R01,2002,288252,0.006606492222083382

"PACS INFRASTRUCTURE TO SUPPORT-BASED MEDICAL PRACTICE The broad, tong-term objective of this Program Project Grant is to develop an effective imaging-based information and health care delivery system to support clinical practice, research, and education. The specific aims of the grant are to: (1) evolve PACS into an effective infrastructure that promotes the objectification of subjective patient clinical symptoms, (2) develop methods for improving the characterization of medical data through structured data collection, natural language processing of medical reports (NLP) and parametric summarization for medical images, (3) provide flexible, patient -specific presentation methods of medical images, timelines, and structured medical data. The objectification, intelligent access, and flexible presentation of medical data provide better information, which will facilitate the evidence-based practice of medicine and enhance research and evaluation. Five integrated projects employ novel techniques to address specific elements of the system. Intelligently selected imaging protocols are used to objectify patient symptoms. Well-defined information units capture and structure diverse forms of data, whether directly or indirectly through NP for text of parametric summarization for images. Patient medical records are correlated with medical literature by content. Timelines organize the data into a format that allow medical events, their dependencies, and conditional trends to be easily visualized (Project 3). Scenario-based proxies provide up-to-date access to relevant medical information. Relaxation broadens queries to medical information when exact matches are not found. Software toolkits and user models enable user-, and domain-, and task-specific customizations. The hardware independent architecture will facilitate access to the system across different platforms and software subsystems. Together, they form a unique infrastructure that provides broad and intelligently customized access to well-defined structured data and up-to-date literature. This, in addition to patient-specific relevant data, expert opinion, and similar cases with known outcome, will promote the evidence-based practice of medicine.

Although a formal cost-effectiveness study is not proposed, the foundation is laid for these measurements when these PACs technologies mature. These measurements will be facilitated by recording resource utilization, determining of imaging-based episodes of care, and counter- specific information related to a chief complaint.  n/a",PACS INFRASTRUCTURE TO SUPPORT-BASED MEDICAL PRACTICE,6512665,P01EB000216,"['automated medical record system', ' health care facility information system', ' radiology', ' telemedicine']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,P01,2002,2120168,0.004469752969579626
"DISCOVERING AND APPLYING KNOWLEDGE IN CLINICAL DATABASES A real-time clinical repository contains a wealth of detailed information useful for clinical care, research, and administration.  In their raw form, however, the data are difficult to use there is too much volume, too much detail, missing values, and inaccuracies. Clinicians, researchers, and administrators require higher level interpretations that address their questions. For example, a clinician may need to know whether a patient is at sufficient risk for having active tuberculosis to warrant respiratory isolation. The answer to the question may be spread around the clinical repository in chest radiographs, laboratory tests, medication histories, vital signs, and physician's notes. Translating from these raw data to the interpretation (at risk or not) is a difficult and laborious task. The hypothesis of this proposal is that data mining techniques can be applied to a real-time clinical repository to discover knowledge and generate accurate clinical interpretations, and that these interpretations can be automated. The project differs from earlier machine learning studies in its emphasis on a real clinical repository and the use of natural language processing to supply coded clinical data. The specific aims are: (l) Select clinical domains--Several clinical domains with interesting, non-trivial clinical problems will be selected. Problems for which a gold standard answer can or has been assembled for a retrospective cohort will be chosen. (2) Prepare raw clinical data for mining--The raw data from a clinical repository will be transformed into a structure that facilitates data mining. The data will be flattened, pivoted, summarized, and mapped as needed for the domains. Narrative data will be coded using the MedLEE natural language processor. The preparation process will be automated. (3) Use data mining algorithms to discover knowledge- Several data mining algorithms will be applied to the selected clinical domains. Algorithms will include decision tree generation, rule discovery, neural networks, nearest neighbor, logistic regression, and composite algorithms (for variable reduction). The algorithms will be trained on a training set for each domain, and their predictive accuracy will be measured and compared to each other and to expert-written rules. The performance of human experts writing rules using manual data mining visualization techniques (which does not require an explicit training set) will also be measured. (4) Study the dependence of data mining on the training set--The performance of data mining algorithms depends on the data used the train them. The sensitivity of the algorithms to noise (inaccurate data), missing data, and training set size will be measured. (5) Use the discovered knowledge to generate real-time interpretations-- The output of the algorithms (decision tree, rules, neural network equation, or logistic regression equation, but not nearest neighbor) along with the necessary data preparation steps will be encoded in Arden Syntax Medical Logic Modules. They will be run against the clinical repository to verify that the interpretation can be automated in real time. (6) Disseminate the methods and results--The methods and results will be disseminated via publications and a Web site, and tools will be made available.  n/a",DISCOVERING AND APPLYING KNOWLEDGE IN CLINICAL DATABASES,6391286,R01LM006910,"['Internet', ' artificial intelligence', ' clinical research', ' computer assisted medical decision making', ' computer assisted patient care', ' computer program /software', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' data collection methodology /evaluation', ' health care facility information system', ' human data', ' information dissemination', ' information system analysis', ' vocabulary development for information system']",NLM,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2001,396315,6.200040570531547e-05
"UMLS ENHANCED DYNAMIC AGENTS TO MANAGE MEDICAL KNOWLEDGE   DESCRIPTION (adapted from the Abstract):                                             With the explosion of medical information accessible via the Internet, there         is a growing need for development of better access to the online medical             literature databases through user-friendly systems and interface.  The               proliferation of online information and the diversity of interfaces to data          collections has led to a medical information gap between medical researchers         and the accessibility of medical literature databases.  Users who need access        to such information must visit a variety of sources, which can be both               excessively time consuming and potentially dangerous if the information is           needed for treatment decisions.  In addition, information generated by using         existing search engines is often too general or inaccurate.  Particularly            frustrating is that simple queries can result in an excessive number of              documents retrieved - too many to search through to determine which are and          which are not relevant.                                                                                                                                                   The goal of this research is to extend a bridge across the medical information       gap by creating easy-to-use interfaces to medical literature databases based         on UMLS-enhanced Semantic Parsing and Personalized Medical Agent (PMA):                                                                                                   (1)  UMLS-enhanced Semantic Parsing: Our first goal will be to combine noun          phrasing and co-occurrence analysis techniques recently developed by The             University of Arizona Artificial Intelligence Lab (AI Lab) for the NSF-funded        Illinois Digital Library Initiative (DLI) project with existing components           found in the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) developed by NLM.

"DATA MINING AND MODEL BUILDING IN MEDICAL INFORMATICS Our long-term goal is to assist biomedical scientists by extracting and          codifying new knowledge from large biomedical databases routinely by             computer. As large collections of data become more readily accessibly,           the opportunities for discovering new information increase. We propose           here to work toward this goal by extending our prior research on machine         learning in two important directions: (1) codification of disparate              pieces of knowledge into a coherent model (model building), and (2)              discovery of new information in medical databases (data mining).                                                                                                  Machine learning programs find classification rules (or decision trees           or networks) that separate members of a target class from other                  individuals. They have emphasized predictive accuracy, with some                 attention to tradeoffs between accuracy and cost of errors or between            accuracy and simplicity. We propose a framework in which these, and              other, tradeoffs are explicit and the criteria by which tradeoffs are            made are available for modification. We also include semantic                    considerations among the criteria to control the internal coherence of           models.                                                                                                                                                           ""Data mining"" is a recently-coined term for using computers to explore           large databases, with a goal of discovering new relationships but                usually with no specific target defined at the outset. In addition to            accuracy, simplicity, coherence, and cost, a program that purports to            discover new relationships must be able to assess novelty. We propose to         measure the extent to which proposed relationships are novel by                  comparing them against existing knowledge in the domain of discourse,            and to look for unusual rules (and other relations) that would be very           interesting if true.                                                                                                                                              The computer program we are primarily building on, RL, is a knowledge-           based learning program that learns classification rules from a                   collection of data. RL has been demonstrated to be flexible enough to            allow guidance from prior knowledge, and powerful enough to learn                publishable information for scientists working in several different              domains. Both parts of the research will requires extending the RL               system in new ways detailed in the research plan, which are consistent           with the overall design philosophy of the present system. We will                primarily work with data already collected on pneumonia patients with            with which we have considerable.

"LATENT SEMANTIC INDEXING IN SUPPORT OF DATA RETRIEVAL We propose to extend the successful work we have achieved with                   statistically based indexing and retrieval systems, by incorporating             semantic structures which accommodate the modifying attributes of clinical       conCepts. Patient data is rarely limited to a single axis of meaning or          detail, and retrieval for application in quality improvement, decision           support, or epidemiologic research, demands Consistent information               struCture. This proposal will invoke the knowledge and tool suites of the        UMLS Specialist Lexicon, the SGML markup and recognition capabilities of         the TextMachine application, extensions to our locally developed CliniCal        Query Language, and layer these enhancements upon our core techniques for        statistically based indexing and retrieval of patient data.

Our first major tool building project will be an Object Oriented Framework for the integration of data and tools for genomics, proteomics, DNA arrays and protein-protein interactions. This tool will follow the data from the source through model building. It will build on existing open source tools such as a data acquisition package from particle physics (ROOT), a public database system (MYSQL or PostgreSQL), statistics tools (""R""), graphics libraries, a variety of software tools that have been developed at ISB and new tools needed for the new technologies. We stress the use of an open source system as a means to build the community, creating a functioning system that can be tailored for research and education. We then propose to augment this system with tools for analysis, visualization and model building. We will use yeast as a model system owing to the wide range of data that it available for it.

"Dynamic Language Modeling for Transcription Systems The high cost of data entry is a critical issue that has challenged the evolution of computerized patient record systems. Development of dynamic language models is proposed for significantly improving the cost performance of medical transcription systems. The innovative use of speech recognition, computer telephony integration, and the Internet is proposed for the management and transcription of physician dictation. Results of Phase I research demonstrate significant cost savings to healthcare organizations. Our goal in Phase II is to apply multiple dynamic language models to both improve accuracy and the robustness of the system. We propose to create a physician specific mapping of historical transcriptions to their spoken counterparts. We then propose to explore different methodologies for building language models for specific physician work-type combinations using a database of processed historical transcriptions based on dictations from over 1,500 physicians. In addition, the output of the recognition system will be processed by a natural language processing engine to transform it into a formatted, styled draft transcription for review and editing by a transcriptionist. Our unique approach integrates seamlessly into a physician's workflow and does not require the alteration of physician work patterns. We expect this research and development will result in a commercially viable transcription system that significantly reduces costs associated with medical transcription. eScription has obtained three paying pilot customers with whom we are working closely with to develop this system. These customers have/will provide eScription with textual data, audio data, and medical transcriptionists who will test the final system. All have expressed a keen interest in becoming corporate partners for Phase III. Two are currently using our prototype system in their production environments today. We are submitting this grant request to partially cover the cost of constructing and testing the system. PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS: eScription focuses on alleviating significant healthcare cost pressures associated with transcription of medical dictation. We apply new technologies such as speech recognition, computer telephony and Internet communications, which are not commonly used for medical transcription.

"UNLOCKING DATA FROM MEDICAL RECORDS WITH TEXT PROCESSING   DESCRIPTION (adapted from the Abstract):                                              The long-term aim of this project is to use natural language processing (NLP)        to help realize the full potential of the Electronic Medical Record (EMR).           Our research involves advanced NLP techniques to: 1) extract and encode              information in textual reports; 2) map terms to an authoritative vocabulary;         3) obtain comprehensive domain coverage based on the processing of domain            corpora; and 4) facilitate vocabulary development by providing visualization         tools using the Extensible Markup Language (XML).  It has already been               demonstrated that MedLEE, the NLP system we developed, accurately extracts and       codifies information in the EMR.  This current project builds upon our               experience with MedLEE and uses it to accomplish the latter three goals              concerning vocabulary development and standardization.                                                                                                                    More specifically, MedLEE will be used to map source terms to UMLS concepts.         MedLEE will process and structure the source terms and candidate UMLS                concepts.  Suitable matches will be found based on structural similarity             between components of the source term and candidate concepts.  This should           enhance current methods because knowledge of the type of modifiers that match        should improve the quality of the matches.  We will also use MedLEE to process       a large corpus and generate structured output in XML format.  Statistics based       on the structured output will be computed, and then clinically relevant              composite terms will be detected based on frequencies of the structures              containing the more elementary terms.  Our method differs from other discovery       methods because we use NLP techniques that identify semantic modifiers and           complex relations even if the terms are distant from each other, whereas other       methods use statistical co-occurrence data based on adjacency.  The individual       XML structures and statistics will be combined and mapped into a single XML          tree.  It will be possible to visualize the tree and frequencies using an XML        tree viewer, to navigate the tree, to manipulate the tree, and to reorganize         the tree according to different axes (i.e., procedure, body location,                finding).                                                                                                                                                                 The use of a sophisticated NLP system, such as MedLEE, is ideal as a                 foundation for our proposed work in vocabulary development and                       standardization; medical terminology is an integral part of medical language         and a state of the art NLP system is especially equipped to handle the               inherent complexities of language. n/a",UNLOCKING DATA FROM MEDICAL RECORDS WITH TEXT PROCESSING,6095940,R01LM006274,"['abstracting', ' automated medical record system', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' human data', ' information retrieval', ' method development', ' vocabulary development for information system']",NLM,QUEENS COLLEGE,R01,2001,303860,0.006606492222083382

"NEW DRUG TARGETS FOR APOPTOSIS DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The aim of this proposal is to establish an Integrated Neuroinformatics Resource on Alcoholism (INRA) as the informatics core component of the Integrative Neuroscience Initiative on Alcoholism Consortium (INIA). The overall goal of the INRA will be to create an integrated, multiresolution repository of neuroscience data, ranging from molecules to behavior for collaborative research on alcoholism. As the neuroinformatics core of the INIAC, the INRA will enable the integration of all data generated by all components of the INIAC. Furthermore, it will support synthesis of new knowledge through computational neurobiology tools for exploratory analysis including visualization, data mining and simulation. The INRA will represent a synthesis of emerging approaches in bioinformatics and existing methods of neuroinformatics to provide the INIAC a versatile toolbox of computational methods for elucidating the effects of alcohol on the nervous system. The specific aims of the INRA will be: (i) implementation of an informatics infrastructure for integrating complex neuroscience data, from molecules to behavior, generated by the consortium and relevant data available in the public domain; (ii) development of an integrated secure web-based environment so that consortium members can interactively visualize, search and update the integrated neuroscience knowledge; and (iii) development of data mining tools, including biomolecular sequence analysis, gene expression array analysis, characterization of Biochemical pathways, and natural language processing to support hypothesis generation and testing regarding ethanol Consumption and neuroadaptation to alcohol.

"PACS INFRASTRUCTURE TO SUPPORT-BASED MEDICAL PRACTICE The broad, tong-term objective of this Program Project Grant is to develop an effective imaging-based information and health care delivery system to support clinical practice, research, and education. The specific aims of the grant are to: (1) evolve PACS into an effective infrastructure that promotes the objectification of subjective patient clinical symptoms, (2) develop methods for improving the characterization of medical data through structured data collection, natural language processing of medical reports (NLP) and parametric summarization for medical images, (3) provide flexible, patient -specific presentation methods of medical images, timelines, and structured medical data. The objectification, intelligent access, and flexible presentation of medical data provide better information, which will facilitate the evidence-based practice of medicine and enhance research and evaluation. Five integrated projects employ novel techniques to address specific elements of the system. Intelligently selected imaging protocols are used to objectify patient symptoms. Well-defined information units capture and structure diverse forms of data, whether directly or indirectly through NP for text of parametric summarization for images. Patient medical records are correlated with medical literature by content. Timelines organize the data into a format that allow medical events, their dependencies, and conditional trends to be easily visualized (Project 3). Scenario-based proxies provide up-to-date access to relevant medical information. Relaxation broadens queries to medical information when exact matches are not found. Software toolkits and user models enable user-, and domain-, and task-specific customizations. The hardware independent architecture will facilitate access to the system across different platforms and software subsystems. Together, they form a unique infrastructure that provides broad and intelligently customized access to well-defined structured data and up-to-date literature. This, in addition to patient-specific relevant data, expert opinion, and similar cases with known outcome, will promote the evidence-based practice of medicine.

The evaluation will also explore the relationship between process changes and specific outcomes, particularly short-term health related quality of life. Although a formal cost-effectiveness study is not proposed, the foundation is laid for these measurements when these PACs technologies mature. These measurements will be facilitated by recording resource utilization, determining of imaging-based episodes of care, and counter- specific information related to a chief complaint.  n/a",PACS INFRASTRUCTURE TO SUPPORT-BASED MEDICAL PRACTICE,6375859,P01CA051198,"['automated medical record system', ' health care facility information system', ' radiology', ' telemedicine']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,P01,2001,2071652,0.004469752969579626
"DISCOVERING AND APPLYING KNOWLEDGE IN CLINICAL DATABASES A real-time clinical repository contains a wealth of detailed information useful for clinical care, research, and administration.  In their raw form, however, the data are difficult to use there is too much volume, too much detail, missing values, and inaccuracies. Clinicians, researchers, and administrators require higher level interpretations that address their questions. For example, a clinician may need to know whether a patient is at sufficient risk for having active tuberculosis to warrant respiratory isolation. The answer to the question may be spread around the clinical repository in chest radiographs, laboratory tests, medication histories, vital signs, and physician's notes. Translating from these raw data to the interpretation (at risk or not) is a difficult and laborious task. The hypothesis of this proposal is that data mining techniques can be applied to a real-time clinical repository to discover knowledge and generate accurate clinical interpretations, and that these interpretations can be automated. The project differs from earlier machine learning studies in its emphasis on a real clinical repository and the use of natural language processing to supply coded clinical data. The specific aims are: (l) Select clinical domains--Several clinical domains with interesting, non-trivial clinical problems will be selected. Problems for which a gold standard answer can or has been assembled for a retrospective cohort will be chosen. (2) Prepare raw clinical data for mining--The raw data from a clinical repository will be transformed into a structure that facilitates data mining. The data will be flattened, pivoted, summarized, and mapped as needed for the domains. Narrative data will be coded using the MedLEE natural language processor. The preparation process will be automated. (3) Use data mining algorithms to discover knowledge- Several data mining algorithms will be applied to the selected clinical domains. Algorithms will include decision tree generation, rule discovery, neural networks, nearest neighbor, logistic regression, and composite algorithms (for variable reduction). The algorithms will be trained on a training set for each domain, and their predictive accuracy will be measured and compared to each other and to expert-written rules. The performance of human experts writing rules using manual data mining visualization techniques (which does not require an explicit training set) will also be measured. (4) Study the dependence of data mining on the training set--The performance of data mining algorithms depends on the data used the train them. The sensitivity of the algorithms to noise (inaccurate data), missing data, and training set size will be measured. (5) Use the discovered knowledge to generate real-time interpretations-- The output of the algorithms (decision tree, rules, neural network equation, or logistic regression equation, but not nearest neighbor) along with the necessary data preparation steps will be encoded in Arden Syntax Medical Logic Modules. They will be run against the clinical repository to verify that the interpretation can be automated in real time. (6) Disseminate the methods and results--The methods and results will be disseminated via publications and a Web site, and tools will be made available.  n/a",DISCOVERING AND APPLYING KNOWLEDGE IN CLINICAL DATABASES,6031325,R01LM006910,"['Internet', ' artificial intelligence', ' clinical research', ' computer assisted medical decision making', ' computer assisted patient care', ' computer program /software', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' data collection methodology /evaluation', ' health care facility information system', ' human data', ' information dissemination', ' information system analysis', ' vocabulary development for information system']",NLM,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2000,433383,6.200040570531547e-05
"DATA MINING AND MODEL BUILDING IN MEDICAL INFORMATICS Our long-term goal is to assist biomedical scientists by extracting and          codifying new knowledge from large biomedical databases routinely by             computer. As large collections of data become more readily accessibly,           the opportunities for discovering new information increase. We propose           here to work toward this goal by extending our prior research on machine         learning in two important directions: (1) codification of disparate              pieces of knowledge into a coherent model (model building), and (2)              discovery of new information in medical databases (data mining).                                                                                                  Machine learning programs find classification rules (or decision trees           or networks) that separate members of a target class from other                  individuals. They have emphasized predictive accuracy, with some                 attention to tradeoffs between accuracy and cost of errors or between            accuracy and simplicity. We propose a framework in which these, and              other, tradeoffs are explicit and the criteria by which tradeoffs are            made are available for modification. We also include semantic                    considerations among the criteria to control the internal coherence of           models.                                                                                                                                                           ""Data mining"" is a recently-coined term for using computers to explore           large databases, with a goal of discovering new relationships but                usually with no specific target defined at the outset. In addition to            accuracy, simplicity, coherence, and cost, a program that purports to            discover new relationships must be able to assess novelty. We propose to         measure the extent to which proposed relationships are novel by                  comparing them against existing knowledge in the domain of discourse,            and to look for unusual rules (and other relations) that would be very           interesting if true.                                                                                                                                              The computer program we are primarily building on, RL, is a knowledge-           based learning program that learns classification rules from a                   collection of data. RL has been demonstrated to be flexible enough to            allow guidance from prior knowledge, and powerful enough to learn                publishable information for scientists working in several different              domains. Both parts of the research will requires extending the RL               system in new ways detailed in the research plan, which are consistent           with the overall design philosophy of the present system. We will                primarily work with data already collected on pneumonia patients with            with which we have considerable.

"IMIA WG6 CONFERENCE The basic science of representing patient events, findings, interventions, and outcomes in a semantically consistent and logically reproducible way is medical concept representation.  It embodies principles of linguistics, logic, computer science, cognition, biology and clinical medicine to undertake this highly multidisciplinary activity. Much of this work is undertaken in experimental settings, which hypothesize practical extensions to existing models, and test their utility against standardized retrieval sets or clinical usability environments. The proposed conference intends to continue the tradition of the International Medical Informatics Association (IMIA), Working Group 6 on Medical Concept Representation, to provide a forum for the academic discussion of problems, issues, theories, and applications of natural language processing, knowledge representation, terminology development, and concept coordination to biomedicine and healthcare.  the proposed tracks at this time are: 1.

"COMMUNITY DEPOSIT AND REVIEW OF BIOCHEMICAL DATABASES DESCRIPTION:  Computing with biochemical reactions is increasingly important     in studying genomes, assessing toxicity, and developing therapeutics.

"KNOWLEDGE BASED TEMPORAL ABSTRACTION OF CLINICAL DATA Abstractions of time-stamped clinical data are useful for planning               therapy, for monitoring therapy, and for creating high-level summaries of        time-oriented clinical databases.  Temporal abstractions also support            explanations by an intelligent patient-record system and can be used for         representation of the goals and intentions of clinical guidelines and            protocols.

RESUME has been evaluated with highly        encouraging results in several clinical areas. We will address the               practical and theoretical issues of representation, acquisition,                 maintenance, and reuse of temporal-abstraction knowledge. Our specific           aims are defined by a four-step research plan:                                                                                                                    1. We will define formally the knowledge requirements for five                   computational modules (mechanisms) we employ, thus facilitating the              acquisition, maintenance, reuse, and sharing of the required knowledge.                                                                                           2.

(d) Interpolation between temporally disjoint clinical abstractions,             including a development of a probabilistic representation and semantics.         (e) Matching of predefined and runtime temporal patterns, given time-            stamped data and conclusions.                                                                                                                                     3.

"LATENT SEMANTIC INDEXING IN SUPPORT OF DATA RETRIEVAL We propose to extend the successful work we have achieved with                   statistically based indexing and retrieval systems, by incorporating             semantic structures which accommodate the modifying attributes of clinical       conCepts.

"PACS INFRASTRUCTURE TO SUPPORT-BASED MEDICAL PRACTICE The broad, tong-term objective of this Program Project Grant is to develop an effective imaging-based information and health care delivery system to support clinical practice, research, and education. The specific aims of the grant are to: (1) evolve PACS into an effective infrastructure that promotes the objectification of subjective patient clinical symptoms, (2) develop methods for improving the characterization of medical data through structured data collection, natural language processing of medical reports (NLP) and parametric summarization for medical images, (3) provide flexible, patient -specific presentation methods of medical images, timelines, and structured medical data. The objectification, intelligent access, and flexible presentation of medical data provide better information, which will facilitate the evidence-based practice of medicine and enhance research and evaluation. Five integrated projects employ novel techniques to address specific elements of the system. Intelligently selected imaging protocols are used to objectify patient symptoms. Well-defined information units capture and structure diverse forms of data, whether directly or indirectly through NP for text of parametric summarization for images. Patient medical records are correlated with medical literature by content. Timelines organize the data into a format that allow medical events, their dependencies, and conditional trends to be easily visualized (Project 3). Scenario-based proxies provide up-to-date access to relevant medical information. Relaxation broadens queries to medical information when exact matches are not found. Software toolkits and user models enable user-, and domain-, and task-specific customizations. The hardware independent architecture will facilitate access to the system across different platforms and software subsystems. Together, they form a unique infrastructure that provides broad and intelligently customized access to well-defined structured data and up-to-date literature. This, in addition to patient-specific relevant data, expert opinion, and similar cases with known outcome, will promote the evidence-based practice of medicine.

"A framework to enhance radiology structured report by invoking NLP and DL:  Models and Applications PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  In radiology practices, timely and accurate formulation of reports is closely linked to patient satisfaction, physician productivity, and reimbursement. While the American College of Radiology and the Radiological Soci- ety of North America have recommended implementation of structured reporting to facilitate clear and consistent communication between radiologists and referring clinicians, cumbersome nature of current structured reporting systems made them unpopular amongst their users. Recently, the emerging techniques of deep learning have been widely and successfully applied in many different natural language processing tasks (NLP). However, when adopted in a certain speciﬁc domain, such as radiology, these techniques should be combined with extensive domain knowledge to improve efﬁciency and accuracy. There is, therefore, a critical need to take advantage of clinical NLP and deep learning to fundamentally change the radiology reporting. The long-term goal in this appli- cation is to improve the form, content, and quality of radiology reports and to facilitate rapid generation of radiol- ogy reports with consistent organization and standardized texts. The overall objective is to use radiology-speciﬁc ontology, NLP and computer vision techniques, and deep learning to construct a radiology-speciﬁc knowledge graph, which will then be used to build a reporting system that can assist radiologists to quickly generate struc- tured and standardized text reports. The rationale for this project is that through integration of new clinical NLP technologies, radiology-speciﬁc knowledge graphs, and development of new reporting system, we can build au- tomatous systems with a higher-level understanding of the radiological world. The speciﬁc aims of this project are to: (1) recognize and normalize named entities in radiology reports; (2) construct a radiology-speciﬁc knowledge graph from free-text and images; and (3) build a reporting system that can dynamically adjust templates based on radiologists' prior entries. The research proposed in this application is innovative, in the applicant's opinion, because it combines deep learning, NLP techniques, and domain knowledge in a single framework to construct comprehensive and accurate knowledge graphs that will enhance the workﬂow of the current reporting systems. The proposed research is signiﬁcant because a novel reporting system can expedite radiologists' workﬂow and acquire well-annotated datasets that facilitate machine learning and data science. To develop such a method, the candidate, Dr. Yifan Peng, requires additional training and mentoring in clinical NLP and radiology. During the K99 phase, Dr. Peng will conduct this research as a research fellow at the National Center for Biotechnology Information. He will be mentored by Dr. Zhiyong Lu, a leading text mining and deep learning researcher, and co- mentored by Dr. Ronald M. Summers, a leading radiologist and clinical informatics researcher. This application for the NIH Pathway to Independence Award (K99/R00) describes a career development plan that will allow Dr. Peng to achieve the career goals of becoming an independent investigator and leader in the study of clinical NLP. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research is relevant to public health because it entails a new strategy to construct a radiology- speciﬁc knowledge graph to facilitate the development of a new reporting system that enables rapid generation of structured radiology reports. The proposed knowledge graph and reporting system will contribute to advancement in understanding of the radiological world, and promise to enhance clinical communication and patient-centric care. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to the part of the NLM's mission that pertains to applying deep knowledge of clinical terminology and natural language processing to improve clinical data science and health services.",A framework to enhance radiology structured report by invoking NLP and DL:  Models and Applications,10197509,R00LM013001,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'American College of Radiology', 'Award', 'Biotechnology', 'Caring', 'Client satisfaction', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Formulation', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Health Services', 'Hospitals', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Names', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Nomenclature', 'North America', 'Ontology', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Picture Archiving and Communication System', 'Process', 'Productivity', 'Public Health', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resort', 'Societies', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'System', 'Systems Development', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Terminology', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Voice', 'Writing', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'convolutional neural network', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'impression', 'improved', 'innovation', 'knowledge graph', 'lexical', 'long short term memory', 'neural network', 'neural network architecture', 'novel', 'radiologist', 'repository', 'response', 'syntax', 'text searching']",NLM,WEILL MEDICAL COLL OF CORNELL UNIV,R00,2020,236549,-0.0021543479530640704
"Temporal relation discovery for clinical text Project Summary / Abstract The current proposal continues the investigation on the topic of temporal relation extraction from the Electronic Medical Records (EMR) clinical narrative funded by the NLM since 2010 (Temporal Histories of Your Medical Events, or THYME; thyme.healthnlp.org). Through our efforts so far, we have defined the topic as an active area of research attracting attention across the world. Since its inception, the project has pushed the boundaries of this highly challenging task by investigating new computational methods within the context of the latest developments in the fields of natural language processing (NLP), machine learning (ML), artificial intelligence (AI) and biomedical informatics (BMI) resulting in 60+ publications/presentations. We have made our best performing methods available to the community open source as part of the Apache Clinical Text Analysis and Knowledge Extraction System (cTAKES; ctakes.apache.org). In 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018, we organized an international shared task (Clinical TempEval) on the topic under the umbrella of the highly prestigious SemEval, thus inviting the international community to work with our THYME data and improve on our results. Clinical TempEval has been highly successful with many participants each year, resulting in new discoveries and many publications. We have made all our data along with our gold standard annotations available to the community through the hNLP Center (center.healthnlp.org).  The underlying theme of this renewal is novel methods for combining explicit domain knowledge (linguistic, semantic, biomedical ontological, clinical), readily available unlabeled data (health-related social media, EMRs), and modern machine learning techniques (e.g. neural networks) for temporal relation extraction from the EMR clinical narrative. Therefore, our renewal proposes a novel and much needed exploration of this line of research:  Specific Aim 1: Develop computational models for novel rich semantic representations such as the Abstract Meaning Representations to encapsulate a single, coherent, full-document graphical representation of meaning for temporal relation extraction  Specific Aim 2: Develop computational methods to infuse domain knowledge (linguistic, semantic, biomedical ontological, clinical) into modern machine learning techniques such as NNs for temporal relation extraction – through input representations, pre-trained vectors, or architectures  Specific Aim 3: Develop novel methods for combining labeled and unlabeled data from various sources (EMR, health-related social media, newswire) for temporal relation extraction from the clinical narrative  Specific Aim 4: Apply the best performing methods for temporal relation extraction developed in SA1-3 to temporally sensitive phenotypes for direct translational sciences studies. Dissemination efforts through publications and open source releases into Apache cTAKES. Project Narrative Temporal relations are of prime importance in biomedicine as they are intrinsically linked to diseases, signs and symptoms, and treatments. Understanding the timeline of clinically relevant events is key to the next generation of translational research where the importance of generalizing over large amounts of data holds the promise of deciphering biomedical puzzles. The goal of our current proposal is to automatically discover temporal relations from clinical free text and structured EMR data and create an aggregated patient-level timeline.",Temporal relation discovery for clinical text,9949779,R01LM010090,"['Address', 'Apache', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Attention', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Encapsulated', 'Engineering', 'Event', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Image', 'International', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Knowledge Extraction', 'Label', 'Linguistics', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modernization', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Participant', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Publications', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Semantics', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Solid', 'Source', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Text', 'Thyme', 'Time', 'TimeLine', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Vision', 'Work', 'advanced disease', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'biomedical ontology', 'clinically relevant', 'cohesion', 'electronic data', 'electronic structure', 'epidemiology study', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'learning community', 'neural network', 'next generation', 'novel', 'open source', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'social media', 'support vector machine', 'symptom treatment', 'vector']",NLM,BOSTON CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2020,545793,-0.02375499766869215
"CLAMP-CS: a Cloud-based, Service-oriented, high-performance Natural Language Processing Platform for Healthcare Project Summary Wide adoption of electronic health records (EHRs) has led to huge clinical databases, which enable the rapid growth of healthcare analytics market. One particular challenge for analyzing EHRs data is that much detailed patient information is embedded in clinical documents and not directly available for downstream analysis. Therefore, clinical natural language processing (NLP) technologies, which can unlock information embedded in clinical narratives, have received great attention, with an estimated global market of $2.65 billion by 2021 . In our previous work, we have developed CLAMP (Clinical Language Annotation, Modeling, and Processing), a clinical NLP tool with demonstrated superior performance through multiple international NLP challenges and a large user community (over 1,500 downloads by users from over 700 organizations). Commercialization of CLAMP by Melax Technologies Inc. has been successful (i.e., with a dozen licensed customers now); but it also reveals its limitations as a desktop application in the Cloud era. Therefore, we propose to extend CLAMP to a new Cloud- based, Service-oriented platform (called CLAMP-CS), which will address the identified challenges by: 1) improving clinical NLP performance and reducing annotation cost by leveraging the state-of-the-art algorithms such as deep learning, active learning and transfer learning and making them accessible to less experienced users; 2) following new service-oriented architectures to make CLAMP-CS available via SaaS and PaaS, ready for Cloud-based development and deployment; and 3) improving CLAMP-CS interoperability with downstream applications following two widely used standard representations: HL7 FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) and OMOP CMD (Common Data Model), to support the use cases in clinical operations and research respectively. With these advanced features, we believe CLAMP-CS will be a leading clinical NLP system in the market and it will accelerate the adoption of NLP technology for diverse healthcare applications and clinical/translational research. Project Narrative In this study, we plan to develop a new clinical natural language processing (NLP) tool based on the existing widely used CLAMP (Clinical Language Annotation, Modeling, and Processing) system, to support enterprise development and deployment of NLP solutions in healthcare. We believe that the new generation of Cloud- based, service-oriented NLP tool will accelerate the adoption of NLP technology for diverse healthcare applications and clinical and translational research.","CLAMP-CS: a Cloud-based, Service-oriented, high-performance Natural Language Processing Platform for Healthcare",10011177,R44TR003254,"['Active Learning', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Attention', 'Belief', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Closure by clamp', 'Cloud Computing', 'Communities', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources', 'Generations', 'Grant', 'Growth', 'Health Sciences', 'Healthcare', 'Hospital Administration', 'International', 'Language', 'Licensing', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Natural Language Processing pipeline', 'Operations Research', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Psychological Transfer', 'Records', 'Research', 'Services', 'System', 'Technology', 'Texas', 'Time', 'Translational Research', 'Universities', 'Work', 'active method', 'base', 'clinical application', 'clinical database', 'cloud based', 'commercialization', 'cost', 'data modeling', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'experience', 'improved', 'insight', 'interoperability', 'language training', 'learning algorithm', 'model building', 'next generation', 'novel', 'prevent', 'rapid growth', 'tool', 'user-friendly', 'web app']",NCATS,"MELAX TECHNOLOGIES, INC.",R44,2020,503546,-6.547402125527336e-05
"Automated domain adaptation for clinical natural language processing Project Summary Automatic extraction of useful information from clinical texts enables new clinical research tasks and new technologies at the point of care. The natural language processing (NLP) systems that perform this extraction rely on supervised machine learning. The learning process uses manually labeled datasets that are limited in size and scope, and as a result, applying NLP systems to unseen datasets often results in severely degraded performance. Obtaining larger and broader datasets is unlikely due to the expense of the manual labeling process and the difficulty of sharing text data between multiple different institutions. Therefore, this project develops unsupervised domain adaptation algorithms to adapt NLP systems to new data. Domain adaptation describes the process of adapting a machine learning system to new data sources. The proposed methods are unsupervised in that they do not require manual labels for the new data. This project has three aims. The first aim makes use of multiple existing datasets for the same task to study the differences in domains, and uses this information to develop new domain adaptation algorithms. Evaluation uses standard machine learning metrics, and analysis of performance is tightly bounded by strong baselines from below and realistic upper bounds, both based on theoretical research on machine learning generalization. The second aim develops open source software tools to simplify the process of incorporating domain adaptation into clinical text processing workflows. This software will have input interfaces to connect to methods developed in Aim 1 and output interfaces to connect with Apache cTAKES, a widely used open- source NLP tool. Aim 3 tests these methods in an end-to-end use case, adverse drug event (ADE) extraction on a dataset of pediatric pulmonary hypertension notes. ADE extraction relies on multiple NLP systems, so this use case is able to show how broad improvements to NLP methods can improve downstream methods. This aim also creates new manual labels for the dataset for an end-to-end evaluation that directly measures how improvements to the NLP systems lead to improvement in ADE extraction. Project Narrative Software systems that use machine learning to understand clinical text often suffer severe performance loss when they are applied to new data that looks different than the data that they originally learned from. In this project, we develop and implement methods that allow these systems to automatically adapt to the characteristics of a new data source. We evaluate these methods on the clinical research task of adverse drug event detection, which relies on many different variables found in the text of electronic health records.",Automated domain adaptation for clinical natural language processing,9986899,R01LM012918,"['Adult', 'Adverse drug event', 'Algorithms', 'Apache', 'Area', 'Characteristics', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Clinical Research', 'Colon Carcinoma', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Conceptions', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Detection', 'Dimensions', 'Ecosystem', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Evaluation', 'Human', 'Information Retrieval', 'Institution', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Language', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Linguistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of brain', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Network-based', 'Output', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Process', 'Pulmonary Hypertension', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Research', 'Software Tools', 'Source', 'Statistical Models', 'System', 'Testing', 'Text', 'TimeLine', 'Training', 'Update', 'Vision', 'Work', 'adaptation algorithm', 'base', 'case finding', 'improved', 'machine learning method', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'method development', 'natural language', 'neural network', 'new technology', 'news', 'novel', 'open source', 'point of care', 'side effect', 'social media', 'software systems', 'statistics', 'structured data', 'supervised learning', 'tool', 'tumor', 'unsupervised learning']",NLM,BOSTON CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2020,383874,0.009911630723079833
"Natural Language Processing and Automated Speech Recognition to Identify Older Adults with Cognitive Impairment Project Summary The purpose of this proposal is to develop two strategies, natural language processing (NLP) and automated speech analysis (ASA), to enable automated identification of patients with cognitive impairment (CI), from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to Alzheimer’s Disease Related Dementias (ADRD) in clinical settings. The number of older adults in the United States with MCI and ADRD is increasing and yet the ability of clinicians and researchers to identify them at scale has advanced little over recent decades and screening with clinical assessments is done inconsistently. Alternative strategies using available data, like analysis of diagnostic codes in the clinical record or insurance claims, have very low sensitivity. NLP and ASA used with machine learning are technologies that could greatly increase ability to detect MCI and ADRD in clinical contexts. NLP automatically converts text in the electronic health record (EHR) into structured concepts suitable for analysis. Thus, clinicians’ documentation of signs and symptoms or orders of tests and services that reflect or address cognitive limitations can be efficiently captured, possibly long before the clinician uses an ADRD-related diagnostic code. ASA directly measures cognition by recognizing different features of cognition captured in speech. Extracting features through both NLP and ASA could thus provide a unique measure of cognition and its impact on the individual and their caregivers. Early detection of MCI and ADRD can help researchers identify appropriate patients for research and help clinicians and health systems target patients for preventive care and care coordination. For these reasons, more efficient, highly scalable strategies are needed to identify people with MCI and ADRD. The Specific Aims of this proposal are to (1) Develop and validate a ML algorithm using features extracted from the EHR with NLP to identify patients with CI, (2) Develop and validate a ML algorithm using features extracted from ASA of audio recordings of patient-provider encounters during routine primary care visits to identify patients with CI, (3) Develop and validate a ML algorithm using both NLP and ASA extracted features to create an integrated CI diagnostic algorithm. We will develop machine learning algorithms using NLP and ASA extracted features trained against neurocognitive assessment data on 800 primary care patients in New York City and validate them in an independent sample of 200 patients in Chicago. In secondary analyses we will train ML algorithms to identify MCI and its subtypes. This project will be the most rigorous development of NLP, ASA, and ML algorithms for CI yet performed, the first to test ASA in primary care settings, and the first to test NLP and ASA feature extraction strategies in combination. The multi-disciplinary team of clinicians, health services researchers, and neurocognitive and data scientists will apply machine learning to develop these highly scalable, automated technologies for identification of MCI and ADRD. 1 Project Narrative The ability of clinicians, health systems and researchers to identify patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer’s Disease Related Dementias (ADRD) is limited. This project will apply machine learning to natural language processing (NLP) of electronic health record data and automated speech analysis (ASA) of patient-doctor conversations during primary care visits to identify patients with MCI and ADRD using automated and scalable procedures. The analytic algorithms will be developed with neurocognitive assessment data on 800 primary care patients in New York City and validated in an independent sample of 200 patients in Chicago. 1",Natural Language Processing and Automated Speech Recognition to Identify Older Adults with Cognitive Impairment,9998610,R01AG066471,"['Acoustics', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Caregivers', 'Chicago', 'Clinical', 'Clinical assessments', 'Code', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Element', 'Data Scientist', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Documentation', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Elderly', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Health Services', 'Health system', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Insurance Carriers', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neurocognitive', 'New York City', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Preventive care', 'Primary Health Care', 'Procedures', 'Provider', 'Psychiatric Diagnosis', 'Reference Standards', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resource Allocation', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Semantics', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Services', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Speech', 'Structure', 'Study Subject', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Visit', 'adverse event risk', 'aging population', 'automated speech recognition', 'base', 'care coordination', 'clinical encounter', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive testing', 'deep learning', 'demographics', 'electronic data', 'electronic structure', 'falls', 'feature extraction', 'financial incentive', 'health care settings', 'improved', 'insurance claims', 'learning classifier', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mental state', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'multidisciplinary', 'prevent', 'primary care setting', 'recruit', 'risk mitigation', 'screening', 'secondary analysis', 'structured data', 'success', 'testing services', 'tool', 'treatment choice', 'unstructured data']",NIA,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R01,2020,855710,-0.02390967973359413

"Open Health Natural Language Processing Collaboratory Project Summary One of the major barriers in leveraging Electronic Health Record (EHR) data for clinical and translational science is the prevalent use of unstructured or semi-structured clinical narratives for documenting clinical information. Natural Language Processing (NLP), which extracts structured information from narratives, has received great attention and has played a critical role in enabling secondary use of EHRs for clinical and translational research. As demonstrated by large scale efforts such as ACT (Accrual of patients for Clinical Trials), eMERGE, and PCORnet, using EHR data for research rests on the capabilities of a robust data and informatics infrastructure that allows the structuring of clinical narratives and supports the extraction of clinical information for downstream applications. Current successful NLP use cases often require a strong informatics team (with NLP experts) to work with clinicians to supply their domain knowledge and build customized NLP engines iteratively. This requires close collaboration between NLP experts and clinicians, not feasible at institutions with limited informatics support. Additionally, the usability, portability, and generalizability of the NLP systems are still limited, partially due to the lack of access to EHRs across institutions to train the systems. The limited availability of EHR data limits the training available to improve the workforce competence in clinical NLP. We aim to address the above challenges by extending our existing collaboration among multiple CTSA hubs on open health natural language processing (OHNLP) to share distributional information of NLP artifacts (i.e., words, n-grams, phrases, sentences, concept mentions, concepts, and text segments) acquired from real EHRs across multiple institutions. We will leverage the advanced privacy-preserving computing infrastructure of iDASH (integrating Data for Analysis, Anonymization, and SHaring) for privacy- preserving data analysis models and will partner with diverse communities including Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics (OHDSI), Precision Medicine Initiative (PMI), PCORnet, and Rare Diseases Clinical Research Network (RDCRN) to demonstrate the utility of NLP for translational research. This CTSA innovation award RFA provides us with a unique opportunity to address the challenges faced with clinical NLP and through strong partnership with multiple research communities and leadership roles of the research team in clinical NLP, we envision that the successful delivery of this project will broaden the utilization of clinical NLP across the research community. There are four aims planned: i) obtain PHI-suppressed NLP artifacts with retained distribution information across multiple institutions and assess the privacy risk of accessing PHI- suppressed artifacts, ii) generate a synthetic text corpus for exploratory analysis of clinical narratives and assess its utility in NLP tasks leveraging various NLP challenges, iii) develop privacy-preserving computational phenotyping models empowered with NLP, and iv) partner with diverse communities to demonstrate the utility of our project for translational research.

"Semi-Automating Data Extraction for Systematic Reviews Summary ​Semi-Automating Data Extraction for Systematic Reviews (​Renewal) Evidence-based Medicine (EBM) aims to inform patient care using all available evidence. Realizing this aim in practice would require access to concise, comprehensive, and up-to-date structured summaries of the evidence relevant to a particular clinical question. Systematic reviews of biomedical literature aim to provide such summaries, and are a critical component of the EBM arsenal and modern medicine more generally. However, such reviews are extremely laborious to conduct. Furthermore, owing to the rapid expansion of the biomedical literature base, they tend to go out of date quickly as new evidence emerges. These factors hinder the practice of evidence-based care. In this renewal proposal, we seek to continue our ground-breaking efforts on developing, evaluating, and deploying novel machine learning (ML) and natural language processing (NLP) methods to automate or semi-automate the evidence synthesis process. This will extend our innovative and successful efforts developing RobotReviewer and related technologies under the current grant. Concretely, for this renewal we propose to move from extraction of clinically salient data elements from individual trials to synthesis of these elements across trials. Our first aim is to extend our ML and NLP models to produce (as one deliverable) a publicly available, continuously and automatically updated semi-structured evidence database, comprising extracted data for all evidence, both published and unpublished. Unpublished trials will be identified via trial registries. Taking this up-to-date evidence repository as a starting point, we then propose cutting-edge ML and NLP models that will generate first drafts of evidence syntheses, automatically. More specifically we propose novel neural cross-document summarization models that will capitalize on the semi-structured information automatically extracted by our existing models, in addition to article texts. These models will be deployed in a new version of RobotReviewer, called RobotReviewerLive, intended to be a prototype for “living” systematic reviews. To rigorously evaluate the practical utility of the proposed methodological innovations, we will pilot their use to support real, ongoing, exemplar living reviews. Semi-Automating Data Extraction for Systematic Reviews (​Renewal) Narrative We propose novel machine learning and natural language processing methods that will aid biomedical literature summarization and synthesis, and thereby support the conduct of evidence-based medicine (EBM). The proposed models and technologies will motivate core methodological innovations and support real-time, up-to-date, semi-automated biomedical evidence syntheses (“systematic reviews”). Such approaches are necessary if we are to have any hope of practicing evidence-based care in our era of information overload.",Semi-Automating Data Extraction for Systematic Reviews,9990898,R01LM012086,"['American', 'Automation', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Data Element', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Elements', 'Evaluation', 'Evidence Based Medicine', 'Evidence based practice', 'Feedback', 'Grant', 'Hybrids', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Internet', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Medical Informatics', 'Metadata', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modern Medicine', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Paper', 'Patient Care', 'Population Intervention', 'Process', 'PubMed', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Registries', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'Surveillance Methods', 'System', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Textbooks', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Update', 'Vision', 'Work', 'base', 'cardiovascular health', 'database structure', 'design', 'evidence base', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'machine learning method', 'natural language', 'neural network', 'novel', 'open source', 'programs', 'prospective', 'prototype', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'repository', 'search engine', 'structured data', 'study characteristics', 'study population', 'success', 'systematic review', 'tool', 'usability', 'working group']",NLM,NORTHEASTERN UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,291873,-0.010599128810799916
"Integrative data science approaches for rare disease discovery in health records ABSTRACT: There are nearly 7,000 diseases that have a prevalence of only one in 2,000 individuals or less. Yet, such rare diseases are estimated to collectively affect over 300 million people worldwide, representing a significant healthcare concern. Although rare diseases have predominantly genetic origins, nearly half of them do not manifest symptoms until adulthood and frequently confound discovery and diagnosis. Even in the case of early onset disorders, the sheer number of possible diagnoses can often overwhelm clinicians. As a result, rare diseases are often diagnosed with delay, misdiagnosed or even remain undiagnosed, not only disrupting patient lives but also hindering progress on our understanding of such diseases. Data science methods that mine large-scale retrospective health record data for phenotypic information will aid in timely and accurate diagnoses of rare diseases, especially when combined with additional data types, thus, having significant real- world impact. This proposal will integrate electronic health record (EHR) data sets with publicly available vocabularies and ontologies, and genomic data for the improved identification and characterization of patients with rare diseases, using approaches from machine learning, natural language processing (NLP) and basic bioinformatics. The work has three specific aims and will be carried out in two phases. During the mentored phase, the principal investigator (PI) will develop data-driven methods to extract standardized concepts related to rare diseases from clinical notes and infer the occurrence of each disease (Aim 1). He will also develop data science approaches to compare and contrast longitudinal patterns associated with patients' journeys through the healthcare system when seeking a diagnosis for a rare disease, and aid in clinical decision-making by leveraging these patterns (Aim 2). During the independent phase (Aim 3), computational methods will be developed for the integrated modeling and analysis of genotypic (from Aim 3) and phenotypic information (from Aims 1 and 2). Cohorts to be sequenced will cover diseases for which causal genes or disease definitions are unclear (discovery), as well as those for which these are well known (validation). This work will be carried out under the mentorship of four faculty members with complementary expertise in biomedical informatics, data science, NLP, and rare disease genomics at the University of Washington, the largest medical system in the Pacific Northwest (four million EHRs), world-renowned researchers in medical genetics, and a robust data science environment. In addition, under the direction of the mentoring team, the PI will complete advanced coursework, receive training in translational bioinformatics and clinical research informatics, submit manuscripts, and seek an independent research position. This proposal will yield preliminary results for subsequent studies on data-driven phenotyping and enable the realization of the PI's career goals by providing him with the necessary training to build on his machine learning and basic bioinformatics expertise to transition into an independent investigator in biomedical data science. PROJECT NARRATIVE Rare genetic diseases are estimated to affect the lives of 25 to 30 million Americans and their families, and present a significant economic burden on the healthcare system. Currently, our knowledge of the broad spectrum of the 7,000 observed rare diseases is limited to a few well-studied ones, hindering our ability to make correct and timely diagnoses. The objective of this study is to improve the identification of patients with rare diseases in healthcare systems by developing data science approaches that automatically recognize rare disease-related patterns in patient health records and correlate them with genomic data, thus, aiding in diagnosis and discovery.",Integrative data science approaches for rare disease discovery in health records,9884791,K99LM012992,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'American', 'Award', 'Basic Science', 'Behavioral', 'Bioinformatics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Clinical Research', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostics Research', 'Disease', 'Economic Burden', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Faculty', 'Family', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuscripts', 'Markov Chains', 'Medical', 'Medical Genetics', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Names', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Natural Language Processing pipeline', 'Ontology', 'Outcome', 'Pacific Northwest', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevalence', 'Principal Investigator', 'Rare Diseases', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Standardization', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Vocabulary', 'Washington', 'Work', 'accurate diagnosis', 'base', 'biomedical data science', 'biomedical informatics', 'career', 'causal variant', 'clinical data warehouse', 'clinical decision-making', 'cohort', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'disease phenotype', 'early onset disorder', 'exome sequencing', 'gene discovery', 'genomic data', 'health care delivery', 'health data', 'health record', 'improved', 'member', 'multimodal data', 'novel', 'open source', 'patient health information', 'phenotypic data', 'prototype', 'psychologic', 'rare condition', 'rare genetic disorder', 'recruit', 'skills', 'software development', 'support tools', 'tool', 'trait']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,K99,2020,92070,-0.022986688423103616
"Online Evidence of Withdrawal Self-Medication PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Withdrawal symptoms from opioid use can be severe and are major contributing factors to relapse and continuing misuse. Many opioid users are actively experimenting with “remedies” that can alleviate withdrawal, and they are discussing their effectiveness in blogs and forums. In this pilot study we will use Natural Language Processing (NLP) and human expertise to examine over 50,000 recent posts in two Reddit forums OpiatesRecovery and Opiates to assess systematically which remedies are being used, how they are being used, and what are the reported consequences of such self-help experimentation. We will create a curated database of user-reported “remedies.” Information will be semiautomatically extracted from the online, self-reported use of alternative treatments (i.e., other prescription drugs, over the counter medications, food supplements, activities such as meditation and yoga). A team of a pharmacologist, physician, and ethnographer will evaluate database entries to uncover (1) potential harm associated with uncontrolled and unsupervised experimentation, (2) potentially effective available treatments (e.g., traditional medicine), (3) potentially promising compound leads, and (4) patients' needs and issues that are most important to them. Aim 1. To assemble an extensive database of opioid withdrawal and remedy-associated terminology from posts on OpiatesRecovery and Opiates Reddit communities. NLP will be used to build a language model that understands how words are used in context (word2vec). Aim 2. To develop a dataset of instances of self-reported remedy use from Reddit and conduct a bipartite network analysis of remedies and users. Using NLP tools and the word embedding model we will develop an exclusive dataset containing extracted information associated with remedies targeting withdrawal and craving. This aim will use elements of artificial intelligence and close human supervision to extract remedies, including variations of spelling, from the texts. The result of this aim will be a remedy database that includes spelling variations and slang references and a network analysis linking remedies and users. Aim 3. To organize, aggregate, and systematically assess information from mentions of remedy use. Potential compounds and other remedies will be classified to provide an initial assessment of their potential relevance to the opioid treatment process. This process will require the most human oversight and assessment. Network analysis tools will be used to assess and identify the relationships between the types of remedies and potential therapeutic effect and will create the benchmarks for similar future studies.

"Advanced End-to-End Relation Extraction with Deep Neural Networks ABSTRACT Relations linking various biomedical entities constitute a crucial resource that enables biomedical data science applications and knowledge discovery. Relational information spans the translational science spectrum going from biology (e.g., protein–protein interactions) to translational bioinformatics (e.g., gene–disease associations), and eventually to clinical care (e.g., drug–drug interactions). Scientists report newly discovered relations in nat- ural language through peer-reviewed literature and physicians may communicate them in clinical notes. More recently, patients are also reporting side-effects and adverse events on social media. With exponential growth in textual data, advances in biomedical natural language processing (BioNLP) methods are gaining prominence for biomedical relation extraction (BRE) from text. Most current efforts in BRE follow a pipeline approach containing named entity recognition (NER), entity normalization (EN), and relation classiﬁcation (RC) as subtasks. They typically suffer from error snowballing — errors in a component of the pipeline leading to more downstream errors — resulting in lower performance of the overall BRE system. This situation has lead to evaluation of different BRE substaks conducted in isolation. In this proposal we make a strong case for strictly end-to-end evaluations where relations are to be produced from raw text. We propose novel deep neural network architectures that model BRE in an end-to-end fashion and directly identify relations and corresponding entity spans in a single pass. We also extend our architectures to n-ary and cross-sentence settings where more than two entities may need to be linked even as the relation is expressed across multiple sentences. We also propose to create two new gold standard BRE datasets, one for drug–disease treatment relations and another ﬁrst of a kind dataset for combination drug therapies. Our main hypothesis is that our end-to-end extraction models will yield supe- rior performance when compared with traditional pipelines. We test this through (1). intrinsic evaluations based on standard performance measures with several gold standard datasets and (2). extrinsic application oriented assessments of relations extracted with use-cases in information retrieval, question answering, and knowledge base completion. All software and data developed as part of this project will be made available for public use and we hope this will foster rigorous end-to-end benchmarking of BRE systems. NARRATIVE Relations connecting biomedical entities are at the heart of biomedical research given they encapsulate mech- anisms of disease etiology, progression, and treatment. As most such relations are ﬁrst disclosed in textual narratives (scientiﬁc literature or clinical notes), methods to extract and represent them in a structured format are essential to facilitate applications such as hypotheses generation, question answering, and information retrieval. The high level objective of this project is to develop and evaluate novel end-to-end supervised machine learning methods for biomedical relation extraction using latest advances in deep neural networks.",Advanced End-to-End Relation Extraction with Deep Neural Networks,10052028,R01LM013240,"['Adverse event', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Benchmarking', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Research', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Combination Drug Therapy', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dependence', 'Disease', 'Distant', 'Drug Interactions', 'Encapsulated', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Fostering', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Gold', 'Growth', 'Hand', 'Heart', 'Information Retrieval', 'Information Sciences', 'Intramural Research', 'Joints', 'Knowledge Discovery', 'Label', 'Language', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Names', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Patients', 'Peer Review', 'Performance', 'Periodicity', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Process', 'Psychological Transfer', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Review Literature', 'Scientist', 'Semantics', 'Software Tools', 'Source', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Terminology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Trees', 'base', 'biomedical data science', 'clinical care', 'deep neural network', 'improved', 'insight', 'interest', 'knowledge base', 'machine learning method', 'natural language', 'neural network', 'neural network architecture', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'off-label use', 'protein protein interaction', 'relating to nervous system', 'side effect', 'social media', 'supervised learning', 'syntax']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF KENTUCKY,R01,2020,358691,-0.04651270831403401
"COINSTAC 2.0: decentralized, scalable analysis of loosely coupled data Project Summary/Abstract  The brain imaging community is greatly benefiting from extensive data sharing efforts currently underway. However, there is still a major gap in that much data is still not openly shareable, which we propose to address. In addition, current approaches to data sharing often include significant logistical hurdles both for the investigator sharing the data (e.g. often times multiple data sharing agreements and approvals are required from US and international institutions) as well as for the individual requesting the data (e.g. substantial computational re- sources and time is needed to pool data from large studies with local study data). This needs to change, so that the scientific community can create a venue where data can be collected, managed, widely shared and analyzed while also opening up access to the (many) data sets which are not currently available (see overview on this from our group7). The large amount of existing data requires an approach that can analyze data in a distributed way while (if required) leaving control of the source data with the individual investigator or the data host; this motivates a dynamic, decentralized way of approaching large scale analyses. During the previous funding period, we developed a peer-to-peer system called the Collaborative Informatics and Neuroimaging Suite Toolkit for Anonymous Computation (COINSTAC). Our system provides an independent, open, no-strings-attached tool that performs analysis on datasets distributed across different locations. Thus, the step of actually aggregating data is avoided, while the strength of large-scale analyses can be retained. During this new phase we respond to the need for advanced algorithms such as linear mixed effects models and deep learning, by proposing to develop decentralized models for these approaches and also implement a fully scalable cloud-based framework with enhanced security features. To achieve this, in Aim 1, we will incorporate the necessary functionality to scale up analyses via the ability to work with either local or commercial private cloud environments, together with advanced visualization, quality control, and privacy and security features. This suite of new functions will open the floodgates for the use of COINSTAC by the larger neuroscience community to enable new discovery and analysis of unprecedented amounts of brain imaging data located throughout the world. We will also improve usability, training materials, engage the community in contributing to the open source code base, and ultimately facilitate the use of COINSTAC's tools for additional science and discovery in a broad range of applications. In Aim 2 we will extend the framework to handle powerful algorithms such as linear mixed effects models and deep learning, and to perform meta-learning for leveraging and updating fit models. And finally, in Aim 3, we will test this new functionality through a partnership with the worldwide ENIGMA addiction group, which is currently not able to perform advanced machine learning analyses on data that cannot be centrally located. We will evaluate the impact of 6 main classes of substances of abuse (e.g. methamphetamines, cocaine, cannabis, nicotine, opiates, alcohol and their combinations) using the new developed functionality. 3 Project Narrative  Hundreds of millions of dollars have been spent on collecting human neuroimaging data for clinical and re- search studies, many of which do not come with subject consent for sharing or contain sensitive data which are not easily shared, such as genetics. Open sharing of raw data, though desirable from the research perspective, and growing rapidly, is not a viable solution for a large number of datasets which have additional privacy risks or IRB concerns. The COINSTAC solution we propose enables us to capture this `missing data' and achieve the same performance as pooling of both open and `closed' repositories by developing privacy preserving versions of advanced and cutting edge algorithms (including linear mixed effects models and deep learning) and incorpo- rating within an easy-to-use and scalable platform which enables distributed computation. 2","COINSTAC 2.0: decentralized, scalable analysis of loosely coupled data",10058463,R01DA040487,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Agreement', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Alcohols', 'Algorithms', 'Atlases', 'Awareness', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Cannabis', 'Clinical Data', 'Cocaine', 'Communities', 'Consent', 'Consent Forms', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Aggregation', 'Data Pooling', 'Data Set', 'Decentralization', 'Development', 'Environment', 'Family', 'Funding', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Institution', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'International', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Legal', 'Link', 'Location', 'Logistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methamphetamine', 'Modeling', 'Movement', 'Neurosciences', 'Nicotine', 'Opioid', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Privacy', 'Privatization', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Quality Control', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Science', 'Security', 'Series', 'Site', 'Source', 'Source Code', 'Statistical Bias', 'Structure', 'Substance of Abuse', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Update', 'Visualization', 'Work', 'addiction', 'base', 'cloud based', 'computational platform', 'computerized data processing', 'computerized tools', 'data harmonization', 'data reuse', 'data sharing', 'data visualization', 'data warehouse', 'deep learning', 'distributed data', 'improved', 'large datasets', 'learning algorithm', 'life-long learning', 'negative affect', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'open data', 'open source', 'peer', 'privacy preservation', 'repository', 'scale up', 'structural genomics', 'success', 'supervised learning', 'tool', 'unsupervised learning', 'usability', 'virtual']",NIDA,GEORGIA STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,627034,-0.0026400620956978874
"National NLP Clinical Challenges (n2c2): Challenges in Natural Language Processing for Clinical Narratives Project Summary and Abstract Narratives of electronic health records (EHRs) contain useful information that is difficult to automatically extract, index, search, or interpret. Natural language processing (NLP) technologies can extract this information and convert it in to a structured format that is more readily accessible by computerized systems. However, the development of NLP systems is contingent on access to relevant data and EHRs are notoriously difficult to obtain because of privacy reasons. Despite the recent efforts to de-identify and release narrative EHRs for research, these data are still very rare. As a result, clinical NLP, as a field has lagged behind. To address this problem, since 2006, we organized thirteen shared tasks, accompanied with workshops and journal publications. Twelve of these shared tasks have focused on the development of clinical NLP systems and the remaining one on the usability of these systems. We have covered both depth and breadth in terms of shared tasks, preparing tasks that study cutting-edge NLP problems on a variety of EHR data from multiple institutions. Our shared tasks are the longest running series of clinical NLP shared tasks, with ever growing EHR data sets, tasks, and participation. Our most popular three data sets have been cited 495 (2010 data), 284 (2006 de-id data), and 274 (2009 data) times, respectively, representing hundreds of articles that have come out of these three data sets alone. Our goal in this proposal is to continue the efforts we started in 2006 under i2b2 shared task challenges (i2b2, NIH NLM U54LM008748, PI: Kohane and R13 LM011411, PI: Uzuner) to de-identify EHRs, annotate them with gold- standard annotations for clinical NLP tasks, and release them to the research community for the development and head-to-head comparison of clinical NLP systems, for the advancement of the state of the art. Continuing our efforts under National NLP Clinical Challenges (n2c2) based at the Health Data Science program of the newly established Department of Biomedical Informatics at Harvard Medical School, we aim to form partnerships with the community to grow the shared task efforts in several ways: (1) grow the available de-identified EHR data sets through partnerships that can contribute to the volume and variety of the data, and (2) grow the available gold-standard annotations in terms of depth and breadth of NLP tasks. Given these aims and partnerships, we plan to hold a series of shared tasks. We will complement these shared tasks with workshops that meet in conjunction with the Fall Symposium of the American Medical Informatics Association and with journal special issues so that advancement of the state of the art can be sped up and future generations can build on the past. Project Narrative We propose to organize a series of shared tasks, workshops, and journal publications for fostering the continuous development of clinical Natural Language Processing (NLP) technologies that can extract information from narratives of Electronic Health Records (EHRs). Our aim is to grow the annotated gold standard EHR data sets that are available to the research community through partnerships and to bring together clinical NLP researchers with informatics researchers for building collaborations. We will engage the community in shared tasks and disseminate the knowledge generated by these shared tasks through workshops and journal special issues for the advancement of the state of the art.",National NLP Clinical Challenges (n2c2): Challenges in Natural Language Processing for Clinical Narratives,9930152,R13LM013127,"['Access to Information', 'Address', 'American', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Community Developments', 'Complement', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Educational workshop', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Evaluation', 'Fostering', 'Future', 'Future Generations', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Grant', 'Growth', 'Hand', 'Head', 'Healthcare', 'Improve Access', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Institution', 'Israel', 'Journals', 'Knowledge', 'Measures', 'Medical Informatics', 'Medical center', 'Methodology', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Paper', 'Peer Review', 'Performance', 'Privacy', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Running', 'Series', 'Source', 'Structure', 'System', 'Systems Development', 'Targeted Research', 'Technology', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'clinical development', 'computerized', 'falls', 'head-to-head comparison', 'health data', 'indexing', 'medical schools', 'meetings', 'practical application', 'programs', 'symposium', 'usability', 'working group']",NLM,GEORGE MASON UNIVERSITY,R13,2020,20000,-0.010689689769780767
"Full Scale Randomized Trial of an Innovative Conversational Agent for Smoking Cessation PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (DESCRIPTION) Cigarette smoking accounts for 480,000 premature deaths and one third of all cancer deaths annually in the US. There is enormous need for high-impact, cost-effective population-level interventions for smoking cessation. For the past 15 years, mobile phone-delivered text messaging interventions such as the NCI’s SmokefreeTXT have been a prominent technology addressing this need. However, very much like all widely available technologies for smoking cessation (e.g., websites), text messaging interventions have modest quit rates, driven largely by low engagement. Fortunately, a new technology provides a therapeutic conversation to address the problem of engagement that impacts text messaging and other current digital technologies for smoking cessation. Advances in machine learning, natural language processing, and cloud computing are now making it possible to create and widely disseminate conversational agents (CAs), which are computer-powered digital coaches designed to form long-term social-emotional connections with users through conversations. CAs are supportive, empathic, reflectively listen, provide personalized responses, and offer goal setting and advice appropriately timed to the needs of the user. Regarding CAs for smoking cessation, the major knowledge gaps are: (1) their efficacy, (2) theoretical mechanisms, and (3) the cost-effectiveness. Also unexplored are the potential baseline moderators of CAs for smoking cessation. We recently developed a CA for smoking cessation, called “QuitBot,” evaluated it in a diary study, and then tested it in a pilot randomized controlled trial (N = 306), comparing it with the NCI’s SmokefreeTXT. The pilot RCT design was very feasible with 93% three-month follow-up. QuitBot had: (a) high participant engagement and (b) high quit rates at the three-month follow-up—very promising in comparison with SmokefreeTXT. Addressing these knowledge gaps and building on the promising results of our QuitBot research, the project will conduct a randomized controlled trial of QuitBot (n = 760) versus SmokefreeTXT (n = 760) with 12-month follow-up in order to determine whether QuitBot: (1) provides higher quit rates than SmokefreeTXT, (2) has smoking cessation outcomes significantly mediated by therapeutic alliance processes and engagement, and (3) is cost-effective vs. SmokefreeTXT. In addition, this study will explore whether these baseline factors moderate the effectiveness of QuitBot: trust, social support, and demographics (e.g., sex). This innovative project will advance the fields of research on CAs both for smoking cessation in particular and for health behavior change in general— regardless of whether the results are positive or null. Positive results could have high population-level impact and stimulate new lines of research into CA dissemination and implementation, and the adaptation of CAs for multiple subpopulations of smokers, languages, and community and medical settings. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE STATEMENT The overall aim of this project is to determine the effectiveness of a conversational agent for smoking cessation. If successful, this intervention can be cost-effectively scaled on a population level, thereby making a high public health impact.",Full Scale Randomized Trial of an Innovative Conversational Agent for Smoking Cessation,9995331,R01CA247156,"['Abstinence', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Adult', 'American', 'Antismoking', 'Car Phone', 'Cessation of life', 'Cloud Computing', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Computers', 'Cost Measures', 'Effectiveness', 'Emotional', 'Empathy', 'Feeling', 'Goals', 'Health behavior change', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Judgment', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Medical', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Quality-Adjusted Life Years', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Sample Size', 'Smoker', 'Smoking', 'Smoking Cessation Intervention', 'Social support', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text Messaging', 'Therapeutic', 'Trust', 'Work', 'arm', 'behavior change', 'cigarette smoking', 'comparative effectiveness', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'cost effectiveness', 'demographics', 'design', 'diaries', 'digital', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'innovation', 'new technology', 'premature', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'randomized effectiveness trial', 'randomized trial', 'response', 'sex', 'smartphone Application', 'smoking cessation', 'social', 'success', 'successful intervention', 'web site']",NCI,FRED HUTCHINSON CANCER RESEARCH CENTER,R01,2020,730398,-0.0239623554513614
"SimTK: An Ecosystem for Data and Model Sharing in the Biomechanics Community Physics-based simulations provide a powerful framework for understanding biological form and function. They harmonize heterogeneous experimental data with real-world physical constraints, helping researchers understand biological systems as they engineer novel drugs, new diagnostics, medical devices, and surgical interventions. The rise in new sensors and simulation tools is generating an increasing amount of data, but this data is often inaccessible, preventing reuse and limiting scientific progress. In 2005, we launched SimTK, a website to develop and share biosimulation tools, models, and data, to address these issues. SimTK now supports 62,000+ researchers globally and 950+ projects. Members use it to meet their grants’ data sharing responsibilities; experiment with new ways of collaborating; and build communities around their datasets and tools. However, challenges remain: many researchers still do not share their digital assets due to the time needed to prepare, document, and maintain those assets, and since SimTK hosts a growing number of diverse digital assets, the site now also faces the challenge of making these assets discoverable and reusable. Thus, we propose a plan to extend SimTK and implement new solutions to promote scientific data sharing and reuse. First, we will maintain the reliable, user-friendly foundation upon which SimTK is built, continuing to provide the excellent support our members expect and supporting the site’s existing features for sharing and building communities. Second, we will implement methods to establish a culture of model and data sharing in the biomechanics community. We will encourage researchers to adopt new habits, making sharing part of their workflow, by enabling the software and systems they use to automatically upload models and data to SimTK via an application programming interface (API) and by recruiting leading researchers in the community to serve as beta testers and role models. Third, we will create tools to easily replicate and extend biomechanics simulations. Containers and cloud computing services allow researchers to capture and share a snapshot of their computing environment, enabling unprecedented fidelity in sharing. We will integrate these technologies into SimTK and provide custom, easy-to-use interfaces to replicate and extend simulation studies. Lastly, we will develop a metadata standard for models and data for the biomechanics community, increasing reusability and discoverability of the rich set of resources shared on SimTK. We will use the new standard on SimTK and fill in the metadata fields automatically using natural language processing and machine learning, minimizing the burden and inaccuracies of manual metadata entry. We will evaluate our success in achieving these aims by tracking the number of assets shared and the frequency they are used as a springboard to new research. These changes will accelerate biomechanics research and provide new tools to increase the reusability and impact of shared resources. By lowering barriers to data sharing in the biosimulation community, SimTK will continue to serve as a model for how to create national infrastructure for scientific subdisciplines. SimTK is a vibrant hub for the development and sharing of simulation software, data, and models of biological structures and processes. SimTK-based resources are being used to design medical devices and drugs, to generate new diagnostics, to create surgical interventions, and to provide insights into biology. The proposed enhancements to SimTK will accelerate progress in the field by lowering barriers to and standardizing data and model sharing, thus 1) increasing the quantity and also, importantly, the quality of resources that researchers share and 2) enabling others to reproduce and build on the wealth of past biomechanics research studies.",SimTK: An Ecosystem for Data and Model Sharing in the Biomechanics Community,9847973,R01GM124443,"['Achievement', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'Biology', 'Biomechanics', 'Biophysics', 'Cloud Computing', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Consumption', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Files', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Documentation', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Explosion', 'Face', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Habits', 'Infrastructure', 'Letters', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Device', 'Medical Device Designs', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physics', 'Process', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resource Sharing', 'Resources', 'Security', 'Services', 'Site', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Update', 'Work', 'application programming interface', 'base', 'biological systems', 'biomechanical model', 'community building', 'complex biological systems', 'data access', 'data cleaning', 'data ecosystem', 'data reuse', 'data sharing', 'data standards', 'digital', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'insight', 'member', 'new technology', 'novel diagnostics', 'novel therapeutics', 'prevent', 'recruit', 'research study', 'response', 'role model', 'sensor', 'simulation', 'simulation software', 'software systems', 'success', 'tool', 'user-friendly', 'web site']",NIGMS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,489919,-0.0030457709672211094
"Leveraging Twitter to Monitor Nicotine and Tobacco Cancer Communication Patterns in Twitter data have revolutionized understanding of public health events such as influenza outbreaks. While researchers have begun to examine messaging related to substance use on Twitter, this project will strengthen the use of Twitter as an infoveillance tool to more rigorously examine nicotine, tobacco, and cancer- related communication. Twitter is particularly suited to this work because its users are commonly adolescents, young adults, and racial and ethnic minorities, all of whom are at increased risk for nicotine and tobacco product (NTP) use and related health consequences. Additionally, due to the openness of the platform, searches are replicable and transparent, enabling large-scale systematic research. Therefore, our multidisciplinary team of experts in diverse relevant fields—including public health, behavioral science, computational linguistics, computer science, biomedical informatics, and information privacy and security—will build upon our previous research to develop and validate structured algorithms providing automated surveillance of Twitter’s multifaceted and continuously evolving information related to NTPs. First, we will qualitatively assess a stratified random sample of relevant NTP-related tweets for specific coded variables, such as the message’s primary sentiment and other key information of potential value (e.g., whether a message involves buying/selling, policy/law, and cancer-related communication). Tweets will be obtained directly from Twitter using software we developed that leverages a comprehensive list of Twitter-optimized search strings related to NTPs. Second, we will statistically determine what message characteristics (e.g., the presence of certain words, punctuation, and/or structures) are most strongly associated with each of the coded variables for each search string. Using this information, we will create specialized Machine Learning (ML) algorithms based on state-of-the-art methods from Natural Language Processing (NLP) to automatically assess and categorize future Twitter data. Third, we will use this information to provide automatic assessment of current and future streaming data. Time series analyses using seasonal Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Averages (ARIMA) will determine if there are significant changes over time in volume of messaging related to each specific coded variables of interest. Trends will be examined at the daily, weekly, and monthly level, because each of these levels is potentially valuable for intervention. To maximize the translational value of this project, we will partner with public health department stakeholders who are experts in streamlining dissemination of actionable trends data. In summary, this project will substantially advance our understanding of representations of NTPs on social media—as well as our ability to conduct automated surveillance and analysis of this content. This project will result in important and concrete deliverables, including open-source algorithms for future researchers and processes to quickly disseminate actionable data for tailoring community- level interventions. For this project, we gathered a team of public health researchers and computer scientists to leverage the power of Twitter as a novel surveillance tool to better understand communication about nicotine and tobacco products (NTPs) and related messages about cancer and cancer prevention. We will gather a random sample of Twitter messages (“tweets”) related to NTPs and examine them in depth and use this information to create specialized computer algorithms that can automatically categorize future Twitter data. Then, we will examine changes over time related to attitudes towards and interest in NTPs, as well as cancer-related discussion around various NTPs, which will dramatically improve our ability to better understand Twitter as a tool for this type of surveillance.",Leveraging Twitter to Monitor Nicotine and Tobacco Cancer Communication,10111658,R01CA225773,"['Adolescent', 'Affect', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Algorithms', 'Attitude', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Cancer Control', 'Categories', 'Characteristics', 'Cigarette', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational Linguistics', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'County', 'Data', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Electronic cigarette', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Event', 'Food', 'Football game', 'Future', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Individual', 'Influenza A Virus, H1N1 Subtype', 'Intervention', 'Laws', 'Linguistics', 'Literature', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Marketing', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Names', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nicotine', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Policies', 'Privacy', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Public Opinion', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Retrieval', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Security', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Time Series Analysis', 'Tobacco', 'Tobacco use', 'Twitter', 'Work', 'automated analysis', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'cancer prevention', 'computer program', 'computer science', 'computerized tools', 'data standards', 'data streams', 'ethnic minority population', 'geographic difference', 'hookah', 'improved', 'influenza outbreak', 'interest', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'nicotine use', 'novel', 'open source', 'phrases', 'prospective', 'racial minority', 'social', 'social media', 'software development', 'statistics', 'time use', 'tobacco products', 'tool', 'trend', 'vaping', 'young adult']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF ARKANSAS AT FAYETTEVILLE,R01,2020,491992,-0.005555288505847998
"PREMIERE: A PREdictive Model Index and Exchange REpository The confluence of new machine learning (ML) data-driven approaches; increased computational power; and access to the wealth of electronic health records (EHRs) and other emergent types of data (e.g., omics, imaging, mHealth) are accelerating the development of biomedical predictive models. Such models range from traditional statistical approaches (e.g., regression) through to more advanced deep learning techniques (e.g., convolutional neural networks, CNNs), and span different tasks (e.g., biomarker/pathway discovery, diagnostic, prognostic). Two issues have become evident: 1) as there are no comprehensive standards to support the dissemination of these models, scientific reproducibility is problematic, given challenges in interpretation and implementation; and 2) as new models are put forth, methods to assess differences in performance, as well as insights into external validity (i.e., transportability), are necessary. Tools moving beyond the sharing of data and model “executables” are needed, capturing the (meta)data necessary to fully reproduce a model and its evaluation. The objective of this R01 is the development of an informatics standard supporting the requisite information for scientific reproducibility for statistical and ML-based biomedical predictive models; from this foundation, we then develop new computational approaches to compare models' performance. We begin by extending the current Predictive Model Markup Language (PMML) standard to fully characterize biomedical datasets and harmonize variable definitions; to elucidate the algorithms involved in model creation (e.g., data preprocessing, parameter estimation); and to explain the validation methodology. Importantly, models in this PMML format will become findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (i.e., following FAIR principles). We then propose novel meth- ods to compare and contrast predictive models, assessing transportability across datasets. While metrics exist for comparing models (e.g., c-statistics, calibration), often the required case-level information is not available to calculate these measures. We thus introduce an approach to simulate cases based on a model's reported da- taset statistics, enabling such calculations. Different levels of transportability are then assigned to the metrics, determining the extent to which a selected model is applicable to a given population/cohort (i.e., helping answer the question, can I use this published model with my own data?). We tie these efforts together in our proposed framework, the PREdictive Model Index & Exchange REpository (PREMIERE). We will develop an online portal and repository for model sharing around PREMIERE, and our efforts will include fostering a community of users to guide its development through workshops, model-thons, and other activities. To demonstrate these efforts, we will bootstrap PREMIERE with predictive models from a targeted domain (risk assessment in imaging-based lung cancer screening). Our efforts to evaluate these developments will engage a range of stakeholders (model developers, users) to inform the completeness of our standard; and biostatisticians and clinical experts to guide assessment of model transportability. PROGRAM NARRATIVE With growing access to information contained in the electronic health record and other data sources, the appli- cation of statistical and machine learning methods are generating more biomedical predictive models. However, there are significant challenges to reproducing these models for purposes of comparison and application in new environments/populations.

"Automated Knowledge Engineering Methods to Improve Consumers' Comprehension of their Health Records PROJECT SUMMARY  Today, more patients can access their health records online than ever before. However, clinical acronyms hinder patients' comprehension of their records and decrease the benefits of transparency. An automated system for expanding clinical acronyms should have major clinical significance and far-reaching consequences for improving patient-provider communication, shared decision-making, and health outcomes. Existing systems have limited power to expand clinical acronyms, primarily due to the lack of comprehensiveness (or generali- zability) of existing acronym sense inventories. Because developing comprehensive sense inventories is difficult, existing knowledge engineering methods have primarily focused on developing institution-specific sense inventories. Institution-specific sense inventories may not be generalizable to other geographical regions and medical specialties. Furthermore, developing an institution-specific sense inventory at every US healthcare organization is not feasible, especially without automated methods which currently do not exist.  I developed advanced knowledge engineering methods to overcome these limitations through the use of fully automated techniques to generalize existing sense inventories from different geographical regions and medical specialties. My methods leverage the extensive resources already devoted to developing institution- specific sense inventories in the U.S., and may help generalize existing sense inventories to institutions without the resources to develop them. Although promising, challenges remain with the optimization and evaluation of these methods. The objective of the proposed project is to use knowledge engineering to improve patients' comprehension of their health records, focusing specifically on clinical acronyms. In Aim 1, I will develop new knowledge engineering methods to facilitate the automated integration of sense inventories, using literature- based quality heuristics and a Siamese neural network to establish synonymy. I will evaluate these methods using multiple metrics to assess redundancy, quality, and coverage in two test corpora with over 17 million clinical notes. In Aim 2, I will evaluate whether the knowledge engineering methods improve comprehension of doctors' notes in 60 hospitalized patients with advanced heart failure. With success, I will create novel, automated knowledge engineering methods that can be directly applied to improve patient care. This research is in support of my mentored doctoral training at Columbia University Department of Biomedical Informatics (DBMI) under Drs. David Vawdrey, George Hripcsak, Carol Friedman, Suzanne Bakken, and Chunhua Weng, and will include coursework on deep learning, oral presentations at major annual conferences, and career development planning, among other activities. DBMI is frequently recognized as one of the oldest and best programs of its kind in the world, and provides an exception training environment for my development into an independent and productive academic investigator. PROJECT NARRATIVE Clinical acronyms make it difficult for patients to understand their medical records, decreasing the benefits of transparency.

"Optimizing BCI-FIT: Brain Computer Interface - Functional Implementation Toolkit SUMMARY  Many of the estimated four million adults in the U.S. with severe speech and physical impairments (SSPI) resulting from neurodevelopmental or neurodegenerative diseases cannot rely on current assistive technologies (AT) for communication. During a single day, or as their disease progresses, they may transition from one access technology to another due to fatigue, medications, changing physical status, or progressive motor dysfunction. There are currently no clinical or AT solutions that adapt to the multiple, dynamic access needs of these individuals, leaving many people poorly served. This competitive renewal, called BCI-FIT (Brain Computer Interface-Functional Implementation Toolkit) adds to our innovative multidisciplinary translational research conducted over the past 11 years for the advancement of science related to non-invasive BCIs for communication for these clinical populations. BCI-FIT relies on active inference and transfer learning to customize a completely adaptive intent estimation classifier to each user's multiple modality signals in real-time. The BCI-FIT acronym has many implications: our BCI fits to each user's brain signals; to the environment, offering relevant personal language; to the user's internal states, adjusting signals based on drowsiness, medications, physical and cognitive abilities; and to users' learning patterns from BCI introduction to expert use.  Three specific aims are proposed: (1) Develop and evaluate methods for optimizing system and user performance with on-line, robust adaptation of multi-modal signal models. (2) Develop and evaluate methods for efficient user intent inference through active querying. (3) Integrate language interaction and letter/word supplementation as input modalities in real-time BCI use. Four single case experimental research designs will evaluate both user performance and technology performance for functional communication with 35 participants with SSPI in the community, and 30 healthy controls for preliminary testing. The same dependent variables will be tested in all experiments: typing accuracy (correct character selections divided by total character selections), information transfer rate (ITR), typing speed (correct characters/minute), and user experience (UX) questionnaire responses about comfort, workload, and satisfaction. Our goal is to establish individualized recommendations for each user based on a combination of clinical and machine expertise. The clinical expertise plus user feedback added to active sensor fusion and reinforcement learning for intent inference will produce optimized multi-modal BCIs for each end-user that can adjust to short- and long-term fluctuating function. Our research is conducted by four sub-teams who have collaborated successfully to implement translational science: Electrical/computer engineering; Neurophysiology and systems science; Natural language processing; and Clinical rehabilitation. The project is grounded in solid machine learning approaches with models of participatory action research and AAC participation. This project will improve technologies and BCI technical capabilities, demonstrate BCI implementation paradigms and clinical guidelines for people with severe disabilities. PROJECT NARRATIVE The populations of US citizens with severe speech and physical impairments secondary to neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative diseases are increasing as medical technologies advance and successfully support life. These individuals with limited to no movement could potentially contribute to their medical decision making, informed consent, and daily caregiving if they had faster, more reliable means that adapt to their best access methods in communication technologies, as proposed in BCI-FIT.

"A deep learning platform to evaluate the reliability of scientific claims by citation analysis. The opioid epidemic in the United States has been traced to a 1980 letter reporting in the prestigious New England Journal of Medicine that synthetic opioids are not addictive. A belated citation analysis led the journal to append this letter with a warning this letter has been “heavily and uncritically cited” as evidence that addiction is rare with opioid therapy.” This epidemic is but one example of how unreliable and uncritically cited scientific claims can affect public health, as studies from industry report that a substantial part of biomedical reports cannot be independently verified. Yet, there is no publicly available resource or indicator to determine how reliable a scientific claim is without becoming an expert on the subject or retaining one. The total citation count, the commonly used measure, is inherently a poor proxy for research quality because confirming and refuting citations are counted as equal, while the prestige of the journal is not a guarantee that a claim published there is true. The lack of indicators for the veracity of reported claims costs the public, businesses, and governments, billions of dollars per year. We have developed a prototype that automatically classifies statements citing a scientific claim into three classes: those that provide supporting or contradicting evidence, or merely mention the claim. This unique capability enables scite users to analyze the reliability of scientific claims at an unprecedented scale and speed, helping them to make better-informed decisions. The prototype has attracted potential customers among top biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, research institutions, academia, and academic publishers. We propose to conduct research that will refine scite into an MVP by optimizing prototype efficiency and accuracy until they reach feasible milestones, and will refine the product-market fit in our beachhead market, academic publishing, whose influence on the integrity and reliability of research is difficult to overestimate. We propose to develop a platform that can be used to evaluate the reliability of scientific claims. Our deep learning model, combined with a network of experts, automatically classifies citations as supporting, contradicting, or mentioning, allowing users to easily assess the veracity of scientific articles and consequently researchers. By introducing a system that can identify how a research article has been cited, not just how many times, we can assess research better than traditional analytical approaches, thus helping to improve public health by identifying and promoting reliable research and by increasing the return on public and private investment in research.",A deep learning platform to evaluate the reliability of scientific claims by citation analysis.,10136941,R44DA050155,"['Academia', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Architecture', 'Biotechnology', 'Businesses', 'Classification', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Epidemic', 'Government', 'Human', 'Industry', 'Institution', 'Investments', 'Journals', 'Letters', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Marketing', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'New England', 'Performance', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Phase', 'Privatization', 'Program Description', 'Proxy', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Readiness', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Sales', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Speed', 'System', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States', 'Vision', 'Visual system structure', 'addiction', 'commercialization', 'cost', 'dashboard', 'deep learning', 'design', 'improved', 'insight', 'interest', 'learning classifier', 'literature citation', 'opioid epidemic', 'opioid therapy', 'product development', 'programs', 'prototype', 'synthetic opioid', 'tool', 'user-friendly']",NIDA,"SCITE, INC.",R44,2020,746725,-0.003003929118265992
"Development of Tools for Evaluating the National Toxicology Program's Effectiveness  NIEHS funds research grants and conducts research to evaluate agents of public health concern. NIEHS has need for research and development tools for use in its research evaluations both the Division of the National Toxicology Program (DNTP) and the Division of Extramural Research and Training (DERT). These tools will enable NTP to evaluate its effectiveness across multiple stakeholder groups to determine use and ability to affect change for public health. Additionally, NTP has interests in using natural language processing for tools that can assist with information extraction from scientific publications ultimately for use in assessing potential hazards.

"A decentralized macro and micro gene-by-environment interaction analysis of substance use behavior and its brain biomarkers   Abstract Wide-spread data sharing has started to permeate the brain imaging community from funders to researchers. However, in recent years there have also been some concerns raised regarding ethical issues related to privacy and data ownership among others. In the parent award we are leveraging and extending a privacy preserving decentralized data sharing platform called COINSTAC to perform a study of gene-by-environmental effects by pooling together data from across the world, some of which is unable to be openly shared. In this supplement we will study various bioethical issues related to different data sharing strategies. This will include calculating risk scores from existing data to evaluate the effectiveness of machine learning to potentially reidentify from similar or different data types, a detailed survey of various policy makers and stakeholders including researchers, federal employees, IRB members, and more, and finally the development of a forward looking white paper addressing both privacy, policy, and regulatory aspects which attempts to frame the various aspects that arise in the contact of the spectrum of data sharing approaches including fully open, ‘trust’ based via data usage agreements, privacy preserving via tools like COINSTAC, and more. The outcomes of this supplement will provide a useful guide for the field going forward and also provide initial data necessary to develop a larger scale project on these topics going forward. Narrative The era of big data, open science, and deep learning is upon us, and data sharing can be done in various ways ranging from fully open to privacy preserving to fully closed. However bioethical issues related to risk, privacy, and data sharing strategies have not been well studied in the context of combined brain imaging, genomics, and macro-environmental data and can be especially sensitive in the context of information such as substance use. In this supplement we will quantify risk levels, survey a broad community of stakeholders, and develop recommendations for the field going forward.",A decentralized macro and micro gene-by-environment interaction analysis of substance use behavior and its brain biomarkers  ,10131528,R01DA049238,"['Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Age', 'Agreement', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Anxiety', 'Award', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Genetics', 'Big Data', 'Bioethical Issues', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain scan', 'China', 'Climate', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Consumption', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Protection', 'Decentralization', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Dropout', 'Economic Burden', 'Employee', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemiology', 'Ethical Issues', 'Ethnic group', 'Europe', 'Family', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Heritability', 'Household', 'Image', 'Income', 'India', 'Individual', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Legal', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Modeling', 'Movement', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Outcome', 'Ownership', 'Paper', 'Parents', 'Physiological', 'Policies', 'Policy Maker', 'Population', 'Population Density', 'Privacy', 'Quality Control', 'Race', 'Recommendation', 'Regulation', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Scanning', 'Smoking', 'Source Code', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Time', 'Trust', 'Twin Multiple Birth', 'Update', 'Urbanization', 'Visualization', 'adolescent substance use', 'base', 'cloud based', 'cognitive development', 'cohort', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'data access', 'data exchange', 'data sharing', 'deep learning', 'drinking', 'early life stress', 'effectiveness evaluation', 'epidemiologic data', 'gene environment interaction', 'genetic profiling', 'human subject', 'imaging genetics', 'insight', 'member', 'neuroimaging', 'open data', 'open source', 'peer', 'privacy preservation', 'psychiatric symptom', 'relating to nervous system', 'rural area', 'sex', 'sharing platform', 'statistics', 'tool', 'tool development', 'urban area', 'virtual']",NIDA,GEORGIA STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,149834,-0.0501067285244083
"Nathan Shock Center of Excellence in Basic Biology of Aging OVERALL PROJECT SUMMARY This application is for renewal of the Nathan Shock Center of Excellence in the Basic Biology of Aging at the University of Washington and affiliated institutions. This Center has over the past 25 years provided key resources in support of investigators who study the biology of aging. This application continues a theme that emphasizes outreach and service to the broadest community of investigators in the gerosciences. Of proximal relevance is the characterization of aging-related phenotypes of longevity and healthspan. As our Center services must be easily accessible to outside users, our Longevity and Healthspan Core (Core E) focuses on invertebrate assays, many of them novel. Two other Resources Cores focus on the high dimensional assessments that are closely related to aging phenotypes: Protein Phenotypes of Aging (Core C) and Metabolite Phenotypes of Aging (Core D). Sophisticated computational and bioinformatic tools for data analysis and optimal insight are provided by the Artificial Intelligence and Bioinformatics Core F. Each of these four Resource Cores is led by highly respected experts in that field, including Michael MacCoss and Judit Villen (Core C), Daniel Promislow (Core D), Matt Kaeberlein and Maitreya Dunham (Core E) and Su-In Lee (Core F). Each will push the envelope of appropriate technologies, developing new state-of-the art approaches for assessments that are the most applicable to gerontology and making them accessible to the national aging community. The Research Development Core (Core B) will continue to support pilot and junior faculty studies, with a firm focus on outreach of service to the national geroscience constituency. The Administrative and Program Enrichment Core (Core A) supports administrative management, an external advisory panel, courses, and data sharing and dissemination. Core A’s program of seminars and symposia will continue a focus on sponsorship and organization of national courses, meetings and pre-meetings, as well as workshops in the fields allied to our Resource Core Services. In coordination with other Nathan Shock Centers, we will support a new Geropathology Research initiative. UW NATHAN SHOCK CENTER OVERALL - PROJECT NARRATIVE We apply for renewal of the Nathan Shock Center of Excellence in the Basic Biology of Aging at the University of Washington, which has for 25 years provided key resources supporting investigators who study the biology of aging. The overarching goal of this Center is to have a positive impact on the field by accelerating research discovery and providing research support for investigators nationally and internationally, particularly junior investigators in the process of building their own research programs.

"Automated Data Collection on Antimicrobial Use in Dogs and Cats in a Tertiary Hospital and Private Practices Judicious antimicrobial use in veterinary medicine is important because improper antimicrobial use can contribute to the evolution of antimicrobial resistance in bacterial pathogens, which makes subsequent use of these drugs less effective in both human and veterinary medicine. There is very little on-the-ground information about veterinary clinicians’ antimicrobial use (AMU) practices in companion animal practice in the US. veterinary medicine. To improve our understanding of antimicrobial use in dogs and cats, we propose to create a nationwide digital surveillance system to collect critical AMU data using existing electronic practice information management systems (PIMS) in collaboration with veterinary industry partners. The system will automatically harvest AMU and patient data from digital PIMS. The proposed system will harvest data collected in routine veterinary examinations from existing PIMS systems and therefore will not require any additional effort from practitioners to participate in the program. Natural language processing, a machine learning method used to classify unstructured text, will be used to review electronic medical records to determine patients’ diagnosis. We aim to prototype the system in our native digital PIMS at North Carolina State University’s College of Veterinary Medicine Teaching hospital. We will then enroll additional private veterinary practices, including general practice, specialty hospitals, and emergency clinics, as sentinels and collect the same detailed PIMS data from a more representative set of clinics. Working closely with the sentinel clinics will provide a deep understanding of how our system operates in private clinics, and in the final stage we aim to expand the fully automated system to PIMS nationwide. The combination of sentinel clinics with the nationwide survey of clinics will create a powerful broad and deep surveillance system for antimicrobial use in veterinary clinics. A broad suite of AMU parameters will be estimated from this data, and the results reported to the FDA in an annual report. Additionally, we will share the data with other researchers through an web-based portal and GitHub repositories. This system will provide the critical data and analysis to understand veterinary AMU in the US. NARRATIVE Veterinarians play a central role in protecting animal and human health by preserving the efficacy of the antibiotics that their use for their patients. We have created a partnership among a public university, private veterinary hospitals, and a leading industry partner to collect information on how antibiotics are being used in cat and dog practices across the country with no disruption to the participating hospitals.

"Boston University CCCR OVERALL ABSTRACT The Boston University CCCR will serve as a central resource for clinical research focused mostly on the most common musculoskeletal disorders, osteoarthritis and gout and will also provide research resources for investigator based research in scleroderma, spondyloarthritis, musculoskeletal pain and osteoporosis. Center grant funding has supported 30-35 papers annually in peer reviewed journals, most in the leading arthritis journals and some in leading general medical journals. This center has trained many of the leading clinical researchers in rheumatology throughout the US and internationally, and many of these former trainees have active collaborations with the center. We will include a broad research community and a core group of faculty in this CCCR. The research community's ready access to core faculty and to the sophisticated research methods and assistance they provide will enhance the clinical and translational research of the community and will increase collaborative opportunities for the core faculty and the community. The CCCR updates BU's historical focus on epidemiologic methods to include new approaches to causal inference and adds new methods in machine learning and mobile health. The Research and Evaluation Support Core Unit (RESCU) is the focal point of this CCCR. A key feature is the weekly research (RESCU meetings in which ongoing and proposed research projects are critically evaluated. This feature ensures frequent interactions between clinician researchers, epidemiologists and biostatisticians who are the core members of the CCCR. The RESCU core unit has provided critical support for other Center grants related to rheumatic and arthritic disorders at Boston University, three current R01/U01's; five current NIH K awards (one K24, 3 K23's, one K01), an R03, an NIH trial planning grant (U34), and multiple ACR RRF awards. The overall goal of this center is to carry out and disseminate high-level clinical research informed both by state of the art clinical research methods and by clinical and biological scientific discoveries. Ultimately, we aim either to prevent the diseases we are studying or to improve the lives of those living with the diseases. NARRATIVE The Boston University Core Center for Clinical Research will provide broad clinical research methods expertise to a large multidisciplinary group of investigators whose research focuses on osteoarthritis and gout with a secondary emphasis on scleroderma, spondyloarthritis, osteoporosis and musculoskeletal pain.

"Graphical Processing Units and a Large-Memory Compute Node for Applications in Genomics, Neuroscience, and Structural Biology Project Summary  Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory (CSHL) is a private, not-for-profit institution dedicated to research and education in biology, with leading research programs in genomics, neuroscience, quantitative biology, plant biology, and cancer. Many activities at CSHL depend critically on high-performance computing resources, but at present, investigators have limited access to Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) and large-memory compute nodes. This deficiency is beginning to hamper a wide variety of biomedical research activities, particularly in the key areas of genomics, neuroscience and structural biology, where such specialty hardware is becoming essential for many important computational analyses. Here, we propose to acquire four state-of-the-art GPU nodes, each equipped with eight Nvidia Tesla V100, SXM2, 32GB GPUs, two 20-core 2.5 GHz Intel Xeon-Gold 6248 (Cascade Lake) processors, and 768 GB of RAM. A second-generation Nvidia NVLink will provide for 300 GB/s inter-GPU communication. In addition, we propose to acquire one large-memory node with 3 TB of RAM and four 20-core 2.5 GHz Intel Xeon-Gold 6248 (Cascade Lake) processors, as well as a top-of-rack 10 Gb Ethernet switch to interconnect the servers with each other and with our existing computer cluster. These new resources will enable a wide variety of innovative research across fields, with direct implications for human health. In genomics, applications will include RNA-seq read mapping; alignment, base-calling, and genome assembly for long-read sequence data; clustering of single cell RNA-seq data; analysis of transposable elements; deep-learning methods for prediction of the fitness consequences of mutations; and deep-learning methods for interpreting high-throughput mutagenesis experiments. In neuroscience, they will include analysis of multi-neuron activity recordings; analysis of mouse brain images; and artificial neural network models of the human olfactory system, of audio features, and of behavior as a function of changing motivations. In structural biology, they will include image processing and 3D reconstruction from cryo-electron microscopy data. These new compute nodes will have a primary impact on the research programs of nine major users from the CSHL faculty with substantial NIH funding. They will also impact three minor users. The new GPU and large-memory nodes will be fully integrated with a soon-to-be-upgraded high-performance computer cluster and managed by the experienced Information Technology group at CSHL, with oversight from a committee of seven faculty members and two IT staff members. Altogether, these new computational resources will substantially enhance the overall computational infrastructure at CSHL. Project Narrative  Many areas of modern biomedical research depend critically on state-of-the-art computing resources. Here we propose to acquire two types of specialty computer hardware: four Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) nodes and a large-memory compute node, both of which will be fully integrated with an existing and soon-to-be-upgraded high-performance computer cluster. These resources will meet a wide variety of computing needs across research areas at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, particularly in the growing areas of genomics, neuroscience, and structural biology.","Graphical Processing Units and a Large-Memory Compute Node for Applications in Genomics, Neuroscience, and Structural Biology",9939826,S10OD028632,"['3-Dimensional', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Research', 'Brain imaging', 'Communication', 'Computer Analysis', 'Cryoelectron Microscopy', 'DNA Transposable Elements', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Education', 'Faculty', 'Funding', 'Generations', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Gold', 'Health', 'High Performance Computing', 'Human', 'Information Technology', 'Institution', 'Laboratories', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Memory', 'Minor', 'Motivation', 'Mus', 'Mutagenesis', 'Mutation', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Olfactory Pathways', 'Plants', 'Privatization', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'artificial neural network', 'base', 'computer cluster', 'computer infrastructure', 'computing resources', 'deep learning', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'fitness', 'high end computer', 'image processing', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'medical specialties', 'member', 'programs', 'reconstruction', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'structural biology', 'transcriptome sequencing']",OD,COLD SPRING HARBOR LABORATORY,S10,2020,436882,-0.03859149615491997
"Developing novel technologies that ensure privacy and security in biomedical data science research Data science holds the promise of enabling new pathways to discovery and can improve the understanding, prevention and treatment of complex disorders such as cancer, diabetes, substance abuse, etc., which are significantly on the rise. The promise of data science can be fully realized only when collected data can be collaboratively shared and analyzed. However, the widespread increases in healthcare data breaches due to inappropriate access as well as the increasing number of novel privacy attacks restrict institutions from sharing data. Indeed, in some cases, the results of the analysis can themselves lead to significant privacy harm. The success of the data commons depends on ensuring the maximal access to data, subject to all of the patient privacy requirements including those mandated by legislation, and all of the constraints of the organization collecting the data itself. While there are existing solutions that can solve parts of the problem, there are significant challenges in truly incorporating these into comprehensive working solutions that are usable by the biomedical research community, and new challenges brought on by modern techniques such as deep learning. The long-term goal of this research is to develop technologies that can holistically enable data sharing while respecting privacy and security considerations and to ensure that they are implemented in existing platforms that have widespread acceptance in the research community. Towards this, the objective of this project is to develop complementary solutions for risk inference, distributed learning, and access control that can enable different modalities of data sharing. The problems studied are general in nature and will evolve depending on research successes and new impediments that arise. The proposed program of research is significant since lack of access to biomedical data can lead to fragmentation of care, resulting in higher economic and social costs, and is a significant impediment to biomedical research. The project will result in open-source, freely available software tools that will be integrated into widely used data collection, cohort identification, and distributed analytics platforms. There are several ongoing collaborations that will serve as initial pilot customers to provide use cases, identify the requirements, evaluate results, and in general validate the developed solutions. Project Narrative Statement of Relevance to Public Health Being able to ensure privacy and security while enabling data sharing and analysis is critical to pave the way forward for public health research and improve our understanding of diseases. The proposed work will address the challenges that impede the use of data across all of the different modalities of data sharing. The integration into existing platforms will ensure that the developed models, tools, and solutions directly impact the research community and improve public health interventions.",Developing novel technologies that ensure privacy and security in biomedical data science research,9851602,R35GM134927,"['Address', 'Biomedical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Data Commons', 'Data Science', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Economics', 'Ensure', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Institution', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Nature', 'Pathway interactions', 'Prevention', 'Privacy', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Security', 'Software Tools', 'Statutes and Laws', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Work', 'biomedical data science', 'care fragmentation', 'cohort', 'cost', 'data sharing', 'deep learning', 'improved', 'new technology', 'novel', 'open source', 'patient privacy', 'programs', 'public health intervention', 'public health research', 'social', 'success', 'tool']",NIGMS,RUTGERS THE STATE UNIV OF NJ NEWARK,R35,2020,382108,-0.02111104344957595
"Center for Modeling Complex Interactions Biomedical problems are innately complex, and their solutions require input from many fields. Many centers focus on a single disease or organ system. By contrast, the Center for Modeling Complex Interactions focuses on an approach that can address many biomedical problems: team-based, interdisciplinary research centered around modeling. Our goal is to support and facilitate biomedical discovery by integrating modeling into interdisciplinary research. Modeling improves research at all stages—hypothesis formulation, experimental design, analysis, and interpretation. It provides a unifying language by which exchange of ideas can highlight commonalities and uncover unforeseen connections between problems. Formalization of ideas into this unifying language also improves rigor and reproducibility. We define modeling broadly to include everything from deterministic and stochastic mathematical approaches, to physical and computational models of three- dimensional objects, to agent-based and machine learning approaches where exact solutions are not possible. We seek to support modelers by increasing their numbers, and by giving them opportunities to play on interdisciplinary teams. We seek to support empiricists by giving them access to relevant modeling expertise, and by creating a community and a culture to facilitate interdisciplinary research. In Phase I, the Center for Modeling Complex Interactions created the intellectual, cultural, and physical environment to promote team- based, interdisciplinary research. In Phase II, we will build on that foundation by maintaining a strong interdisciplinary culture to foster collaboration among people who might otherwise never connect, and by adding additional faculty to expand our modeling expertise. We have four Aims: 1) Support faculty to carry out model-based, interdisciplinary biomedical research and increase their competitiveness for external funding. Research in the Center is carried out in the context of Working Groups—zero-barrier, interdisciplinary, goal- focused teams that meet regularly to get work done. Supported research includes three Research Projects, Pilot Projects, Modeling Access Grants, and ad hoc teams. Our comprehensive plan for proposal preparation improves grantsmanship, and our staff assists with submission and grant management. 2) Increase University of Idaho’s faculty participation in biomedical research. We will add six new faculty as a commitment to this Phase II COBRE and attract broader participation from across the University. 3) Extend the reach of the Modeling Core into new areas of modeling to capitalize on emerging opportunities. The Modeling Core accelerates interdisciplinary research by placing Core Fellows at the hub of the research community. We have added new Core Initiatives in machine learning and geospatial modeling to stimulate research in these areas with high potential for future growth. 4) Establish a path to long-term sustainability under the umbrella of the Institute for Modeling Collaboration & Innovation. The major hurdle for sustainability is to maintain a robust Modeling Core. We have developed a business plan that calls for us to diversify our funding sources to include institutional, state, and private support to supplement federal grants. Human health is determined by interactions of complex biological systems at multiple scales, from the ecological to the biophysical; these are layered with spatial and temporal variation. To decipher these systems requires predictive modeling, coupled with strong empirical work, to be guided by and to feed the models.

"HERCULES: Exposome Research Center PROJECT SUMMARY: HERCULES The vision of the HERCULES P30 is to demonstrably advance the role of environmental health sciences in clinical and public health settings using the platform of the exposome. Healthcare and biomedical research have become increasingly genome-centric. While much of this is due to the impressive achievements in genomics, which have consistently outpaced gains in environmental health, it is our contention that a more persuasive case needs to be made for environmental factors. Science and intuition support the idea that the environment plays just as large of a role as genetics for the majority of diseases. The exposome, which embraces a strategy and scale similar to genomic research, is poised to elevate the environment in discussions of health and disease. We will continue to grow and enhance the environmental health science research portfolio at Emory through cutting-edge technologies and innovative data solutions. We will build upon the superb relationships we have built with the local community and continue to push the mission of NIEHS on campus and across the scientific landscape. Based on the extraordinary progress over our first three years, we propose to retain our theme to use exposome-related concepts and approaches to improve human health. This simple and unifying vision will continue to stimulate discovery, promote collaboration, and enhance communication through the following Specific Aims: Specific Aim 1. To marshal physical and intellectual resources to support exposome-related approaches (high-resolution metabolomics, analytical chemistry, systems biology, machine learning, bioinformatics, high-throughput toxicology, and spatial and temporal statistical models) through cores, pilot funding, mentoring, and research forums. Specific Aim 2. To make major contributions towards exposome and environmental health science research. Specific Aim 3. To provide career development activities around innovative and emerging concepts and approaches related to the exposome. Specific Aim 4. To enhance and expand existing relationships with community partners to resolve environmental health issues in the community using exposome principles. Specific Aim 5. To provide infrastructure and resources to facilitate rapid translation of novel scientific findings into the development of prevention and treatment strategies in humans.

"Enhancing Infrastructure for Clinical and Translational Research to Address the Opioid Epidemic PROJECT SUMMARY Up-to-date information about non-fatal overdose emergency department (ED) encounters can provide critical information about the evolution of the opioid epidemic and response of the healthcare system and is an essential to planning of clinical trials to address the problems underlying this epidemic. Establishing a platform that delivers high positive predictive value for opioid-related overdose (OD) using a combination of coded and natural language terms in electronic health records (EHRs) is an essential step toward the large-scale surveillance necessary to evaluate the pragmatic effectiveness of numerous systemic and policy-based efforts and to create the infrastructure for large scale trials to reduce drug-related mortality and morbidity. However, to date, localized and federal efforts have been largely based on discrete ICD-10 code data or have had time lags of one-to-three years for more detailed data. Perhaps more Importantly, they have not had the capacity for planning and feasibility assessment for clinical and translational research at specific sites. We propose foundational work to create an inter-institutional research database and network focused on patients presenting to EDs with opioid-related OD. To create this network, we will extend previous work to develop: (1) an e-phenotype for case identification in the ED based on EHR data, and (2) combine this with a data dictionary and coded data extraction tools, and natural language processing (NLP) algorithms, to obtain additional data from EHRs; tools for primary capture of data during clinical care; and tools for integration of data on social determinants of health. This will allow for a more thorough characterization of individuals presenting to EDs with opioid-related OD including: demographics, comorbidities, OD agent and source, intentionality of the OD, ED treatment and discharge disposition. Through refinement and automation, the data extraction process will be extended to a set of pilot CTSA Accrual to Clinical Trials (ACT) Network sites and then potentially to other CTSA's nation-wide. This new functionality focuses on providing a platform to accelerate research. To accomplish this work, our Specific Aims are to: 1) Demonstrate the feasibility of extending the ACT Network data model and infrastructure to monitor the opioid epidemic using ED data, 2) Create a prototype opioid overdose monitoring and response network across participating institutions and a toolkit for other CTSA sites to join the network, and 3) Demonstrate potential usefulness of the network in monitoring the opioid epidemic and in planning clinical trials. This proposal is innovative as it aims to develop a feasible and effective near real time means of monitoring opioid-related OD presentation in EDs across the country to inform point-of-care service delivery, prevention and treatment intervention development and evaluation. Downstream, the application of project deliverables include dissemination of the replication toolkit to leverage the platform of the CTSAs and NIDA Clinical Trials Network to build capacity for timely surveillance of opioid-related OD to facilitate prevention and treatment research and intervention. PROJECT NARRATIVE Patients presenting with opioid-related overdose to hospital emergency departments represent a high-risk group for morbidity and mortality and a potential target for interventions to combat the opioid epidemic. This proposal is innovative as it aims to develop a feasible and effective inter-institutional research database and network focused on these patients.

"N3C & All of Us Research Program Collaborative Project Project Summary/Abstract The COVID-19 pandemic presents unprecedented clinical and public health challenges. Though institutions collect large amounts of clinical data about COVID-19 cases, these datasets individually might not be diverse enough to draw population level conclusions. Also, statistical, machine learning, and causal analyses are most successful with large-scale data beyond what is available in any given organization. To tackle this problem, NCATS introduced the National COVID Cohort Collaborative (N3C), an open science, community-based initiative to share patient level data for analysis. The initiative requires participating institutions to share information about their COVID-19 patients in a standard-driven way, including demographics, vital signs, diagnoses, laboratory results, medications, and other treatments. The data from multiple institutions will be merged and consolidated, and access will be provided to investigators through a centralized analytical platform. The COVID-19 data sharing collaboration with the N3C initiative offers a mechanism to initiate collaborations with other NIH sponsored data sharing programs, such as the All of Us Research Program (AoURP). This administrative supplement will support efforts to clean and standardize data at VCU, and to transfer it to the N3C data repository. The supplement will also assist in introducing new services at the Wright Center to support our investigators to use the N3C resources. It will also enable collaboration with the AoURP by establishing a pipeline to collect and transmit consented patients' EHR data and by building on existing community outreach pathways to recruit additional participants for the AoURP. The project will be overseen by the PI/Executive Committee and supervised by the Director of Research Informatics. Procedures and services developed at our local CTSA hub will be shared and disseminated to the CTSA network. Project Narrative NIH/NCATS has been working on the National COVID Cohort Collaborative (N3C), which aims to build a centralized national data resource to be used by the research community to study the COVID-19 pandemic and identify potential treatments as the pandemic continues to evolve. The COVID-19 data sharing collaboration with the N3C initiative also offers a mechanism to initiate collaborations with the All of Us Research Program (AoURP).

"Development of an Open-Source and Data-Driven Modeling Platform to Monitor and Forecast Disease Activity PROJECT SUMMARY Reliable and real-time municipality-level predictive modeling and forecasts of infectious disease activity have the potential to transform the way public health decision-makers design interventions such as information campaigns, preemptive/reactive vaccinations, and vector control, in the presence of health threats across the world. While the links between disease activity and factors such as: human mobility, climate and environmental factors, socio-economic determinants, and social media activity have long been known in the epidemic literature, few efforts have focused on the evident need of developing an open-source platform capable of leveraging multiple data sources, factors, and disparate modeling methodologies, across a large and heterogeneous nation to monitor and forecast disease transmission, over four geographic scales (nation, state, city, and municipal). The overall goal of this project is to develop such a platform. Our long-term goal is to investigate effective ways to incorporate the findings from multiple disparate studies on disease dynamics around the globe with local and global factors such as weather conditions, socio- economic status, satellite imagery and online human behavior, to develop an operational, robust, and real- time data-driven disease forecasting platform. The objective of this grant is to leverage the expertise of three complementary scientific research teams and a wealth of information from a diverse array of data sources to build a modeling platform capable of combining information to produce real-time short term disease forecasts at the local level. As part of this, we will evaluate the predictive power of disparate data streams and modeling approaches to monitor and forecast disease at multiple geographic scales--nation, state, city, and municipality--using Brazil as a test case. Additionally, we will use machine learning and mechanistic models to understand disease dynamics at multiple spatial scales, across a heterogeneous country such as Brazil. Our specific aims will (1) Assess the utility of individual data streams and modeling techniques for disease forecasting; (2) Fuse modeling techniques and data streams to improve accuracy and robustness at the four spatial scales; (3) Characterize the basic computational infrastructure necessary to build an operational disease forecasting platform; and (4) Validate our approach in a real-world setting. This contribution is significant because It will advance our scientific knowledge on the accuracy and limitations of disparate data streams and multiple modeling approaches when used to forecast disease transmission. Our efforts will help produce operational and systematic disease forecasts at a local level (city- and municipality-level). Moreover, we aim at building a new open-source computational platform for the epidemiological community to use as a knowledge discovery tool. Finally, we aim at developing this platform under the guidance of a Subject Matter Expert (SME) panel comprising of WHO, CDC, academics, and local and federal stakeholders within Brazil. The proposed approach is innovative because few efforts have focused on developing an open-source computational platform capable of combining disparate data sources and drivers, across a heterogeneous and large nation, into multiple modeling approaches to monitor and forecast disease transmission, over multiple geographic scales.. In addition, we propose to investigate how to best combine modeling approaches that have, to this date, been developed and interpreted independently, namely, traditional epidemiological mechanistic models and novel machine-learning predictive models, in order to produce accurate and robust real-time disease activity estimates and forecasts. Project Narrative The proposed research is of crucial importance to public health surveillance and preparedness communities because it seeks to identify effective ways to utilize previously disconnected results, that have pointed out links between disease spread and factors such as socio-economic status, local weather conditions, human mobility, social media activity, to build an open-source and data driven, modeling platform capable of extracting and disseminating information from disparate data sources, and complementary modeling approaches, to (1) Evaluate the predictive power of disparate data streams and modeling approaches to monitor and forecast disease at multiple geographic scales: nation, state, city, and municipality; (2) Fuse complementary modeling approaches that have been developed independently and oftentimes not used in conjunction; (3) produce real- time and short term forecasts of disease activity in multiple geographic scales across a heterogeneous and large nation like Brazil.",Development of an Open-Source and Data-Driven Modeling Platform to Monitor and Forecast Disease Activity,10000112,R01GM130668,"['Area', 'Assimilations', 'Beds', 'Behavior', 'Brazil', 'Burn injury', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Cities', 'Climate', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Dengue', 'Developing Countries', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Economics', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemic', 'Epidemiology', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'High Performance Computing', 'Human', 'Imagery', 'Individual', 'Influenza', 'Influenza B Virus', 'Institution', 'Internet', 'Knowledge', 'Knowledge Discovery', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Municipalities', 'Population Surveillance', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Readiness', 'Research', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Twitter', 'Vaccination', 'Vector-transmitted infectious disease', 'Water', 'Weather', 'Work', 'ZIKA', 'base', 'chikungunya', 'climate variability', 'computational platform', 'computer infrastructure', 'data infrastructure', 'data modeling', 'data streams', 'digital', 'disease transmission', 'economic determinant', 'experience', 'flu', 'genomic data', 'heterogenous data', 'improved', 'innovation', 'mathematical methods', 'multiple data sources', 'novel', 'open data', 'open source', 'pathogen', 'pathogen genomics', 'predictive modeling', 'social', 'social media', 'sociodemographics', 'socioeconomics', 'spreading factor', 'therapy design', 'time use', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'trend', 'vector control', 'vector-borne']",NIGMS,BOSTON CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2020,365601,-0.0410086710836733
"Meta-analysis in human brain mapping This is the competing renewal of R01MH074457-13, which sustains the BrainMap Project (www.brainmap.org). The overall goal of the BrainMap Project is to provide the human neuroimaging community with curated data sets, metadata, computational tools, and related resources that enable coordinate-based meta-analyses (CBMA), meta-analytic connectivity modeling (MACM), meta-data informed interpretation (“decoding”) of imaging results, and meta-analytic priors for mining (including machine learning) primary (per-subject) neuroimaging data. To date, the BrainMap Project has designed and populated two coordinate-based databases: 1) a task-activation repository (TA DB); and, 2) a voxel-based morphometry repository (VBM DB). The TA DB contains >17,200 experiments, collectively representing > 78,000 subjects and > 110 task- activation paradigms. The VBM DB contains > 3,100 experiments, collectively representing > 81,000 subjects with > 80 psychiatric, neurologic and developmental disorders with ICD-10 coding. The BrainMap Project has created, optimized and validated an integrated pipeline of multi-platform (Javascript), open-access tools to curate (Scribe), filter and retrieve (Sleuth), analyze (GingerALE), visualize (Mango) and interpret analysis output (BrainMap meta-data plugins for Mango). Several network-modeling approaches have been applied to BrainMap data -- MACM, independent components analysis (ICA), graph theory modeling (GTM), author-topic modeling (ATM), structural equation modeling (SEM), and connectivity-based parcellation (CBP) – but none are yet pipeline components. Utilization of these CBMA resources is substantial: BrainMap software, data and meta-data have been used in > 825 peer-reviewed publications. Of these, > 350 were published within the current funding period (April 2015-March 2019; brainmap.org/pubs). In this competing renewal, four tool- development aims are proposed, each of which extends this high-impact research resource. Aim 1. Database Expansion. BrainMap data repositories will be expanded. Aim 2. Meta-analytic Network Modeling. Network modeling will be added to the BrainMap pipeline. Aim 3. Large-Scale Simulations, Comparisons and Validations. Data simulations, characterizations and validations will be performed. Aim 4. Meta-data Inferential tools. Tools for mining BrainMap’s location-linked meta-data will be expanded. Data Sharing Plan. BrainMap data, meta-data, pipeline tools, and templates created by whole-database modeling (e.g., ICA and ATM network masks) are shared at BrainMap.org. Of all new data entries, more than half are contributed by BrainMap users, i.e., community data sharing via BrainMap.org. For community-coded entries, the BrainMap team provides curation and quality control. Comprehensive database images (database dumps) are available to tool developers through Collaborative Use Agreements.

"DOCKET: accelerating knowledge extraction from biomedical data sets Component type: This Knowledge Provider project will continue and significantly extend work done by the Translator Consortium Blue Team, focusing on deriving knowledge from real-world data through complex analytic workflows, integrated to the Translator Knowledge Graph, and served via tools like Big GIM and the Translator Standard API. The problem: We aim to solve the “first mile” problem of translational research: how to integrate the multitude of dynamic small-to-large data sets that have been produced by the research and clinical communities, but that are in different locations, processed in different ways, and in a variety of formats that may not be mutually interoperable. Integrating these data sets requires significant manual work downloading, reformatting, parsing, indexing and analyzing each data set in turn. The technical and ethical challenges of accessing diverse collections of big data, efficiently selecting information relevant to different users’ interests, and extracting the underlying knowledge are problems that remain unsolved. Here, we propose to leverage lessons distilled from our previous and ongoing big data analysis projects to develop a highly automated tool for removing these bottlenecks, enabling researchers to analyze and integrate many valuable data sets with ease and efficiency, and making the data FAIR [1]. Plan: (AIM 1) We will analyze and extract knowledge from rich real-world biomedical data sets (listed in the Resources page) in the domains of wellness, cancer, and large-scale clinical records. (AIM 2) We will formalize methods from Aim 1 to develop DOCKET, a novel tool for onboarding and integrating data from multiple domains. (AIM 3) We will work with other teams to adapt DOCKET to additional knowledge domains. ■ The DOCKET tool will offer 3 modules: (1) DOCKET Overview: Analysis of, and knowledge extraction from, an individual data set. (2) DOCKET Compare: Comparing versions of the same data set to compute confidence values, and comparing different data sets to find commonalities. (3) DOCKET Integrate: Deriving knowledge through integrating different data sets. ■ Researchers will be able to parameterize these functions, resolve inconsistencies, and derive knowledge through the command line, Jupyter notebooks, or other interfaces as specified by Translator Standards. ■ The outcome will be a collection of nodes and edges, richly annotated with context, provenance and confidence levels, ready for incorporation into the Translator Knowledge Graph (TKG). ■ All analyses and derived knowledge will be stored in standardized formats, enabling querying through the Reasoner Std API and ingestion into downstream AI assisted machine learning. ■ Example questions this will allow us to address include: (Wellness) Which clinical analytes, metabolites, proteins, microbiome taxa, etc. are significantly correlated, and which changing analytes predict transition to which disease? [2,3] (Cancer) Which gene mutations in any of X pathways are associated with sensitivity or resistance to any of Y drugs, in cell lines from Z tumor types? (All data sets) Which data set entities are similar to this one? Are there significant clusters? What distinguishes between the clusters? What significant correlations of attributes can be observed? How can this set of entities be expanded by adding similar ones? How do these N versions of this data set differ, and how stable is each knowledge edge as the data set changes over time? Collaboration strengths: Our team has extensive experience with biomedical and domainagnostic data analytics, integrating multiple relevant data types: omics, clinical measurements and electronic health records (EHRs). We have participated in large collaborative consortia and have subject matter experts willing to advise on proper data interpretation. Our application synergizes with those of other Translator teams (see Letters of Collaboration). Challenges: Data can come in a bewildering diversity of formats. Our solution will be modular, will address the most common formats first, and will leverage established technologies like DataFrames and importers (like pandas.io) where possible. Mapping nodes and edge types onto standard ontologies is crucial for knowledge integration; we will collaborate with the Standards component to maximize success. n/a",DOCKET: accelerating knowledge extraction from biomedical data sets,10057127,OT2TR003443,"['Address', 'Big Data', 'Cell Line', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ethics', 'FAIR principles', 'Gene Mutation', 'Individual', 'Ingestion', 'Knowledge', 'Knowledge Extraction', 'Letters', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Ontology', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Provider', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Resources', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Standardization', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Translational Research', 'Work', 'experience', 'indexing', 'interest', 'interoperability', 'knowledge graph', 'knowledge integration', 'large datasets', 'microbiome', 'novel', 'success', 'tool', 'tumor']",NCATS,INSTITUTE FOR SYSTEMS BIOLOGY,OT2,2020,609068,-0.038368003734550564
"Mozak: Creating an Expert Community to accelerate neuronal reconstruction at scale Project Summary This project aims to leverage the best of both computational and human expertise in neuronal reconstruction towards the goal of accelerating global neuroscience discovery from internationally-sourced imaging data. We propose to create a cloud-based unified platform for converging 3-dimensional images of neurons onto a single analysis platform to (1) train and grow a new expert community of global reconstructors to work across the data from these groups, to (2) generate a community-sourced neuronal reconstruction database of open imaging data that can be incorporated into a 3-dimensional map of neuronal interconnectivity - onto which (3) novel annotations and more complex functional and molecular data can be overlaid. Our approach will evolve with the growing needs of the neuroscience community over time. To do this, in Aim One (Neuronal Reconstruction at Scale), we will test if the newly developed crowd-sourced game-based platform Mozak can develop a collective of new human experts at scale, capable of accelerating the rate of current reconstruction by at least an order of magnitude, at the same time as increasing the robustness, quality and unbiasedness of the final reconstructions. In Aim Two (Robust Multi-Purpose Annotation), we will enhance basic neuronal reconstruction by adding specific semantic annotation— including soma volume and morphological quantification, volumetric analysis, and ongoing features (e.g. dendritic spines, axonal varicosities) requested from the neuroscience community. Experienced and high-ranking members will be given the opportunity to advance through increasingly complex neurons into full arbor brain-wide neuronal projections and multiple clustered groups of neurons in localized circuits. Finally, in Aim 3 (Creation of a Research-Adaptive Data Repository), we aim to develop a database of neuronal images reconstructed using the Mozak interface that will directly serve the general and specific needs of different research groups. Our goal is to make this database dynamically adaptive — as new research questions will invariably bring new needs for additional annotations and cross-referencing with other data modalities. This highquality unbiased processing repository will also be perfectly suited for training sets for automated algorithms, and the generation of a 3-dimensional maps such as Allen Institute for Brain Science (AIBS) common coordinate framework. We expect that the computational reconstruction methods will further improve with the new large corpus of “gold standard” reconstructions. Collectively, the completion of these three aims will create an analysis suite as well as an online community of experts capable of performing in depth analysis of large-scale datasets that will significantly accelerate neuroscience research, enhance machine learning for reconstruction analysis, and create a common platform of baseline neuronal morphology data against which aberrantly functioning neurons can be analyzed. Project Narrative  This project will create a new central nexus point for neuronal reconstruction and semantic annotation (Mozak) that can be used by all research labs via an accessible online portal. We will develop a new cadre of neuronal reconstruction experts that will— in conjunction with automated tools that are enhanced by their work — drastically increase the volume, quality and robustness of neuron reconstructions and annotations. Mozak reconstructions will be shared with existing repositories and will be continually updated and re-annotated based on emerging needs of research - ensuring perpetual relevance, and allowing us to generate a platform to establish the range of “baseline” 3-dimensional readouts of neuronal morphology against which diseased or malfunctioning neurons can be analyzed and understood. 1",Mozak: Creating an Expert Community to accelerate neuronal reconstruction at scale,10005472,R01MH116247,"['3-Dimensional', 'Adopted', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Axon', 'Brain', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Dendritic Spines', 'Disease', 'Ensure', 'Future', 'Gap Junctions', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Guidelines', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging technology', 'Infrastructure', 'Institutes', 'International', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Molecular', 'Morphology', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Process', 'Research', 'Science', 'Semantics', 'Slice', 'Source', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Three-dimensional analysis', 'Time', 'Training', 'Update', 'Variant', 'Varicosity', 'Work', 'automated algorithm', 'base', 'citizen science', 'cloud based', 'crowdsourcing', 'data warehouse', 'experience', 'improved', 'large scale data', 'member', 'neuronal cell body', 'novel', 'online community', 'petabyte', 'programs', 'reconstruction', 'repository', 'tool', 'two-dimensional', 'web portal']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2020,628430,-0.012737093354871928
"New Jersey Alliance for Clinical Translational Science: NJ ACTS Contact PD/PI: Panettieri, Reynold Alexander Project Summary/Abstract Overview Coordinated by Rutgers Biomedical and Health Sciences (RBHS), the New Jersey Alliance for Clinical and Translational Science (NJ ACTS) comprises a consortium with Rutgers and Princeton Universities (PU), NJ Institute for Technology (NJIT), medical, nursing, dental and public health schools, hospitals, community health centers, outpatient practices, industry, policymakers and health information exchanges. All Alliance universities and affiliates have provided substantial resources and contributed to the planning, development and leadership of the consortium. With access to ~7 million people, NJ ACTS serves as a ‘natural laboratory’ for translational and clinical research. With a state population of ~9 million, New Jersey ranks 11th in the US, 1st in population density and higher than average in racial and ethnic diversity. Surprisingly, NJ has no CTSA Hub to coordinate translational and clinical research. Our CTSA Hub focuses on two overarching themes: the heterogeneity of disease pathogenesis and response to treatment, and the value of linking large clinical databases with interventional clinical investigations to identify cause-and-effect and predict therapeutic responses. NJ ACTS will provide: innovative approaches to link information from large databases and electronic health records to inform clinical trial design, execution and analysis; and novel platforms for biomarker discovery using fluorescence in situ hybridization and machine learning to identify unique neural signatures of chronic illness. NJ ACTS will access a large health system with significant member diversity; a rich legacy of community engagement and community-based research platforms; and proven approaches to enhance workforce development in clinical research. With a substantial investment in streamlining research administration and IRB practices at Rutgers and with the inception of NJ ACTS, there exists an unparalleled opportunity for logarithmic growth in clinical research in New Jersey. To build our capacity for participant and clinical interactions as a CTSA Hub, the newly established Trial Accelerator and Recruitment Office will coordinate feasibility assessment, implementation, recruitment, and evaluation of clinical studies. Additionally, our organization of five clinical research units into a cohesive network provides extraordinary expertise in strategic locations to enhance participant recruitment from diverse communities with a particular focus on: children; the elderly; those with serious mental illness or substance abuse issues; low-income individuals served by Medicaid; those with HIV/AIDS; and people of all ages who are minorities, underserved, and victims of health and environmental disparities. With a history of collaboration, partners and affiliates share unique skills, expertise, training and mentoring capabilities that will be greatly amplified within the infrastructure of a CTSA Hub. Princeton and NJIT, without medical schools or hospital affiliates, seeks collaboration with Rutgers to provide clinical research platforms; Rutgers seeks the PU and NJIT expertise in novel informatics platforms, expertise in natural language and ontology, machine learning and cognitive neurosciences. Together NJ ACTS will provide an alliance that will catalyze clinical research and training across New Jersey to improve population health and contribute to the CTSA Consortium.

"New Jersey Alliance for Clinical Translational Science: NJ ACTS Contact PD/PI: Panettieri, Reynold Alexander Project Summary/Abstract Overview Coordinated by Rutgers Biomedical and Health Sciences (RBHS), the New Jersey Alliance for Clinical and Translational Science (NJ ACTS) comprises a consortium with Rutgers and Princeton Universities (PU), NJ Institute for Technology (NJIT), medical, nursing, dental and public health schools, hospitals, community health centers, outpatient practices, industry, policymakers and health information exchanges. All Alliance universities and affiliates have provided substantial resources and contributed to the planning, development and leadership of the consortium. With access to ~7 million people, NJ ACTS serves as a ‘natural laboratory’ for translational and clinical research. With a state population of ~9 million, New Jersey ranks 11th in the US, 1st in population density and higher than average in racial and ethnic diversity. Surprisingly, NJ has no CTSA Hub to coordinate translational and clinical research. Our CTSA Hub focuses on two overarching themes: the heterogeneity of disease pathogenesis and response to treatment, and the value of linking large clinical databases with interventional clinical investigations to identify cause-and-effect and predict therapeutic responses. NJ ACTS will provide: innovative approaches to link information from large databases and electronic health records to inform clinical trial design, execution and analysis; and novel platforms for biomarker discovery using fluorescence in situ hybridization and machine learning to identify unique neural signatures of chronic illness. NJ ACTS will access a large health system with significant member diversity; a rich legacy of community engagement and community-based research platforms; and proven approaches to enhance workforce development in clinical research. With a substantial investment in streamlining research administration and IRB practices at Rutgers and with the inception of NJ ACTS, there exists an unparalleled opportunity for logarithmic growth in clinical research in New Jersey. To build our capacity for participant and clinical interactions as a CTSA Hub, the newly established Trial Accelerator and Recruitment Office will coordinate feasibility assessment, implementation, recruitment, and evaluation of clinical studies. Additionally, our organization of five clinical research units into a cohesive network provides extraordinary expertise in strategic locations to enhance participant recruitment from diverse communities with a particular focus on: children; the elderly; those with serious mental illness or substance abuse issues; low-income individuals served by Medicaid; those with HIV/AIDS; and people of all ages who are minorities, underserved, and victims of health and environmental disparities. With a history of collaboration, partners and affiliates share unique skills, expertise, training and mentoring capabilities that will be greatly amplified within the infrastructure of a CTSA Hub. Princeton and NJIT, without medical schools or hospital affiliates, seeks collaboration with Rutgers to provide clinical research platforms; Rutgers seeks the PU and NJIT expertise in novel informatics platforms, expertise in natural language and ontology, machine learning and cognitive neurosciences. Together NJ ACTS will provide an alliance that will catalyze clinical research and training across New Jersey to improve population health and contribute to the CTSA Consortium.

"Academy of Aphasia Research and Training Symposium PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The annual Academy of Aphasia meeting is the premier conference for researchers in the field of language processing and aphasia. Since the first meeting in 1963, this international meeting has brought together an interdisciplinary group of linguists, psychologists, neurologists, and speech-language pathologists to discuss the latest research in the field of aphasia, including theoretical, clinical, and rehabilitation aspects of this language disorder. The topics at the conference range widely but almost always cover all aspects of language processing including phonological processing, lexical-semantic processing, syntactic processing, orthographic processing, bilingualism, computational modeling, non-invasive and invasive brain imaging, language recovery, neuroplasticity, and rehabilitation. In this proposal, we aim to include two special initiatives that will take place during the annual academy of aphasia conference. The first initiative involves a formal mentoring program for young investigators entering the field of aphasia research. In this program, selected student/post-doctoral fellows from interdisciplinary backgrounds who are first authors at the conference are paired with a mentor. This mentor will provide specific feedback about the fellow's presentation and general mentorship to the fellow about research and academic careers. This program is currently occurring as part of the conference and has been growing at the annual meeting with very positive feedback. Additionally, a formal mentoring meeting will allow a structured format for discussion about a career in aphasia research. The second initiative will be a three hour seminar (New Frontiers in Aphasia Research) that covers the background and approach of a state of the art methodology (e.g., fNIRS, graph theoretical metric, machine learning approaches) that has an application to the study of aphasia. These workshops will be recorded and, consequently, uploaded to the academy website/youtube channel for dissemination to aphasia researchers and the public. This workshop will allow conference attendees to understand the conceptual and methodological aspect of a particular scientific approach that can be implemented in their study of aphasia. Given the highly interdisciplinary nature of aphasia research, these workshops will bridge the communication between aphasia researchers and scientists and experts who have developed new approaches to study the brain. This meeting already allows a valuable opportunity for cross-pollination of research ideas and will now provide a platform for the training the next generation of scientists interested in pursuing the nature of aphasia and associated language disorders in adults. PROJECT NARRATIVE Approximately 100,000 individuals suffer from aphasia each year. The academy of aphasia is an organization of clinicians, scientists and practitioners who study this communication disorder and develop interventions to treat individuals with aphasia. The members comprise a very interdisciplinary group of linguists, psychologists, speech and language clinicians, neurologists and neuroscientists. The annual academy of aphasia meeting is the premier venue to share state of the art methodologies for application in the study of aphasia to improve the research in the development of diagnosis and treatment approaches to alleviate aphasia. This conference is also the ideal venue to educate and train the next generation of aphasia researchers who are well trained from a theoretical, technical and clinical standpoint and are committed to expand the impact of research in aphasia.",Academy of Aphasia Research and Training Symposium,9944489,R13DC017375,"['Academy', 'Adult', 'Aphasia', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Chicago', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Committee Membership', 'Communication', 'Communication impairment', 'Computer Models', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Discipline', 'Educational workshop', 'Feedback', 'Fellowship', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Governing Board', 'Grant', 'Graph', 'Hour', 'Image', 'Individual', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Language', 'Language Disorders', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Linguistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuscripts', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders', 'Nature', 'Neurologic', 'Neurologist', 'Neuronal Plasticity', 'Neurosciences', 'Non-aphasic', 'Orthography', 'Outcome', 'Pathologist', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Production', 'Psychologist', 'Psychology', 'Publishing', 'Reading', 'Recovery', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Support', 'Research Training', 'Rest', 'Retrieval', 'Scientist', 'Secure', 'Speech', 'Speech Pathologist', 'Speech Perception', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'Students', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training and Education', 'Transcranial magnetic stimulation', 'Travel', 'Videotape', 'Work', 'Writing', 'base', 'bilingualism', 'career', 'career networking', 'experience', 'frontier', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'interest', 'language processing', 'lexical', 'meetings', 'member', 'neuroimaging', 'next generation', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'outcome forecast', 'phonology', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'semantic processing', 'success', 'symposium', 'syntax', 'tenure track', 'web site']",NIDCD,BOSTON UNIVERSITY (CHARLES RIVER CAMPUS),R13,2020,39939,-0.03879690426050741
"An Informatics Framework for Discovery and Ascertainment of Drug-Supplement Interactions Most U.S. adults (68%) take dietary supplements (DS) and there is increasing evidence of drug-supplement interactions (DSIs); our ability to readily identify interactions between DS with prescription medications is currently very limited. To optimize the safe use of DS, there remains a critical and unmet need for informatics methods to detect DSIs. Our rationale is that an innovative informatics framework to discover potential DSIs from the large scale of biomedical literature will enable a new line of research for targeted DSI validation and will also significantly narrow the range of DSIs that must be further explored. Our long-term goal is to use informatics approaches to enhance DSI clinical research and translate its findings to clinical practice ultimately via clinical decision support systems. The objective of this application is to develop an informatics framework to enable the discovery of DSIs by creating a DS terminology and mining scientific evidence from the biomedical literature. Towards these objectives, we propose the following specific aims: (1) Compile a comprehensive DS terminology using online resources; and (2) Discover potential DSIs from the biomedical literature. The successful accomplishment of this project will deliver a novel informatics paradigm and resources for identifying most clinically significant DSI signals and their biological mechanisms. This information is critical to subsequent efforts aimed at improving patient safety and efficacy of therapeutic interventions. The results from this study are imperative in order to achieve the ultimate goal of reducing an individual’s risk of potential DSIs. PROJECT NARRATIVE This research will address a critical and unmet need to conduct large-scale clinical research in drug-supplement interactions (DSIs) and improve evidence bases for healthcare practice.

"Neuroscience Gateway to Enable Dissemination of Computational And Data Processing Tools And Software. Abstract (Proposal title: Neuroscience Gateway to Enable Dissemination of Computational and Data Processing Tools and Software.): This proposal presents a focused plan for expanding the capabilities of the Neuroscience Gateway (NSG) to meet the evolving needs of neuroscientists engaged in computationally intensive research. The NSG project began in 2012 with support from the NSF. Its initial goal was to catalyze progress in computational neuroscience by reducing technical and administrative barriers that neuroscientists faced in large scale modeling projects involving tools and software which require and run efficiently on high performance computing (HPC) resources. NSG's success is reflected in the facts that (1) its base of registered users has grown continually since it started operation in early 2013 (more than 800 at present), (2) every year the NSG team successfully acquires ever larger allocations of supercomputer time (recently more than 10,000,000 core hours/year) on academic HPC resources of the Extreme Science and Engineering Discovery (XSEDE – that coordinates NSF supercomputer centers) program by writing proposals that go through an extremely competitive peer review process, and (3) it has contributed to large number of publications and Ph.D thesis. In recent years experimentalists, cognitive neuroscientists and others have begun using NSG for brain image data processing, data analysis and machine learning. NSG now provides over 20 tools on HPC resources for modeling, simulation and data processing. While NSG is currently well used by the neuroscience community, there is increasing interest from that community in applying it to a wider range of tasks than originally conceived. For example, some are trying to use it as an environment for dissemination of lab-developed tools, even though NSG is not suitable for that use because of delays from the batch queue wait times of production HPC resources, and lack of features and resources for an interactive, graphical, and collaborative environment needed for tool development, benchmarking and testing. “Forced” use of NSG for development and dissemination makes NSG's operators a “person-in-the-middle” bottleneck in the process. Another issue is that newly developed data processing tools require high throughput computing (HTC) usage mode, as opposed to HPC, but currently NSG does not provide access to compute resources suitable for HTC. Additionally, data processing workflows require features such as the ability to transfer large size data, process shared data, and visualize output results, which are not currently available on NSG. The work we propose will enhance NSG by adding the features that it needs to be a suitable and efficient dissemination environment for lab-developed neuroscience tools to the broader neuroscience community. This will allow tool developers to disseminate their lab-developed tools on NSG taking advantage of the current functionalities that are being well served on NSG for the last six years such as a growing user base, an easy user interface, an open environment, the ability to access and run jobs on powerful compute resources, availability of free supercomputer time, a well-established training and outreach program, and a functioning user support system. All of these well-functioning features of NSG will make it an ideal environment for dissemination and use of lab-developed computational and data processing neuroscience tools. The Neuroscience Gateway (NSG) was first implemented to enable large scale computational modeling of brain cells and circuits used to study neural function in health and disease. This new project extends NSG's utility to support development, dissemination and use of new tools by the neuroscience community for analyzing enormous data sets produced by advanced experimental methods in neuroscience.",Neuroscience Gateway to Enable Dissemination of Computational And Data Processing Tools And Software.,10019388,U24EB029005,"['Behavioral', 'Benchmarking', 'Brain imaging', 'Cells', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Computer Models', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Correlations', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Education', 'Education and Outreach', 'Educational workshop', 'Electroencephalography', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Foundations', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'High Performance Computing', 'Hour', 'Human Resources', 'Image', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurophysiology - biologic function', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Occupations', 'Output', 'Peer Review', 'Persons', 'Process', 'Production', 'Psychologist', 'Publications', 'Reaction Time', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Running', 'Science', 'Software Tools', 'Students', 'Support System', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Wait Time', 'Work', 'Workload', 'Writing', 'base', 'bioimaging', 'brain cell', 'collaborative environment', 'computational neuroscience', 'computerized data processing', 'computing resources', 'data sharing', 'image processing', 'interest', 'models and simulation', 'open data', 'operation', 'outreach program', 'programs', 'response', 'success', 'supercomputer', 'tool', 'tool development', 'trend', 'webinar']",NIBIB,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",U24,2020,381282,-0.006902014261094426
"The University of Iowa Clinical and Translational Science Award ABSTRACT The Institute for Clinical and Translational Science (ICTS) at the University of Iowa (UI) was established by the Board of Regents to realize three objectives – first, to lead the development of translational science at the UI; second, to advance translational science as a distinct academic discipline; and third, to disseminate capacities in translational science across the State of Iowa. This mandate enabled us to tackle large problems affecting translational science that required institutional solutions, such as transforming regulatory processes for human subjects research, developing an informatics infrastructure for integrating electronic medical record and other health care data, establishing bi-directional relationships with community organizations, and revitalizing the pipeline of well trained clinical and translational researchers. Iowa is a rural state, which brings special health care needs and challenges. We have used these rural considerations as a catalyst for driving our approach to clinical and translational research pushing our teams to develop strategies to engage rural populations of all ages and backgrounds and to create new approaches that overcome the geographic barriers in a rural state. We are capitalizing on our established community practice networks of family physicians, clinics, school nurses and pharmacists. We utilize e Health/ e Learning platforms in novel ways and will test the efficacy of these new methods of engagement. As we move research “Beyond Our Borders,” we have created methods to capture real-time, real-life data from the home and to correlate this environmentally specific, comprehensive data to human performance. The ICTS is engaging with other CTSA hubs and national CTR systems to empirically test different approaches and to develop the evidence base of proven strategies for accelerating translation that can be more broadly disseminated. Though distance and rurality drive our approaches, the strategies that we develop are simply new and potentially better ways to generate broad representation and improved participation by patients, healthcare teams and academicians. Through our local, state and national partnerships, UI and the ICTS are poised to move clinical and translational discovery rapidly into healthcare practice in a variety of clinical settings. PROJECT NARRATIVE The mission of the University of Iowa Institute for Clinical and Translational Science (ICTS) is to accelerate translational science through programs to develop the translational workforce, promote the engagement of community members and other stakeholders, to promote research integration across the lifespan, and to catalyze innovative clinical and translational research. The ongoing development of collaborative data-based infrastructure and services is a central tenant to achieving this mission. The goals of this proposal are: for Iowa to join the N3C partnership, contributing data in an effective method that evolves and improves over time, to enable Iowa researchers to leverage the N3C data resource in their research and to leverage the N3C framework for other areas of research in the future.",The University of Iowa Clinical and Translational Science Award,10201104,UL1TR002537,"['Affect', 'Age', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Automobile Driving', 'Award', 'COVID-19', 'Caring', 'Center for Translational Science Activities', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Clinical and Translational Science Awards', 'Clinics and Hospitals', 'Communities', 'Community Practice', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Data Element', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'E-learning', 'Emergency Situation', 'Family Physicians', 'Future', 'Genomics', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Human Subject Research', 'Image', 'Infrastructure', 'Institutes', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'Iowa', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical Care Team', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Patient Participation', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacists', 'Phenotype', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resources', 'Rural', 'Rural Health', 'Rural Population', 'School Nursing', 'Services', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Transfer Agreement', 'Translational Research', 'Translations', 'Universities', 'Work', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'catalyst', 'clinical decision support', 'cohort', 'collaborative approach', 'community organizations', 'coronavirus disease', 'data acquisition', 'data enclave', 'data exchange', 'data resource', 'data sharing', 'data warehouse', 'efficacy testing', 'evidence base', 'health management', 'improved', 'informatics infrastructure', 'innovation', 'interest', 'member', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'pandemic disease', 'phenotypic data', 'programs', 'rurality', 'social determinants', 'support tools', 'translational scientist']",NCATS,UNIVERSITY OF IOWA,UL1,2020,98933,-0.013844843726264358
"Carolina Population Center PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The Carolina Population Center requests infrastructure support that will advance population dynamics research at CPC by increasing research impact, innovation, and productivity, supporting the development of junior scientists, and reducing the administrative burden on scientists. Infrastructure support will advance science in three primary research areas: Sexuality, Reproduction, Fertility, and Families; Population, Health, and the Environment; and Inequality, Mobility, Disparities, and Well-Being. Much of the research at CPC draws on large publicly available longitudinal data sets that our faculty have designed and collected, including the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health, the China Health and Nutrition Survey, newer surveys associated with the Transfer Project, and the Study of the Tsunami Aftermath and Recovery, all of which will continue to be important in work related to our primary research areas over the next five years. These projects embody several themes that have guided research at CPC since the Center's inception. These themes, which will continue to shape our work, are the importance of life course processes and longitudinal data, multi-level processes and measurement of context, interventions and natural experiments as means of learning about causal processes, and the relevance of sociodemographic variables such as age, gender, race- ethnicity, and socioeconomic status for disparities in health and well-being. By embedding these themes, our projects provide data that enable us to address barriers that otherwise impede progress in the population sciences generally, and in our primary research areas in particular. We request support for three cores which in combination will provide an institutional infrastructure that will push populations dynamics research forward by empowering CPC faculty to tackle challenging questions using state of the art measurement techniques and methods. The Administrative Core plans activities that maintain a stimulating intellectual community, streamlines administrative processes so that scientists can focus on research, coordinates activities of the Cores so that services are offered efficiently, and communicates information about research and data more broadly. The Development Core supports early stage investigators and other faculty with exciting new ideas through multiple mechanisms: workshops, access to technical expertise in measurement, and seed grants. The Research Services Core enables scientists to address complex and important population research issues by providing access to state-of-the-art research tools and professional support for programming, survey development, and analysis. NARRATIVE This project will provide infrastructure support for a cutting edge program of research on population dynamics at the Carolina Population Center. Research at the Center will analyze state-of-the art data to address fundamental questions regarding fertility, adolescent health, and links between the environment and health.

"A Multigenerational Longitudinal Panel for Aging Research Summary/Abstract This project will construct a Multigenerational Longitudinal Panel (IPUMS-MLP) of unprecedented scale and scope. Using cutting-edge automatic record linkage technology and drawing on complete count U.S. census data available from IPUMS for the period 1850 to 1940, the project will construct millions of individual life histories and trace millions of families over multiple generations. This infrastructure will provide the most comprehensive view of long-run changes in life-course dynamics available for any place in the world and will transform our understanding of processes of population aging. The work will require significant innovation and new technical infrastructure to accommodate the massive scale of the database. These data will allow investigators to directly observe changes in aging processes and life-course transitions during the period in which U.S. society was being transformed by industrialization, urbanization, immigration, demographic transition, and economic collapse. Investigators will be able to follow individuals over time to evaluate the impact of early-life conditions on later outcomes, trace life-course transitions into adulthood and old age, and observe family change over multiple generations. IPUMS-MLP will enrich existing aging surveys by providing data on multiple generations of forebears of survey respondents; likewise, it will enrich existing historical databases by enabling them to connect with descendants across multiple generations. Leveraging billions of dollars of federal investments in census data and transactional records from a variety of administrative sources, this project is a highly cost-effective use of scarce resources to develop shared infrastructure for research, education, and policy-making on health and aging. Project Narrative The proposed work is directly relevant to the core mission of the Population and Social Processes branch of NIA: the new data will advance fundamental knowledge about the causes and consequences of changes in health and well-being of the older population and will support research on the effects of public policies, social institutions, and environmental conditions on the health, well-being, and functioning of people, both over the life course and in their later years. For example, the data will enable examinations of the impact of lead exposure to late onset Alzheimer’s disease, the socioeconomic and health effects of early-life income support, intergenerational transmission of health and wellbeing over multiple generations, and the impact of early-life cognitive capacity on later-life health and economic outcomes.",A Multigenerational Longitudinal Panel for Aging Research,9984216,R01AG057679,"['Adult', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Big Data', 'Censuses', 'Characteristics', 'Communities', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Security', 'Databases', 'Demographic Transitions', 'Economics', 'Education', 'Elderly', 'Exposure to', 'Family', 'Family member', 'Future', 'Genealogy', 'Generations', 'Health', 'Household', 'Immigration', 'Income', 'Individual', 'Industrialization', 'Infrastructure', 'Institution', 'Investments', 'Knowledge', 'Late Onset Alzheimer Disease', 'Life', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Link', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Military Personnel', 'Mission', 'Names', 'Neighborhoods', 'Older Population', 'Outcome', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Persons', 'Policy Making', 'Population', 'Population Process', 'Process', 'Public Policy', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Support', 'Resources', 'Respondent', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Selection Bias', 'Social Processes', 'Social Security', 'Societies', 'Source', 'Surveys', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Urbanization', 'War', 'Weight', 'Woman', 'Work', 'aging population', 'base', 'cognitive capacity', 'cost effective', 'data curation', 'data integration', 'data quality', 'economic outcome', 'experience', 'health economics', 'improved', 'innovation', 'intergenerational', 'lead exposure', 'life history', 'longitudinal dataset', 'machine learning algorithm', 'machine learning method', 'novel', 'parallel processing', 'social', 'socioeconomics', 'structured data', 'tool', 'transmission process']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,R01,2020,675029,-0.02434227840371157

"University of Buffalo Clinical and Translational Science Institute The Buffalo Translational Consortium (BTC), which includes the University at Buffalo (UB) health sciences schools, the major healthcare institutions in our region, four key research institutes and five influential community partners, have embarked on a comprehensive strategic plan to build a strong foundation for clinical and translational research in response to our community needs. Buffalo is the second most populous city in New York State and has a rich cultural history. The proportion of underrepresented minorities in Buffalo in 2018 (50%) parallels that projected for the US in 2050, making Buffalo a microcosm of what the US will look like in 30 years. A similar proportion of our population experiences health disparities. The vision for our CTSA hub is to perform innovative research across the translational spectrum to improve the health of our community and the nation. We will develop, test and share novel approaches to engage difficult-to-engage populations and reduce health disparities in our community, which represents a “population of the future”. Guided by our vision, the CTSA has catalyzed a transformation of our environment since our CTSA was first funded in August 2015 with remarkable growth in clinical and translational research. Further, in just the past year, the UB medical school has moved into a spectacular new building and our clinical partner, Kaleida Health, the largest healthcare system in the region, opened the new Oishei Children’s Hospital, both on the Buffalo Niagara Medical Campus and connected to the Clinical and Translational Research Center devoted entirely to clinical and translational research that opened in 2012. This rapid and continuing trajectory of growth in healthcare and research in the region has resulted in a new 21st century Academic Health Center with healthcare, medical education and clinical and translational research on one campus in the heart of Buffalo, creating a foundation to enhance the impact of our CTSA even further. While launching our CTSA, we have prioritized participation in the national consortium through hosting and testing Innovation Labs as a team science tool, working with multiple hubs on initiatives to solve translational research barriers and sharing tools that we have developed with the CTSA consortium, including novel health informatics tools. Our CTSA has five ambitious but achievable aims, including: 1) Accelerate innovative translational research with teams that engage communities, regional stakeholders and the national consortium; 2) Train an excellent, diverse workforce to advance translation of discoveries; 3) Enhance inclusion of special populations across the lifespan and difficult-to-engage populations; 4) Streamline clinical research processes focusing on quality and efficiency with emphasis on multisite studies; 5) Develop, test and share biomedical informatics tools to integrate data from multiple sources to speed translation. Guided by our vision to perform research to improve the health of our community and the nation, we will continue our momentum to expand translational research, train our diverse workforce, streamline processes, engage our community, and actively contribute to the national consortium. The University at Buffalo Clinical and Translational Science Institute (CTSI) is the coordinating center of the Buffalo Translational Consortium, which includes the region's premier research, educational and clinical institutions with influential community partners.

"Tufts Clinical and Translational Science Institute (N3C Supplement) PROJECT SUMMARY Tufts Clinical and Translational Science Institute (Tufts CTSI) is based on the conviction that authentic involvement of the entire spectrum of clinical and translational research (CTR) is critical to fulfilling the promise of biomedical science for meeting the public's needs. This includes not only from translation from bench to bedside (T1 translation), but also, crucially for having health impact, translation into effective clinical practice (T2), care delivery and public health (T3), and health policy (T4). Advances on all of these fronts is increasingly dependent on making effective use of scientific data from multiple domains. The COVID-19 global emergency presents both an immediate challenge and an opportunity to progress on important data sharing aims emphasized by NIH. In response, NCATS and the Centers for Translational Science Award (CTSA) hubs, several HHS agencies, and other partnering organizations have committed to developing a next-generation repository for clinical data related to COVID-19, the National COVID Cohort Collaborative (N3C), as a means of accelerating global research into the disease and aiding the development of diagnostics, therapeutics, and effective vaccines. The N3C initiative's goal of improving the efficiency and accessibility of analyses with clinical data is consistent with the primary informatics objectives of Tufts CTSI, which am to reduce barriers to the integration of healthcare and research by providing innovative systems, data repositories, and analytical tools, and by enabling greater exchange and collaboration through interoperability, standardization, and resource sharing. In- line with shared objectives, in this supplement we seek to contribute to the N3C initiative as a data provider and thought partner through the following specific aims: (1) continue to play an important role providing tools and resources for N3C's analytics platform; and (2) ensure Tufts CTSI's Informatics Program has sufficient staff and technical resources to continue to provide COVID-specific patient data from our hub to the N3C repository. PROJECT NARRATIVE An integrated, continuously updated data repository and a platform of putting powerful analytics capabilities at the disposal of the scientific community can generate insights into COVID-19 and accelerate the development of effective treatments and vaccines to counter the disease.

"The Center for Innovation in Intensive Longitudinal Studies (CIILS) PROJECT SUMMARY Significance. The Intensive Longitudinal Behavior Network (ILHBN) provides an unprecedented opportunity to advance and shape the future landscape of health behavior science and related intervention practice. The proposed Research Coordinating Center, the Center for Innovation in Intensive Longitudinal Studies (CIILS), housed at the Pennsylvania State University (Penn State), will bring together an interdisciplinary team to synergistically support and coordinate research activities across a diverse portfolio of anticipated U01 projects to accomplish the Network’s larger goal of sustained innovation in the use of intensive longitudinal data (ILD) and associated methods in the study of health behavior change, and in informing prevention and intervention designs. Innovation. The proposed organizational structure of the ILHBN as a small-world network is motivated by our team’s collective decades of experience with multidisciplinary and multi-site collaborations, and is designed to facilitate information flow, collective decision making, and coordination of goals and effort within the ILHBN. Approach. CIILS consists of five Cores with expertise in management of multi-site projects and coordinating centers (Administrative Core); development of novel methods for analysis of ILD (Methods Core); ILD collection, harmonization, sharing, security, as well as collection of digital footprints (Data Core); ILD design, harmonization and instrumentation support (Design Core); and integration of health behavior theories, translation, and implementation of within-person health preventions/interventions (Theory Core). Key personnel with rich and complementary expertise are supported by a roster of advisory Co-Is at Penn State and distributed consultants who are leaders and innovators in their respective fields. Institutional support and contributed staff time by Penn State provide robust infrastructure, expertise, and “boots on the ground” to support the operation and coordination activities of ILHBN; and a wealth of additional resources to elevate and broaden the collective impacts of the Network.

"Modeling the Incompleteness and Biases of Health Data Modeling the Incompleteness and Biases of Health Data Researchers are increasingly working to “mine” health data to derive new medical knowledge. Unlike experimental data that are collected per a research protocol, the primary role of clinical data is to help clinicians care for patients, so the procedures for its collection are not often systematic. Thus, missing and/or biased data can hinder medical knowledge discovery and data mining efforts. Existing efforts for missing health data imputation often focus on only cross-sectional correlation (e.g., correlation across subjects or across variables) but neglect autocorrelation (e.g., correlation across time points). Moreover, they often focus on modeling incompleteness but neglect the biases in health data. Modeling both the incompleteness and bias may contribute to better understanding of health data and better support clinical decision making. We propose a novel framework of Bias-Aware Missing data Imputation with Cross-sectional correlation and Autocorrelation (BAMICA), and leverage clinical notes to better inform the methods that will otherwise rely on structured health data only. In addition to evaluating its imputation accuracy, we will apply the proposed framework to assist in downstream tasks such as predictive modeling for multiple outcomes across a diverse range of clinical and cohort study datasets. Aim 1 introduces the MICA framework to jointly consider cross-sectional correlation and auto-correlation. In Aim 2, we will augment MICA to be bias-aware (hence BAMICA) to account for biases stemmed from multiple roots such as healthcare process and use them as features in imputing missing health data. This augmentation is achieved by a novel recurrent neural network architecture that keeps track of both evolution of health data variables and bias factors. In Aim 3, we will supplement unstructured clinical notes to structured health data for modeling incompleteness and biases using a novel architecture of graph neural network on top of memory network. We will apply graph neural networks to process clinical notes in order to learn proper representations as input to the memory networks for imputation and downstream predictive modeling tasks. Depending on the clinical problem and data availability, not all modules may be needed. Thus our proposed BAMICA framework is designed to be flexible and consists of selectable modules to meet some or all of the above needs. In summary, our proposal bridges a key knowledge gap in jointly modeling incompleteness and biases in health data and utilizes unstructured clinical notes to supplement and augment such modeling in order to better support predictive modeling and clinical decision making. We will demonstrate generalizability by experimenting on four large clinical and cohort study datasets, and by scaling up to the eMERGE network spanning 11 institutions nationwide. We will disseminate the open-source framework. The principled and flexible framework generated by this project will bring significant methodological advancement and have a direct impact on enhancing discovery from health data.

"WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE UNDIAGNOSED DISEASES NETWORK CLINICAL SITE 1.0 PROJECT SUMMARY The scientific premise of this application is that the individualized translational research process of the Undiagnosed Diseases Network (UDN) developed during Phase I is scalable and that its impact on patients, families, and disease discovery can be advanced and sustained by addition of a Clinical Site at Washington University School of Medicine (WUSM). WUSM represents a large academic medical center that is fully integrated with world-renowned basic science capabilities and demonstrated expertise in a gene first approach for patients with undiagnosed diseases. The highly collaborative clinical and biomedical research culture at WUSM promotes interactions within and across Departments, with institutional genomic, clinical, computational, and model system experts, and with colleagues regionally, nationally, and internationally. These interactions support recruitment, selection, evaluation, diagnosis discovery, and follow up of pediatric and adult patients with undiagnosed diseases through both established networks and individual referrals. Building on this infrastructure, WUSM faculty and staff will advance the success of the UDN in diagnosing and managing disease in undiagnosed patients by, first, using, refining, and improving protocols designed during Phase I of the UDN for comprehensive, timely clinical evaluations of 30 undiagnosed patients annually. Secondly, we will collect, securely store, and share standardized, high-quality clinical and laboratory data including genotyping, phenotyping, and documentation of environmental exposures and promote an integrated and collaborative community across the UDN and among laboratory and clinical investigators focused on defining the pathophysiology, cell biologic, and molecular mechanisms that cause these difficult to diagnose diseases.

"Microdata for Analysis of Early Life Conditions, Health, and Population Project Summary This project will enhance and develop the only source of data that provides core information about work, education, income, and migration for the entire U.S. population. This unique resource allows us to observe today's late-life population when they were young. This allows a prospective view of the impact of early-life environments and socioeconomic status on health and well-being in later life. The massive database describes the characteristics of all 133 million persons who resided in the United States in 1940. The data have been available for only a brief period, but are already having a profound impact on scientific research. They are the primary data source for at least 19 sponsored projects, including nine funded by NIH and seven funded by NSF. Through May 2017, 104 investigators had produced 95 papers based on the data, including 22 articles, four books, three PhD dissertations, and 66 working papers. This project will improve the quality and usability of the database by correcting transcription errors; improving the coding, editing, and allocation of key variables; and introducing new data dissemination tools designed to simplify access to the data. The project will undertake three major activities to meet these objectives. 1. Incorporate new verified census information on name, age, sex, family relationship, race, marital status,  birthplace, and residence five years ago. 2. Improve coding, editing, and allocation for geographic variables, migration, occupation, and numerically-  coded variables such as income. 3. Apply new technologies to democratize access to the data through new data access tools and a virtual data  enclave for a restricted version of the data that contains names. This project is a highly cost-effective use of scarce resources to develop shared infrastructure for research, education, and policy-making on health and aging. The proposed improvement of data quality is urgent, and will provide a resource of unprecedented power for understanding the effects of public policies, social institutions, and environmental conditions on the health, well-being, and functioning of people, both over the life course and in their later years. Narrative This project will develop data for prospective analysis of the impact of early-life circumstances and environment on health outcomes in late life, including Alzheimer's disease. The proposed improvement of data quality is urgent, and will provide a resource of unprecedented power for understanding the effects of public policies, social institutions, and environmental conditions on the health, well-being, and functioning of people, both over the life course and in their later years.

"Washington University School of Medicine Undiagnosed Diseases Network Clinical Site 1.0 PROJECT SUMMARY The scientific premise of this application is that the individualized translational research process of the Undiagnosed Diseases Network (UDN) developed during Phase I is scalable and that its impact on patients, families, and disease discovery can be advanced and sustained by addition of a Clinical Site at Washington University School of Medicine (WUSM). WUSM represents a large academic medical center that is fully integrated with world-renowned basic science capabilities and demonstrated expertise in a gene first approach for patients with undiagnosed diseases. The highly collaborative clinical and biomedical research culture at WUSM promotes interactions within and across Departments, with institutional genomic, clinical, computational, and model system experts, and with colleagues regionally, nationally, and internationally. These interactions support recruitment, selection, evaluation, diagnosis discovery, and follow up of pediatric and adult patients with undiagnosed diseases through both established networks and individual referrals. Building on this infrastructure, WUSM faculty and staff will advance the success of the UDN in diagnosing and managing disease in undiagnosed patients by, first, using, refining, and improving protocols designed during Phase I of the UDN for comprehensive, timely clinical evaluations of 30 undiagnosed patients annually. Secondly, we will collect, securely store, and share standardized, high-quality clinical and laboratory data including genotyping, phenotyping, and documentation of environmental exposures and promote an integrated and collaborative community across the UDN and among laboratory and clinical investigators focused on defining the pathophysiology, cell biologic, and molecular mechanisms that cause these difficult to diagnose diseases. Thirdly, the WUSM UDN Clinical Site will propose a bioinformatics plan for leveraging institutional infrastructure and expertise to develop innovative strategies to improve discovery of pathogenic variants. Fourthly, the assessment, dissemination, outreach, and training plan will accelerate assessment and dissemination of data, protocols, consent materials, and methods, availability of educational and outreach materials for participants, clinicians, and other researchers, engagement of underrepresented minorities, and training for students, fellows, staff, and faculty in collaboration with WUSM’s Clinical and Translational Science Award infrastructure.

"Longitudinal and Intergenerational Determinants of Aging and Mortality ABSTRACT  Some of the most important open questions in aging relate to the impact of longitudinal and intergenerational factors. But documenting the role of early-life and intergenerational determinants of health and aging is limited by the dearth of large-scale micro-data containing this information. This is especially true for understudied populations such as women and minority groups.  Our research objective is to add critical information on cause of death to the new large-scale data resource, the Longitudinal, Intergenerational Family Electronic Micro-database (LIFE-M). Funded by the National Science Foundation, LIFE-M links millions of vital records (birth, marriage, and death certificates) to decennial censuses over four generations and 120 years for five states. LIFE-M is a representative sample of cohorts aging and dying in the last 25 years of the 20th century and includes crucial early-life and intergenerational information. Enhancing the LIFE-M with cause of death will facilitate path-breaking research on the relationship of longevity and cause of death with demographic, socio-economic, and early-life environmental factors for family networks across four generations.  We will achieve this objective by pursuing the following specific aims:  (1) We will use new “Smart Indexing” technology to digitize and cross-validate hand-written cause-of-death information;  (2) We will link digitized causes of death to the LIFE-M infrastructure and create extensive documentation for  this new variable for public use; and  (3) We will publicly release the cause-of-death variable and documentation with the LIFE-M dataset, meta-  data, and supporting documentation on ICPSR in 2020.  The proposed project will also have broader impacts. In addition to contributing a significant new data resource that can be added to Minnesota Population Center's historical linked censuses and the Census Longitudinal Infrastructure Project (CLIP), this project's methodological innovations in script digitization will enhance on-going and future data infrastructure initiatives. Both contributions promise to transform the research frontier in population health and aging in the United States. PROJECT NARRATIVE  This project contributes to public health knowledge by adding cause-of-death information to a new intergenerational and longitudinal dataset (LIFE-M). These data will allow much more research on the long- term determinants of health and aging, including a deeper understanding the intergenerational and early-life origins of later-life diseases and mortality in today's aging population.",Longitudinal and Intergenerational Determinants of Aging and Mortality,9829517,R01AG057704,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'American', 'Biogenesis', 'Birth', 'Birth Records', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cause of Death', 'Censuses', 'Cessation of life', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Complement', 'Cost Savings', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Death Certificates', 'Demography', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Documentation', 'Economics', 'Elderly', 'Enrollment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemiology', 'Exposure to', 'Family', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Hand', 'Handwriting', 'Health', 'Health Campaign', 'Health Resources', 'Health and Retirement Study', 'Hypertension', 'Image', 'Immigrant', 'Income', 'Individual', 'Inequality', 'Infant', 'Infrastructure', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Link', 'Longevity', 'Maiden Name', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Marriage', 'Medicare/Medicaid', 'Metadata', 'Methodology', 'Michigan', 'Minnesota', 'Minority Groups', 'Names', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Price', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Role', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Sanitation', 'Science', 'Subgroup', 'Surveys', 'Technology', 'Toxin', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Vaccines', 'Water', 'Woman', 'Women&apos', 's Group', 'aging population', 'base', 'cohort', 'convolutional neural network', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'data infrastructure', 'data resource', 'early-life nutrition', 'ethnic minority population', 'frontier', 'health knowledge', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'intergenerational', 'large scale data', 'longitudinal dataset', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mortality', 'panel study of income dynamics', 'population health', 'population survey', 'programs', 'racial and ethnic', 'response', 'socioeconomics', 'suicide rate']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2020,307227,-0.012761968065898998
"Overall: Eunice Kennedy Shriver Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities Research Center at Vanderbilt Founded in 1965 as one of the original Intellectual and Developmental Disorders Research Centers (IDDRC), the Vanderbilt Kennedy Center (VKC) IDDRC serves as the central nexus across Vanderbilt for interdisciplinary research, communication, and training in intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD). The VKC IDDRC serves as a trans-institutional institute that brings together over 200 faculty from 38 departments in 10 schools at Vanderbilt. The VKC’s mission to facilitate discoveries that inform best practices to improve the lives of people with IDD and their families. This mission is met by leveraging our outstanding institutional resources and support, partnering with disability communities, and capitalizing on synergistic interactions across the VKC’s federally-designated centers: the VKC IDDRC, a University Center of Excellence in Developmental Disabilities and a Leadership Education in Neurodevelopmental Disabilities program. The IDDRC as the centerpiece of the VKC is the foundational organizing structure that creates a “Center culture” wherein research and discovery permeates the VKC’s broader training and service activities, thus enhancing the translational research goals of the IDDRC. Demonstrable IDDRC success includes 976 investigator- authored publications and robust NIH funding to Vanderbilt to support IDD-related research ($52.6M in FY20). Harnessing and leveraging this trans-institutional strength to focus on unique challenges in IDD, the overarching goal of the next phase of the IDDRC is to develop precision care for IDD by providing infrastructure and scientific leadership to enable rapid translation of basic discoveries into high- impact IDD interventions and treatments. Three global Aims guide the IDDRC’s work. Aim 1 provides core services to enable and disseminate impactful research on individualizing treatments based upon the causes, mechanisms, and contributing co-morbid sequelae of IDD; Aim 2 focuses on incorporating innovative methods and approaches to enhance multidisciplinary IDD research; and Aim 3 proposes to conduct a signature research project to improve the precision use of antipsychotic medication in people with autism. Across these Aims and five Cores supported by the IDDRC (Administrative, Clinical Translational, Translational Neuroscience, Behavioral Phenotyping, and Data Sciences), three themes permeate our work: (1) recruitment of highly-skilled researchers not currently conducting IDD research (non-traditional researchers); (2) inclusion of IDD participants into research studies that currently do not include IDD (non-traditional subjects); and (3) incorporation of novel scientific approaches and methods (non-traditional approaches). Our IDDRC is ideally posed to enable rapid discovery of precision care approaches by supporting 50 investigators leading 70 research projects (15 from NICHD) and, as highlighted by the Signature Research Project, to promote and implement generative, novel, and impactful research directions, thus meeting the NICHD’s vision of applying newly evolved technologies and approaches to rapidly accelerate the prevention and/or amelioration of IDDs. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: As a group, intellectual and developmental disabilities, including Down syndrome and autism spectrum disorder, have dramatic effects on affected people’s and their caregiver’s lives. Unfortunately, there remains a lack of understanding about what causes these disabilities and, critically, how to treat them with targeted therapies. The Vanderbilt Kennedy Center’s Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities Research Center serves as the hub for Vanderbilt’s research efforts focusing on improving the lives of people with intellectual and developmental disabilities by understanding the causes of these disorders and developing and testing therapies tailored to each individual’s precise needs.",Overall: Eunice Kennedy Shriver Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities Research Center at Vanderbilt,10085550,P50HD103537,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Affect', 'Antipsychotic Agents', 'Basic Science', 'Behavioral', 'Biomedical Research', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Development', 'Developmental Disabilities', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Down Syndrome', 'Education', 'Evaluation', 'Faculty', 'Family', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gap Junctions', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Institutes', 'Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities Research Centers', 'Intellectual functioning disability', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention', 'Leadership', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical Records', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Child Health and Human Development', 'Neurodevelopmental Disability', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacogenetics', 'Phase', 'Pilot Projects', 'Policy Research', 'Prevention', 'Problem behavior', 'Publications', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Schools', 'Series', 'Services', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Translations', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Vision', 'Weight Gain', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'behavioral phenotyping', 'clinical translation', 'comorbidity', 'cost effective', 'developmental disease', 'disability', 'drug-induced weight gain', 'experience', 'image processing', 'implementation science', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'innovation', 'large datasets', 'lectures', 'meetings', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'personalized approach', 'personalized care', 'personalized medicine', 'population based', 'pragmatic trial', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'recruit', 'research study', 'success', 'targeted treatment', 'translational neuroscience', 'trial comparing']",NICHD,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,P50,2020,1387605,-0.02349597014045024
