"Using artificial intelligence to enable early identification and treatment of peripheral artery disease ABSTRACT The purpose of this award is to provide Dr. Elsie Ross, Assistant Professor of Surgery (Vascular Surgery) and Medicine (Biomedical Informatics Research) at Stanford University, the support necessary to transition her from a junior investigator into an independent surgeon-scientist in translational biomedical informatics. Dr. Ross is a vascular surgeon with an advanced degree in health services research and postdoctoral training in biomedical informatics. Her long-term goal is to combine her interdisciplinary training to develop and implement machine learning tools that will enable the delivery of precise, high-value care to patients with cardiovascular diseases. Her career development activities focus on advancing her ability to translate informatics discoveries into viable clinical tools by 1) completing didactic courses to deepen and expand her knowledge of deep learning algorithms, clinical trials and implementation science, 2) designing and conducting her first independent human subjects clinical research study evaluating the performance of machine learning technology, 3) implementing and evaluating the effects of an electronic health record (EHR)-based screening tool to identify latent vascular disease, and 4) strengthening her previous training in cost-effectiveness analysis to enable her future aim of evaluating the associated costs and utility of pro-active, automated disease screening. The candidate has convened a mentorship team that includes Dr. Nigam Shah, a biomedical informatics expert who combines machine learning, text-mining and medical ontologies to enable a learning health care system; Dr. Kenneth Mahaffey a world-expert in cardiovascular clinical trials; and Dr. Paul Heidenreich, an expert in implementation sciences with a focus on the use of EHR interventions to improve care quality for cardiovascular patients and evaluating the cost-effectiveness of new technologies. The research proposal builds on the candidate's prior work with using machine learning and EHR data to evaluate and predict cardiovascular disease outcomes. The candidate now proposes to characterize the performance of machine learning algorithms in identifying patients with peripheral artery disease (PAD) using EHR data (Aim 1), evaluate whether learned classification models perform better than traditional risk factors for identification of undiagnosed PAD in a prospective patient cohort (Aim 2), and implement an EHR-based screening tool to identify patients with undiagnosed PAD and evaluate the diagnosis and treatment effects (Aim 3). Completion of the proposed research will result in a novel, EHR-based screening tool for identification of undiagnosed vascular disease that can decrease PAD-related cardiovascular morbidity and mortality through earlier and more aggressive medical management. This research will also form the basis for an R01 application before the end of the award to conduct a multi-site randomized-controlled clinical trial to evaluate the impact of EHR- based proactive PAD screening. ! ! ! PROJECT NARRATIVE Peripheral artery disease is a prevalent yet under-diagnosed condition that can lead to limb loss, stroke, heart attacks and/or premature death. Work proposed in this grant aims to develop technology using electronic health records and machine learning algorithms to automatically identify patients with undiagnosed peripheral artery disease and recommend treatment. Such technology could improve the health and longevity of patients with peripheral artery disease by ensuring that patients are diagnosed early and appropriately treated.",Using artificial intelligence to enable early identification and treatment of peripheral artery disease,9806796,K01HL148639,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Applications Grants', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Award', 'Awareness', 'Blood Vessels', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cohort Studies', 'Cost Effectiveness Analysis', 'Cost utility', 'Costs and Benefits', 'Current Procedural Terminology Codes', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Early treatment', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Enrollment', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Health Services Research', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Image', 'Informatics', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Limb structure', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medicare', 'Medicine', 'Mentorship', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Noise', 'Notification', 'Ontology', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Peripheral arterial disease', 'Physicians', 'Quality of Care', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Controlled Clinical Trials', 'Recommendation', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Proposals', 'Research Training', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk stratification', 'Scientist', 'Screening procedure', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Site', 'Specialist', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'Surgeon', 'Symptoms', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Vascular Diseases', 'Work', 'analysis pipeline', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'care burden', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical data warehouse', 'clinical implementation', 'cohort', 'computing resources', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'cost outcomes', 'cost-effectiveness evaluation', 'deep learning algorithm', 'design', 'disease diagnosis', 'disorder risk', 'electronic data', 'high risk', 'human subject', 'human very old age (85+)', 'implementation science', 'improved', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mortality', 'new technology', 'novel', 'post-doctoral training', 'premature', 'prevent', 'professor', 'prospective', 'random forest', 'randomized trial', 'recurrent neural network', 'research study', 'screening', 'text searching', 'tool', 'treatment effect']",NHLBI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,K01,2019,162000,0.05077435086601774
"Resource Curation and Evaluation for EHR Note Comprehension Title: Resource Curation and Evaluation for EHR Note Comprehension The American Diabetes Association estimates that over 25.8 million Americans have diabetes. Proper patient self-management is perhaps the most critical and under-exercised element for patients to achieve appropriate glycemic control and thus mitigate complications and comorbid conditions, and implement appropriate preventive strategies (e.g., vaccines, exercise, healthy diet). In previous work we have shown that educating patients by using content in their medical records improved diabetes outcomes and that NoteAid, a multi- module natural language processing system that links medical jargon in electronic health records to definitions, has improved self-reported comprehension. Here we propose to develop NoteAid with a high-quality resource of expert-curated lay definitions and evaluation methods for diabetes patients’ note comprehension. ! !

"Learning Universal Patient Representations from Clinical Text with Hierarchical Recurrent Neural Networks Project Summary In this project we develop new methods for extracting important information from electronic health records based on recurrent neural networks. These methods represent the hierarchical and sequential nature of human language, leverage large scale datasets to make learning sophisticated representations possible, and make use of novel sources of supervision that are available at this scale. The model architecture we propose is a hierarchical recurrent neural network (RNN). This architecture explicitly represents temporality at multiple different time scales, with stacked RNN layers representing words, sentences, paragraphs, and documents. At the word level, the model is trained to predict important pieces of clinical information, such as negation and temporality, using existing labeled data sets. Training for clinical information extraction at the lowest level ensures that the higher-level models have a foundation of medically relevant inputs. We are still left with the challenge of training higher-level networks, because these models require massive amounts of labeled training data to learn. We solve this problem by taking advantage of the temporal aspect of information in an EHR, and having each higher-level recurrent layer train getting supervision from the future. For example, the document RNN is trained to predict billing codes and NLP concept codes that were found in the subsequent document. This source of supervision is scalable, and our preliminary data shows that it is effective at learning how to generate generalizable patient representations. The patient representations that our model learns are shareable across multiple tasks, potentially streamlining EHR-based research by eliminating what was previously a manual step – designing text-based variables to represent patients. We demonstrate a new workflow for text-based EHR research, showing how the same representations can be used for two completely distinct phenotyping tasks. These phenotyping studies make use of high-quality datasets of patients with pulmonary hypertension and autism spectrum disorder at Boston Children’s Hospital. PH is relatively rare, so finding every patient with a phenotyping algorithm is important for clinical research. ASD has several sub-phenotypes, and finding large numbers of patients from each sub- phenotype can help to better understand the mechanisms of ASD. Along with demonstrating the applicability of our representations on these specific clinical research use cases, we incorporate our patient representations into the i2b2 clinical research software, making them available to all clinical investigators using this platform at Boston Children’s Hospital. Project Narrative This project develops methods for extracting universal patient representations from unstructured text in electronic health records. These methods leverage huge amounts of clinical data, recurrent neural network architectures, and novel training techniques to incorporate information at multiple time scales. These methods are evaluated using public datasets to promote reproducibility, and applied to clinical research tasks that extend the knowledge of patients with pulmonary hypertension and autism spectrum disorder at Boston Children’s Hospital.",Learning Universal Patient Representations from Clinical Text with Hierarchical Recurrent Neural Networks,9642922,R01LM012973,"['Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Boston', 'Brain', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Clinical Research', 'Code', 'Comorbidity', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Event', 'Face', 'Felis catus', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Human', 'Human Characteristics', 'Human Resources', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Israel', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Left', 'Linguistics', 'Location', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Patients', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Problem Solving', 'Process', 'Pulmonary Hypertension', 'Rare Diseases', 'Records', 'Recurrence', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Source', 'Statistical Methods', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Technics', 'Uncertainty', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'data resource', 'deep neural network', 'design', 'disease phenotype', 'learning strategy', 'machine translation', 'neural network', 'neural network architecture', 'novel', 'recurrent neural network', 'relating to nervous system']",NLM,BOSTON CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2019,386910,-0.002200010797064017
"Machine Learning to Determine Dynamically Evolving New-Onset Venous Thromboembolic (VTE) Event Risk in Hospitalized Patients Failure to rescue (FTR), a nurse-sensitive national metric of health care quality, refers to death of a hospitalized patient from a treatable complication, and is potentiated by failure to recognize and appropriately respond to early signs of complications. There is a paucity of research examining patient features predictive of FTR complications. Such information could shift the current paradigm of nursing surveillance to earlier recognition, prevention and treatment of FTR complications, thereby saving lives. New-onset venous thromboembolism (VTE), an FTR complication occurring as either a deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or a pulmonary embolism (PE), is the leading cause of preventable hospital death, carrying a high risk of mortality and a national cost burden of $7 billion annually. VTE is a complex disease process involving interactions between clinical risk factors and acquired and/or inherited susceptibilities to thrombosis. Although biomarkers and clinical factors associated with VTE have been identified, clinical manifestations are subtle, presenting gradually over hours to days. Current VTE risk assessment models (RAM), the cornerstone of prevention, have limited utility due to their complexity and lack of reliability, generalizability and external validation. A critical gap in VTE risk modeling research is that while new-onset VTE pathology evolves over the course of hospitalization, no current models incorporate the progressive accrual of dynamic patient data and pattern evolution over time in their modeling approaches. The totality of routinely collected electronic health record (EHR) data is massive in terms of volume, variety, and production at a rapid velocity in real-time. Such big data could be used in machine learning (ML) analytic approaches to process time series clinical data to identify subtle, evolving feature patterns predictive of new-onset VTE and address this gap. This study proposes to assemble a large scale, multi-source, multi-dimensional VTE study dataset, and in tandem, systematically define the EHR data elements associated with a new-onset VTE diagnosis for computable phenotype algorithm development. We will then apply machine learning analytic approaches to baseline and accruing intensive time series clinical data in the curated dataset to develop models identifying data patterns and features predictive of dynamically evolving new-onset VTE in adult hospitalized patients. This proposal aligns with NINR’s strategic vision for nurse scientists to employ new strategies for collecting and analyzing complex big data sets to permit better understanding of the biological underpinnings of health, and improve ways nurses prevent and manage illness. This innovative study and individualized training plan under a strong and well- established team, represents initial steps in the applicant’s research trajectory focused on data science approaches to predict FTR complication risk, and develop, implement and test dynamic RAMs to inform targeted prevention and treatment decisions. Discovering new knowledge informing real-time decision making, nursing surveillance practices and care delivery systems can improve nurse sensitive patient outcomes. PROJECT NARRATIVE Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is the leading cause of preventable hospital death. This study first proposes to develop a reproducible computable phenotype definition for new-onset VTE cohort ascertainment from the electronic health record, and then develop dynamic models for VTE risk assessment through the application of machine learning algorithms to massive electronic health record clinical data repositories. Such models can inform the mechanisms underlying this complex disease and identify subtle pattern changes in a patient’s condition forecasting a VTE event, enabling earlier nurse identification and intervention, and decreasing the development of complications and failure to rescue in hospitalized patients.",Machine Learning to Determine Dynamically Evolving New-Onset Venous Thromboembolic (VTE) Event Risk in Hospitalized Patients,9794015,F31NR018102,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Adverse event', 'Algorithms', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Censuses', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Code', 'Cohort Studies', 'Complex', 'Complication', 'Data', 'Data Element', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Deep Vein Thrombosis', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Discipline of Nursing', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Failure', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Logic', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nurses', 'Pathology', 'Patient Triage', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Production', 'Pulmonary Embolism', 'Quality of Care', 'Readability', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Savings', 'Scientist', 'Selection for Treatments', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Series', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Source', 'Standardization', 'System', 'Testing', 'Thromboembolism', 'Thrombosis', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Failure', 'Validation', 'Venous', 'Vision', 'base', 'care delivery', 'classification algorithm', 'clinical data warehouse', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical risk', 'cohort', 'cost', 'disease phenotype', 'health care quality', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mortality risk', 'multidimensional data', 'prevent']",NINR,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,F31,2019,45016,0.03699590324284152
"Machine Learning of Physiological Waveforms and Electronic Health Record Data to Predict, Diagnose, and Treat Hemodynamic Instability in Surgical Patients Project Summary / Abstract If one could accurately predict who, when and why patients develop cardiorespiratory instability (CRI) during surgery, then effective preemptive treatments could be given to improve postoperative outcome and more effectively use healthcare resources. But signs of shock often occur late once organ injury is already present. The goal of this proposal is to develop, validate, and test real-time intraoperative risk prediction tools based on electronic health record (EHR) data and high-fidelity physiological waveforms to predict CRI and make the databases of intraoperative data and waveforms used for these developments freely accessible. This is extremely relevant because although 5.7 million Americans are admitted to an Intensive Care Units (ICU) in one year, more than 42 millions undergo surgery annually. Previous and ongoing studies conducted in the ICU and in the step down unit have built the architecture to collect real-time high-fidelity physiological waveform data streams and integrate them with patient demographics from the EHR to build large data sets, and derive actionable fused parameters based on machine learning (ML) analytics as well as display information in real time at the bedside to drive clinical decision support (CDS) in the critical care setting. The goal of this proposal is to apply these ML approaches to the complex and time compressed environment of high-risk surgery where greater patient and disease variability exist and shorter period of time is available to deliver truly personalized medicine approaches. The work will be initiated using an already existing annotated intraoperative database from the University of California Irvine including EHR and high-fidelity waveform data. This operating room database already exists and needs only to be extracted. This data will be used for the initial training and development of the ML model that will then be tested on prospectively collected University of California Los Angeles and University of Pittsburgh Medical Center databases. Simultaneously, this approach will use existing knowledge of CRI patterns derived from previous step down unit / intensive care unit cohorts, MIMIC II data, University of California Irvine data, and animal studies to create smart alarms and graphic user interface for clinical decision support based on functional hemodynamic monitoring principles. The next step will then leverage the focus on the issues and strengths of the intraoperative environment, some of which can be listed as: 1) Known patients characteristics before surgery to define pre-stress baseline, allowing functional hemodynamic monitoring stress evaluations, preconditioning, and other preoperative calibrations, 2) High degree of direct observation and data density during most phases of surgery allowing close semi-autonomous monitoring and titration of novel treatment algorithms early, 3) Defined stages in the initial part of surgery (induction, intubation, skin incision) allowing ML approaches to build large common relational database registries, and 4) Defined surgical procedure and stressors (anesthesia induction, intra-abdominal air insufflation, and other surgery-specific interventions), which will alter the impact of CRI on measured variables. Project Narrative The purpose of this study is to first develop multivariable models through data-driven classification techniques to predict parsimoniously cardiorespiratory instability, etiology and response to treatment in patients undergoing high-risk surgery. Using high-fidelity intraoperative physiological waveform data augmented with extensive electronic health record derived annotation and applying machine learning approaches we will characterize and quantify common patterns in subjects destined to develop cardiorespiratory instability during high-risk surgery. We will use these inputs in simulated real-time bedside management to develop an iteratively designed prototype clinical decision support system suitable for intraoperative care.","Machine Learning of Physiological Waveforms and Electronic Health Record Data to Predict, Diagnose, and Treat Hemodynamic Instability in Surgical Patients",9643500,R01HL144692,"['Acute', 'Adopted', 'Air', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Anesthesia procedures', 'Animals', 'Architecture', 'Calibration', 'California', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical effectiveness', 'Complex', 'Critical Care', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Documentation', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Homeostasis', 'Hospital Mortality', 'Hospitals', 'Hypotension', 'Injury', 'Insufflation', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Intervention', 'Intra-abdominal', 'Intraoperative Care', 'Intraoperative Period', 'Intubation', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Los Angeles', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical center', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Nature', 'Operating Rooms', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic Processes', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perioperative', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Postoperative Complications', 'Postoperative Period', 'Process', 'Recommendation', 'Registries', 'Resources', 'Resuscitation', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Shock', 'Signal Transduction', 'Skin', 'Specificity', 'Stream', 'Stress', 'Surgical incisions', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Titrations', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical care', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical risk', 'cohort', 'data integration', 'data structure', 'database structure', 'deep neural network', 'demographics', 'density', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'electronic data', 'graphical user interface', 'hemodynamics', 'high risk', 'improved', 'information display', 'insight', 'interoperability', 'iterative design', 'machine learning algorithm', 'model development', 'mortality', 'neural network algorithm', 'novel', 'patient population', 'personalized medicine', 'preconditioning', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive tools', 'pressure', 'prospective', 'prototype', 'relational database', 'response', 'simulation', 'stressor', 'support tools', 'surgical risk', 'tool', 'treatment response']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2019,694170,0.03191684761556195
"Automating Delirium Identification and Risk Prediction in Electronic Health Records Abstract. Delirium, or acute confusional state, affects 30-40% of hospitalized older adults, with the added cost of care estimated to be up to $7 billion. Although originally conceptualized as a transient disorder, delirium is now recognized to have significant consequences, including increased risk of death, functional decline, and long-term cognitive impairment. As up to 75% cases are not recognized by providers, there is an urgent need for additional methods to identify delirium for clinical and research purposes, and to stratify patients based on delirium risk. In this proposal, we present a novel approach to the identification of delirium based on large-scale data mining (i.e., pattern recognition) algorithms using machine learning and natural language processing applied to electronic health record (EHR) data, which will automate chart-based determination of delirium status and risk prediction. We will combine these algorithms with data collected through our recently implemented Virtual Acute Care for Elders (ACE) quality improvement project, which institutes delirium screening once per shift by nursing staff for all individuals over age 65 admitted to the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) Hospital. This unprece- dented volume of data will allow us to achieve the necessary sample sizes for effective training and validation of our data mining algorithms. Data mining algorithms that discover patterns of associations in data, rather than testing predetermined hypotheses, are well suited to application in large-scale algorithms for identification of delirium. Using our Virtual ACE and hospital EHR data, we will be able to evaluate more than 10,000 individual features (e.g., text words and phrases, laboratory and other diagnostic tests, concurrent medical conditions) as- sociated with delirium, which will be classified as risk factors for delirium, as signs, symptoms, and descriptors of delirium itself, and as complications and consequences of delirium, based on expert consensus. We will then use these features to develop rules for identification of delirium in the EHR, as well as risk prediction models that can be integrated into the EHR to provide individualized assessments of delirium risk. This study will lay the foundation for methods of automated delirium identification and risk prediction in healthcare settings that are unable to implement the screening by providers done in our Virtual ACE, as well as for large-scale epidemiological investigations of delirium using EHR data, expanding the current armamentarium for studying this common and debilitating disorder. Project Narrative. Delirium, or acute confusional state, affects up to 7 million hospitalized older adults annu- ally and is associated with long-term declines in cognition and function, but is not recognized by providers in up to 75% of cases. The growth of electronic health records offers a unique opportunity to improve recognition of delir- ium, as methods for identifying delirium based on chart review by clinicians have been developed but are time- and resource-intensive. In this secondary data analysis, we will examine methods for automating delirium recog- nition and risk prediction in electronic health records using machine learning and natural language processing computer algorithms, which in turn will lead to improved care for this serious but often overlooked disorder.",Automating Delirium Identification and Risk Prediction in Electronic Health Records,9637480,R01AG060993,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Agreement', 'Alabama', 'Algorithms', 'Ally', 'Assessment tool', 'Automation', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Computational algorithm', 'Confusion', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Delirium', 'Descriptor', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Discipline of Nursing', 'Disease', 'Elderly', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Epidemiology', 'Foundations', 'Growth', 'Health system', 'Hospitals', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Inpatients', 'Institutes', 'Institutionalization', 'Laboratories', 'Link', 'Logistics', 'Long-Term Care for Elderly', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurable', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nurses', 'Nursing Staff', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Persons', 'Prevention', 'Property', 'Provider', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Reference Standards', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'care costs', 'confusion assessment method', 'data mining', 'epidemiology study', 'functional decline', 'functional disability', 'health care settings', 'high dimensionality', 'human old age (65+)', 'improved', 'instrument', 'interest', 'model development', 'mortality risk', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'patient stratification', 'phrases', 'prediction algorithm', 'programs', 'risk prediction model', 'screening', 'validation studies', 'virtual', 'ward']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,R01,2019,432969,0.05782096460657616
"Statistical Methods for Incorporating Machine Learning Tools in Inference and Large-Scale Surveillance using Electronic Medical Records Data SUMMARY The modernization and standardization of clinical care information systems is creating large networks of linked electronic health records (EHR) that capture key treatments and select patient outcomes for millions of patients throughout the country. The observational data emerging from these systems provide an unparalleled opportunity to learn about the effectiveness of existing and novel treatments, and to monitor potential safety issues that may arise when interventions are used in broad patient populations. However, observational clinical data have exposures that are driven by many factors and therefore aggressive adjustment is needed to remove as much confounding bias as possible in order to make attribution regarding select exposures. The field of machine learning provides a powerful collection of data-driven approaches for performing flexible, thorough confounding adjustment, but performing reliable statistical inference is particularly challenging when these techniques are used as part of the analytic strategy. We propose to advance reproducible research methods by developing and illustrating novel targeted learning tools that leverage the flexibility of machine learning methods to detect and characterize health effect signals using large-scale EHR data. Specifically, we will first develop techniques for making efficient, statistically valid and robust inference for treatment effects using state-of-the-art machine learning tools. We will also develop online learning techniques to make such inference in the context of streaming EHR data. Methodological advances will enable us to formulate a formal, rigorous and practical framework for conducting continuous, effective and reliable surveillance for safety endpoints. Finally, we will develop statistical approaches for incorporating prior information -- including demographic, epidemiologic or pharmacodynamic knowledge, for example -- to improve health effect estimation and inference when the health outcome of interest is rare and the statistical problem is thus difficult, as often occurs in safety surveillance. The ultimate goal of the proposed research is to enable biomedical researchers and public health regulators to carefully monitor and protect the health of the public by allowing them to more effectively and more reliably detect critical health effect signals that may be contained in population-scale EHR data. PROJECT NARRATIVE The modernization and standardization of clinical care information systems is creating large networks of linked electronic medical records that capture key treatments and select patient outcomes for millions of U.S. subjects. The population scale of contemporary health care data is opening new opportunities for quickly learning from observational data, and is now supporting on-going national surveillance that will monitor the risks and benefits of both existing and novel treatment paths. The objective of this proposal is to provide an inferential framework that leverages the flexibility of machine learning methods to detect health effect signals, including in the important setting of high-dimensional confounders and/or rare events, and to develop a real-time sequential updating methodology for safety signal detection.",Statistical Methods for Incorporating Machine Learning Tools in Inference and Large-Scale Surveillance using Electronic Medical Records Data,9816009,R01HL137808,"['Algorithms', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical Data', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Confidence Intervals', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Dimensions', 'E-learning', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Epidemiology', 'Estimation Techniques', 'Event', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Heterogeneity', 'Information Systems', 'Infrastructure', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pharmacodynamics', 'Population', 'Population Surveillance', 'Procedures', 'Public Health', 'Records', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Safety', 'Sentinel', 'Signal Transduction', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stream', 'Structural Models', 'Subgroup', 'Surveillance Program', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Treatment outcome', 'Update', 'base', 'clinical care', 'comparative treatment', 'flexibility', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'national surveillance', 'novel', 'open source', 'patient population', 'patient subsets', 'risk minimization', 'software development', 'surveillance data', 'tool', 'treatment effect', 'user-friendly']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2019,502815,0.019017719821389206
"Advancing Chronic Condition Symptom Cluster Science Through Use of Electronic Health Records and Data Science Techniques Despite their adverse impact on patient quality of life and healthcare utilization and costs, symptom clusters (SCs) in common adult chronic conditions such as cancer, heart failure (HF), type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are understudied and poorly understood. The lack of access to real world, longitudinal patient symptom data sets and inability to adequately model the complexity of SCs has greatly limited research. Based on our previous work, we propose that these gaps can be addressed in an innovative way using electronic health records (EHRs) and data science techniques. Our overall objective is to develop, apply and refine, and implement an optimized data processing and analysis pipeline for the characterization of SCs in common adult chronic conditions for use with EHR data. We hypothesize that a core set of SCs is shared among all common adult chronic conditions and that distinct SCs characterize specific conditions and/or treatments. The long term training goal of this project is to assist Dr. Koleck in becoming an independent investigator conducting a program of research dedicated to mitigating symptom burden in patients with chronic conditions through use of informatics and omics (e.g., genomics and proteomics), the focus of her pre-doctoral work. Using exceptional resources available from Columbia University, the K99 phase of this project will focus on the development of a rigorous pipeline; essential competencies in SC analysis and interpretation; and the data science techniques of clinical data mining, natural language processing, machine learning, and data visualization. In the R00 phase, Dr. Koleck will independently implement the pipeline in another medical center to determine the reproducibility of identified SCs and begin to explore clinical predictors (e.g., socio-demographics, laboratory results, and medications) of SCs. The specific aims are to 1) develop a data-driven pipeline for the characterization of SCs from EHRs using a cohort of adult patients diagnosed with cancer, as SCs have been most systematically characterized in this condition; 2) apply the pipeline to three other common adult chronic conditions that share biological and behavioral risk factors with cancer, i.e., HF, T2DM, and COPD, and evaluate SCs in these conditions; and 3) determine if SCs differ for cancer, HF, T2DM, and COPD when implementing the pipeline within another medical center and explore clinically relevant, EHR- documented predictors of identified SCs. To accomplish research aims and training goals, an interdisciplinary team of scientists with expertise in symptom science, biomedical informatics, data science, pertinent clinical domains, and career development mentorship has been assembled. This research is significant because a pipeline that accommodates the format in which symptom data is already being documented in EHRs has the potential to greatly accelerate the acquisition of SC knowledge and expedite clinical translation of symptom mitigation strategies. Given the array of new competencies to be developed, this K99/R00 award is necessary for achieving the candidate’s career goal of advancing chronic condition symptom science. The proposed research is relevant to public health because adult patients diagnosed with chronic conditions are frequently burdened by two or more co-occurring, related symptoms. Development of an optimized process to study multiple symptoms collected in patient electronic health records has the potential to lead to new knowledge and improved symptom management. The proposed research addresses the NINR theme of “symptom science” and a key area in the NINR Strategic Plan, “taking advantage of innovations in data science in order to develop interventions to promote health and wellness that are leading-edge, effective, and translatable to clinical practice.”",Advancing Chronic Condition Symptom Cluster Science Through Use of Electronic Health Records and Data Science Techniques,9673231,K99NR017651,"['18 year old', 'Academic Medical Centers', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Advance Directives', 'American', 'Anxiety', 'Area', 'Award', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical assessments', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Code', 'Competence', 'Complement', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Depressed mood', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dyspnea', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Equipment and supply inventories', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Fatigue', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Promotion', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heart failure', 'Impaired cognition', 'Informatics', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Knowledge acquisition', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mastectomy', 'Medical Genetics', 'Medical center', 'Mentorship', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nausea', 'Nausea and Vomiting', 'Neurobehavioral Manifestations', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Pain', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Postoperative Nausea and Vomiting', 'Procedures', 'Proteomics', 'Pruritus', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Race', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk Factors', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Sleep disturbances', 'Strategic Planning', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Woman', 'Work', 'Xerostomia', 'analysis pipeline', 'base', 'biomarker discovery', 'biomedical informatics', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical data warehouse', 'clinical practice', 'clinical predictors', 'clinical translation', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'computerized data processing', 'data mining', 'data visualization', 'data warehouse', 'electronic data', 'experience', 'health care service utilization', 'health data', 'innovation', 'knowledge translation', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'oncology', 'patient oriented', 'pre-doctoral', 'process optimization', 'programs', 'sociodemographics', 'statistics', 'symptom cluster', 'symptom management', 'symptom science', 'symptomatic improvement', 'unsupervised learning']",NINR,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,K99,2019,90185,-0.005243027332134091
"Multi-objective representation learning methods for interpetable predictions of patient outcomesusing electronic health records Project Summary/Abstract This project proposes new methods for representing data in electronic health records (EHR) to improve pre- dictive modeling and interpretation of patient outcomes. EHR data offer a promising opportunity for advancing the understanding of how clinical decisions and patient conditions interact over time to inﬂuence patient health. However, EHR data are difﬁcult to use for predictive modeling due to the various data types they contain (con- tinuous, categorical, text, etc.), their longitudinal nature, the high amount of non-random missingness for certain measurements, and other concerns. Furthermore, patient outcomes often have heterogenous causes and re- quire information to be synthesized from several clinical lab measures and patient visits. The core challenge at hand is overcoming the mismatch between data representations in the EHR and the assumptions underly- ing commonly used statistical and machine learning (ML) methods. To this end, this project proposes novel wrapper-based methods for learning informative features from EHR data. Both methods propose specialized operators to handle sequential data, time delays, and variable interactions, and have the capacity to discover underlying clinical rules/decisions that affect patient outcomes. Importantly, both methods also produce archives of possible models that represent the best trade-offs between complexity and accuracy, which assists in model interpretation. These method advances are made possible by encoding a rich set of data operations as nodes in a directed acyclic graph, and optimizing the graph structures using multi-objective optimization. The central hypothesis of this research is that multi-objective optimization can learn effective data representations from the EHR to produce accurate, explanatory models of patient outcomes. Preliminary work has shown that these methods can effectively learn low-order data representations that improve the predictive ability of several state- of-the-art ML methods. This technique demonstrates good scaling properties with high-dimensional biomedical data. Aim 1 (K99) is to develop a multi-objective feature engineering method that pairs with existing ML methods to iteratively improve their performance by constructing new features from the raw data and using feedback from the trained model to guide feature construction. In Aim 2 (K99), this method is applied to form predictive models of the risk of heart disease and heart failure using longitudinal EHR data. The resultant models will be inter- preted with the help of mentors in order to translate predictions into clinical recommendations. For Aim 3 (R00), a second method is proposed that uses a similar framework to optimize existing neural network approaches in order to simplify their structure as much as possible while maintaining accuracy. The goal of Aim 4 (R00) is to identify hospital patients who are at risk of readmission and propose point-of-care strategies to mitigate that risk. This goal is facilitated through the application of the proposed methods to patient data collected from the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, the Geisinger Health System, and publicly available EHR databases. Project Narrative  Understanding how clinical decisions interact with a patient's health and environmental over time to inﬂuence patient outcomes is central to the goals of enhancing health, reducing illness and improving quality of life. The proposed research provides important methodological advances for extracting these insights from widely available patient health records.",Multi-objective representation learning methods for interpetable predictions of patient outcomesusing electronic health records,9744166,K99LM012926,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Archives', 'Area', 'Automobile Driving', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Categories', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Couples', 'Data', 'Data Reporting', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Engineering', 'Feedback', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Hand', 'Health', 'Health Sciences', 'Health system', 'Heart Diseases', 'Heart failure', 'Hospitals', 'Inpatients', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical Records', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pennsylvania', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quality of life', 'Recommendation', 'Replacement Arthroplasty', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'University Hospitals', 'Visit', 'Work', 'base', 'care costs', 'cluster computing', 'data archive', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'design', 'disease diagnosis', 'disorder subtype', 'health record', 'heart disease risk', 'high dimensionality', 'hospital readmission', 'improved', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'network architecture', 'neural network', 'novel', 'open source', 'operation', 'point of care', 'predictive modeling', 'readmission rates', 'readmission risk', 'tool']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,K99,2019,89260,0.0815054124067315
"Discovering and Applying Knowledge in Clinical Databases PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT The long-term goal of our ongoing project, “Discovering and applying knowledge in clinical databases,” is to learn from data in the electronic health record (EHR) and to apply that knowledge to understand and improve health. The EHR, because of its broad capture of human health, greatly amplifies our ability to carry out observational research, opening the possibility of covering emerging problems, diverse populations, rare diseases, and chronic diseases in long-term longitudinal studies. Unfortunately, the strength of EHR data—its breadth and flexible nature—imposes additional challenges. We have found that the biggest challenge comes from the inaccuracy, incompleteness, complexity, and resulting bias inherent in the recording of the health care process. We previously showed that health care process bias exists to the extent, for example, that simple use of the data can create signals implying the opposite of what we know to be true. One of the most important factors is sparse, irregular sampling; we found that sampling bias can be reduced by reparameterizing time and that prediction techniques that can accommodate EHR-specific data and resist their biases like data assimilation can be used on EHR data to produce good estimates of glucose and HA1c. The previous cycle of this project produced 75 publications. We propose to develop methods to accommodate health care process bias, using both knowledge engineering and experience with health care process bias as well as advanced statistical techniques that employ dynamical models and latent variables. We hypothesize that heuristics and models combined with knowledge can improve our ability to generate inferences and learn phenotypes despite health care process bias. Our aims are as follows: (1) Taking a knowledge engineering approach, study the effect of preprocessing and analytic choices on reducing health care process bias, and using machine learning techniques, learn more about health care process bias. (2) Taking a more empirical approach, use dynamic latent factor modeling and variation inference to accommodate health care process bias, learning how a patient's health state and health processes affect censoring, exploiting information from many variables at once. (3) Use data assimilation and mechanistic models to learn otherwise unmeasurable physiologic phenotypes despite irregular, sparse sampling typical of electronic health records. (4) Use the developed models and generated phenotypes to answer clinical questions, and disseminate the results. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project studies the biases that health care processes bring to electronic health record data, and it develops methods to overcome those biases to improve reuse of the data for purposes such as clinical research and quality improvement.",Discovering and Applying Knowledge in Clinical Databases,9659641,R01LM006910,"['Active Learning', 'Adopted', 'Adverse drug effect', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Assimilations', 'Award', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Reporting', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Engineering', 'Functional disorder', 'Generations', 'Glucose', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Human', 'Insulin', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Nature', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Nonlinear Dynamics', 'Observational Study', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Process', 'Publications', 'Rare Diseases', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Biases', 'Signal Transduction', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Work', 'abstracting', 'clinical database', 'deep learning', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'heuristics', 'improved', 'novel', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling']",NLM,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2019,596772,0.019532375174496734
"From enrichment to insights Project Summary Most medical decisions are made without the support of rigorous evidence in large part due to the cost and complexity of performing randomized trials for most clinical situations. In practice, clinicians must use their judgement, informed by their own and the collective experience of their colleagues. The advent of the electronic health record (EHR) enables the modern practitioner to algorithmically check the records of thousands or millions of patients to rapidly find similar cases and compare outcomes. In addition to filling the inferential gap in actionable evidence, these kinds of analyses avoid issues of ethics, practicality, and generalizability that plague randomized clinical trials (RCTs). Unfortunately, identifying patients with the appropriate phenotypes, properly leveraging available data to adjust results, and matching similar patients to reduce confounding remain critical challenges in every study that uses EHR data. Overcoming these challenges to improve the accuracy of observational studies conducted with EHR data is of paramount importance. Studies using EHR data begin by defining a set of patients with specific phenotypes, analogous to amassing a cohort for a clinical trial. This process of electronic phenotyping, is typically done via a set of rules defined by experts. Machine learning approaches are increasingly used to complement consensus definitions created by experts and we propose several advances to validate and improve this practice. We will explore and quantify the effects of feature engineering choices to transform the diagnoses, procedures, medications, laboratory tests and clinical notes in the EHR into a computable feature matrix. Finally, building on recent advances, we plan to characterize the performance of existing methods and develop EHR-specific strategies for patient matching. Our work is significant because we will take on three challenging problems--electronic phenotyping, feature engineering, and patient matching--that stand in the way of generating insights via EHR data. If we are successful, we will significantly advance our ability to generate insights from the large amounts of health data that are routinely generated as a byproduct of clinical processes. Narrative The advent of the electronic health record (EHR) enables the search of thousands or millions of patients to rapidly find similar cases and compare outcomes.

"SCH: INT Re-envisioned Chat-assessment for Real-time Investigating of Nursing and Guidance  Two decades have lapsed since the seminal publications of the National Academy of Medicine (formerly the Institute of Medicine), To Err Is Human and Crossing the Quality Chasm, cast a national spotlight on health-care safety and quality, yet US patient outcome indices continue to lag behind those in other industrialized countries. The 2009 American Recovery and Reinvestment Act mandated health-care providers adopt electronic health record (EHR) systems, leading to widespread EHR adoption, albeit primarily for billing purposes rather than research or quality improvement efforts. Thus EHR impact on health-care quality has tended to be in the domains of physician efficiency and guideline compliance. Despite a large body of evidence that nursing quality is directly related to patient outcomes in the acute care selling, nurses often lack timely information to use in improving individual patient outcomes, and indices of outcomes across patient populations are slow to budge over lime. Widespread adoption of EHRs in U.S. hospitals now allows determination of outcome quality indicators for all patients in a hospital for real-time feedback to nurses. Quality indicators are often only determined by piecing together other information to determine occurrence of an incident, e.g., exhuming information buried in nursing notes. The goal is to develop Chart-assessment for Real-lime Investigation of Nursing and Guidance (CARING), an automated machine learning system to report and predict nursing quality indicators in real-time for hospitalized patients to assist nurses in care planning. CARI NG will reflect algorithmic innovations to mine sequential patterns from multi-sourced, heterogeneous data including nursing narratives, yielding robust predictive models that are insensitive to uncertain labels and evolve with changes in health-care practices. CARING will represent EHR data using inter-connected tensors, capturing higher-order relations, temporal weighting, i.e., more recent data receives more weight, and incorporating domain expert feedback in development. Although CARING will be developed initially for the ten hospitals of our industry partner Emory Healthcare, its flexible refinement will enable adaptation at other health-care institutions. Outcomes of this project will give nurses actionable data in real time to improve nursing care quality that they do not receive now. Moreover, this system can be implemented into the health information infrastructure at an institutional level, integrating multi-scale and multi-level clinical, contextual, and organizational data surrounding each patient for real-time reporting and incorporation into predictive models. CARING supports the National Library of Medicine mission 1) by creating an innovative open source suite of tools for advancing patient safety; and 2) through educational efforts: training graduate students and fellows, and developing a Massive Open Online Course (MOOG), ""Big Data Analytics for Nursing,"" covering topics at the confluence of computer science, nursing, and patient outcome quality indicators.

"Addressing Bias from Missing Data in EHR Based Studies of CVD Project Summary This NHLBI K01 application supports the career development of Dr. Nrupen A. Bhavsar, PhD, an Assistant Professor of Medicine at the Duke University School of Medicine. Dr. Bhavsar is a chronic disease epidemiologist who has performed multidisciplinary studies in the epidemiology of CVD, chronic kidney disease and cancer. He is passionate about pursuing a career in clinical research at the intersection of epidemiology, informatics, and biostatistics. At the end of the award period, Dr. Bhavsar will be an independent investigator applying knowledge gained through this K01 to develop large scale EHR-based population studies that identify individuals at high risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD) events. Through training in data linkage, machine learning, and causal inference, he will apply missing data methods to conduct rigorous non-randomized studies to improve health. The topical areas of the proposed training and research are diabetes and incident CVD events in the application of data linkage, machine learning, and causal inference. Career development aim: Obtain transdisciplinary competencies within informatics, biostatistics, and population sciences to investigate methodological challenges inherent in the use of multi-health system EHR data for clinical research. The training approach will leverage didactic and experiential training complemented by analyses of data derived from a multi-health system, multi-state research collaborative. Study population: Patients who received care at one of the North Carolina or South Carolina “Carolinas Collaborative” institutions (Duke University Medical Center, UNC-CH Health System, Wake Forest Baptist Health Center, and 9 additional health systems collaborating within the Health Sciences of South Carolina institutions). Specific aims: This proposal will identify approaches to account for missing data when patients seek care across multiple health systems but EHR data is only available from a single health system. Estimating the systemic bias introduced by missing data for single institution studies and identifying methods for accounting for missing data biases may improve the ability of EHR data to be used for clinical research. Anticipated results: Through this NHLBI K01 Research Scientist Career Development Award, Dr. Bhavsar will acquire essential training and research experience to develop large scale EHR-based population studies in CVD. PROJECT NARRATIVE Data from the electronic health records (EHR) are increasingly being used for clinical research, yet there is limited information on the best approaches to address the methodological limitations of the EHR, such as missing data.

"PED Screen: Pediatric Sepsis EHR Registry, Clinical Outcomes, and Predictive Model Project Summary/Abstract Each year over 75,000 children develop sepsis in the United States resulting in substantial morbidity, up to 20% mortality, and billions in US health care expenditures. There have been substantial advances that demonstrate improved patient outcomes with adherence to early aggressive emergency care. However, methods to accurately, reliably, and rapidly identify children who require these resource-intensive therapies are lacking. In addition, understanding the impact of these therapies on near-term outcomes, before significant morbidity occurs, is also lacking. Current algorithms do not reliably discriminate between patients who develop sepsis and those who are clinically similar upon initial presentation but do not progress to sepsis. As a result, children requiring life-saving treatments do not receive them, or do not receive them in a timely fashion, and others may be over-treated, wasting healthcare resources and potentially diverting emergency care from those in need. With the advent of electronic health records (EHR), there are now information-enabled solutions that offer unique opportunities to identify non-biased, heterogeneous samples of children and allow us to accurately and reliably measure risk factors and near-term outcomes for sepsis. This work addresses the critical need to improve pediatric sepsis outcomes by developing methods to accurately identify at-risk children presenting for emergency care. Utilizing the infrastructure of the Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network (PECARN), this proposal will innovatively capture EHR data to create a multi-center registry with the ultimate goal to improve the detection and treatment of pediatric sepsis in the ED setting. To accomplish this, we propose the following specific aims: We will develop an expanded multicenter sepsis registry for pediatric patients from merged electronic health record clinical data from different hospitals with different EHR data sources. We will automate the determination of organ dysfunction in children with sepsis directly from structured and narrative data within the multicenter EHR registry. From the registry and outcome data, we will derive and validate a prediction model of pediatric sepsis using emergency department EHR data from the first 4 hours of care that predicts subsequent organ dysfunction within 48 hours. Each of these aims works to the goal of improving the emergent care for pediatric sepsis with innovative deliverables from this project including the existence of a broad and rich EHR registry, an automated process of outcome determination, and a prediction model of risk of sepsis. We will also have a strong foundation for future projects to implement and evaluate decision support tools, improve diagnostic techniques, engage in comparative effectiveness studies, measure quality of care, establish linked bio-repositories, and guide clinical trial design. The proposed project, thus, has enormous potential to improve our ability to improve the quality of care provided to our most acutely ill children.  Project Narrative Sepsis is a leading cause of pediatric morbidity and mortality with life-saving treatment dependent on early and accurate identification. We will establish a multi-center data registry from electronic health records (EHR), identify a multi-center cohort of pediatric patients at risk for sepsis, automate sepsis-related pediatric organ dysfunction directly from the registry EHR data, and develop an emergency department based prediction model of sepsis related organ dysfunction. Each of these aims has the ultimate goal of improving the emergent care for pediatric sepsis with innovative deliverables from this project including the existence of a broad and rich EHR registry, the automated process of important proximal outcome determination, and an emergency department prediction model of risk of sepsis. ","PED Screen: Pediatric Sepsis EHR Registry, Clinical Outcomes, and Predictive Model",9626417,R01HD087363,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Achievement', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adherence', 'Algorithms', 'Applied Research', 'Blood Pressure', 'Caring', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Derivation procedure', 'Detection', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emergency Care', 'Emergent care', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health Expenditures', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Infrastructure', 'Inpatients', 'Intervention', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Organ', 'Organ failure', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pediatric cohort', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Quality of Care', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Savings', 'Sepsis', 'Shock', 'Site', 'Structure', 'Time', 'United States', 'United States Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality', 'Visit', 'Work', 'base', 'cohort', 'comparative effectiveness', 'data registry', 'design', 'effective intervention', 'electronic registry', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'member', 'mortality', 'novel', 'patient registry', 'pediatric emergency', 'pediatric patients', 'predictive modeling', 'repository', 'risk prediction model', 'septic patients', 'support tools', 'wasting']",NICHD,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R01,2019,616807,0.0322840756750685
"Investigating the documentation of E-cigarette use in the VA EHR PROJECT SUMMARY Electronic cigarettes were developed in China in the early 2000s and first introduced to the US market in 2007. Once established in the US, the product experienced explosive growth, with the number of electronic cigarette users doubling every year between 2008 and 2012. In 2012, it was estimated that 75% of US adults had heard of electronic cigarettes, and 8% had tried them. While electronic cigarettes have been studied over the last sev- eral years, no scientific consensus has emerged regarding either the safety of electronic cigarettes, or their po- tential as a smoking cessation aid. With this proposal, we will investigate how electronic cigarette use is documented in the Veterans Association Electronic Health Record, focusing specifically on the relationship between electronic cigarette use and com- bustible tobacco use, with the goal of understanding both how electronic cigarette use is documented in the context of the United States’ only nationwide health system, and how electronic cigarette related information can be reliably extracted from narrative clinical text using fully automated Natural Language Processing meth- ods. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research focuses on the use of Natural Language Processing methods to automatically extract mentions of electronic cigarette use from the Veterans Association Electronic Health Record. The research will provide insight into important, currently unresolved questions regarding how clinicians record electronic cigarette use in the context of a nationwide health system, and whether patients report the use of electronic cigarettes as a smoking cessation aid or use the devices in conjunction with combustible tobacco.",Investigating the documentation of E-cigarette use in the VA EHR,9652537,R03DA047577,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Area', 'China', 'Cities', 'Clinical', 'Consensus', 'Dangerousness', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Documentation', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Electronic Nicotine Delivery Systems', 'Electronic cigarette', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Evaluation', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Government', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Health system', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hearing', 'Individual', 'Methods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Professional Organizations', 'Public Health', 'Public Health Applications Research', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'Scheme', 'Smoking', 'Sodium Chloride', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Tobacco', 'Tobacco use', 'Tweens', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Utah', 'Variant', 'Veterans', 'Work', 'authority', 'electronic cigarette use', 'electronic cigarette user', 'electronic hookah', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'information model', 'innovation', 'insight', 'men', 'smoking cessation', 'success', 'systems research', 'tobacco control', 'tool', 'vaping']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,R03,2019,76250,0.040860575835530405
"Better Outcomes for Children: Promoting Excellence in Healthcare Genomics to Inform Policy ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In May 2012 Cincinnati Children's (CCHMC) joined eMERGE II with our Boston Children's partner. Since then we have developed algorithms for the electronic health record (EHR), led the Pediatric Workgroup, developed pharmacogenomics, evaluated the preferences of parents and caregivers to advance genomic medicine and assimilated technical advances into our EHR. The eMERGE effort has become the basic fabric of the institutional initiative to incorporate the extraordinary advances of genetics, genomics and the electronic medical record into healthcare. In addition, we bring a comprehensive EHR (EPIC), operating in every venue for healthcare delivery at CCHMC; a deidentified i2b2 data warehouse of 1.2 million patient records; and a Biobank with 150,000 consents that allow return of results to 38,000 patients and guardians who have provided 58,000 DNA samples, all with consent to return results and i2b2 EHR records. Now, we present our plan to join the eMERGE III network with 17 proposed initiatives. Our eMERGE effort is designed to move an entire institution with our eMERGE III partners into a genomic-EHR era of healthcare implementation and discovery. Our effort is divided into Genomics , Aim 1, where we hope to help the eMERGE III Steering Committee identify the 100 or so genes for the eMERGE III Targeted Gene Panel (eTGP), select our 2,000 CCHMC patients to be sequenced (of the 38,000 in our Biobank), review 4,000 targeted gene panels from clinical care at CCHMC for somatic mosaicism and reinterpretation, and further develop and disseminate a software workflow suite for sequence analysis (CASSI). For Phenotypes, Aim 2, we will extend our work generating EHR phenotype algorithms using heuristic and machine learning methods with a comprehensive set of EHR features derived from data driven algorithms to describe phenotypic pleiotropy of eTGP gene variants. We will develop working collaborations with Patients Care Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI) and the Million Veterans Program by applying eMERGE developed EHR algorithms to these large electronic data warehouses. For Implementation and Evaluation, Aim 3, we will develop tools to evaluate adolescent return of results preferences, examine the ethical and legal obligations and potential to reanalyze results, analyze the cost of tacrolimus management of kidney transplant with and without CYP3A5 testing, develop clinical decision support for phenotyping, test ordering, and returning eTGP results. Our success in these eMERGE III studies will be enhanced by the ongoing institutional investments made in the CCHMC BioBank, the comprehensive EHR (EPIC), and the i2b2 deidentified medical record data warehouse, and hundreds of Faculty and senior staff who make genomics or informatics an active focus of their research. We present a comprehensive program addressing all of the salient elements presented in the RFP for eMERGE III (HG-14-025) to enhance our collaborative productivity within the eMERGE Network in ways that ultimately improve our healthcare systems through discovery, implementation, and advanced applications of genomics and informatics. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center (CCHMC) proposes to contribute as a funded site in the eMERGE III Network by pursuing a series of initiatives designed to advance genomics and the electronic health record (EHR). We propose 100 genes to evaluate by sequencing in 2,000 patients consented for return of results, to advance genomics by evaluating fee for service for DNA sequence-based genetic testing at CCHMC, to develop the reliable identification many diseases in the EHR and along with genome wide genetic testing, to explore genetic variants for alleged and unknown clinical manifestations, to extend the work of eMERGE to other large collections of EHR and genetic data, to evaluate cost benefits of genetic testing, to characterize the genetics of pain, to explor the preferences of adolescents concerning the genetic results they prefer to learn, and to explore the legal, ethical, and social issues that surround the re-interpretation of genetic variants. All of this work will be pursued with our eMERGE III Network colleagues the goal of improving the quality of the health care we deliver.",Better Outcomes for Children: Promoting Excellence in Healthcare Genomics to Inform Policy,9901995,U01HG008666,"['Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm', 'Address', 'Administrator', 'Adolescent', 'Algorithms', 'Appendicitis', 'Archives', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Base Sequence', 'Boston', 'Budgets', 'CYP3A5 gene', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Computer software', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Computers', 'Consent', 'Costs and Benefits', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence', 'DNA Sequence Analysis', 'DNA sequencing', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Effectiveness', 'Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Electronic Medical Records and Genomics Network', 'Elements', 'Ethics', 'Evaluation', 'Faculty', 'Familial Hypercholesterolemia', 'Fee-for-Service Plans', 'Fibromyalgia', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic screening method', 'Genomic medicine', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Human Resources', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Infrastructure', 'Institution', 'Investments', 'Kidney Transplantation', 'Learning', 'Legal', 'Legal Obligations', 'Letters', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant hyperpyrexia due to anesthesia', 'Medical Records', 'Medical center', 'Migraine', 'Modification', 'Mosaicism', 'Narcotic Addiction', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Outpatients', 'PTEN gene', 'Pain', 'Parents', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Pharmacogenomics', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Policies', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Primary Ciliary Dyskinesias', 'Process', 'Productivity', 'Pyloric Stenosis', 'Recommendation', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Institute', 'Research Personnel', 'Ritalin', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Sequence Analysis', 'Series', 'Site', 'Tacrolimus', 'Testing', 'Textiles', 'Time', 'Tonsillectomy', 'Translating', 'Variant', 'Veterans', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'biobank', 'clinical care', 'clinical decision support', 'clinically actionable', 'cohort', 'cost', 'data modeling', 'data warehouse', 'database of Genotypes and Phenotypes', 'design', 'economic impact', 'electronic data', 'ethical legal social implication', 'follow-up', 'gene panel', 'genetic information', 'genetic variant', 'genome-wide', 'genomic variation', 'health care delivery', 'health care quality', 'heuristics', 'improved', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'member', 'next generation sequencing', 'patient oriented', 'pleiotropism', 'preference', 'primary pulmonary hypertension', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'skills', 'social', 'success', 'support tools', 'targeted sequencing', 'tool', 'tool development']",NHGRI,CINCINNATI CHILDRENS HOSP MED CTR,U01,2019,742762,0.03883429279508797
"Efficient Statistical Learning Methods for Personalized Medicine Using Large Scale Biomedical Data Project Summary/Abstract  Current medical treatment guidelines largely rely on data from randomized controlled trials that study  average effects, which may be inadequate for making individualized decisions for real-world patients. Large-scale electronic health records (EHRs) data provide unprecedented opportunities to optimize personalized treatment strategies and generate evidence relevant to real-world patients. However, there are inherent challenges in the use of EHRs, including non-experimental nature of data collection processes, heterogeneous data types with complex dependencies, irregular measurement patterns, multiple dynamic treatment sequences, and the need to balance risk and benefit of treatments. Using two high-quality EHR databases, Columbia University Medical Center's clinical data warehouse and the Indiana Network for Patient Care database, and focusing on type 2 diabetes (T2D), this proposal will develop novel and scalable statistical learning approaches that overcome these challenges to discover optimal personalized treatment strategies for T2D from real-world patients. Specifically, under Aim 1, we will develop a unified framework to learn latent temporal processes for feature extraction and dynamic patient records representation. Our approach will accommodate large-scale variables of mixed types (continuous, binary, counts) measured at irregular intervals. They extract lower-dimensional components to reflect patients' dynamic health status, account for informative healthcare documentation processes, and characterize similarities between patients. Under Aim 2, we will develop fast and efficient multi-category machine learning methods, in order to evaluate treatment propensities and adaptively learn optimal dynamic treatment regimens (DTRs) among the extensive number of treatment options observed in the EHRs. The methods will provide  sequential decisions that determine the best treatment sequence for a T2D patient given his/her EHRs. Under Aim 3, we will develop statistical learning methods to assist multi-faceted treatment decision-making, which balances risks versus benefits when evaluating a DTR. Our approach will ensure maximizing benefit to the greatest extent while controlling all risk outcomes under the safety margins. For all aims, we will develop efficient stochastic resampling algorithms to scale up the optimization for massive data sizes. We will identify optimal DTRs for T2D using the extracted information from patients' comorbidity conditions, medications, and laboratory tests, as well as records-collection processes. Our methodologies will be applied and cross-validated between the two EHR databases. The treatment strategies learned from the representative EHR databases with a diverse patient  population will be beneficial for individual patient care, assisting clinicians to adaptively choose the optimal treatment for a patient. Finally, we will disseminate our methods and results through freely available software and outreach to the informatics and clinical experts at our Centers for Translational Science and elsewhere. Project Narrative  This proposal aims to develop novel and scalable statistical learning methods to analyze electronic health records (EHRs) and use two real-world, high-quality EHR databases for personalized medicine research. The methods will handle the non-experimental nature of data collection processes, along with heterogeneous data types, dynamic treatment sequences, and the trade-off between benefit and risk outcomes. The results will complement the current knowledge base for individual patient care using evidence generated from patients in real-world clinical practices.",Efficient Statistical Learning Methods for Personalized Medicine Using Large Scale Biomedical Data,9659349,R01GM124104,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Address', 'Adverse event', 'Algorithms', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Categories', 'Center for Translational Science Activities', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Comorbidity', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Dependence', 'Dimensions', 'Documentation', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Equilibrium', 'Exclusion Criteria', 'Formulation', 'Gaussian model', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Status', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heterogeneity', 'Indiana', 'Informatics', 'International', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Length', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Process', 'Quality Control', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Records', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'Sampling', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Treatment Protocols', 'adaptive learning', 'adverse event risk', 'algorithmic methodologies', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'big biomedical data', 'clinical data warehouse', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical practice', 'data modeling', 'data space', 'design', 'evidence base', 'individual patient', 'individualized medicine', 'knowledge base', 'learning strategy', 'novel', 'optimal treatments', 'outreach', 'patient population', 'personalized decision', 'personalized medicine', 'population based', 'scale up', 'temporal measurement', 'theories', 'treatment effect', 'treatment guidelines', 'treatment response', 'treatment strategy']",NIGMS,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2019,329020,0.03582618455489078
"Improve medical decision making in emergency medicine via a new interface to visualize and understand relevant prior history for complex patients at the point-of-care. PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Patient Insight is working to drive more informed medical decisions by designing a real-time interface that dynamically captures and presents prior history for complex patients in less time and with more completeness than using their electronic health record (EHR) system. The company is developing proprietary data mining and natural language processing algorithms that show promise for identifying, aggregating, and displaying the most essential EHR data for patients with complex conditions while at the same time working with clinicians to design the visual interface to reduce the cognitive burden and support diagnosis and treatment decisions. The specific goals of this phase I project are to test the feasibility of developing Patient Insight’s core solution to (1) use advanced analytics and natural language processing to mine and prioritize the most relevant information for use by (ED) physicians and (2) develop an clinician-informed, visual display of that essential information to timely support clinical decision-making sufficient to reduce medical errors, improve health, and control costs. In phase I, Patient Insight will work with Universal Health Systems, the parent company of George Washington University Hospital, to co-develop and test the platform for efficacy in the ED as a precursor to continued development of this core solution/product. This will involve using EHR data to assess comprehensiveness to reconstruct history for five groups of chronically ill patients (e.g., advanced cancer, coronary heart disease, insulin-dependent diabetes, chronic pain, and schizophrenia) who are admitted with high-frequency chief complaints of abdominal pain, chest pain, and fever. This will include mining, prioritizing, and presenting information to clinicians using a total of 30 dimensions of data regarding patient’s prior ED and hospital visits including both structured (e.g., diagnosis, medications, labs, imaging test types, EKG date/time) and unstructured data (e.g., images, physician notes, consult notes) to establish physician consensus on the data most valuable to medical decision-making and co-design data visualization tools to render a clear patient history. Our aims include: (Aim 1) Establishing the feasibility of leveraging provider-as-user-centered design to guide development of a data visualization platform that enables providers to readily “see” the most complete patient record for the five groups of complex patients, and (Aim 2) Conducting usability testing and compare the completeness and efficiency of using the enhanced platform on the five patient categories with usual care. Success in phase I will enable the company to validate a ‘proof of concept’ for developing its clinician-as-user-centered design process to inform a phase II research and development effort to design a commercially viable clinical decision support tool for hospitals and health systems. PROJECT NARRATIVE Patient Insight seeks to determine the feasibility of its proposed platform to aggregate and present the clearest picture possible of a patient’s history for time-constrained emergency department (ED) providers sufficient to drive improved medical decision-making, safety, and improved health outcomes for complex patients at the point-of-care and across disparate EHR systems. The strategy is to leverage our capability to extract discreet and unstructured data from select EHR systems and engage providers in the design of key elements of information display to reduce duplicate testing, lower medical errors related to misinformed treatment choices, and reduce unnecessary treatment and costs. Proving feasibility will enable Patient Insight to structure a partnership with Universal Health Services and inform further development and testing of its core solution across multiple ED facilities.",Improve medical decision making in emergency medicine via a new interface to visualize and understand relevant prior history for complex patients at the point-of-care.,9778547,R43LM013130,"['Abdominal Pain', 'Accident and Emergency department', 'Adoption', 'Advanced Malignant Neoplasm', 'Algorithms', 'Automated Clinical Decision Support', 'Award', 'Caring', 'Categories', 'Chest Pain', 'Chronically Ill', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Comorbidity', 'Complex', 'Consensus', 'Consult', 'Coronary heart disease', 'Cost Control', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Data Display', 'Data Element', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Elements', 'Emergency Medicine', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Fever', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Health Services', 'Health system', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Iatrogenesis', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Inpatients', 'Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Intuition', 'Medical', 'Medical Errors', 'Medical History', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Parents', 'Patients', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Primary Health Care', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Psyche structure', 'Recording of previous events', 'Records', 'Research', 'Safety', 'Schizophrenia', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Software Engineering', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Treatment Cost', 'Universities', 'University Hospitals', 'Visit', 'Visual', 'Visualization software', 'Washington', 'Work', 'chronic pain', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical decision-making', 'cognitive load', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'data mining', 'data visualization', 'design', 'health information technology', 'improved', 'information display', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interoperability', 'medical specialties', 'novel', 'opioid misuse', 'point of care', 'research and development', 'stem', 'success', 'support tools', 'tool', 'treatment as usual', 'treatment choice', 'unnecessary treatment', 'usability', 'user centered design']",NLM,"PATIENT INSIGHT, INC.",R43,2019,155520,0.032197797694269094
"Health Information Technology for Surveillance of Health Care-Associated Infections PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Health care-associated infections (HAIs) affect one in every 20 hospitalized patients and account for $10 billion dollars in potentially preventable health care expenditures annually. Current efforts at detection of HAIs are limited to manual chart review which hinders the generalizability and scalability of HAI detection. My goal in seeking a Mentored Clinical Scientist Career Development Award is to acquire the necessary training, practical experience, and knowledge to develop a health services research career as a principal investigator focusing on leveraging novel health information technology (HIT) tools to improve the measurement of surgical health care quality, safety, and effectiveness. To continue my progress towards this goal, the objective of this project is to address the challenges of HAI detection by developing a robust and portable automated HAI surveillance toolkit. This toolkit will combine structured electronic health record (EHR) data with rich information locked in clinical notes using machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) to identify HAIs after surgical procedures. Our overall hypothesis is that combining structured variables from the EHR supplemented with NLP will improve our ability to identify HAIs after surgical procedures. To test the central hypothesis and accomplish the objectives for this application, I will pursue the following three specific aims: 1) Determine the EHR data elements indicative of postoperative HAIs and evaluate the performance of a novel HAI surveillance algorithm; 2) Identify the presence of postoperative SSIs from clinical notes using an automated portable NLP-based algorithm; 3) Apply user-centered design to create a high fidelity prototype of a surgical quality dashboard incorporating our HAI case detection methodology. This contribution is a significant first step in a continuum of research that utilizes the large amounts of data in the EHR combined with novel HIT methods to improve the measurement of surgical health-care quality, safety, and effectiveness. This approach is significant because the tools developed in this proposal have potential to serve as a prototype for identification and monitoring hospitals adverse events and could be replicated on a national scale. The proposed research is innovative in its approach using a combination of structured and unstructured data in the EHR along with novel machine learning and NLP tools to create a generalizable surveillance toolkit for the detection of HAIs. This proposal is responsive to the AHRQ Special Emphasis Notice (NOT-HS-13-011) specifically addressing the use of HIT to improve quality measurement. I have assembled a mentoring team who all internationally recognized experts with long and successful track records of funding and trainee mentorship. This project will provide the means to place me on a trajectory towards a health services research career focused on improving the measurement of surgical health-care quality, safety, and effectiveness using novel HIT tools. In summary, my previous training and experience, innovative research plan, high-quality training plan, first-rate mentorship team, and supportive research environment give me the highest likelihood of success to research independence with the proposed K08 award. PROJECT NARRATIVE/RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH The proposed research and career development plan are relevant to public health because health care- associated infections (HAIs) affect about one in every 20 hospitalized patients and account for $30 billion dollars in potentially preventable health care expenditures annually. The objective of this project is to develop robust and portable automated surveillance toolkit that combines structured EHR data with rich information locked in clinical notes using natural language processing to identify HAIs after surgical procedures.

"Enhance Arthroplasty Research through Electronic Health Records and Nlp-Enabled Informatics ABSTRACT Total joint arthroplasty (TJA) is the most common and fastest growing surgical procedure in the nation. Despite the high procedure volume, the evidence base for TJA procedures and associated interventions are limited. This is mainly due to lack of high quality data sources and the logistical difficulties associated with manually extracting TJA information from the unstructured text of the Electronic Health Records (EHR). Meanwhile, the rapid adoption of EHR and the advances in health information technology offer the potential to transform unstructured EHR notes into structured, codified format that can then be analyzed and shared with local and national arthroplasty registries and other agencies. We therefore propose to leverage unique data resources and natural language processing (NLP) technologies to build an informatics infrastructure for automated EHR data extraction and analysis. We will (1) develop a high performance, externally validated and user centric NLP- enabled algorithm for extraction of complex TJA-specific data elements from the structured and unstructured text of the EHR, (2) validate the algorithm externally in multiple EHR platforms and hospital settings, and (3) conduct a demonstration project focused on prediction of prosthetic joint infections using data elements collected by the NLP-enabled algorithm. Our overarching goal is to develop valid, open source and portable NLP-enabled data collection and risk prediction tools and disseminate them widely to hospitals participating in regional and national TJA registries. This research is significant as it leverages strong data resources and expertise to tackle the pressing need for high quality data and accurate prediction models in TJA. Automated data collection and processing capabilities will lead to an upsurge in secondary use of EHR to advance scientific knowledge on TJA risk factors, healthcare quality and patient outcomes. Accurate prediction of high risk patients for prosthetic joint infections will guide prevention and treatment decisions resulting in significant health benefits to TJA patients. The research is innovative because TJA-specific bioinformatics technology will shift TJA research from current under-powered, single-center studies to large, multi-center registry-based observational studies and clinical trials. Our deliverables have the potential to exert a sustained downstream effect on future TJA research, practice and policy. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Lack of high quality data is a critical barrier to progress in total joint arthroplasty (TJA) research. We will utilize health information technology to automate extraction of rich TJA information from the electronic health records, and develop a robust risk prediction score for prosthetic joint infections, a devastating and yet preventable complication of TJA. Widespread adoption of these tools will enhance data collection capabilities and enable affordable large scale studies for practice improvements through secondary use of real-world data. Accurate prediction of post- operative infection risk among TJA candidates will guide individualized preventive strategies for modifiable risk factors, thereby reducing the burden of prosthetic joint infections in TJA patients.",Enhance Arthroplasty Research through Electronic Health Records and Nlp-Enabled Informatics,9657648,R01AR073147,"['Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Bioinformatics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complex', 'Complication', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Element', 'Data Quality', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Documentation', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Epidemic', 'Evidence based practice', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Guide prevention', 'Health Benefit', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Institution', 'Intervention', 'Joint Prosthesis', 'Knowledge', 'Logistics', 'Manuals', 'Marketing', 'Medicare', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Observational Study', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Policies', 'Postoperative Period', 'Prevention', 'Prevention strategy', 'Procedures', 'Provider', 'Publishing', 'Registries', 'Replacement Arthroplasty', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Safety', 'Scientific Advances and Accomplishments', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'United States', 'age group', 'base', 'computerized data processing', 'cost', 'data access', 'data resource', 'electronic data', 'electronic structure', 'epidemiology study', 'evidence base', 'health care quality', 'health information technology', 'high risk', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'infection risk', 'informatics infrastructure', 'informatics\xa0tool', 'innovation', 'joint infection', 'modifiable risk', 'novel', 'open source', 'outcome prediction', 'patient population', 'portability', 'pragmatic trial', 'predictive modeling', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'risk prediction model', 'surgery outcome', 'tool', 'willingness']",NIAMS,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,R01,2019,636882,0.08330302154269341
"Advancing Cancer Pharmacoepidemiology Research Through EHRs and Informatics DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of cancer pharmacoepidemiology is to identify adverse and/or long-term effects of chemotherapeutic agents and determine the impact of drugs on cancer risk, prevention, and response to treatments. Pharmacoepidemiology studies exert strong influence on defining optimal treatments and accelerating translational research. Therefore, it is imperative for these to be done efficiently and leveraging real-world patient data such as electronic health records (EHR). Massive clinical data from EHRs are being tapped into for research in disease-gene associations, comparative effectiveness and clinical outcomes. There is however paucity in pharmacoepidemiological studies using comprehensive EHR data due to the inherent challenges that exist for data abstraction, handling and analysis. The hurdles include heterogeneity of reports, embedding of detailed clinical information in narrative text, differing EHR platforms across different sites and missing data to name a few. In this study, we propose to integrate and extend preexisting tools to build an informatics infrastructure for EHR data extraction, interpretation, management and analysis to advance cancer pharmacoepidemiology research. We will leverage existing tools of natural language processing (NLP), standardized ontologies and clinical data management systems to extract and manipulate EHR data for cancer pharmacoepidemiological research. To achieve our goal we propose four specific aims. In aim 1, we intend to develop a high-performance, user- centric information extraction framework with advanced features such as active learning (to reduce annotation cost), domain adaptation (to transfer data across multiple sites) and user-friendly interfaces (for non-technical end users). In aim 2, we plan to improve data harmonization across differing platforms, develop components for seamless data export as well as expand methodologies to address impediments inherent to EHR-based data (such as the missing data problem). In aim 3, we will conduct demonstration projects of cancer pharmacoepidemiology including pharmacovigilance and pharmacogenomics of chemotherapeutic agents to evaluate, refine and validate the broad uses of our tools. Finally in aim 4, we propose to disseminate the methods and tools developed in this project to the cancer research and pharmacoepidemiology communities. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In this project, we propose to integrate and extend previously developed tools to build an informatics infrastructure for electronic health records (EHR) data extraction, interpretation, management, and analysis, to advance cancer pharmacoepidemiology research. Such methods can efficiently integrate and standardize cancer pharmacoepidemiology specific information from EHRs across different sites, thus advancing research in this field.",Advancing Cancer Pharmacoepidemiology Research Through EHRs and Informatics,9774751,U24CA194215,"['Active Learning', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Advanced Malignant Neoplasm', 'Algorithms', 'American Association of Cancer Research', 'American Society of Clinical Oncology', 'Benefits and Risks', 'CCL4 gene', 'Cancer Intervention', 'Cancer Patient', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical and Translational Science Awards', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Data Aggregation', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Documentation', 'Drug Exposure', 'Drug usage', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ethics', 'Face', 'Funding', 'Genes', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health Policy', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hybrids', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Letters', 'Long-Term Effects', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medex', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Names', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Observational Study', 'Ontology', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacoepidemiology', 'Pharmacogenomics', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Preventive', 'Public Health Informatics', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recurrence', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Selection Bias', 'Site', 'Smoking Status', 'Standardization', 'System', 'Text', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Translational Research', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vision', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'cancer risk', 'cancer type', 'chemotherapeutic agent', 'clinical implementation', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'comparative effectiveness', 'cost', 'data management', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'informatics infrastructure', 'informatics\xa0tool', 'interest', 'learning algorithm', 'longitudinal dataset', 'novel', 'open source', 'optimal treatments', 'pharmacovigilance', 'public health relevance', 'rapid growth', 'success', 'tool', 'treatment response', 'user-friendly']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR HOUSTON,U24,2019,600683,0.06940470421842232
"5/6 COMpAAAS U24: Resource in Informatics and Biostatistics (RIB) The overall aim of the NIAAA-funded Consortium to improve OutcoMes in hiv/Aids, Alcohol, Aging, & multi- Substance use (COMpAAAS) is to build and disseminate the evidence needed to optimize care for HIV+ experiencing medical harm from alcohol and related substance use, through coordinated, integrated, and externally validated observational, operations research modeling, and intervention studies. Combining and integrating the complimentary expertise of informatics, biostatistics and epidemiology, we propose a U24 Resource for Informatics and Biostatistics (RIB) to support and inform the other COMpAAAS components. This resource will address the complex challenges required to maximize power and minimize bias in analyses addressing consortium-wide questions. Advanced informatics methods supported include natural language processing (NLP), ontologies, database and clinical decision support, and application of vital data management tools for secure data collection, storage, annotation, retrieval, and integration. Advanced epidemiological and statistical methods include time-updated exposure techniques, multiple imputation, propensity score techniques, measurement error correction, and competing risks regression. Routine, but essential, statistical methods include Cox proportional hazards, logistic and linear regression, goodness of fit diagnostics, and agreement/accuracy metrics (kappa, sensitivity, specificity, etc.). The RIB will further leverage the observational and interventional studies, simulation models, and well-coordinated network of cores and workgroups of COMpAAAS with advanced informatics and biostatistical techniques tailored to the particular challenges of large scale, longitudinal data from multiple sources including electronic health records (EHR), clinical interventions, patient self-report, and tissue repositories. Our specific aims are to provide 1) statistical and 2) informatics expertise for COMpAAAS to maximize scientific impact. To accomplish this, we will enhance the design, recruitment, and follow-up of intervention studies, support appropriate design and execution of data analyses and cross cohort collaborations, provide advanced statistical methods plus estimates of alcohol patterns for OR modeling and identify sexual/gender minority populations (CHAMP) from VACS survey data. In addition we will enhance the Consortium Web-Based Laboratory (WBL Portal) informatics infrastructure to support ongoing research design, data collection and management, development and testing of interventions such as clinical decision support and eHealth tools and enhance support for the analysis of textual data. The Resource for Informatics and Biostatistics (RIB) will extend and enhance the research capacities and productivity among investigators at the NIAAA-funded Consortium to improve OutcoMes in hiv/AIDS, Alcohol, Aging, and multi-Substance use (COMpAAAS).

"Enhancing Intimate Partner Violence (IPV) Identification through Automated EHR Summarization Project summary Intimate partner violence (IPV) is a significant public health and criminal justice problem that negatively impacts millions of victims yearly in the United States, primarily women (85%). Most IPV-related healthcare visits (83%) occurred in an emergency department (ED), and these clinical encounters are unique opportunities to identify IPV victims and potentially provide assistance. Although numerous health professional organizations have endorsed universal screening and counseling for IPV since 1992, actual screening rates, detection of IPV victims, and referrals to IPV services remain low in the ED. As a result, many IPV victims pass through the ED unidentified and untreated. Computerized screening tools have been developed and implemented in clinical settings in order to assist providers in screening and detecting IPV. However, these tools have a great limitation in that they rely on information collected from the patient and do not utilize the longitudinal data in electronic health records (EHR). Recently, researchers demonstrated that a history of IPV diagnoses and associated clinical symptoms highly predict current and future IPV (OR=7.8), and these important IPV data could serve as red flags that trigger providers to assess patients further for IPV. In order to enhance IPV screening in the ED, we propose to develop and assess an automatic clinical data summarizer that extracts, abstracts and synthesizes patient historical IPV data (structured and unstructured), and delivers patient historical IPV data to ED providers through an intuitive interface. The specific aims are: 1) develop and evaluate natural language processing (NLP) strategies to identify and extract patient historical IPV incidents and timelines from clinic notes; 2) develop and evaluate a web service-based summary tool (IPV-Summary-Service) that synthesizes patient- specific IPV information from both NLP-processed data elements and structured data; and 3) develop and pilot test an enhanced IPV screening strategy that delivers clinical evidence generated by the IPV-Summary- Service through a specific EHR (Epic) to providers during the patient universal IPV screening in the ED. This automatic clinical date summary for IPV will be piloted in one ED at MUSC. There are two major outcomes to be measured for the IPV-Summary enhanced screening for 6 months before and after the index date of pilot testing: 1) rate of successful referral to the IPV 24-hour dedicated IPV nurse; and 2) rate of initiation of referral and identification of persons at high risk of IPV. We will use mixed effect generalized linear regression models to estimate the effects of IPV-Summary on the referral rate and IPV case identification rate. Through survey studies, we will assess secondary outcomes including factors of system feasibility, usability, and providers' satisfaction. These analyses can identify potentially important correlates of the major outcomes and may help us improve the design of the intervention. The results from this study will form the foundation for a broader implementation in a regional health information exchange for EDs. Narrative Computer-based approaches for intimate partner violence (IPV) universal screening have led to significantly higher screening rate and detection rate, as well as receipt of IPV services in the emergency department (ED). However, these approaches rely on information collected from the patient and do not utilize the longitudinal IPV data existing in electronic health records (EHR), which have high predictive power of IPV risk. In order to enhance the effectiveness of IPV screening, we propose to develop and assess an automatic clinical data summary tool that extracts, abstracts, and synthesizes patient historical IPV information from EHR and then delivers that critical information to ED providers at the point of care.",Enhancing Intimate Partner Violence (IPV) Identification through Automated EHR Summarization,9739347,R21LM012945,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Adult', 'American', 'Caring', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Chronic', 'Client', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'Counseling', 'Crime', 'Criminal Justice', 'Data', 'Data Element', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emergency Department patient', 'Emergency department visit', 'Event', 'Face', 'Female', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Health', 'Health Care Visit', 'Health Professional', 'Hour', 'Injury', 'Intuition', 'Linear Regressions', 'Link', 'Masks', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nurses', 'Outcome', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Process', 'Professional Organizations', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Screening procedure', 'Services', 'South Carolina', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'TimeLine', 'Trauma', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Victimization', 'Violent injury', 'Woman', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical practice', 'clinically relevant', 'computerized', 'experience', 'high risk', 'improved', 'indexing', 'intimate partner violence', 'point of care', 'pressure', 'satisfaction', 'screening', 'secondary outcome', 'therapy design', 'tool', 'usability', 'web services']",NLM,MEDICAL UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA,R21,2019,168188,0.011569619575734439
"Interdisciplinary Infrastructure for Aging Research: Rochester Epidemiology Project PROJECT SUMMARY The National Institutes on Aging (NIA) has recommended strengthening research infrastructures to address future aging research questions (2016 Data Infrastructure Review Committee Report and PAR-16-367). In particular, they recommend: 1) integrating biological data into larger population-based studies; 2) increasing use of electronic health record (EHR) data and linking to medical care claims data; and 3) developing new approaches to collecting data to answer important scientific questions about mechanisms of aging. The Rochester Epidemiology Project (REP; NIA R01 AG034676) is a unique infrastructure for studies of aging, because the REP collects longitudinal EHR data on all health conditions that come to medical attention for a large, Midwestern population. Therefore, the REP allows investigators to study all age-related diseases and outcomes. However, the REP has three significant gaps. First, the REP does not include biospecimens. Second, the REP is missing health care delivered outside of the health care institutions that partner with the REP, and it does not include information on filled prescriptions. Third, a significant proportion of EHR data is difficult to access due to two factors: 1) the full text of the EHRs includes extensive clinical notes about aging outcomes and geriatric syndromes, but these notes are not routinely coded for billing, and can only be accessed through laborious manual review; and 2) the REP health care partners use three different EHR systems, making it difficult to apply electronic data extraction tools across all partners. To address these three gaps, we will develop an interdisciplinary collaboration across experts in aging research, epidemiologic methods, biobanking, and medical informatics to create a new, comprehensive research infrastructure (“Bio-REP”) to support aging research. In the R21 phase, we will develop a comprehensive research infrastructure that combines the REP data with Mayo Clinic Biobank biospecimens, medical claims data from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS; Aim 1), and geriatric syndrome data that are included in the unstructured EHR clinical notes using Natural Language Processing techniques (NLP; Aim 2). In the R33 phase, we will deploy NLP algorithms developed in Aim 2 in the clinical notes from two additional EHR systems (Aim 3), and we will conduct two demonstration projects. First, we will measure associations between novel aging-related biomarkers and aging-related outcomes (Aim 4). Second, we will determine whether two common medications that are hypothesized to impact aging (metformin and angiotensin receptor blockers) modify associations between aging biomarkers and aging outcomes (Aim 5). The new, robust Bio-REP infrastructure will support a wide range of efficient, cost-effective observational studies to characterize associations between aging-related biomarkers and specific diseases, geriatric syndromes, and drug utilization. Such studies are urgently needed to design effective clinical trials to improve the health span of the aging population.

"Clinical Informatics to Advance Epidemiology and Pharmacogenetics of Serious Cutaneous Adverse Drug Reactions Project Summary  Severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs) are morbid immunologic reactions to drugs that confer a mortality of 10-50%. Over the last decade, significant promise for prediction and prevention has come from the discovery that many SCARs are associated with variation within HLA class I alleles. For HLA-B*15:02, this has led to routine pre-prescription screening for carbamazepine in many Southeast Asian countries and a significant reduction in cases of carbamazepine SJS/TEN. Despite this progress, there is little known about genetic and epidemiological risk factors for SCARs related to commonly used drugs such as antibiotics. There is also limited information about HLA risk for SCARs across the diverse populations present in the United States. Furthermore, imprecision of clinical phenotyping and lack of standardized coding has led to challenges in finding SCAR cases in the electronic health record (EHR). Our proposed study aims to address critical challenges and gaps in our knowledge of antibiotic SCARs.  In Aim 1, we will leverage advanced informatics and longitudinal EHR data for over 11 million patients from Partners HealthCare System since the 1980s to identify SCAR cases. We will create, optimize and standardize reproducible methods for finding SCAR cases and validating a cohort of SCAR patients. This iterative process will be used to refine and disseminate an electronic phenotype to be validated cross-institutionally.  In Aim 2, we will analyze SCAR prevalence and conduct a case-control study to identify drug-specific and patient-specific risk factors for antibiotic-associated SCARs. We will compare clinical sequelae, quality of life and adherence of SCAR patients compared to controls through validated survey instruments.  In Aim 3, we will identify candidate HLA and genetic associations from patients with validated antibiotic- associated SCARs. We will examine difference in genetic risk in minority and health disparity populations and predict that we will be powered to establish HLA associations for vancomycin DRESS (i.e., drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms) and sulfonamide antimicrobial and beta-lactam SCAR. HLA alone, or in combination with clinical risk factors, can lead to improved SCAR prevention and early diagnosis. We will establish a data sharing platform, in the form of an online electronic phenotype and patient registry, that can be used to enlarge SCAR cohorts for future large-scale genomics studies.  The roadmap we develop will translate into the development of electronic phenotypes for serious adverse drug reactions that facilitate genetic discovery. Knowledge gained will be crucial to the translation of genetic data into clinical decision making. This is in close alignment with NIH’s research mission to accelerate genetic discovery for iatrogenic and preventable drug-induced diseases that will translate into prevention, earlier diagnosis and an enhanced mechanistic understanding that may lead to targeted therapeutic approaches. Narrative  Severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs) result in substantial morbidity, long term disability, health care burden and a mortality of 10-50%. To advance the science of clinical and genetic risk factor identification for antibiotic SCAR, we will leverage large electronic health record (EHR) data and advanced informatics technology. Through case validation we will create an informatics roadmap for other institutions with similar EHR data to identify SCAR cases and we will establish a data sharing platform, including an online electronic phenotype and patient registry, that can be used to enlarge SCAR cohorts for future large-scale genomics studies.",Clinical Informatics to Advance Epidemiology and Pharmacogenetics of Serious Cutaneous Adverse Drug Reactions,9857829,R01AI150295,"['Address', 'Adherence', 'Adverse event', 'Adverse reactions', 'Affect', 'African American', 'Alleles', 'Allergic Reaction', 'Allopurinol', 'Antibiotics', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Autoimmune Process', 'Biological Markers', 'Carbamazepine', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Code', 'Comorbidity', 'Country', 'Cutaneous', 'Data', 'Dermatology', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Drug Administration Routes', 'Drug Exposure', 'Drug Prescriptions', 'Drug usage', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Eosinophilia', 'Epidemiology', 'Ethnic group', 'Female', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic Translation', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'HLA Antigens', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class I', 'Hypersensitivity', 'Iatrogenesis', 'Immunologics', 'Immunology', 'Infection', 'Informatics', 'Inpatients', 'Institution', 'International', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Mandatory Reporting', 'Medical Genetics', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Monobactams', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nevirapine', 'Outpatients', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacogenetics', 'Pharmacology', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Quality of life', 'Race', 'Reaction', 'Registries', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk stratification', 'Science', 'Source', 'Specificity', 'Standardization', 'Stevens-Johnson Syndrome', 'Sulfonamides', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'United States', 'United States Food and Drug Administration', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Vancomycin', 'Variant', 'abacavir', 'adverse drug reaction', 'antimicrobial', 'base', 'beta-Lactams', 'care burden', 'case control', 'case finding', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinical practice', 'clinical risk', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'data sharing', 'data warehouse', 'design', 'disability', 'dosage', 'genetic association', 'genetic risk factor', 'health disparity', 'immunoreaction', 'improved', 'medication compliance', 'medication safety', 'minority health', 'mortality', 'patient population', 'patient registry', 'prevent', 'racial and ethnic', 'screening', 'sex', 'southeast Asian', 'targeted treatment']",NIAID,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2019,689571,0.03732748880500851
"Integrating EHR and Genomics to Predict Multiple Sclerosis Drug Response PROJECT SUMMARY The growing expansion of the approved multiple sclerosis (MS) disease-modifying treatments (DMTs) and the variable responses to MS treatment have created an unmet medical need to provide individually tailored therapy. Efforts to bring precision medicine to provide individualized MS treatment selection have been impeded by our limited understanding of the factors that determine treatment response. While genomics hold the promise for closing this knowledge gap, the insufficient number of patients with detailed treatment response data and the modest effect size of genetic variants that influence treatment responses are the main limiting factors in pharmacogenomics studies. As electronic health records (EHR) become widely adopted and increasingly standardized and as we implement sophisticated computational and statistical methods to harness the EHR data, EHR systems can become cost-effective platforms to perform large-scale treatment response studies in real-life settings. Our team with a history of productive collaborations and diverse expertise (led by PI Dr. Xia) previously developed robust algorithms to identify 5,495 MS patients from the Partners HealthCare EHR systems and then model MS disease activity in these patients using EHR data. The Partners EHR system contains longitudinal clinical information on thousands of MS patients from two large academic medical centers and is linked to a well-characterized MS patient research registry and biobanks with existing genomics data. For the proposed study, we will test the hypothesis that meaningful phenotypes of MS disease activity can be extracted from EHR data to inform treatment response, and that additional common genetic variants exist in the population and can predict therapeutic response in MS when combined with clinical features derived from EHR data. The proposed study has three aims with the overall goal to produce a computational and analytic approach capable of identifying MS disease activity in relation to treatment history using EHR data and integrate with genomics profile to develop a predictive model of therapeutic response to commonly prescribed DMTs in this cohort of 5,495 MS patients, including injectable (interferon-β, glatiramer acetate) and oral (fingolimod, dimethyl fumarate) options. Specifically, we will (1) leverage narrative electronic health records data (e.g., clinical notes, radiology reports) and natural language processing (NLP) to ascertain individualized response to DMTs (n=600 for each DMT); (2) Identify clinical features from electronic health record data (e.g., diagnoses, exposures) that predict response to DMTs using a systematic phenome-wide approach; (3) Develop and test a comprehensive predictive model of individualized response to DMTs that incorporates clinical and genetic predictors. This research has the potential impact to be transformative by contributing to a major knowledge gap regarding the factors that influence treatment response and bringing precision medicine closer to individualized MS treatment selection. PROJECT NARRATIVE AND PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic neurological condition that affects over 400,000 individuals in the United States and creates a high socioeconomic burden as a leading cause of neurological disability in young adults. Because not all patients respond the same way to a specific medication, physicians and MS patients often lose precious time searching for effective treatment with serially testing of costly medications. An individually tailored treatment can ensure early start of effective medication that can prevent relapse and progression of disability. Ultimately, this project will help gain insights into the factors that determine treatment response and enable physicians to match an individual MS patient's clinical and genomic profile with uniquely tailored therapy to maximize effectiveness, delay disease progression and reduce overall cost.",Integrating EHR and Genomics to Predict Multiple Sclerosis Drug Response,9747390,R01NS098023,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Adopted', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Biology', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Computing Methodologies', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Fumarates', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Injectable', 'Interferon-beta', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Link', 'Longitudinal prospective study', 'Manuals', 'Medical', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neurologic', 'Neurologist', 'Oral', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacogenomics', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Recording of previous events', 'Registries', 'Relapse', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Selection for Treatments', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Methods', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'TimeLine', 'Treatment Cost', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States', 'Variant', 'biobank', 'clinical predictors', 'cohort', 'copolymer 1', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'disability', 'effective therapy', 'experience', 'genetic predictors', 'genetic variant', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'genomic profiles', 'individual response', 'individualized medicine', 'insight', 'multiple sclerosis patient', 'multiple sclerosis treatment', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'patient response', 'phenome', 'portability', 'precision medicine', 'predicting response', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'socioeconomics', 'treatment group', 'treatment response', 'young adult']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2019,298872,0.07686752110648665

"ICLIC-MS for Enhancing Outcomes Research and Clinical Care in Multiple Sclerosis PROJECT SUMMARY Cognitive impairment, physical disability and progressive disease are common but understudied clinical outcomes that substantially impact employment and overall quality of life for individuals with multiple sclerosis (MS). We have recently developed and validated an assisted, web-based tool (ICLIC-MS) for systematic and longitudinal clinical outcomes data collection of MS-validated cognitive function measures, physical disability and progressive disease measures that are not reliably captured in the electronic health record (EHR). In response to FOA# PA-17-010, Use of Technology to Enhance Patient Outcomes and Prevent Illness, our team proposes the study of MS outcomes in a large, multi-ethnic population representative sample of more than 3,000 female and male MS cases from the Kaiser Permanente Northern California Health Plan Membership. We will integrate other EHR data such as important comorbid conditions, use of disease modifying therapy, MRI reports, as well as quality of life measures and employment histories. Our goals include: 1) comprehensively characterizing clinical outcomes in a large MS patient cohort; 2) developing and utilizing an integrated MS health report to enhance patient care; and 3) establishing a resource for clinical outcomes research in MS that also includes whole genomic and environmental exposure data. Findings from our proposed study represent an extraordinary opportunity to facilitate effective long-term management of MS, accelerate progress in the understanding of disease pathogenesis, predict patient trajectories and inform prevention strategies. We have assembled a team with strong expertise in clinical neurology/MS neurology, advanced epidemiologic methods, EHR structure and clinical care within a health maintenance organization, human genomics, biostatistics, and big data approaches.

"National Infrastructure for Standardized and Portable EHR Phenotyping Algorithms PROJECT SUMMARY With the rapidly growing adoption of patient electronic health record systems (EHRs) due to Meaningful Use, and linkage of EHRs to research biorepositories, evaluating the suitability of EHR data for clinical and translational research is becoming ever more important, with ramifications for genomic and observational research, clinical trials, and comparative effectiveness studies. A key component for identifying patient cohorts in the EHR is to define inclusion and exclusion criteria that algorithmically select sets of patients based on stored clinical data. This process is commonly referred to, as “EHR-driven phenotyping” is time-consuming and tedious due to the lack of a widely accepted and standards-based formal information model for defining phenotyping algorithms. To address this overall challenge, the proposed project will design, build and promote an open-access community infrastructure for standards-based development and sharing of phenotyping algorithms, as well as provide tools and resources for investigators, researchers and their informatics support staff to implement and execute the algorithms on native EHR data. PROJECT NARRATIVE The identification of patient cohorts for clinical and genomic research is a costly and time-consuming process. This bottleneck adversely affects public health by delaying research findings, and in some cases by making research costs prohibitively high. To address this issue, leveraging electronic health records (EHRs) for identifying patient cohorts has become an increasingly attractive option.

"Data-Mining Clinical Decision Support from Electronic Health Records ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)    Data-Mining Clinical Decision Support from Electronic Health Records Public Health Motivation: National healthcare quality is compromised by undesirable variability, reflected in different locales having anywhere from 20-80% compliance with evidence-based guidelines. Much of this is due to uncertainty, with half of clinical practice guidelines lacking adequate evidence to confirm their efficacy. This is unsurprising when clinical trials cost >$15 million to answer individual clinical questions. The result is medical practice routinely driven by individual opinio and anecdotal experience. While Big Data has revolutionized how society processes internet scale information, the status quo in clinical decision making remains the manual interpretation of literature and isolated decision aids. The adoption of electronic health records (EHR) creates a new opportunity to answer a ""grand challenge in clinical decision support (CDS)."" In a learning health system, we could automatically adapt knowledge from the collective expertise embedded in the EHR practices of real clinicians and close the loop by disseminating that knowledge back as executable decision support.

This proposal will accelerate his transition into an independent physician scientist, towards his long-term goals to produce Big Data technologies that answer such grand challenges in clinical decision support. His near-term objective is developing methods to translate EHR data into useful knowledge in the form of patient- specific, point-of-care clinical order recommendations for acute medical hospitalizations. His doctoral background in computer science gives him the technical capability to achieve these objectives, while his medical training will ensure clinically meaningful results. His preliminary work to build an order recommender, analogous to commercial product recommenders, demonstrates the proposal's overall feasibility. Institutional Environment and Career Development: The research facilities and training opportunities at Stanford University provide the ideal environment to achieve these objectives, with established and growing Centers for Biomedical Informatics Research, the Biomedical Data Science Initiative, and the first Clinical Informatics Fellowship accredited in the nation. Prof. Russ Altman, Director of the Biomedical Informatics Training Program, will lead a collaborative team of mentors with expertise in clinical decision support (Mary Goldstein), implementation science (Steven Asch), data-mining electronic health records (Nigam Shah), statistical learning algorithms (Lester Mackey), and healthcare statistics (Michael Baiocchi). Combined with respective didactic training, this mentorship will enable Dr. Chen to achieve his objectives through a series of research aims. Research Aims: The overriding hypothesis of the proposal is that clinical knowledge reflected in clinical order patterns from historical EHR data can improve medical decision making when adapted into functional clinical decision support. The specific aims each address components of this concept, as they seek to: (1) Develop the algorithms to learn clinical order patterns from historical EHR data, building on a preliminary recommender system; (2) Assess how underlying clinician proficiency affects the quality of those learned clinical order patterns through observational data inference against external standards; and (3) Determine the impact of automatically learned clinical decision support (CDS) on (simulated) clinical workflows through a randomized controlled crossover trial of human-computer interfaces with real clinicians. Expected Results and General Significance: By the completion of the proposed work, Dr. Chen will answer the grand challenge in clinical decision support (CDS) by automating much of the CDS production process, and have direct translational impact with a prototype system. This will advance the field with new paradigms of generating and disseminating clinical knowledge, which can then improve the consistency and quality of healthcare delivery. Additional benefits will include methods to identify and monitor areas of high practice variability for targeted optimization and improve predictive models that inform precision medicine. With this applied research experience and career development, Dr. Chen can compete for R01 funding and become an independent physician scientist developing Big Data approaches to solve national healthcare problems in clinical decision making. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    National healthcare quality is compromised by undesirable practice variability and medical uncertainty, with most medical practice routinely driven by individual opinions and anecdotal experience. With methods analogous to commercial product recommender systems, the proposed project will automatically learn patterns in raw clinical transaction data to capture the undocumented knowledge of real-world clinicians, and close the loop in a learning health system by disseminating that knowledge back as clinical decision support to improve patient care.",Data-Mining Clinical Decision Support from Electronic Health Records,9749154,K01ES026837,"['Accreditation', 'Achievement', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Admission activity', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Applied Research', 'Area', 'Automated Clinical Decision Support', 'Back', 'Big Data', 'Big Data to Knowledge', 'Caring', 'Chiroptera', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Clinical Practice Guideline', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cost efficiency', 'Cross-Over Trials', 'Crowding', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Decision Aid', 'Decision Making', 'Diagnosis', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Exhibits', 'Failure', 'Fellowship', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'Internet', 'Investments', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Locales', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Medical', 'Medical Residency', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Motivation', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Privatization', 'Process', 'Production', 'Public Health', 'Quality of Care', 'Randomized', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Research Training', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Services', 'Societies', 'Source', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Transact', 'Translating', 'Uncertainty', 'Universities', 'User-Computer Interface', 'Validation', 'Weight', 'Work', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'career development', 'clinical care', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical practice', 'clinical predictors', 'computer science', 'cost', 'data mining', 'design', 'evidence based guidelines', 'experience', 'health care delivery', 'health care quality', 'implementation science', 'improved', 'learning algorithm', 'multidisciplinary', 'point of care', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'research facility', 'routine practice', 'statistics', 'support tools', 'training opportunity', 'translational impact']",NIEHS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,K01,2019,178606,-0.0057775535995157985
"Improving missing data analysis in distributed research networks ABSTRACT Electronic health record (EHR) databases collect data that reflect routine clinical care. These databases are increasingly used in comparative effectiveness research, patient-centered outcomes research, quality improvement assessment, and public health surveillance to generate actionable evidence that improves patient care. It is often necessary to analyze multiple databases that cover large and diverse populations to improve the statistical power of the study or generalizability of the findings. A common approach to analyzing multiple databases is the use of a distributed research network (DRN) architecture, in which data remains under the physical control of data partners. Although EHRs are generally thought to contain rich clinical information, the information is not uniformly collected. Certain information is available only for some patients, and only at some time points for a given patient. There are generally two types of missing information in EHRs. The first is the conventionally understood and obvious missing data in which some data fields (e.g., body mass index) are not complete for various reasons, e.g., the clinician does not collect the information or the patient chooses not to provide the information. The second is less obvious because the data field is not empty but the recorded value may be incorrect due to missing data. For example, EHRs generally do not have complete data for care that occurs in a different delivery system. A medical condition (e.g., asthma) may be coded as “no” but the true value would have been “yes” if more complete data had been available, e.g., from claims data as the other delivery system would submit a claim to the patient’s health plan for the care provided. In other words, one may incorrectly treat “absence of evidence” as “evidence of absence”. EHRs hold great promise but we must address several outstanding methodological challenges inherent in the databases, specifically missing data. Addressing missing data is more challenging in DRNs due to different missing data mechanisms across databases. The specific aims of the study are: (1) Apply and assess missing data methods developed in single-database settings to handle obvious and well-recognized missing data in DRNs; (2) Apply and assess machine learning and predictive modeling techniques to address less obvious and under-recognized missing data for select variables in DRNs; and (3) Apply and assess a comprehensive analytic approach that combines conventional missing data methods and machine learning techniques to address missing data in DRNs. The analytic methods developed in this project, including the extension of existing missing data methods to DRNs, the innovative use of machine learning techniques to address missing data, and their integration with privacy- protecting analytic methods, will have direct impact on the design and analysis of future comparative effectiveness and safety studies, and patient-centered outcomes research conducted in DRNs. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed project will refine existing methods and develop new methods to address missing data issues in electronic health record databases.",Improving missing data analysis in distributed research networks,9783740,R01HS026214,[' '],AHRQ,"HARVARD PILGRIM HEALTH CARE, INC.",R01,2019,399886,0.03037155980736578
"Scalable Clinical Decision Support for Individualized Cancer Risk Management Project Summary / Abstract We propose to enable a scalable clinical decision support (CDS) platform that helps clinicians and patients select cancer screening strategies that are best suited to each individual. This kind of CDS is important because increased evidence supports personalizing cancer screening decisions according to each individual's unique cancer risks. While a highly desired goal, individualizing screening at a population scale requires the implementation of patient-specific risk assessments for several types of cancer. This is quite challenging in today's overwhelmed primary care environment. Our proposed CDS platform addresses this challenge by (i) automating the risk stratification process at the population level based on EHR data and patient reported data; (ii) prioritizing patients for case review by genetic counselors; and (iii) automatically communicating risk and screening recommendations with primary care providers and their patients. We will integrate the CDS platform with the Epic EHR and test it at the University of Utah Health Care community clinics and the Huntsman Cancer Institute. We will assess the generalizability of the CDS platform with a different EHR (Cerner) at a different institution (Intermountain Healthcare). To maximize the dissemination potential for the proposed cancer risk screening platform, we will extend two well-established open source CDS platforms: OpenCDS and OpenInfobutton. These platforms are reference implementations of international EHR standards that are required for EHR certification in the US. We will also obtain software certification from the Open Source EHR Alliance, share the CDS platform and our experiences with other awardees in the ITCR Program, present the CDS platform at national and international cancer and informatics conferences; and engage with relevant stakeholders through a technical expert panel. Any healthcare organization with a certified EHR will be able to use the proposed CDS platform. Therefore, if successful, this proposal can have a significant impact on disseminating individualized cancer screening practices according to the best available evidence. The proposed research addresses the need for individualizing cancer screening according to the risk of an individual. We propose to enable software that scans electronic health records of entire patient populations to automatically detect those at a high risk to develop specific types of cancer according to cancer guidelines. Genetic counselors will review patients identified by the software, and discuss optimal cancer screening strategies with the patient and their primary care providers.",Scalable Clinical Decision Support for Individualized Cancer Risk Management,9749060,U24CA204800,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Breast Cancer Detection', 'Breast Cancer Risk Factor', 'Certification', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Community Healthcare', 'Computer software', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Reporting', 'Detection', 'Documentation', 'Ecosystem', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Family', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Incentives', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Information Retrieval', 'Infrastructure', 'Institutes', 'Institution', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Logic', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Modality', 'National Comprehensive Cancer Network', 'Natural Language Processing pipeline', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Population', 'Primary Health Care', 'Process', 'Provider', 'PubMed', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Management', 'Risk stratification', 'Scanning', 'Screening for cancer', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Universities', 'Utah', 'base', 'cancer risk', 'cancer type', 'care providers', 'clinical decision support', 'colorectal cancer risk', 'community clinic', 'design', 'experience', 'genetic counselor', 'health care service organization', 'healthcare community', 'high risk', 'improved', 'incentive program', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'online course', 'online resource', 'open source', 'patient population', 'personalized screening', 'primary care setting', 'programs', 'screening', 'screening guidelines', 'support tools', 'symposium', 'web services']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,U24,2019,733691,0.020425192934152472
"EHR-Based Strategies to Improve Outcomes in Familial Hypercholesterolemia PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is a relatively common genetic disorder characterized by elevated plasma low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and a dramatically increased lifetime risk for premature atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). Available data suggest substantial under treatment of individuals with FH, and it is estimated that <5% of prevalent FH cases in the US are diagnosed and treated. The proposed research will develop electronic health record (EHR)-based strategies to reduce mortality and morbidity from FH. We will develop and validate a phenotyping algorithm for rapid and efficient identification of FH cases thereby enabling EHR-based surveillance of FH. We will deploy the phenotyping algorithm in the population-based setting of Olmsted County, Minnesota, to estimate prevalence and provide hitherto unavailable data on awareness, detection and control of FH. We will develop CDS to help care providers manage FH patients and an FH-specific decision aid to facilitate shared decision making related to lipid-lowering therapy and screening of family members. To accomplish these goals, we will leverage the following resources: a) the electronic phenotyping expertise available in the electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) network; b) the Rochester Epidemiology Project (REP), that links medical records of Olmsted County MN residents thereby capturing nearly all health care delivered to residents of the community; and c) expertise in developing and deploying CDS in the EHR and in creating decision aids for disclosing cardiovascular risk and the benefits of lipid-lowering drugs. Our specific aims are: Aim 1. Develop and validate an electronic phenotyping algorithm to rapidly identify FH cases from the EHR. Aim 2. Conduct an e- epidemiology study to obtain hitherto unknown data regarding prevalence, awareness, detection, control of FH in a population-based setting in the US. Aim 3. a) Develop EHR-based tools to help care providers manage FH and facilitate shared decision making and cascade screening and b) assess outcomes after implementation of CDS and decision aid. The proposed research will enable rapid identification of FH in EHRs, provide hitherto unavailable data on the burden of FH in the community, facilitate EHR-based strategies for early detection, increase awareness of FH among care providers, provide guidance for management of FH at point of care and help both patients and providers make informed decisions about drug therapy and screening of family members. These are critical steps for early detection and treatment of FH to reduce the burden of premature ASCVD due to this condition. PROJECT NARRATIVE Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is a relatively common genetic disorder characterized by high cholesterol levels and increased risk of heart attack or sudden cardiac death. The proposed research will develop electronic health record (EHR)-based strategies to prevent adverse outcomes such as heart attack in FH patients. These include methods to rapidly identify FH patients, estimate prevalence of FH and develop clinical decision support to help care providers manage FH patients.

"Semi-supervised Algorithms for Risk Assessment with Noisy EHR Data PROJECT SUMMARY Large electronic health record research (EHR) data integrated with -omics data from linked biorepositories have expanded opportunities for precision medicine research. These integrated datasets open opportunities for developing accurate EHR-based personalized cancer risk and progression prediction models, which can be easily incorporated into clinical practice and ultimately realize the promise of precision oncology. However, efficiently and effectively using EHR for cancer research remains challenging due to practical and methodological obstacles. For example, obtaining precise event time information such as time of cancer recurrence is a major bottleneck in using EHR for precision medicine research due to the requirement of laborious medical record review and the lack of documentation. Simple estimates of the event time based on billing or procedure codes may poorly approximate the true event time. Naive use of such estimated event times can lead to highly biased estimates due to the approximation error. Such biases impose challenges to performing pragmatic trials when the study endpoint is time to events and captured using EHR. The overall goal of this proposal is to fill these methodological gaps in risk assessment for cancer research using EHR data, which will advance our ability to achieve the promise of precision oncology. Statistical algorithms and software will be developed to (i) automatically assign event time information using longitudinally recorded EHR information; and (ii) to perform accurate risk assessment using noisy proxies of event times. The proposed tools for risk assessment using imperfect EHR data without requiring extensive manual chart review could greatly improve the utility of EHR for oncology research. PROJECT NARRATIVE This proposal addresses major methodological gaps in effectively utilizing EHR data for risk assessment due to the noisy nature of EHR data. We propose novel statistical algorithms and software to (i) efficiently annotate event time by combining multiple longitudinally recorded code information and (ii) to provide precise risk estimates using noisy proxies of event times. By drawing upon the rich albeit imperfect data from bio-repository linked EHR, our algorithms will advance our ability to use EHR data for precision oncology research.",Semi-supervised Algorithms for Risk Assessment with Noisy EHR Data,9827744,R21CA242940,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Biological', 'Boston', 'Cancer Patient', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Cohort Studies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Documentation', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Event', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Healthcare', 'Infrastructure', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Medical Records', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Nature', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Procedures', 'Progression-Free Survivals', 'Proxy', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Estimate', 'Software Tools', 'Source', 'Statistical Algorithm', 'Supervision', 'Testing', 'Time', 'adjudicate', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'biobank', 'cancer recurrence', 'cancer risk', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'electronic data', 'evidence base', 'genomic data', 'improved', 'learning algorithm', 'multimodality', 'novel', 'oncology', 'patient population', 'patient subsets', 'pragmatic trial', 'precision medicine', 'precision oncology', 'predictive modeling', 'repository', 'supervised learning', 'tool', 'tumor progression', 'user friendly software', 'web site']",NCI,HARVARD SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH,R21,2019,192385,0.08924746723729875
"Resource Curation and Evaluation for EHR Note Comprehension Title: Resource Curation and Evaluation for EHR Note Comprehension The American Diabetes Association estimates that over 25.8 million Americans have diabetes.

"Machine Learning to Determine Dynamically Evolving New-Onset Venous Thromboembolic (VTE) Event Risk in Hospitalized Patients Failure to rescue (FTR), a nurse-sensitive national metric of health care quality, refers to death of a hospitalized patient from a treatable complication, and is potentiated by failure to recognize and appropriately respond to early signs of complications. There is a paucity of research examining patient features predictive of FTR complications. Such information could shift the current paradigm of nursing surveillance to earlier recognition, prevention and treatment of FTR complications, thereby saving lives. New-onset venous thromboembolism (VTE), an FTR complication occurring as either a deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or a pulmonary embolism (PE), is the leading cause of preventable hospital death, carrying a high risk of mortality and a national cost burden of $7 billion annually. VTE is a complex disease process involving interactions between clinical risk factors and acquired and/or inherited susceptibilities to thrombosis. Although biomarkers and clinical factors associated with VTE have been identified, clinical manifestations are subtle, presenting gradually over hours to days. Current VTE risk assessment models (RAM), the cornerstone of prevention, have limited utility due to their complexity and lack of reliability, generalizability and external validation. A critical gap in VTE risk modeling research is that while new-onset VTE pathology evolves over the course of hospitalization, no current models incorporate the progressive accrual of dynamic patient data and pattern evolution over time in their modeling approaches. The totality of routinely collected electronic health record (EHR) data is massive in terms of volume, variety, and production at a rapid velocity in real-time. Such big data could be used in machine learning (ML) analytic approaches to process time series clinical data to identify subtle, evolving feature patterns predictive of new-onset VTE and address this gap. This study proposes to assemble a large scale, multi-source, multi-dimensional VTE study dataset, and in tandem, systematically define the EHR data elements associated with a new-onset VTE diagnosis for computable phenotype algorithm development. We will then apply machine learning analytic approaches to baseline and accruing intensive time series clinical data in the curated dataset to develop models identifying data patterns and features predictive of dynamically evolving new-onset VTE in adult hospitalized patients. This proposal aligns with NINR’s strategic vision for nurse scientists to employ new strategies for collecting and analyzing complex big data sets to permit better understanding of the biological underpinnings of health, and improve ways nurses prevent and manage illness. This innovative study and individualized training plan under a strong and well- established team, represents initial steps in the applicant’s research trajectory focused on data science approaches to predict FTR complication risk, and develop, implement and test dynamic RAMs to inform targeted prevention and treatment decisions. Discovering new knowledge informing real-time decision making, nursing surveillance practices and care delivery systems can improve nurse sensitive patient outcomes. PROJECT NARRATIVE Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is the leading cause of preventable hospital death. This study first proposes to develop a reproducible computable phenotype definition for new-onset VTE cohort ascertainment from the electronic health record, and then develop dynamic models for VTE risk assessment through the application of machine learning algorithms to massive electronic health record clinical data repositories. Such models can inform the mechanisms underlying this complex disease and identify subtle pattern changes in a patient’s condition forecasting a VTE event, enabling earlier nurse identification and intervention, and decreasing the development of complications and failure to rescue in hospitalized patients.",Machine Learning to Determine Dynamically Evolving New-Onset Venous Thromboembolic (VTE) Event Risk in Hospitalized Patients,9610301,F31NR018102,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Adverse event', 'Algorithms', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Censuses', 'Cessation of life', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Code', 'Cohort Studies', 'Complex', 'Complication', 'Data', 'Data Element', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Deep Vein Thrombosis', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Discipline of Nursing', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Failure', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Logic', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nurses', 'Pathology', 'Patient Triage', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Production', 'Pulmonary Embolism', 'Quality of Care', 'Readability', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Savings', 'Scientist', 'Selection for Treatments', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Series', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Source', 'Standardization', 'System', 'Testing', 'Thromboembolism', 'Thrombosis', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Failure', 'Validation', 'Venous', 'Vision', 'base', 'care delivery', 'clinical data warehouse', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical risk', 'cohort', 'cost', 'disease phenotype', 'health care quality', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'mortality', 'prevent']",NINR,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,F31,2018,44524,0.03699590324284152
"Advancing Chronic Condition Symptom Cluster Science Through Use of Electronic Health Records and Data Science Techniques Despite their adverse impact on patient quality of life and healthcare utilization and costs, symptom clusters (SCs) in common adult chronic conditions such as cancer, heart failure (HF), type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are understudied and poorly understood. The lack of access to real world, longitudinal patient symptom data sets and inability to adequately model the complexity of SCs has greatly limited research. Based on our previous work, we propose that these gaps can be addressed in an innovative way using electronic health records (EHRs) and data science techniques. Our overall objective is to develop, apply and refine, and implement an optimized data processing and analysis pipeline for the characterization of SCs in common adult chronic conditions for use with EHR data. We hypothesize that a core set of SCs is shared among all common adult chronic conditions and that distinct SCs characterize specific conditions and/or treatments. The long term training goal of this project is to assist Dr. Koleck in becoming an independent investigator conducting a program of research dedicated to mitigating symptom burden in patients with chronic conditions through use of informatics and omics (e.g., genomics and proteomics), the focus of her pre-doctoral work. Using exceptional resources available from Columbia University, the K99 phase of this project will focus on the development of a rigorous pipeline; essential competencies in SC analysis and interpretation; and the data science techniques of clinical data mining, natural language processing, machine learning, and data visualization. In the R00 phase, Dr. Koleck will independently implement the pipeline in another medical center to determine the reproducibility of identified SCs and begin to explore clinical predictors (e.g., socio-demographics, laboratory results, and medications) of SCs. The specific aims are to 1) develop a data-driven pipeline for the characterization of SCs from EHRs using a cohort of adult patients diagnosed with cancer, as SCs have been most systematically characterized in this condition; 2) apply the pipeline to three other common adult chronic conditions that share biological and behavioral risk factors with cancer, i.e., HF, T2DM, and COPD, and evaluate SCs in these conditions; and 3) determine if SCs differ for cancer, HF, T2DM, and COPD when implementing the pipeline within another medical center and explore clinically relevant, EHR- documented predictors of identified SCs. To accomplish research aims and training goals, an interdisciplinary team of scientists with expertise in symptom science, biomedical informatics, data science, pertinent clinical domains, and career development mentorship has been assembled. This research is significant because a pipeline that accommodates the format in which symptom data is already being documented in EHRs has the potential to greatly accelerate the acquisition of SC knowledge and expedite clinical translation of symptom mitigation strategies. Given the array of new competencies to be developed, this K99/R00 award is necessary for achieving the candidate’s career goal of advancing chronic condition symptom science. The proposed research is relevant to public health because adult patients diagnosed with chronic conditions are frequently burdened by two or more co-occurring, related symptoms. Development of an optimized process to study multiple symptoms collected in patient electronic health records has the potential to lead to new knowledge and improved symptom management. The proposed research addresses the NINR theme of “symptom science” and a key area in the NINR Strategic Plan, “taking advantage of innovations in data science in order to develop interventions to promote health and wellness that are leading-edge, effective, and translatable to clinical practice.”",Advancing Chronic Condition Symptom Cluster Science Through Use of Electronic Health Records and Data Science Techniques,9504168,K99NR017651,"['18 year old', 'Academic Medical Centers', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Advance Directives', 'American', 'Anxiety', 'Area', 'Award', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical assessments', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Code', 'Competence', 'Complement', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Depressed mood', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dyspnea', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Equipment and supply inventories', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Fatigue', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Promotion', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heart failure', 'Impaired cognition', 'Informatics', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Knowledge acquisition', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mastectomy', 'Medical Genetics', 'Medical center', 'Mentorship', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nausea', 'Nausea and Vomiting', 'Neurobehavioral Manifestations', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Pain', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Postoperative Nausea and Vomiting', 'Procedures', 'Proteomics', 'Pruritus', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Race', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk Factors', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Sleep disturbances', 'Strategic Planning', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Woman', 'Work', 'Xerostomia', 'base', 'biomarker discovery', 'biomedical informatics', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical data warehouse', 'clinical practice', 'clinical predictors', 'clinical translation', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'computerized data processing', 'data mining', 'data visualization', 'data warehouse', 'demographics', 'electronic data', 'experience', 'health care service utilization', 'health data', 'innovation', 'knowledge translation', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'oncology', 'patient oriented', 'pre-doctoral', 'process optimization', 'programs', 'statistics', 'symptom cluster', 'symptom management', 'symptom science', 'symptomatic improvement', 'unsupervised learning']",NINR,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,K99,2018,90050,-0.005243027332134091
"Natural Language Question Understanding for Electronic Health Records ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Patient information in the electronic health record (EHR) such as lab results, medications, and past medical history is the basis for physician decisions about patient care. It also helps patients better understand and manage their care. Efficient access to this patient information is thus essential. One of the most intuitive ways of accessing data is by asking natural language questions. A significant amount of work in medical question answering has been conducted, yet little work has been performed in question answering for EHRs. Natural language questions can be represented in logical forms, a standard structured knowledge representation technique. This project proposes to take natural language EHR questions, both for doctors and patients, and automatically convert them to a logical form. The logical forms can then be converted to a structured query such as those used by EHRs. A major obstacle to this approach is the lack of data containing questions annotated with logical forms. This project hypothesizes that a small set of questions can be manually annotated, and then paraphrases can be produced for each annotated question. Since paraphrasing is a simpler task than logical form annotation, crowd-sourcing techniques can be used to collect thousands of question paraphrases. This question paraphrase corpus will then be used to build a semantic grammar capable of recognizing the logical structure of EHR questions. To ensure a robust, generalizable grammar, existing NLP techniques will be used to pre-process questions, simplifying their syntactic structure and abstracting their medical concepts.     In order to develop such a method, the candidate, Dr. Kirk Roberts, requires additional training and mentoring in natural language processing and biomedical informatics. This application for the NIH Pathway to Independence Award (K99/R00) describes a career development plan that will allow Dr. Roberts to achieve the goals of this project as well as transition to a career as an independent researcher. He will be mentored by Dr. Dina Demner-Fushman, a leading medical NLP researcher, and co-mentored by Dr. Clement McDonald, a leading EHR and medical informatics researcher.     The specific aims of the project are: (1) Build a paraphrase collection of EHR questions, where each prototype question will have many unique paraphrases. The paraphrases encompass different lexical and syntactic means of conveying the same logical form. (2) Construct a semantic grammar for EHR questions. The grammar can then be used to convert a natural language question to a logical form. (3) Implement an end- to-end question analyzer that generalizes EHR questions for improved parsing, parses the question into a logical form using the grammar, and converts the logical form into a leading structured EHR query format. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed work aims to significantly improve the ability of both doctors and patients to find information within electronic health records (EHR). By providing an interface to EHRs where users can specify their information needs in the form of a natural language question, the proposed work provides a more intuitive means of finding patient data than is currently available.",Natural Language Question Understanding for Electronic Health Records,9479293,R00LM012104,"['Artificial Intelligence', 'Award', 'Blood Glucose', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development Plans', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Glucose', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Intuition', 'Knowledge', 'Literature', 'Manuals', 'Medical', 'Medical History', 'Medical Informatics', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Process', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Semantics', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'TimeLine', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'abstracting', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'career', 'career development', 'crowdsourcing', 'data access', 'design', 'electronic structure', 'health data', 'illiterate', 'improved', 'information organization', 'lexical', 'natural language', 'open source', 'operation', 'patient portal', 'phrases', 'prototype', 'syntax']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR HOUSTON,R00,2018,248999,0.054382557527370624
"From enrichment to insights Project Summary Most medical decisions are made without the support of rigorous evidence in large part due to the cost and complexity of performing randomized trials for most clinical situations. In practice, clinicians must use their judgement, informed by their own and the collective experience of their colleagues. The advent of the electronic health record (EHR) enables the modern practitioner to algorithmically check the records of thousands or millions of patients to rapidly find similar cases and compare outcomes. In addition to filling the inferential gap in actionable evidence, these kinds of analyses avoid issues of ethics, practicality, and generalizability that plague randomized clinical trials (RCTs). Unfortunately, identifying patients with the appropriate phenotypes, properly leveraging available data to adjust results, and matching similar patients to reduce confounding remain critical challenges in every study that uses EHR data. Overcoming these challenges to improve the accuracy of observational studies conducted with EHR data is of paramount importance. Studies using EHR data begin by defining a set of patients with specific phenotypes, analogous to amassing a cohort for a clinical trial. This process of electronic phenotyping, is typically done via a set of rules defined by experts. Machine learning approaches are increasingly used to complement consensus definitions created by experts and we propose several advances to validate and improve this practice. We will explore and quantify the effects of feature engineering choices to transform the diagnoses, procedures, medications, laboratory tests and clinical notes in the EHR into a computable feature matrix. Finally, building on recent advances, we plan to characterize the performance of existing methods and develop EHR-specific strategies for patient matching. Our work is significant because we will take on three challenging problems--electronic phenotyping, feature engineering, and patient matching--that stand in the way of generating insights via EHR data. If we are successful, we will significantly advance our ability to generate insights from the large amounts of health data that are routinely generated as a byproduct of clinical processes. Narrative The advent of the electronic health record (EHR) enables the search of thousands or millions of patients to rapidly find similar cases and compare outcomes.

"Bayesian Generative Methods for Extracting and Modeling Relations in EHR Narratives Project Summary Medicine has evolved into an era where the entire hospital progressively adopts more real-time monitoring for the patients and generates ICU like clinical data. The rapidly growing data makes ICU a snapshot for tomorrow’s standard of care that should benefit from computer-aided decision making. These data contain not only numerical or coded information, but also a large volume of unstructured narrative text such as physicians’ and nurses' notes, specialists' reports, and discharge summaries. Both types of data have been shown to be highly informative for tasks such as cohort selection, and work best in combination. However, to achieve this, specific bits of information must be extracted from the narrative reports and coded in formal representation. These bits include medical concepts such as symptoms, diseases, medications and procedures; characteristics such as certainty, severity, dose; assertions about these items, such as whether they pertain to the patient or a family member, etc.; relations among these mentions, including indications of what condition is treated by what action and its degree of success, the time sequence and duration of events, and interpretations of laboratory test results as relations among medical concepts such as cells and antigens (e.g., “[large atypical cells] express [CD30]”). Concepts and assertions can be regarded as simple relations, and our proposal focuses on modeling narrative relations to augment structured data for predicting patient outcomes. Most existing techniques for interpreting clinical narratives either rely on hand-crafted rule systems and large medical thesauri or are based on machine learning models that create classification or regression models from large annotated data sets. The former are difficult and laborious to generalize, whereas the latter require large volumes of human-labeled data and may result in models whose operation is difficult to interpret and is therefore considered unsuitable for computer-aided decision making. We propose to build on our previous work to use unsupervised learning methods that identify frequent patterns in un-annotated narratives and identify informative patterns by tensor factorization. Although existing methods can also identify patterns that are meaningful in a data-driven sense, these patterns are difficult for clinicians to understand. Our specific goal is to develop a novel method that uses a Bayesian generative model that integrates relation mining with tensor factorization to learn patterns that correspond to an understanding of the clinical domain and can be used for evidence based patient outcome prediction. Our framework represents relations in clinical narratives as graphs, then mines subgraphs for important relations. These relations are used as features in building up a tensor model in order to reduce dimensionality, discover coherent groups of relations, and explore the group interactions. We develop Bayesian formulation to integrate relation mining and tensor modeling in a generative model, to incorporate existing medical knowledge as probability priors, as well as to reliably estimate the posterior probabilities and confidence intervals of any findings from the model. Rapid growth in the hospital adoption of large volume of Electronic Health Records (EHRs) has led to an unprecedented availability of narrative dataset for clinical and translational research. We propose the development of a novel Bayesian generative framework to enable extraction of accurate and clinically meaningful patterns of EHR narratives in order to support evidence based diagnostic reasoning and outcome risk prediction.",Bayesian Generative Methods for Extracting and Modeling Relations in EHR Narratives,9535479,R21LM012618,"['Admission activity', 'Adopted', 'Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Antigens', 'Appearance', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Code', 'Cognitive', 'Computer Assisted', 'Confidence Intervals', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Event', 'Family member', 'Formulation', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Hand', 'Hodgkin Disease', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Lymphoma', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'National Research Council', 'Nurses', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Pathology Report', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Probability', 'Procedures', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Severities', 'Source', 'Specialist', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'TNFRSF8 gene', 'Techniques', 'Test Result', 'Text', 'Thesauri', 'Time', 'To specify', 'Translational Research', 'Work', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'clinical decision support', 'cohort', 'data warehouse', 'diagnostic panel', 'evidence base', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'mortality', 'novel', 'operation', 'outcome prediction', 'patient oriented', 'rapid growth', 'real time monitoring', 'standard of care', 'success', 'unsupervised learning']",NLM,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R21,2018,181755,0.02902906158290324
"Algorithms to Identify Systemic Lupus from Electronic Health Record Data Abstract  Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic, autoimmune, multisystem disease that is often difficult to diagnose because of the diverse manifestations that occur over time and across care sites leading to increased damage and early mortality. The personal and economic costs in decreased quality of life and increase in healthcare expenditures, respectively, highlight the critical unmet need to develop new therapeutic strategies to treat lupus, so that treatment or participation in clinical trials occurs as early as possible to mitigate against disease-related damage. Therefore, it is important to find better ways to identify SLE patents.  Electronic health records (EHR) are now used in a majority of health care settings throughout the country, and present a rich source of information about patients which can be mined for earlier diagnosis and identification to improve quality of care, or enable high throughput clinical studies. Despite this potential, to date few accurate algorithms have been developed to identify SLE patients using EHR data. Construction of an effective algorithm, either by rule-based or machine learning methods, requires access to at two data resources not commonly available: 1) a validated “gold standard” patient data set with clear documentation of criteria that are indicative of SLE that can be compared against EHR data and 2) an integrated health record dataset that contains data from multiple health care institutions and reflects that SLE patients receive healthcare at multiple institutions and healthcare providers given their chronic, progressive disease. Over the past several years, our team has created both key resources: the Chicago Lupus Database (CLD), a physician-validated registry of 880 patients and gold standard data set and the Chicago HealthLNK Data Repository (HDR), a regional data resource including integrated medical records for 2.1 million patients across multiple institutions. Jointly, these two datasets enable the creation, testing and validation of algorithms for the identification of SLE in EHR data and provide a more complete picture of a patient population at risk for lupus.  We propose three specific aims to address the need to reduce the time to identify those with SLE in order to initiate treatment in a timelier fashion and to identify candidates for clinical trials. These aims are: 1) To create and validate a series of algorithms to identify SLE patients in EHR data against a gold standard curated registry, CLD, using validated classification criteria for SLE to build concepts for rule-based and machine learning methods that incorporate structured data, laboratory data, and unstructured data, e.g., physician notes, 2) To determine whether identification of SLE patients is improved when algorithms to identify SLE patients are extended to an integrated medical record dataset that includes data from multiple health care institutions, and 3) To use clustering techniques on SLE patients identified from EHR data to isolate clinically distinct sub-populations of patients, which could inform patient selection for participation in clinical trials.

"Addressing Bias from Missing Data in EHR Based Studies of CVD Project Summary This NHLBI K01 application supports the career development of Dr. Nrupen A. Bhavsar, PhD, an Assistant Professor of Medicine at the Duke University School of Medicine. Dr. Bhavsar is a chronic disease epidemiologist who has performed multidisciplinary studies in the epidemiology of CVD, chronic kidney disease and cancer. He is passionate about pursuing a career in clinical research at the intersection of epidemiology, informatics, and biostatistics. At the end of the award period, Dr. Bhavsar will be an independent investigator applying knowledge gained through this K01 to develop large scale EHR-based population studies that identify individuals at high risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD) events. Through training in data linkage, machine learning, and causal inference, he will apply missing data methods to conduct rigorous non-randomized studies to improve health. The topical areas of the proposed training and research are diabetes and incident CVD events in the application of data linkage, machine learning, and causal inference. Career development aim: Obtain transdisciplinary competencies within informatics, biostatistics, and population sciences to investigate methodological challenges inherent in the use of multi-health system EHR data for clinical research. The training approach will leverage didactic and experiential training complemented by analyses of data derived from a multi-health system, multi-state research collaborative. Study population: Patients who received care at one of the North Carolina or South Carolina “Carolinas Collaborative” institutions (Duke University Medical Center, UNC-CH Health System, Wake Forest Baptist Health Center, and 9 additional health systems collaborating within the Health Sciences of South Carolina institutions). Specific aims: This proposal will identify approaches to account for missing data when patients seek care across multiple health systems but EHR data is only available from a single health system. Estimating the systemic bias introduced by missing data for single institution studies and identifying methods for accounting for missing data biases may improve the ability of EHR data to be used for clinical research. Anticipated results: Through this NHLBI K01 Research Scientist Career Development Award, Dr. Bhavsar will acquire essential training and research experience to develop large scale EHR-based population studies in CVD. PROJECT NARRATIVE Data from the electronic health records (EHR) are increasingly being used for clinical research, yet there is limited information on the best approaches to address the methodological limitations of the EHR, such as missing data.

"PED Screen: Pediatric Sepsis EHR Registry, Clinical Outcomes, and Predictive Model Project Summary/Abstract Each year over 75,000 children develop sepsis in the United States resulting in substantial morbidity, up to 20% mortality, and billions in US health care expenditures. There have been substantial advances that demonstrate improved patient outcomes with adherence to early aggressive emergency care. However, methods to accurately, reliably, and rapidly identify children who require these resource-intensive therapies are lacking. In addition, understanding the impact of these therapies on near-term outcomes, before significant morbidity occurs, is also lacking. Current algorithms do not reliably discriminate between patients who develop sepsis and those who are clinically similar upon initial presentation but do not progress to sepsis. As a result, children requiring life-saving treatments do not receive them, or do not receive them in a timely fashion, and others may be over-treated, wasting healthcare resources and potentially diverting emergency care from those in need. With the advent of electronic health records (EHR), there are now information-enabled solutions that offer unique opportunities to identify non-biased, heterogeneous samples of children and allow us to accurately and reliably measure risk factors and near-term outcomes for sepsis. This work addresses the critical need to improve pediatric sepsis outcomes by developing methods to accurately identify at-risk children presenting for emergency care. Utilizing the infrastructure of the Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network (PECARN), this proposal will innovatively capture EHR data to create a multi-center registry with the ultimate goal to improve the detection and treatment of pediatric sepsis in the ED setting. To accomplish this, we propose the following specific aims: We will develop an expanded multicenter sepsis registry for pediatric patients from merged electronic health record clinical data from different hospitals with different EHR data sources. We will automate the determination of organ dysfunction in children with sepsis directly from structured and narrative data within the multicenter EHR registry. From the registry and outcome data, we will derive and validate a prediction model of pediatric sepsis using emergency department EHR data from the first 4 hours of care that predicts subsequent organ dysfunction within 48 hours. Each of these aims works to the goal of improving the emergent care for pediatric sepsis with innovative deliverables from this project including the existence of a broad and rich EHR registry, an automated process of outcome determination, and a prediction model of risk of sepsis. We will also have a strong foundation for future projects to implement and evaluate decision support tools, improve diagnostic techniques, engage in comparative effectiveness studies, measure quality of care, establish linked bio-repositories, and guide clinical trial design. The proposed project, thus, has enormous potential to improve our ability to improve the quality of care provided to our most acutely ill children.  Project Narrative Sepsis is a leading cause of pediatric morbidity and mortality with life-saving treatment dependent on early and accurate identification. We will establish a multi-center data registry from electronic health records (EHR), identify a multi-center cohort of pediatric patients at risk for sepsis, automate sepsis-related pediatric organ dysfunction directly from the registry EHR data, and develop an emergency department based prediction model of sepsis related organ dysfunction. Each of these aims has the ultimate goal of improving the emergent care for pediatric sepsis with innovative deliverables from this project including the existence of a broad and rich EHR registry, the automated process of important proximal outcome determination, and an emergency department prediction model of risk of sepsis. ","PED Screen: Pediatric Sepsis EHR Registry, Clinical Outcomes, and Predictive Model",9419932,R01HD087363,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Achievement', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adherence', 'Algorithms', 'Applied Research', 'Blood Pressure', 'Caring', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Derivation procedure', 'Detection', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emergency Care', 'Emergent care', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health Expenditures', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Inpatients', 'Intervention', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Organ', 'Organ failure', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Quality of Care', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Savings', 'Sepsis', 'Shock', 'Site', 'Structure', 'Time', 'United States', 'United States Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality', 'Visit', 'Work', 'base', 'cohort', 'comparative effectiveness', 'data registry', 'design', 'effective intervention', 'electronic registry', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'member', 'mortality', 'novel', 'patient registry', 'pediatric emergency', 'pediatric patients', 'predictive modeling', 'repository', 'septic patients', 'support tools', 'wasting']",NICHD,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R01,2018,623932,0.0322840756750685
"Better Outcomes for Children: Promoting Excellence in Healthcare Genomics to Inform Policy ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In May 2012 Cincinnati Children's (CCHMC) joined eMERGE II with our Boston Children's partner. Since then we have developed algorithms for the electronic health record (EHR), led the Pediatric Workgroup, developed pharmacogenomics, evaluated the preferences of parents and caregivers to advance genomic medicine and assimilated technical advances into our EHR. The eMERGE effort has become the basic fabric of the institutional initiative to incorporate the extraordinary advances of genetics, genomics and the electronic medical record into healthcare. In addition, we bring a comprehensive EHR (EPIC), operating in every venue for healthcare delivery at CCHMC; a deidentified i2b2 data warehouse of 1.2 million patient records; and a Biobank with 150,000 consents that allow return of results to 38,000 patients and guardians who have provided 58,000 DNA samples, all with consent to return results and i2b2 EHR records. Now, we present our plan to join the eMERGE III network with 17 proposed initiatives. Our eMERGE effort is designed to move an entire institution with our eMERGE III partners into a genomic-EHR era of healthcare implementation and discovery. Our effort is divided into Genomics , Aim 1, where we hope to help the eMERGE III Steering Committee identify the 100 or so genes for the eMERGE III Targeted Gene Panel (eTGP), select our 2,000 CCHMC patients to be sequenced (of the 38,000 in our Biobank), review 4,000 targeted gene panels from clinical care at CCHMC for somatic mosaicism and reinterpretation, and further develop and disseminate a software workflow suite for sequence analysis (CASSI). For Phenotypes, Aim 2, we will extend our work generating EHR phenotype algorithms using heuristic and machine learning methods with a comprehensive set of EHR features derived from data driven algorithms to describe phenotypic pleiotropy of eTGP gene variants. We will develop working collaborations with Patients Care Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI) and the Million Veterans Program by applying eMERGE developed EHR algorithms to these large electronic data warehouses. For Implementation and Evaluation, Aim 3, we will develop tools to evaluate adolescent return of results preferences, examine the ethical and legal obligations and potential to reanalyze results, analyze the cost of tacrolimus management of kidney transplant with and without CYP3A5 testing, develop clinical decision support for phenotyping, test ordering, and returning eTGP results. Our success in these eMERGE III studies will be enhanced by the ongoing institutional investments made in the CCHMC BioBank, the comprehensive EHR (EPIC), and the i2b2 deidentified medical record data warehouse, and hundreds of Faculty and senior staff who make genomics or informatics an active focus of their research. We present a comprehensive program addressing all of the salient elements presented in the RFP for eMERGE III (HG-14-025) to enhance our collaborative productivity within the eMERGE Network in ways that ultimately improve our healthcare systems through discovery, implementation, and advanced applications of genomics and informatics. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center (CCHMC) proposes to contribute as a funded site in the eMERGE III Network by pursuing a series of initiatives designed to advance genomics and the electronic health record (EHR).

"Efficient Statistical Learning Methods for Personalized Medicine Using Large Scale Biomedical Data Project Summary/Abstract  Current medical treatment guidelines largely rely on data from randomized controlled trials that study av- erage effects, which may be inadequate for making individualized decisions for real-world patients. Large-scale electronic health records (EHRs) data provide unprecedented opportunities to optimize personalized treatment strategies and generate evidence relevant to real-world patients. However, there are inherent challenges in the use of EHRs, including non-experimental nature of data collection processes, heterogeneous data types with complex dependencies, irregular measurement patterns, multiple dynamic treatment sequences, and the need to balance risk and beneﬁt of treatments. Using two high-quality EHR databases, Columbia University Medical Center's clinical data warehouse and the Indiana Network for Patient Care database, and focusing on type 2 diabetes (T2D), this proposal will develop novel and scalable statistical learning approaches that overcome these challenges to discover optimal personalized treatment strategies for T2D from real-world patients. Speciﬁcally, under Aim 1, we will develop a uniﬁed framework to learn latent temporal processes for feature extraction and dynamic patient records representation. Our approach will accommodate large-scale variables of mixed types (continuous, binary, counts) measured at irregular intervals. They extract lower-dimensional components to reﬂect patients' dynamic health status, account for informative healthcare documentation processes, and characterize similarities between patients. Under Aim 2, we will develop fast and efﬁcient multi-category machine learning methods, in order to evaluate treatment propensities and adaptively learn optimal dynamic treatment regimens (DTRs) among the extensive number of treatment options observed in the EHRs. The methods will provide se- quential decisions that determine the best treatment sequence for a T2D patient given his/her EHRs. Under Aim 3, we will develop statistical learning methods to assist multi-faceted treatment decision-making, which balances risks versus beneﬁts when evaluating a DTR. Our approach will ensure maximizing beneﬁt to the greatest extent while controlling all risk outcomes under the safety margins. For all aims, we will develop efﬁcient stochastic resampling algorithms to scale up the optimization for massive data sizes. We will identify optimal DTRs for T2D using the extracted information from patients' comorbidity conditions, medications, and laboratory tests, as well as records-collection processes. Our methodologies will be applied and cross-validated between the two EHR databases. The treatment strategies learned from the representative EHR databases with a diverse patient pop- ulation will be beneﬁcial for individual patient care, assisting clinicians to adaptively choose the optimal treatment for a patient. Finally, we will disseminate our methods and results through freely available software and outreach to the informatics and clinical experts at our Centers for Translational Science and elsewhere. Project Narrative  This proposal aims to develop novel and scalable statistical learning methods to analyze electronic health records (EHRs) and use two real-world, high-quality EHR databases for personalized medicine research. The methods will handle the non-experimental nature of data collection processes, along with heterogeneous data types, dynamic treatment sequences, and the trade-off between benefit and risk outcomes. The results will complement the current knowledge base for individual patient care using evidence generated from patients in real-world clinical practices.",Efficient Statistical Learning Methods for Personalized Medicine Using Large Scale Biomedical Data,9519452,R01GM124104,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Address', 'Adverse event', 'Algorithms', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Categories', 'Center for Translational Science Activities', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Comorbidity', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Dependence', 'Dimensions', 'Documentation', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Equilibrium', 'Exclusion Criteria', 'Formulation', 'Gaussian model', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Status', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heterogeneity', 'Indiana', 'Informatics', 'International', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Length', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Process', 'Quality Control', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Records', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'Sampling', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Treatment Protocols', 'adaptive learning', 'algorithmic methodologies', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'clinical data warehouse', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical practice', 'data modeling', 'data space', 'design', 'evidence base', 'individual patient', 'individualized medicine', 'knowledge base', 'learning strategy', 'novel', 'optimal treatments', 'outreach', 'patient population', 'personalized decision', 'personalized medicine', 'population based', 'scale up', 'temporal measurement', 'theories', 'treatment guidelines', 'treatment response', 'treatment strategy']",NIGMS,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2018,352653,0.035734771574070484
"Improving accreditation, certification and quality improvement programs through automated abstraction of electronic health data. ABSTRACT SBIR Phase I: Reduce the burden of data abstraction for certification, accreditation and quality improvement programs via a new platform to automate the abstraction of measures and a novel interface to improve human abstractor workflow. The broad impact/commercial potential of this SBIR Phase I project is to drive down the burden of participation in quality improvement programs, specifically, the resource intensive manual data abstraction process to derive and report quality measures that are instrumental to improving health outcomes and controlling costs. Patient Insight proposes improvements through automated abstraction methods and an interface for human abstractors to better visualize electronic health record (EHR) data and complete their work. The existing approach is a barrier to broader uptake of quality improvement initiatives such as accreditation. Patient Insight’s proposed solution consists of leveraging both proven and proprietary technologies to extract data via EHR agnostic application programming interfaces (APIs), better target eligible patients, and calculate measures via natural language processing (NLP) algorithms and custom queries. The core innovation is a novel data mining engine and user interface that improves the process of human data abstraction for clinical and quality documentation such as those required to achieve accreditation. The proposed project will allow Patient Insight, in partnership with the American College of Cardiology, a leader in the hospital based accreditation space, to develop a proof-of-concept pilot project at a select hospital and compare human and automated data abstraction methods for a pre-selected number of measures that are mandated as part of the ACC’s Heart Failure Accreditation program. Once completed, Patient Insight will expand on the technology, design and user research data/requirements with a roadmap for product enhancements for Phase II that will enable the building of a commercially viable ‘add-on’ service for sites participating in the ACC’s suite of accreditation programs and eventually expand to additional ACC service lines as well as other accreditation and certifying bodies. Success will represent a transformative change in general-purpose abstraction and an interface that will support a broad array of accreditation measures and abstraction workflows thereby solving a critical inefficiency both clinically and financially for hospitals while improving patient health outcomes. PROJECT NARRATIVE Health service accreditation and certification programs are a critical mechanism to direct care quality improvements and ensure compliance with regulations. Reporting on requisite measures is a resource intensive and costly process requiring human data abstractors to interpret heterogeneous and disparately presented data elements from the electronic health record (EHR). Replacing human elements using evolving automated data abstraction methods and an interface for abstractors to better visualize EHR data and manage their workflow would solve an important, unmet need and offer a dramatic improvement over the status quo. Patient Insight’s commercial technology solution will facilitate efficiencies in automated data abstraction and human-to-computer interactions in quality improvement reporting.","Improving accreditation, certification and quality improvement programs through automated abstraction of electronic health data.",9622944,R43LM012955,"['Accreditation', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Appointment', 'Back', 'Beds', 'Budgets', 'Cardiac rehabilitation', 'Cardiology', 'Caring', 'Certification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'Cost Control', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Element', 'Diuretics', 'Documentation', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Elements', 'Ensure', 'Event', 'Expenditure', 'Feedback', 'Hand', 'Health', 'Health Services', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Health Status', 'Healthcare', 'Heart failure', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Information Technology', 'Investments', 'Licensing', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Paper', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Process', 'Quality of Care', 'Regulation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Schedule', 'Services', 'Site', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Work', 'application programming interface', 'base', 'cardiology service', 'certificate program', 'college', 'cost', 'data management', 'data mining', 'data visualization', 'design', 'exercise program', 'follow-up', 'health assessment', 'health data', 'human data', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'new technology', 'novel', 'product development', 'programs', 'readmission rates', 'success', 'tool', 'uptake', 'usability']",NLM,"PATIENT INSIGHT, INC.",R43,2018,259060,0.03553425255751213
"Health Information Technology for Surveillance of Health Care-Associated Infections PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Health care-associated infections (HAIs) affect one in every 20 hospitalized patients and account for $10 billion dollars in potentially preventable health care expenditures annually. Current efforts at detection of HAIs are limited to manual chart review which hinders the generalizability and scalability of HAI detection. My goal in seeking a Mentored Clinical Scientist Career Development Award is to acquire the necessary training, practical experience, and knowledge to develop a health services research career as a principal investigator focusing on leveraging novel health information technology (HIT) tools to improve the measurement of surgical health care quality, safety, and effectiveness. To continue my progress towards this goal, the objective of this project is to address the challenges of HAI detection by developing a robust and portable automated HAI surveillance toolkit. This toolkit will combine structured electronic health record (EHR) data with rich information locked in clinical notes using machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) to identify HAIs after surgical procedures. Our overall hypothesis is that combining structured variables from the EHR supplemented with NLP will improve our ability to identify HAIs after surgical procedures. To test the central hypothesis and accomplish the objectives for this application, I will pursue the following three specific aims: 1) Determine the EHR data elements indicative of postoperative HAIs and evaluate the performance of a novel HAI surveillance algorithm; 2) Identify the presence of postoperative SSIs from clinical notes using an automated portable NLP-based algorithm; 3) Apply user-centered design to create a high fidelity prototype of a surgical quality dashboard incorporating our HAI case detection methodology. This contribution is a significant first step in a continuum of research that utilizes the large amounts of data in the EHR combined with novel HIT methods to improve the measurement of surgical health-care quality, safety, and effectiveness. This approach is significant because the tools developed in this proposal have potential to serve as a prototype for identification and monitoring hospitals adverse events and could be replicated on a national scale. The proposed research is innovative in its approach using a combination of structured and unstructured data in the EHR along with novel machine learning and NLP tools to create a generalizable surveillance toolkit for the detection of HAIs. This proposal is responsive to the AHRQ Special Emphasis Notice (NOT-HS-13-011) specifically addressing the use of HIT to improve quality measurement. I have assembled a mentoring team who all internationally recognized experts with long and successful track records of funding and trainee mentorship. This project will provide the means to place me on a trajectory towards a health services research career focused on improving the measurement of surgical health-care quality, safety, and effectiveness using novel HIT tools. In summary, my previous training and experience, innovative research plan, high-quality training plan, first-rate mentorship team, and supportive research environment give me the highest likelihood of success to research independence with the proposed K08 award. PROJECT NARRATIVE/RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH The proposed research and career development plan are relevant to public health because health care- associated infections (HAIs) affect about one in every 20 hospitalized patients and account for $30 billion dollars in potentially preventable health care expenditures annually. The objective of this project is to develop robust and portable automated surveillance toolkit that combines structured EHR data with rich information locked in clinical notes using natural language processing to identify HAIs after surgical procedures. The proposed research has the potential to serve as a prototype for identification and monitoring of numerous hospitals adverse events and could be replicated on a national scale.",Health Information Technology for Surveillance of Health Care-Associated Infections,9599186,K08HS025776,[' '],AHRQ,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,K08,2018,160164,0.015218443216748498
"Patient Medical History Representation, Extraction, and Inference from EHR Data DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The significance of developing tools for automatically harvesting temporal constraints of clinical events from Electronic Health Records (EHR) cannot be overestimated. Efficient analysis of the temporal aspects in EHR data could boost an array of clinical and translational research such as disease progression studies, decision support systems, and personalized medicine.     One big challenge we are facing is to automatically untangle and linearize the temporal constraints of clinical events embedded in highly diverse large-scale EHR data. Barriers to temporal data modeling, normalization, extraction, and reasoning have precluded the efficient use of EHR data sources for event history evaluation and trending analysis: (1) The current federally-supported EHR data normalization tools do not focus on the time aspect of unstructured data yet; (2) Existing time models focus only on structured data with absolute time, lack of supporting reasoning systems, or only offer application-specific partial solutions which cannot be adopted by the complex EHR data; (3) Current temporal information extraction approaches are either difficult to be adopted to EHR data, not scalable, or only offers application-specific partial solution.     This proposed project fills in the current gaps among ontologies, Natural Language Processing (NLP), and EHR-based clinical research for temporal data representation, normalization, extractions, and reasoning. We propose to develop novel approaches for automatic temporal data representation, normalization and reasoning for large, diverse, and heterogeneous EHR data and prepare the integrated data for further analysis. We will build new reasoning and extraction capacities on our TIMER (Temporal Information Modeling, Extracting, and Reasoning) framework to provide an end-to-end, open-source, standard-conforming software package. TIMER will be built on strong prior work by our team. We will develop new features in our CNTRO (Clinical Narrative Temporal Relation Ontology) for semantically defining the time domain and representing temporal data in complex EHR data. On top of the new developed CNTRO semantics, we will implement temporal relation reasoning capacities to automatically normalize temporal expressions, compute and infer temporal relations, and resolve ambiguities. We will leverage existing NLP tools and work on top of these tools to develop new extraction approaches to fill in the current gaps between NLP approaches and ontology-based reasoning approaches. We will adapt the SHARPn EHR data normalization pipeline and cTAKES for extracting and normalizing clinical event mentions from clinical narratives. We will explore an innovative approach for temporal relation extraction and event coreference, and make it work with the TIMER framework. We will evaluate the system using Diabetes Mellitus (DM) and colorectal cancer (CRC) patient cohorts from two insititutions. Each component will be tested separately first followed by an evaluation of the whole framework. Results such as precision, recall, and f-measure will be reported. Project Narrative The significance of developing capabilities for automatically harvesting temporal constraints for clinical events from Electronic Health Records (EHR) cannot be overestimated. A substantial portion of the information in the EHR is historical in nature. Patient medical history can be long, especially in complex patients. The proposed work, by offering an end-to-end open-source framework for automatically extracting, normalizing, and reasoning clinically-important time-relevant information from large-scale EHR data, can boost an array of clinical and translational research such as disease progression studies, decision support systems, and personalized medicine; as well as facilitate clinical practice for early disease detection, post-treatment care, and patient-clinician communication.","Patient Medical History Representation, Extraction, and Inference from EHR Data",9534182,R01LM011829,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Aftercare', 'Archives', 'Automated Annotation', 'Big Data', 'Caring', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Reporting', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Detection', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Harvest', 'Human', 'Institutes', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medical History', 'Medical Records', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Ontology', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Recording of previous events', 'Registries', 'Reporting', 'Resolution', 'Semantics', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translational Research', 'Work', 'application programming interface', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'colon cancer patients', 'data modeling', 'data structure', 'information model', 'innovation', 'novel strategies', 'open source', 'patient-clinician communication', 'personalized medicine', 'tool', 'trend analysis']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR HOUSTON,R01,2018,335217,0.09895186513416336
"Enhance Arthroplasty Research through Electronic Health Records and Nlp-Enabled Informatics ABSTRACT Total joint arthroplasty (TJA) is the most common and fastest growing surgical procedure in the nation. Despite the high procedure volume, the evidence base for TJA procedures and associated interventions are limited. This is mainly due to lack of high quality data sources and the logistical difficulties associated with manually extracting TJA information from the unstructured text of the Electronic Health Records (EHR). Meanwhile, the rapid adoption of EHR and the advances in health information technology offer the potential to transform unstructured EHR notes into structured, codified format that can then be analyzed and shared with local and national arthroplasty registries and other agencies. We therefore propose to leverage unique data resources and natural language processing (NLP) technologies to build an informatics infrastructure for automated EHR data extraction and analysis. We will (1) develop a high performance, externally validated and user centric NLP- enabled algorithm for extraction of complex TJA-specific data elements from the structured and unstructured text of the EHR, (2) validate the algorithm externally in multiple EHR platforms and hospital settings, and (3) conduct a demonstration project focused on prediction of prosthetic joint infections using data elements collected by the NLP-enabled algorithm. Our overarching goal is to develop valid, open source and portable NLP-enabled data collection and risk prediction tools and disseminate them widely to hospitals participating in regional and national TJA registries. This research is significant as it leverages strong data resources and expertise to tackle the pressing need for high quality data and accurate prediction models in TJA. Automated data collection and processing capabilities will lead to an upsurge in secondary use of EHR to advance scientific knowledge on TJA risk factors, healthcare quality and patient outcomes. Accurate prediction of high risk patients for prosthetic joint infections will guide prevention and treatment decisions resulting in significant health benefits to TJA patients. The research is innovative because TJA-specific bioinformatics technology will shift TJA research from current under-powered, single-center studies to large, multi-center registry-based observational studies and clinical trials. Our deliverables have the potential to exert a sustained downstream effect on future TJA research, practice and policy. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Lack of high quality data is a critical barrier to progress in total joint arthroplasty (TJA) research. We will utilize health information technology to automate extraction of rich TJA information from the electronic health records, and develop a robust risk prediction score for prosthetic joint infections, a devastating and yet preventable complication of TJA. Widespread adoption of these tools will enhance data collection capabilities and enable affordable large scale studies for practice improvements through secondary use of real-world data. Accurate prediction of post- operative infection risk among TJA candidates will guide individualized preventive strategies for modifiable risk factors, thereby reducing the burden of prosthetic joint infections in TJA patients.",Enhance Arthroplasty Research through Electronic Health Records and Nlp-Enabled Informatics,9486584,R01AR073147,"['Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Bioinformatics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complex', 'Complication', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Element', 'Data Quality', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Documentation', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Epidemic', 'Evidence based practice', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Guide prevention', 'Health Benefit', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Informatics', 'Institution', 'Intervention', 'Joint Prosthesis', 'Knowledge', 'Logistics', 'Manuals', 'Marketing', 'Medicare', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Observational Study', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Patient risk', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Policies', 'Postoperative Period', 'Prevention', 'Prevention strategy', 'Procedures', 'Provider', 'Publishing', 'Registries', 'Replacement Arthroplasty', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Safety', 'Scientific Advances and Accomplishments', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'United States', 'age group', 'base', 'computerized data processing', 'cost', 'data access', 'data resource', 'electronic data', 'electronic structure', 'epidemiology study', 'evidence base', 'health care quality', 'health information technology', 'high risk', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'informatics infrastructure', 'innovation', 'joint infection', 'modifiable risk', 'novel', 'open source', 'outcome prediction', 'patient population', 'portability', 'pragmatic trial', 'predictive modeling', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'surgery outcome', 'tool', 'willingness']",NIAMS,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,R01,2018,484387,0.08330302154269341
"Advancing Cancer Pharmacoepidemiology Research Through EHRs and Informatics ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of cancer pharmacoepidemiology is to identify adverse and/or long-term effects of chemotherapeutic agents and determine the impact of drugs on cancer risk, prevention, and response to treatments. Pharmacoepidemiology studies exert strong influence on defining optimal treatments and accelerating translational research. Therefore, it is imperative for these to be done efficiently and leveraging real-world patient data such as electronic health records (EHR). Massive clinical data from EHRs are being tapped into for research in disease-gene associations, comparative effectiveness and clinical outcomes. There is however paucity in pharmacoepidemiological studies using comprehensive EHR data due to the inherent challenges that exist for data abstraction, handling and analysis.

"Advancing Cancer Pharmacoepidemiology Research Through EHRs and Informatics ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of cancer pharmacoepidemiology is to identify adverse and/or long-term effects of chemotherapeutic agents and determine the impact of drugs on cancer risk, prevention, and response to treatments. Pharmacoepidemiology studies exert strong influence on defining optimal treatments and accelerating translational research. Therefore, it is imperative for these to be done efficiently and leveraging real-world patient data such as electronic health records (EHR). Massive clinical data from EHRs are being tapped into for research in disease-gene associations, comparative effectiveness and clinical outcomes. There is however paucity in pharmacoepidemiological studies using comprehensive EHR data due to the inherent challenges that exist for data abstraction, handling and analysis. The hurdles include heterogeneity of reports, embedding of detailed clinical information in narrative text, differing EHR platforms across different sites and missing data to name a few. In this study, we propose to integrate and extend preexisting tools to build an informatics infrastructure for EHR data extraction, interpretation, management and analysis to advance cancer pharmacoepidemiology research. We will leverage existing tools of natural language processing (NLP), standardized ontologies and clinical data management systems to extract and manipulate EHR data for cancer pharmacoepidemiological research. To achieve our goal we propose four specific aims. In aim 1, we intend to develop a high-performance, user- centric information extraction framework with advanced features such as active learning (to reduce annotation cost), domain adaptation (to transfer data across multiple sites) and user-friendly interfaces (for non-technical end users). In aim 2, we plan to improve data harmonization across differing platforms, develop components for seamless data export as well as expand methodologies to address impediments inherent to EHR-based data (such as the missing data problem). In aim 3, we will conduct demonstration projects of cancer pharmacoepidemiology including pharmacovigilance and pharmacogenomics of chemotherapeutic agents to evaluate, refine and validate the broad uses of our tools. Finally in aim 4, we propose to disseminate the methods and tools developed in this project to the cancer research and pharmacoepidemiology communities.

"Interdisciplinary Infrastructure for Aging Research: Rochester Epidemiology Project PROJECT SUMMARY The National Institutes on Aging (NIA) has recommended strengthening research infrastructures to address future aging research questions (2016 Data Infrastructure Review Committee Report and PAR-16-367). In particular, they recommend: 1) integrating biological data into larger population-based studies; 2) increasing use of electronic health record (EHR) data and linking to medical care claims data; and 3) developing new approaches to collecting data to answer important scientific questions about mechanisms of aging. The Rochester Epidemiology Project (REP; NIA R01 AG034676) is a unique infrastructure for studies of aging, because the REP collects longitudinal EHR data on all health conditions that come to medical attention for a large, Midwestern population. Therefore, the REP allows investigators to study all age-related diseases and outcomes. However, the REP has three significant gaps. First, the REP does not include biospecimens. Second, the REP is missing health care delivered outside of the health care institutions that partner with the REP, and it does not include information on filled prescriptions. Third, a significant proportion of EHR data is difficult to access due to two factors: 1) the full text of the EHRs includes extensive clinical notes about aging outcomes and geriatric syndromes, but these notes are not routinely coded for billing, and can only be accessed through laborious manual review; and 2) the REP health care partners use three different EHR systems, making it difficult to apply electronic data extraction tools across all partners. To address these three gaps, we will develop an interdisciplinary collaboration across experts in aging research, epidemiologic methods, biobanking, and medical informatics to create a new, comprehensive research infrastructure (“Bio-REP”) to support aging research. In the R21 phase, we will develop a comprehensive research infrastructure that combines the REP data with Mayo Clinic Biobank biospecimens, medical claims data from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS; Aim 1), and geriatric syndrome data that are included in the unstructured EHR clinical notes using Natural Language Processing techniques (NLP; Aim 2). In the R33 phase, we will deploy NLP algorithms developed in Aim 2 in the clinical notes from two additional EHR systems (Aim 3), and we will conduct two demonstration projects. First, we will measure associations between novel aging-related biomarkers and aging-related outcomes (Aim 4). Second, we will determine whether two common medications that are hypothesized to impact aging (metformin and angiotensin receptor blockers) modify associations between aging biomarkers and aging outcomes (Aim 5). The new, robust Bio-REP infrastructure will support a wide range of efficient, cost-effective observational studies to characterize associations between aging-related biomarkers and specific diseases, geriatric syndromes, and drug utilization. Such studies are urgently needed to design effective clinical trials to improve the health span of the aging population.

"5/6 COMpAAAS U24: Resource in Informatics and Biostatistics (RIB) The overall aim of the NIAAA-funded Consortium to improve OutcoMes in hiv/Aids, Alcohol, Aging, & multi- Substance use (COMpAAAS) is to build and disseminate the evidence needed to optimize care for HIV+ experiencing medical harm from alcohol and related substance use, through coordinated, integrated, and externally validated observational, operations research modeling, and intervention studies. Combining and integrating the complimentary expertise of informatics, biostatistics and epidemiology, we propose a U24 Resource for Informatics and Biostatistics (RIB) to support and inform the other COMpAAAS components. This resource will address the complex challenges required to maximize power and minimize bias in analyses addressing consortium-wide questions. Advanced informatics methods supported include natural language processing (NLP), ontologies, database and clinical decision support, and application of vital data management tools for secure data collection, storage, annotation, retrieval, and integration. Advanced epidemiological and statistical methods include time-updated exposure techniques, multiple imputation, propensity score techniques, measurement error correction, and competing risks regression. Routine, but essential, statistical methods include Cox proportional hazards, logistic and linear regression, goodness of fit diagnostics, and agreement/accuracy metrics (kappa, sensitivity, specificity, etc.). The RIB will further leverage the observational and interventional studies, simulation models, and well-coordinated network of cores and workgroups of COMpAAAS with advanced informatics and biostatistical techniques tailored to the particular challenges of large scale, longitudinal data from multiple sources including electronic health records (EHR), clinical interventions, patient self-report, and tissue repositories. Our specific aims are to provide 1) statistical and 2) informatics expertise for COMpAAAS to maximize scientific impact. To accomplish this, we will enhance the design, recruitment, and follow-up of intervention studies, support appropriate design and execution of data analyses and cross cohort collaborations, provide advanced statistical methods plus estimates of alcohol patterns for OR modeling and identify sexual/gender minority populations (CHAMP) from VACS survey data. In addition we will enhance the Consortium Web-Based Laboratory (WBL Portal) informatics infrastructure to support ongoing research design, data collection and management, development and testing of interventions such as clinical decision support and eHealth tools and enhance support for the analysis of textual data. The Resource for Informatics and Biostatistics (RIB) will extend and enhance the research capacities and productivity among investigators at the NIAAA-funded Consortium to improve OutcoMes in hiv/AIDS, Alcohol, Aging, and multi-Substance use (COMpAAAS).

"Improved Disease Stratification Using Electronic Health Records ABSTRACT This Career Development Application describes targeted coursework and mentored research for progression to independent research in the use of electronic health record data for disease subtyping. Electronic health records have demonstrated great promise as a scalable source of data for biomedical research to enable “precision medicine.” Use of natural language processing techniques has enabled computational analysis of specific terms found in free text clinical notes. An improved ability to extract symptom information from clinical notes would improve researchers’ ability to use de-identified data from patient records for discovery of disease subtypes. Symptom-related terms are particularly important in the context of mental health, but also harder to detect in notes than other terms like diseases or drug names.  The research aims of this proposal present a novel approach to scalable extension of biomedical terminologies and improved detection of those terms and their modifiers (e.g. severe, familial, absent). The richer dataset that can be extracted using these enhanced approaches is then used to define patient cohorts and to detect disease subtypes and predictors of response to specific pharmaceutical intervention.  Resulting patient stratification will be compared to groupings made without the enriched data and validated on an independent data set. The overarching hypothesis of this work is that enhanced mining of clinical notes will enable statistically significant and clinically relevant symptom-based stratification of psychiatric disorders. In order to test this hypothesis, I will: Aim 1: Develop a semi-automated pipeline for domain-specific terminology extension Aim 2: Define and stratify patient cohorts through use of enhanced term extraction Aim 3: Evaluate the validity and utility of the richer set of data obtained through Aims 1 and 2  One area of greatest need for more evidence-based disease stratification, and also of greatest challenge for a number of reasons, is that of mental health. Mental health disorders account for 30% of non-fatal disease burden world-wide, and pose an economic burden of trillions of dollars and climbing. Moreover, mental health symptoms are generally subjective and self-reported, with few objectively measurable signs. The impact of this proposal is that it will dramatically improve our ability to use EHR data to stratify patients in this drastically underserved area of health and healthcare.  The major innovations of this project are the adaptation and application of a semi-supervised pattern learning pipeline to augment mental health terminologies, and a novel approach to disease stratification using a significantly underutilized source of biomedical data, namely clinical notes.  This work addresses a major challenge for mining clinical notes in rapidly evolving biomedical domains and leverages a valuable source of medical evidence that is largely untapped and underutilized. Together, these methods for enhanced use of clinical notes will enable identification of distinct patient subgroups using data that is sitting idle in EHRs. Project Narrative Electronic health records have demonstrated great promise as a scalable source of data for biomedical research to enable “precision medicine.” Natural language processing has enabled the use of information from clinical notes in addition to structured data like diagnoses and lab values. This work aims to improve our ability to extract useful information from electronic health records to enable disease subtyping, particularly in the area of mental health.",Improved Disease Stratification Using Electronic Health Records,9566983,K01LM012529,"['Address', 'Area', 'Biological', 'Biomedical Research', 'Categories', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Complement', 'Computer Analysis', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease stratification', 'Economic Burden', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Genotype', 'Grouping', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Measurable', 'Medical', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Names', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Phenotype', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rheumatology', 'Severities', 'Source', 'Statistical Models', 'Stratification', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Terminology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Work', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'career development', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinically actionable', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'disease classification', 'disorder subtype', 'electronic data', 'evidence base', 'improved', 'innovation', 'novel strategies', 'patient stratification', 'patient subsets', 'phenotypic data', 'precision medicine', 'predicting response', 'response', 'treatment response']",NLM,DUKE UNIVERSITY,K01,2018,187483,0.032155827516047814
"Enhancing Intimate Partner Violence (IPV) Identification through Automated EHR Summarization Project summary Intimate partner violence (IPV) is a significant public health and criminal justice problem that negatively impacts millions of victims yearly in the United States, primarily women (85%). Most IPV-related healthcare visits (83%) occurred in an emergency department (ED), and these clinical encounters are unique opportunities to identify IPV victims and potentially provide assistance. Although numerous health professional organizations have endorsed universal screening and counseling for IPV since 1992, actual screening rates, detection of IPV victims, and referrals to IPV services remain low in the ED. As a result, many IPV victims pass through the ED unidentified and untreated. Computerized screening tools have been developed and implemented in clinical settings in order to assist providers in screening and detecting IPV. However, these tools have a great limitation in that they rely on information collected from the patient and do not utilize the longitudinal data in electronic health records (EHR). Recently, researchers demonstrated that a history of IPV diagnoses and associated clinical symptoms highly predict current and future IPV (OR=7.8), and these important IPV data could serve as red flags that trigger providers to assess patients further for IPV. In order to enhance IPV screening in the ED, we propose to develop and assess an automatic clinical data summarizer that extracts, abstracts and synthesizes patient historical IPV data (structured and unstructured), and delivers patient historical IPV data to ED providers through an intuitive interface. The specific aims are: 1) develop and evaluate natural language processing (NLP) strategies to identify and extract patient historical IPV incidents and timelines from clinic notes; 2) develop and evaluate a web service-based summary tool (IPV-Summary-Service) that synthesizes patient- specific IPV information from both NLP-processed data elements and structured data; and 3) develop and pilot test an enhanced IPV screening strategy that delivers clinical evidence generated by the IPV-Summary- Service through a specific EHR (Epic) to providers during the patient universal IPV screening in the ED. This automatic clinical date summary for IPV will be piloted in one ED at MUSC. There are two major outcomes to be measured for the IPV-Summary enhanced screening for 6 months before and after the index date of pilot testing: 1) rate of successful referral to the IPV 24-hour dedicated IPV nurse; and 2) rate of initiation of referral and identification of persons at high risk of IPV. We will use mixed effect generalized linear regression models to estimate the effects of IPV-Summary on the referral rate and IPV case identification rate. Through survey studies, we will assess secondary outcomes including factors of system feasibility, usability, and providers' satisfaction. These analyses can identify potentially important correlates of the major outcomes and may help us improve the design of the intervention. The results from this study will form the foundation for a broader implementation in a regional health information exchange for EDs. Narrative Computer-based approaches for intimate partner violence (IPV) universal screening have led to significantly higher screening rate and detection rate, as well as receipt of IPV services in the emergency department (ED). However, these approaches rely on information collected from the patient and do not utilize the longitudinal IPV data existing in electronic health records (EHR), which have high predictive power of IPV risk. In order to enhance the effectiveness of IPV screening, we propose to develop and assess an automatic clinical data summary tool that extracts, abstracts, and synthesizes patient historical IPV information from EHR and then delivers that critical information to ED providers at the point of care.",Enhancing Intimate Partner Violence (IPV) Identification through Automated EHR Summarization,9520862,R21LM012945,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Adult', 'American', 'Caring', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Chronic', 'Client', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'Counseling', 'Crime', 'Criminal Justice', 'Data', 'Data Element', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emergency Department patient', 'Emergency department visit', 'Event', 'Face', 'Female', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Health', 'Health Care Visit', 'Health Professional', 'Hour', 'Injury', 'Intuition', 'Linear Regressions', 'Link', 'Masks', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nurses', 'Outcome', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Process', 'Professional Organizations', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Screening procedure', 'Services', 'South Carolina', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'TimeLine', 'Trauma', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Victimization', 'Violent injury', 'Woman', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical practice', 'clinically relevant', 'computerized', 'experience', 'high risk', 'improved', 'indexing', 'intimate partner violence', 'point of care', 'pressure', 'satisfaction', 'screening', 'secondary outcome', 'therapy design', 'tool', 'usability', 'web services']",NLM,MEDICAL UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA,R21,2018,201825,0.011569619575734439
"Integrating EHR and Genomics to Predict Multiple Sclerosis Drug Response PROJECT SUMMARY The growing expansion of the approved multiple sclerosis (MS) disease-modifying treatments (DMTs) and the variable responses to MS treatment have created an unmet medical need to provide individually tailored therapy. Efforts to bring precision medicine to provide individualized MS treatment selection have been impeded by our limited understanding of the factors that determine treatment response. While genomics hold the promise for closing this knowledge gap, the insufficient number of patients with detailed treatment response data and the modest effect size of genetic variants that influence treatment responses are the main limiting factors in pharmacogenomics studies. As electronic health records (EHR) become widely adopted and increasingly standardized and as we implement sophisticated computational and statistical methods to harness the EHR data, EHR systems can become cost-effective platforms to perform large-scale treatment response studies in real-life settings. Our team with a history of productive collaborations and diverse expertise (led by PI Dr. Xia) previously developed robust algorithms to identify 5,495 MS patients from the Partners HealthCare EHR systems and then model MS disease activity in these patients using EHR data. The Partners EHR system contains longitudinal clinical information on thousands of MS patients from two large academic medical centers and is linked to a well-characterized MS patient research registry and biobanks with existing genomics data. For the proposed study, we will test the hypothesis that meaningful phenotypes of MS disease activity can be extracted from EHR data to inform treatment response, and that additional common genetic variants exist in the population and can predict therapeutic response in MS when combined with clinical features derived from EHR data. The proposed study has three aims with the overall goal to produce a computational and analytic approach capable of identifying MS disease activity in relation to treatment history using EHR data and integrate with genomics profile to develop a predictive model of therapeutic response to commonly prescribed DMTs in this cohort of 5,495 MS patients, including injectable (interferon-β, glatiramer acetate) and oral (fingolimod, dimethyl fumarate) options. Specifically, we will (1) leverage narrative electronic health records data (e.g., clinical notes, radiology reports) and natural language processing (NLP) to ascertain individualized response to DMTs (n=600 for each DMT); (2) Identify clinical features from electronic health record data (e.g., diagnoses, exposures) that predict response to DMTs using a systematic phenome-wide approach; (3) Develop and test a comprehensive predictive model of individualized response to DMTs that incorporates clinical and genetic predictors. This research has the potential impact to be transformative by contributing to a major knowledge gap regarding the factors that influence treatment response and bringing precision medicine closer to individualized MS treatment selection. PROJECT NARRATIVE AND PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic neurological condition that affects over 400,000 individuals in the United States and creates a high socioeconomic burden as a leading cause of neurological disability in young adults. Because not all patients respond the same way to a specific medication, physicians and MS patients often lose precious time searching for effective treatment with serially testing of costly medications. An individually tailored treatment can ensure early start of effective medication that can prevent relapse and progression of disability. Ultimately, this project will help gain insights into the factors that determine treatment response and enable physicians to match an individual MS patient's clinical and genomic profile with uniquely tailored therapy to maximize effectiveness, delay disease progression and reduce overall cost.",Integrating EHR and Genomics to Predict Multiple Sclerosis Drug Response,9509579,R01NS098023,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Adopted', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Biology', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Computing Methodologies', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Fumarates', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Injectable', 'Interferon-beta', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Link', 'Longitudinal prospective study', 'Manuals', 'Medical', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neurologic', 'Neurologist', 'Oral', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacogenomics', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Recording of previous events', 'Registries', 'Relapse', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Selection for Treatments', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Methods', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'TimeLine', 'Treatment Cost', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States', 'Variant', 'biobank', 'clinical predictors', 'cohort', 'copolymer 1', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'disability', 'effective therapy', 'experience', 'genetic predictors', 'genetic variant', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'genomic profiles', 'individual response', 'individualized medicine', 'insight', 'multiple sclerosis patient', 'multiple sclerosis treatment', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'patient response', 'phenome', 'portability', 'precision medicine', 'predicting response', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'socioeconomics', 'treatment group', 'treatment response', 'young adult']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2018,344656,0.07686752110648665
"Novel Informatics Approaches for Ascertainment of PAD Status and Adverse Outcomes ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The applicant and principal investigator (PI) is a board-certified cardiologist, Assistant Professor of Medicine and Senior Associate Consultant in the Mayo Clinic Cardiovascular Division. [The long-term goal of the PI is to become an independent clinician-investigator in translational informatics focused on the development, validation and deployment of electronic tools to the point-of-care to improve outcomes for patients with cardiovascular disease. The PI intends to leverage the EHR to conduct population-based studies using electronic algorithms that include NLP and by application of state-of-the-art informatics approaches to deliver the knowledge at the point-of-care in support of patient-centered decision-making for patients with peripheral arterial disease (PAD). The electronic tools developed will be portable to different institutions and other health conditions. The PI will be uniquely positioned as a cardiologist within a large academic health system working with novel NLP techniques at the interface of the EHR and CDS to rapidly translate knowledge acquired in community-based epidemiologic investigations to patient care.] The PI has proposed a research career development plan to acquire expertise in translational informatics including electronic phenotyping, and automated calculation and visual display of prognostic scores using a novel application integrated with clinical decision support (CDS). The PI will complete comprehensive coursework in informatics science and gain additional patient-oriented and epidemiologic research experience. The primary mentor will be Iftikhar Kullo, M.D., cardiologist and PI of the Mayo Clinic electronic MEdical Records and GEnomics (eMERGE) network and a leader in the development and application of electronic phenotyping for genomic studies of PAD. The mentoring team also includes Dr. Christopher Chute, M.D., Head of Medical Informatics at Mayo Clinic, an expert in informatics and epidemiology, and co-PI of the Mayo eMERGE grant and co-investigator of the Rochester Epidemiology Project; Hongfang Liu, Ph.D., an expert in natural language processing (NLP) and its application for EHR-based phenotyping; and Kent Bailey, Ph.D., senior biostatistician with expertise in development of prognostic risk scores. The specific aims of the proposal are: Aim 1 - Apply phenotyping algorithms that include NLP of clinical notes to [a] identify PAD cases and controls without PAD in the community from 1998-2011; and [b] ascertain adverse cardiovascular and limb outcomes through December 2013. Aim 2 - Create multivariable prognostic risk models and scores for adverse outcomes in PAD cases from the community. We will estimate the relative risk of death in PAD patients compared to controls without PAD.

"ICLIC-MS for Enhancing Outcomes Research and Clinical Care in Multiple Sclerosis PROJECT SUMMARY Cognitive impairment, physical disability and progressive disease are common but understudied clinical outcomes that substantially impact employment and overall quality of life for individuals with multiple sclerosis (MS). We have recently developed and validated an assisted, web-based tool (ICLIC-MS) for systematic and longitudinal clinical outcomes data collection of MS-validated cognitive function measures, physical disability and progressive disease measures that are not reliably captured in the electronic health record (EHR). In response to FOA# PA-17-010, Use of Technology to Enhance Patient Outcomes and Prevent Illness, our team proposes the study of MS outcomes in a large, multi-ethnic population representative sample of more than 3,000 female and male MS cases from the Kaiser Permanente Northern California Health Plan Membership. We will integrate other EHR data such as important comorbid conditions, use of disease modifying therapy, MRI reports, as well as quality of life measures and employment histories. Our goals include: 1) comprehensively characterizing clinical outcomes in a large MS patient cohort; 2) developing and utilizing an integrated MS health report to enhance patient care; and 3) establishing a resource for clinical outcomes research in MS that also includes whole genomic and environmental exposure data. Findings from our proposed study represent an extraordinary opportunity to facilitate effective long-term management of MS, accelerate progress in the understanding of disease pathogenesis, predict patient trajectories and inform prevention strategies. We have assembled a team with strong expertise in clinical neurology/MS neurology, advanced epidemiologic methods, EHR structure and clinical care within a health maintenance organization, human genomics, biostatistics, and big data approaches. PROJECT NARRATIVE Our team has developed and validated an assisted web-based interface for longitudinal clinical data collection of cognitive function measures, physical disability and depression measures that are not reliably captured in the electronic health record (EHR) of multiple sclerosis (MS) patients.

"Data-Mining Clinical Decision Support from Electronic Health Records ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)    Data-Mining Clinical Decision Support from Electronic Health Records Public Health Motivation: National healthcare quality is compromised by undesirable variability, reflected in different locales having anywhere from 20-80% compliance with evidence-based guidelines. Much of this is due to uncertainty, with half of clinical practice guidelines lacking adequate evidence to confirm their efficacy. This is unsurprising when clinical trials cost >$15 million to answer individual clinical questions. The result is medical practice routinely driven by individual opinio and anecdotal experience. While Big Data has revolutionized how society processes internet scale information, the status quo in clinical decision making remains the manual interpretation of literature and isolated decision aids. The adoption of electronic health records (EHR) creates a new opportunity to answer a ""grand challenge in clinical decision support (CDS)."" In a learning health system, we could automatically adapt knowledge from the collective expertise embedded in the EHR practices of real clinicians and close the loop by disseminating that knowledge back as executable decision support. Candidate Goals and Objectives: The unifying goal of this BD2K K01 proposal is the mentored career development of Jonathan H. Chen, MD, PhD. This proposal will accelerate his transition into an independent physician scientist, towards his long-term goals to produce Big Data technologies that answer such grand challenges in clinical decision support. His near-term objective is developing methods to translate EHR data into useful knowledge in the form of patient- specific, point-of-care clinical order recommendations for acute medical hospitalizations. His doctoral background in computer science gives him the technical capability to achieve these objectives, while his medical training will ensure clinically meaningful results. His preliminary work to build an order recommender, analogous to commercial product recommenders, demonstrates the proposal's overall feasibility. Institutional Environment and Career Development: The research facilities and training opportunities at Stanford University provide the ideal environment to achieve these objectives, with established and growing Centers for Biomedical Informatics Research, the Biomedical Data Science Initiative, and the first Clinical Informatics Fellowship accredited in the nation. Prof. Russ Altman, Director of the Biomedical Informatics Training Program, will lead a collaborative team of mentors with expertise in clinical decision support (Mary Goldstein), implementation science (Steven Asch), data-mining electronic health records (Nigam Shah), statistical learning algorithms (Lester Mackey), and healthcare statistics (Michael Baiocchi). Combined with respective didactic training, this mentorship will enable Dr. Chen to achieve his objectives through a series of research aims. Research Aims: The overriding hypothesis of the proposal is that clinical knowledge reflected in clinical order patterns from historical EHR data can improve medical decision making when adapted into functional clinical decision support. The specific aims each address components of this concept, as they seek to: (1) Develop the algorithms to learn clinical order patterns from historical EHR data, building on a preliminary recommender system; (2) Assess how underlying clinician proficiency affects the quality of those learned clinical order patterns through observational data inference against external standards; and (3) Determine the impact of automatically learned clinical decision support (CDS) on (simulated) clinical workflows through a randomized controlled crossover trial of human-computer interfaces with real clinicians. Expected Results and General Significance: By the completion of the proposed work, Dr. Chen will answer the grand challenge in clinical decision support (CDS) by automating much of the CDS production process, and have direct translational impact with a prototype system. This will advance the field with new paradigms of generating and disseminating clinical knowledge, which can then improve the consistency and quality of healthcare delivery. Additional benefits will include methods to identify and monitor areas of high practice variability for targeted optimization and improve predictive models that inform precision medicine. With this applied research experience and career development, Dr. Chen can compete for R01 funding and become an independent physician scientist developing Big Data approaches to solve national healthcare problems in clinical decision making. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    National healthcare quality is compromised by undesirable practice variability and medical uncertainty, with most medical practice routinely driven by individual opinions and anecdotal experience. With methods analogous to commercial product recommender systems, the proposed project will automatically learn patterns in raw clinical transaction data to capture the undocumented knowledge of real-world clinicians, and close the loop in a learning health system by disseminating that knowledge back as clinical decision support to improve patient care.",Data-Mining Clinical Decision Support from Electronic Health Records,9537252,K01ES026837,"['Accreditation', 'Achievement', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Admission activity', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Applied Research', 'Area', 'Back', 'Big Data', 'Big Data to Knowledge', 'Caring', 'Chiroptera', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Clinical Practice Guideline', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cost efficiency', 'Cross-Over Trials', 'Crowding', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Decision Aid', 'Decision Making', 'Diagnosis', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Exhibits', 'Failure', 'Fellowship', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'Internet', 'Investments', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Locales', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Medical', 'Medical Residency', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Motivation', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Privatization', 'Process', 'Production', 'Public Health', 'Quality of Care', 'Randomized', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Research Training', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Services', 'Societies', 'Source', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Transact', 'Translating', 'Uncertainty', 'Universities', 'User-Computer Interface', 'Validation', 'Weight', 'Work', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'career development', 'clinical care', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical practice', 'clinical predictors', 'computer science', 'cost', 'data mining', 'design', 'evidence based guidelines', 'experience', 'health care delivery', 'health care quality', 'implementation science', 'improved', 'multidisciplinary', 'point of care', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'research facility', 'routine practice', 'statistics', 'support tools', 'training opportunity', 'translational impact']",NIEHS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,K01,2018,178606,-0.0057775535995157985
"Improving missing data analysis in distributed research networks ABSTRACT Electronic health record (EHR) databases collect data that reflect routine clinical care. These databases are increasingly used in comparative effectiveness research, patient-centered outcomes research, quality improvement assessment, and public health surveillance to generate actionable evidence that improves patient care. It is often necessary to analyze multiple databases that cover large and diverse populations to improve the statistical power of the study or generalizability of the findings. A common approach to analyzing multiple databases is the use of a distributed research network (DRN) architecture, in which data remains under the physical control of data partners. Although EHRs are generally thought to contain rich clinical information, the information is not uniformly collected. Certain information is available only for some patients, and only at some time points for a given patient. There are generally two types of missing information in EHRs. The first is the conventionally understood and obvious missing data in which some data fields (e.g., body mass index) are not complete for various reasons, e.g., the clinician does not collect the information or the patient chooses not to provide the information. The second is less obvious because the data field is not empty but the recorded value may be incorrect due to missing data. For example, EHRs generally do not have complete data for care that occurs in a different delivery system. A medical condition (e.g., asthma) may be coded as “no” but the true value would have been “yes” if more complete data had been available, e.g., from claims data as the other delivery system would submit a claim to the patient’s health plan for the care provided. In other words, one may incorrectly treat “absence of evidence” as “evidence of absence”. EHRs hold great promise but we must address several outstanding methodological challenges inherent in the databases, specifically missing data. Addressing missing data is more challenging in DRNs due to different missing data mechanisms across databases. The specific aims of the study are: (1) Apply and assess missing data methods developed in single-database settings to handle obvious and well-recognized missing data in DRNs; (2) Apply and assess machine learning and predictive modeling techniques to address less obvious and under-recognized missing data for select variables in DRNs; and (3) Apply and assess a comprehensive analytic approach that combines conventional missing data methods and machine learning techniques to address missing data in DRNs. The analytic methods developed in this project, including the extension of existing missing data methods to DRNs, the innovative use of machine learning techniques to address missing data, and their integration with privacy- protecting analytic methods, will have direct impact on the design and analysis of future comparative effectiveness and safety studies, and patient-centered outcomes research conducted in DRNs. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed project will refine existing methods and develop new methods to address missing data issues in electronic health record databases.",Improving missing data analysis in distributed research networks,9575484,R01HS026214,[' '],AHRQ,"HARVARD PILGRIM HEALTH CARE, INC.",R01,2018,400000,0.03037155980736578
"Scalable Clinical Decision Support for Individualized Cancer Risk Management Project Summary / Abstract We propose to enable a scalable clinical decision support (CDS) platform that helps clinicians and patients select cancer screening strategies that are best suited to each individual. This kind of CDS is important because increased evidence supports personalizing cancer screening decisions according to each individual's unique cancer risks. While a highly desired goal, individualizing screening at a population scale requires the implementation of patient-specific risk assessments for several types of cancer. This is quite challenging in today's overwhelmed primary care environment. Our proposed CDS platform addresses this challenge by (i) automating the risk stratification process at the population level based on EHR data and patient reported data; (ii) prioritizing patients for case review by genetic counselors; and (iii) automatically communicating risk and screening recommendations with primary care providers and their patients. We will integrate the CDS platform with the Epic EHR and test it at the University of Utah Health Care community clinics and the Huntsman Cancer Institute. We will assess the generalizability of the CDS platform with a different EHR (Cerner) at a different institution (Intermountain Healthcare). To maximize the dissemination potential for the proposed cancer risk screening platform, we will extend two well-established open source CDS platforms: OpenCDS and OpenInfobutton. These platforms are reference implementations of international EHR standards that are required for EHR certification in the US. We will also obtain software certification from the Open Source EHR Alliance, share the CDS platform and our experiences with other awardees in the ITCR Program, present the CDS platform at national and international cancer and informatics conferences; and engage with relevant stakeholders through a technical expert panel. Any healthcare organization with a certified EHR will be able to use the proposed CDS platform. Therefore, if successful, this proposal can have a significant impact on disseminating individualized cancer screening practices according to the best available evidence. The proposed research addresses the need for individualizing cancer screening according to the risk of an individual. We propose to enable software that scans electronic health records of entire patient populations to automatically detect those at a high risk to develop specific types of cancer according to cancer guidelines. Genetic counselors will review patients identified by the software, and discuss optimal cancer screening strategies with the patient and their primary care providers.",Scalable Clinical Decision Support for Individualized Cancer Risk Management,9534547,U24CA204800,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Breast Cancer Detection', 'Breast Cancer Risk Factor', 'Certification', 'Clinic', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Community Healthcare', 'Computer software', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Reporting', 'Detection', 'Documentation', 'Ecosystem', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Family', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Incentives', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Information Retrieval', 'Institutes', 'Institution', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Logic', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Modality', 'National Comprehensive Cancer Network', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Patient Care', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Population', 'Primary Health Care', 'Process', 'Provider', 'PubMed', 'Recommendation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Management', 'Risk stratification', 'Scanning', 'Screening for cancer', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Universities', 'Utah', 'base', 'cancer risk', 'cancer type', 'care providers', 'clinical decision support', 'colorectal cancer risk', 'design', 'experience', 'genetic counselor', 'healthcare community', 'high risk', 'improved', 'incentive program', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'online course', 'online resource', 'open source', 'patient population', 'personalized screening', 'primary care setting', 'programs', 'screening', 'support tools', 'symposium', 'web services']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,U24,2018,752888,0.020425192934152472
"Clinical practice patterns and healthcare resource utilization in acute exacerbation of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis: using real world data to bridge the evidence gap PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT This F32 fellowship award will provide Dr. Erica Farrand with the support necessary to accomplish the following goals: (1) to become an expert in patient-oriented clinical research in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF); (2) to develop a unique skill set in collecting, analyzing and interpreting real-world data; (3) to gain advanced skills in epidemiology, biostatistics and data science methods to conduct clinical research; (4) to advance the IPF field by improving our understanding of the clinical impact of acute exacerbation of IPF. To achieve these goals, Dr. Farrand will conduct clinical investigations in two distinct healthcare systems, the University of California San Francisco (UCSF) Health and Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC). IPF is a progressive fibrotic lung disease associated with high morbidity and mortality and over $1 billion in healthcare cost annually. Acute exacerbation of IPF, is an acute respiratory deterioration and arguably the most clinically significant event in the natural history of the disease. The fundamental aim of this NRSA proposal is to leverage the electronic health records of UCSF Health and KPNC to generate real-world evidence regarding the epidemiology of acute exacerbation of IPF, the nature and variability of its clinical management and health care utilization across settings, and the impact of common management strategies on clinical outcomes. Research in this fellowship will utilize electronic health record data to define the acute exacerbation population using a case-validated diagnostic algorithm (Aim 1), document the scope and impact of acute exacerbation on clinical practice and healthcare resource utilization, comparing the UCSF and KPNC systems (Aim 2), and determine the association of common management approaches with hospital based and short-term patient-outcomes (Aim 3). This project will demonstrate the power of leveraging high-quality electronic health record data to both advance our understanding of a clinical condition and document the association of treatment interventions with patient and system level outcomes NARRATIVE Episodes of acute respiratory deterioration known as acute exacerbations are the most clinically significant events in the natural history of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), and limited data exist to guide the management of acute exacerbations of IPF. The impact of acute exacerbations on health care resource utilization across health care settings has not been characterized. Leveraging high-quality real-world data from the electronic health records of two large medical systems, we will address this knowledge gap by defining the clinical impact of acute exacerbation of IPF on the patient and healthcare system level; this work will demonstrate the power of real-world data for clinical research, and lay the foundation for future pragmatic studies of IPF.",Clinical practice patterns and healthcare resource utilization in acute exacerbation of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis: using real world data to bridge the evidence gap,9610527,F32HL143920,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Admission activity', 'Adrenal Cortex Hormones', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Ambulatory Care', 'Antibiotics', 'Anticoagulation', 'Award', 'Bilateral', 'Biometry', 'California', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinic Visits', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Practice Patterns', 'Clinical Research', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Deterioration', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Epidemiology', 'Event', 'Fellowship', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Intensive Care', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Length of Stay', 'Lung diseases', 'Mechanical ventilation', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'National Research Service Awards', 'Natural History', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Outcome', 'Oxygen', 'Palliative Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Practice Management', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Resources', 'San Francisco', 'System', 'Time', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Ventilator', 'Visit', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical investigation', 'clinical practice', 'clinically relevant', 'clinically significant', 'cohort', 'community setting', 'comparative effectiveness', 'day length', 'disease natural history', 'effectiveness trial', 'electronic data', 'evidence based guidelines', 'health care service utilization', 'health care settings', 'idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis', 'improved', 'insight', 'medical schools', 'member', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'patient oriented', 'pragmatic trial', 'prognostic', 'prospective test', 'respiratory', 'skills', 'survival outcome']",NHLBI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",F32,2018,71077,0.013573772159526659
"EHR-Based Strategies to Improve Outcomes in Familial Hypercholesterolemia PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is a relatively common genetic disorder characterized by elevated plasma low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and a dramatically increased lifetime risk for premature atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). Available data suggest substantial under treatment of individuals with FH, and it is estimated that <5% of prevalent FH cases in the US are diagnosed and treated. The proposed research will develop electronic health record (EHR)-based strategies to reduce mortality and morbidity from FH. We will develop and validate a phenotyping algorithm for rapid and efficient identification of FH cases thereby enabling EHR-based surveillance of FH. We will deploy the phenotyping algorithm in the population-based setting of Olmsted County, Minnesota, to estimate prevalence and provide hitherto unavailable data on awareness, detection and control of FH. We will develop CDS to help care providers manage FH patients and an FH-specific decision aid to facilitate shared decision making related to lipid-lowering therapy and screening of family members. To accomplish these goals, we will leverage the following resources: a) the electronic phenotyping expertise available in the electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) network; b) the Rochester Epidemiology Project (REP), that links medical records of Olmsted County MN residents thereby capturing nearly all health care delivered to residents of the community; and c) expertise in developing and deploying CDS in the EHR and in creating decision aids for disclosing cardiovascular risk and the benefits of lipid-lowering drugs. Our specific aims are: Aim 1. Develop and validate an electronic phenotyping algorithm to rapidly identify FH cases from the EHR. Aim 2. Conduct an e- epidemiology study to obtain hitherto unknown data regarding prevalence, awareness, detection, control of FH in a population-based setting in the US. Aim 3. a) Develop EHR-based tools to help care providers manage FH and facilitate shared decision making and cascade screening and b) assess outcomes after implementation of CDS and decision aid. The proposed research will enable rapid identification of FH in EHRs, provide hitherto unavailable data on the burden of FH in the community, facilitate EHR-based strategies for early detection, increase awareness of FH among care providers, provide guidance for management of FH at point of care and help both patients and providers make informed decisions about drug therapy and screening of family members. These are critical steps for early detection and treatment of FH to reduce the burden of premature ASCVD due to this condition. PROJECT NARRATIVE Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is a relatively common genetic disorder characterized by high cholesterol levels and increased risk of heart attack or sudden cardiac death.

"Natural Language Question Understanding for Electronic Health Records ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Patient information in the electronic health record (EHR) such as lab results, medications, and past medical history is the basis for physician decisions about patient care. It also helps patients better understand and manage their care. Efficient access to this patient information is thus essential. One of the most intuitive ways of accessing data is by asking natural language questions. A significant amount of work in medical question answering has been conducted, yet little work has been performed in question answering for EHRs. Natural language questions can be represented in logical forms, a standard structured knowledge representation technique. This project proposes to take natural language EHR questions, both for doctors and patients, and automatically convert them to a logical form. The logical forms can then be converted to a structured query such as those used by EHRs. A major obstacle to this approach is the lack of data containing questions annotated with logical forms. This project hypothesizes that a small set of questions can be manually annotated, and then paraphrases can be produced for each annotated question. Since paraphrasing is a simpler task than logical form annotation, crowd-sourcing techniques can be used to collect thousands of question paraphrases. This question paraphrase corpus will then be used to build a semantic grammar capable of recognizing the logical structure of EHR questions. To ensure a robust, generalizable grammar, existing NLP techniques will be used to pre-process questions, simplifying their syntactic structure and abstracting their medical concepts.     In order to develop such a method, the candidate, Dr. Kirk Roberts, requires additional training and mentoring in natural language processing and biomedical informatics. This application for the NIH Pathway to Independence Award (K99/R00) describes a career development plan that will allow Dr. Roberts to achieve the goals of this project as well as transition to a career as an independent researcher. He will be mentored by Dr. Dina Demner-Fushman, a leading medical NLP researcher, and co-mentored by Dr. Clement McDonald, a leading EHR and medical informatics researcher.     The specific aims of the project are: (1) Build a paraphrase collection of EHR questions, where each prototype question will have many unique paraphrases. The paraphrases encompass different lexical and syntactic means of conveying the same logical form. (2) Construct a semantic grammar for EHR questions. The grammar can then be used to convert a natural language question to a logical form. (3) Implement an end- to-end question analyzer that generalizes EHR questions for improved parsing, parses the question into a logical form using the grammar, and converts the logical form into a leading structured EHR query format. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed work aims to significantly improve the ability of both doctors and patients to find information within electronic health records (EHR). By providing an interface to EHRs where users can specify their information needs in the form of a natural language question, the proposed work provides a more intuitive means of finding patient data than is currently available.",Natural Language Question Understanding for Electronic Health Records,9254613,R00LM012104,"['Artificial Intelligence', 'Award', 'Blood Glucose', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development Plans', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Glucose', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Intuition', 'Knowledge', 'Literature', 'Manuals', 'Medical', 'Medical History', 'Medical Informatics', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Process', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Semantics', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'TimeLine', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'abstracting', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'career', 'career development', 'crowdsourcing', 'data access', 'design', 'electronic structure', 'health data', 'illiterate', 'improved', 'information organization', 'lexical', 'natural language', 'open source', 'operation', 'phrases', 'prototype', 'syntax']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR HOUSTON,R00,2017,248999,0.054382557527370624
"From enrichment to insights Project Summary Most medical decisions are made without the support of rigorous evidence in large part due to the cost and complexity of performing randomized trials for most clinical situations. In practice, clinicians must use their judgement, informed by their own and the collective experience of their colleagues. The advent of the electronic health record (EHR) enables the modern practitioner to algorithmically check the records of thousands or millions of patients to rapidly find similar cases and compare outcomes. In addition to filling the inferential gap in actionable evidence, these kinds of analyses avoid issues of ethics, practicality, and generalizability that plague randomized clinical trials (RCTs). Unfortunately, identifying patients with the appropriate phenotypes, properly leveraging available data to adjust results, and matching similar patients to reduce confounding remain critical challenges in every study that uses EHR data. Overcoming these challenges to improve the accuracy of observational studies conducted with EHR data is of paramount importance. Studies using EHR data begin by defining a set of patients with specific phenotypes, analogous to amassing a cohort for a clinical trial. This process of electronic phenotyping, is typically done via a set of rules defined by experts. Machine learning approaches are increasingly used to complement consensus definitions created by experts and we propose several advances to validate and improve this practice. We will explore and quantify the effects of feature engineering choices to transform the diagnoses, procedures, medications, laboratory tests and clinical notes in the EHR into a computable feature matrix. Finally, building on recent advances, we plan to characterize the performance of existing methods and develop EHR-specific strategies for patient matching. Our work is significant because we will take on three challenging problems--electronic phenotyping, feature engineering, and patient matching--that stand in the way of generating insights via EHR data. If we are successful, we will significantly advance our ability to generate insights from the large amounts of health data that are routinely generated as a byproduct of clinical processes. Narrative The advent of the electronic health record (EHR) enables the search of thousands or millions of patients to rapidly find similar cases and compare outcomes.

"Algorithms to Identify Systemic Lupus from Electronic Health Record Data Abstract  Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic, autoimmune, multisystem disease that is often difficult to diagnose because of the diverse manifestations that occur over time and across care sites leading to increased damage and early mortality. The personal and economic costs in decreased quality of life and increase in healthcare expenditures, respectively, highlight the critical unmet need to develop new therapeutic strategies to treat lupus, so that treatment or participation in clinical trials occurs as early as possible to mitigate against disease-related damage. Therefore, it is important to find better ways to identify SLE patents.  Electronic health records (EHR) are now used in a majority of health care settings throughout the country, and present a rich source of information about patients which can be mined for earlier diagnosis and identification to improve quality of care, or enable high throughput clinical studies. Despite this potential, to date few accurate algorithms have been developed to identify SLE patients using EHR data. Construction of an effective algorithm, either by rule-based or machine learning methods, requires access to at two data resources not commonly available: 1) a validated “gold standard” patient data set with clear documentation of criteria that are indicative of SLE that can be compared against EHR data and 2) an integrated health record dataset that contains data from multiple health care institutions and reflects that SLE patients receive healthcare at multiple institutions and healthcare providers given their chronic, progressive disease. Over the past several years, our team has created both key resources: the Chicago Lupus Database (CLD), a physician-validated registry of 880 patients and gold standard data set and the Chicago HealthLNK Data Repository (HDR), a regional data resource including integrated medical records for 2.1 million patients across multiple institutions. Jointly, these two datasets enable the creation, testing and validation of algorithms for the identification of SLE in EHR data and provide a more complete picture of a patient population at risk for lupus.  We propose three specific aims to address the need to reduce the time to identify those with SLE in order to initiate treatment in a timelier fashion and to identify candidates for clinical trials. These aims are: 1) To create and validate a series of algorithms to identify SLE patients in EHR data against a gold standard curated registry, CLD, using validated classification criteria for SLE to build concepts for rule-based and machine learning methods that incorporate structured data, laboratory data, and unstructured data, e.g., physician notes, 2) To determine whether identification of SLE patients is improved when algorithms to identify SLE patients are extended to an integrated medical record dataset that includes data from multiple health care institutions, and 3) To use clustering techniques on SLE patients identified from EHR data to isolate clinically distinct sub-populations of patients, which could inform patient selection for participation in clinical trials.

"Bayesian Generative Methods for Extracting and Modeling Relations in EHR Narratives Project Summary Medicine has evolved into an era where the entire hospital progressively adopts more real-time monitoring for the patients and generates ICU like clinical data. The rapidly growing data makes ICU a snapshot for tomorrow’s standard of care that should benefit from computer-aided decision making. These data contain not only numerical or coded information, but also a large volume of unstructured narrative text such as physicians’ and nurses' notes, specialists' reports, and discharge summaries. Both types of data have been shown to be highly informative for tasks such as cohort selection, and work best in combination. However, to achieve this, specific bits of information must be extracted from the narrative reports and coded in formal representation. These bits include medical concepts such as symptoms, diseases, medications and procedures; characteristics such as certainty, severity, dose; assertions about these items, such as whether they pertain to the patient or a family member, etc.; relations among these mentions, including indications of what condition is treated by what action and its degree of success, the time sequence and duration of events, and interpretations of laboratory test results as relations among medical concepts such as cells and antigens (e.g., “[large atypical cells] express [CD30]”). Concepts and assertions can be regarded as simple relations, and our proposal focuses on modeling narrative relations to augment structured data for predicting patient outcomes. Most existing techniques for interpreting clinical narratives either rely on hand-crafted rule systems and large medical thesauri or are based on machine learning models that create classification or regression models from large annotated data sets. The former are difficult and laborious to generalize, whereas the latter require large volumes of human-labeled data and may result in models whose operation is difficult to interpret and is therefore considered unsuitable for computer-aided decision making. We propose to build on our previous work to use unsupervised learning methods that identify frequent patterns in un-annotated narratives and identify informative patterns by tensor factorization. Although existing methods can also identify patterns that are meaningful in a data-driven sense, these patterns are difficult for clinicians to understand. Our specific goal is to develop a novel method that uses a Bayesian generative model that integrates relation mining with tensor factorization to learn patterns that correspond to an understanding of the clinical domain and can be used for evidence based patient outcome prediction. Our framework represents relations in clinical narratives as graphs, then mines subgraphs for important relations. These relations are used as features in building up a tensor model in order to reduce dimensionality, discover coherent groups of relations, and explore the group interactions. We develop Bayesian formulation to integrate relation mining and tensor modeling in a generative model, to incorporate existing medical knowledge as probability priors, as well as to reliably estimate the posterior probabilities and confidence intervals of any findings from the model. Rapid growth in the hospital adoption of large volume of Electronic Health Records (EHRs) has led to an unprecedented availability of narrative dataset for clinical and translational research. We propose the development of a novel Bayesian generative framework to enable extraction of accurate and clinically meaningful patterns of EHR narratives in order to support evidence based diagnostic reasoning and outcome risk prediction.",Bayesian Generative Methods for Extracting and Modeling Relations in EHR Narratives,9374626,R21LM012618,"['Admission activity', 'Adopted', 'Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Antigens', 'Appearance', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Code', 'Cognitive', 'Computer Assisted', 'Confidence Intervals', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Event', 'Family member', 'Formulation', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Hand', 'Hodgkin Disease', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Injectable', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Lymphoma', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'National Research Council', 'Nurses', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Pathology Report', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Probability', 'Procedures', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Severities', 'Source', 'Specialist', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'TNFRSF8 gene', 'Techniques', 'Test Result', 'Text', 'Thesauri', 'Time', 'To specify', 'Translational Research', 'Work', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'cohort', 'diagnostic panel', 'evidence base', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'mortality', 'novel', 'operation', 'outcome prediction', 'patient oriented', 'rapid growth', 'standard of care', 'success']",NLM,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R21,2017,208272,0.02902906158290324
"Automated Detection of Anomalous Accesses to Electronic Health Records DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Health information technology (HIT) can lower costs, strengthen productivity, and promote safety. To realize such benefits on a large scale, healthcare organizations (HCOs) are adopting electronic health records (EHRs) to provide various capabilities. Yet, as EHRs and the healthcare workforce grow in diversity, so does their complexity. This is a concern because evidence suggests complex HIT can interrupt care delivery, contribute to medical errors, and expose patient data to privacy breaches. Moreover, such events tend to be discovered only after they transpire en masse, leading to negative media coverage, loss of patients' trust, and sanctions. Federal regulations now enable patients to receive accountings of who accessed their medical records during treatment, payment, and operations related activities. Yet, for patients to make sense of such accountings, they need to be provided with explanations regarding the extent to which accesses are normal in the context of routine HCO activities. We believe that relating specific accesses to patterns of healthcare operations can help explain how medical records are utilized. Unfortunately, many of the aforementioned problems manifest because EHR utilization patterns rarely guide the design and refinement of healthcare management practices. Thus, the overarching objective of our research is to develop novel strategies to automatically learn HCO behavior based on EHR usage. The past several years has witnessed a flurry of activity in this field, but it remains in is infancy and has only scratched the surface of care patterns and the types of anomalies that can be detected. Through this project, we propose to develop anomaly detection methods that integrate the semantics of healthcare operations and allow for the detection of workflows over time. This will enable HCOs and patients to audit in a meaningful way. Moreover, we believe the innovation and dissemination of such data mining strategies will enable HCOs to detect anomalous events that indicate system misuse and patients who require special attention, but also effectively audit business practices and discover inefficient workflows. The specific aims of this project are (1) to develop machine learning approaches, based on intrasession utilization patterns, to streamline EHR interface configuration and detect anomalous sessions, (2) to design a data mining framework, based on intersession EHR access patterns, to characterize HCO departmental interactions in patient treatment and detect anomalous events, and (3) to infer patient management pathways to consolidate redundant processes and detect deviations from anticipated workflows. In support of these goals, we will evaluate, compare, and contrast the workflows and anomalies in the EHR systems of two large medical centers. Additionally, we will ensure that our methods are integrated into an open source software system that can assist HCOs to extract, transform, and load (ETL) access data from EHRs, analyze such data for anomalies, and visualize the results in interfaces that enable review by healthcare administrators and patients. In doing so, we will be able to compare and contrast behavior of the workflows and multiple institutions and develop methods that appropriately generalize across EHR systems. As electronic health record systems, and healthcare organizations, grow in diversity, so do their complexity, which can lead to inefficient documentation, management of patients, and expose patient data to privacy breaches. In this research, we will develop technologies, to be disseminated through an open source software suite, to learn patterns associated with healthcare operations, upon which anomaly detection techniques can be based. The specific goals of this project are to 1) model HCO users' intrasession behaviors when interacting with an EHR, 2) learn interdepartmental relations based on the accesses of common patients, and 3) infer patient management pathways based on the sequence of accesses to a patient's record.",Automated Detection of Anomalous Accesses to Electronic Health Records,9332474,R01LM010207,"['Administrator', 'Admission activity', 'Adopted', 'Architecture', 'Attention', 'Behavior', 'Businesses', 'Caring', 'Case Manager', 'Case Study', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Security', 'Detection', 'Dimensions', 'Documentation', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Employee', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Entropy', 'Event', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Graph', 'Healthcare', 'Inpatients', 'Institution', 'Interdepartmental Relations', 'Interruption', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Errors', 'Medical Records', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Movement', 'Neonatal Intensive Care', 'Neonatology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Patterns of Care', 'Phase', 'Practice Management', 'Primary Health Care', 'Privacy', 'Process', 'Productivity', 'Provider', 'Recording of previous events', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Safety', 'Semantics', 'Surface', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Trust', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'care delivery', 'comparative', 'cost', 'data access', 'data mining', 'design', 'follow-up', 'health information technology', 'infancy', 'innovation', 'novel strategies', 'open source', 'operation', 'organizational structure', 'payment', 'programs', 'software systems', 'ward', 'web portal']",NLM,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2017,341475,0.06955534119596746
"PED Screen: Pediatric Sepsis EHR Registry, Clinical Outcomes, and Predictive Model Project Summary/Abstract Each year over 75,000 children develop sepsis in the United States resulting in substantial morbidity, up to 20% mortality, and billions in US health care expenditures. There have been substantial advances that demonstrate improved patient outcomes with adherence to early aggressive emergency care. However, methods to accurately, reliably, and rapidly identify children who require these resource-intensive therapies are lacking. In addition, understanding the impact of these therapies on near-term outcomes, before significant morbidity occurs, is also lacking. Current algorithms do not reliably discriminate between patients who develop sepsis and those who are clinically similar upon initial presentation but do not progress to sepsis. As a result, children requiring life-saving treatments do not receive them, or do not receive them in a timely fashion, and others may be over-treated, wasting healthcare resources and potentially diverting emergency care from those in need. With the advent of electronic health records (EHR), there are now information-enabled solutions that offer unique opportunities to identify non-biased, heterogeneous samples of children and allow us to accurately and reliably measure risk factors and near-term outcomes for sepsis. This work addresses the critical need to improve pediatric sepsis outcomes by developing methods to accurately identify at-risk children presenting for emergency care. Utilizing the infrastructure of the Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network (PECARN), this proposal will innovatively capture EHR data to create a multi-center registry with the ultimate goal to improve the detection and treatment of pediatric sepsis in the ED setting. To accomplish this, we propose the following specific aims: We will develop an expanded multicenter sepsis registry for pediatric patients from merged electronic health record clinical data from different hospitals with different EHR data sources. We will automate the determination of organ dysfunction in children with sepsis directly from structured and narrative data within the multicenter EHR registry. From the registry and outcome data, we will derive and validate a prediction model of pediatric sepsis using emergency department EHR data from the first 4 hours of care that predicts subsequent organ dysfunction within 48 hours. Each of these aims works to the goal of improving the emergent care for pediatric sepsis with innovative deliverables from this project including the existence of a broad and rich EHR registry, an automated process of outcome determination, and a prediction model of risk of sepsis. We will also have a strong foundation for future projects to implement and evaluate decision support tools, improve diagnostic techniques, engage in comparative effectiveness studies, measure quality of care, establish linked bio-repositories, and guide clinical trial design. The proposed project, thus, has enormous potential to improve our ability to improve the quality of care provided to our most acutely ill children.  Project Narrative Sepsis is a leading cause of pediatric morbidity and mortality with life-saving treatment dependent on early and accurate identification. We will establish a multi-center data registry from electronic health records (EHR), identify a multi-center cohort of pediatric patients at risk for sepsis, automate sepsis-related pediatric organ dysfunction directly from the registry EHR data, and develop an emergency department based prediction model of sepsis related organ dysfunction. Each of these aims has the ultimate goal of improving the emergent care for pediatric sepsis with innovative deliverables from this project including the existence of a broad and rich EHR registry, the automated process of important proximal outcome determination, and an emergency department prediction model of risk of sepsis. ","PED Screen: Pediatric Sepsis EHR Registry, Clinical Outcomes, and Predictive Model",9239711,R01HD087363,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Achievement', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adherence', 'Algorithms', 'Applied Research', 'Blood Pressure', 'Caring', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Derivation procedure', 'Detection', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emergency Care', 'Emergent care', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health Expenditures', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Inpatients', 'Intervention', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Organ', 'Organ failure', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Quality of Care', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Savings', 'Sepsis', 'Shock', 'Site', 'Structure', 'Time', 'United States', 'United States Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality', 'Visit', 'Work', 'base', 'cohort', 'comparative effectiveness', 'data registry', 'design', 'effective intervention', 'electronic registry', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'member', 'mortality', 'novel', 'patient registry', 'pediatric patients', 'predictive modeling', 'repository', 'support tools', 'wasting']",NICHD,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R01,2017,735263,0.0322840756750685
"Web Software to develop an RDoC-Compatible Adaptive Diagnostic Nosology, the SID-5 n psychiatry, clinical judgment has been the predominant method of diagnosis. The `gold standard” for clinical research is the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-5 (SCID-5). The SCID-5 promotes reliability, but its validity is questionable. There is growing recognition that biomarkers can be used to identify more homogeneous patient populations, but there is substantial phenotypic discordance for schizophrenia even in identical twins. In the absence of symptom data, biomarkers alone are unlikely to yield a clinical diagnosis.  In a past SBIR project, TeleSage Inc. successfully converted the paper SCID into a web-based software program. The NetSCID-5 is now widely used in research. Nevertheless, in order to achieve the goal of “turning clinical care networks into centers for research” (Insel, Director's Blog, 2012) and furthering the RDoC initiative, we need a means of gathering rigorous diagnostic data in routine clinical care. This software must (a) require minimal clinician time, (b) allow clinics to bill according to the current DSM-5 categories, and (c) be able to gather the large amount of data necessary to inform a broad research agenda including machine learning techniques. TeleSage proposes to develop a self-report diagnostic assessment that satisfies both immediate clinical needs and broader research goals: the “Screening Interview for Diagnosis” or SID.  TeleSage has worked with an expert panel including Dr. Michael First, the primary author of the SCID- 5, iteratively developing and testing self-report items. Based on expert panel review and cognitive interviewing, we identified a final set of 661 unique self-report, Likert-scale items covering all of the individual sub-symptoms described within each of the SCID criteria. TeleSage has also created a behavioral health PORTAL that includes the NetSCID-5, IRT/CAT item administration, randomization, and longitudinal reporting capabilities. The PORTAL exchanges data and reports with several EHRs including the NetSmart EHR system.  This Direct-to-Phase II application aims to create the SID, which will (a) reside on our existing secure web PORTAL, (b) administer simple Likert-scale self-report items, (c) generate DSM-5 and ICD-10 diagnoses for billing, (d) use minimal clinician time, (e) pull pre-defined data fields from the EHR (e.g. family history, demographic, and biomarker data), (f) be able to add new self-report items for exploration, (g) integrate with machine learning tools, and (h) send raw data and interpretive reports to EHR systems. Because of these features, we believe that the SID has the potential to be used widely by both clinicians and researchers.  The SID is intended to help transcend DSM-5 and to support RDoC. The SID product must be commercially successful and useful both in routine clinical care and research. The SID is intended to facilitate the development and evolution of a new behavioral health nosology based on the aggregation of biomarker and symptom data, a nosology that is more analogous to those found in other fields of medicine. The Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-5 (SCID-5) represents the current diagnostic gold standard in behavioral health and yields much more reliable diagnoses than the unstructured patient interviews that predominate in clinical settings; however, the full SCID-5 is a lengthy and complex paper-and-pencil instrument that takes approximately 90 minutes to administer and is thus seldom used outside of clinical research settings. We want to create a new, self-report software tool that will save clinicians time relative to the paper SCID, significantly reduce diagnostic error rates, greatly increase the reliability of diagnoses in routine clinical care, and integrate seamlessly into Electronic Health Record (EHR) systems: the Screening Inventory for Diagnosis (SID). The SID is a self-report, computer-adaptive diagnostic assessment, based on easy-to- understand, five-point Likert-scale items. The SID is intended to help transcend DSM-5, support RDoC, and facilitate the development and evolution of a new behavioral health nosology based on the aggregation of biomarker and symptom data.","Web Software to develop an RDoC-Compatible Adaptive Diagnostic Nosology, the SID-5",9255772,R44MH108177,"['Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'Area', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Chemical Analysis', 'Brain scan', 'Categories', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'DSM-IV', 'DSM-V', 'Data', 'Data Reporting', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Errors', 'Differential Diagnosis', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Equipment and supply inventories', 'Evolution', 'Family', 'Future', 'Gene Frequency', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Healthcare', 'Hour', 'Individual', 'International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision (ICD-10)', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Judgment', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Mental Health', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Monozygotic twins', 'Online Systems', 'Paper', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Psyche structure', 'Psychiatry', 'Public Sector', 'Publishing', 'Questionnaires', 'Randomized', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Research Personnel', 'Sampling', 'Savings', 'Schedule', 'Schizophrenia', 'Secure', 'Severities', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Software Tools', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Transcend', 'Update', 'Work', 'base', 'behavioral health', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinical care', 'data exchange', 'disease classification', 'epigenetic marker', 'follow-up', 'health care service', 'instrument', 'mental health center', 'patient population', 'personalized medicine', 'programs', 'satisfaction', 'screening', 'specific biomarkers', 'symptom cluster', 'tool', 'usability', 'web portal']",NIMH,"TELESAGE, INC.",R44,2017,433630,0.026539083764167495
"Better Outcomes for Children: Promoting Excellence in Healthcare Genomics to Inform Policy ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In May 2012 Cincinnati Children's (CCHMC) joined eMERGE II with our Boston Children's partner. Since then we have developed algorithms for the electronic health record (EHR), led the Pediatric Workgroup, developed pharmacogenomics, evaluated the preferences of parents and caregivers to advance genomic medicine and assimilated technical advances into our EHR. The eMERGE effort has become the basic fabric of the institutional initiative to incorporate the extraordinary advances of genetics, genomics and the electronic medical record into healthcare. In addition, we bring a comprehensive EHR (EPIC), operating in every venue for healthcare delivery at CCHMC; a deidentified i2b2 data warehouse of 1.2 million patient records; and a Biobank with 150,000 consents that allow return of results to 38,000 patients and guardians who have provided 58,000 DNA samples, all with consent to return results and i2b2 EHR records. Now, we present our plan to join the eMERGE III network with 17 proposed initiatives. Our eMERGE effort is designed to move an entire institution with our eMERGE III partners into a genomic-EHR era of healthcare implementation and discovery. Our effort is divided into Genomics , Aim 1, where we hope to help the eMERGE III Steering Committee identify the 100 or so genes for the eMERGE III Targeted Gene Panel (eTGP), select our 2,000 CCHMC patients to be sequenced (of the 38,000 in our Biobank), review 4,000 targeted gene panels from clinical care at CCHMC for somatic mosaicism and reinterpretation, and further develop and disseminate a software workflow suite for sequence analysis (CASSI). For Phenotypes, Aim 2, we will extend our work generating EHR phenotype algorithms using heuristic and machine learning methods with a comprehensive set of EHR features derived from data driven algorithms to describe phenotypic pleiotropy of eTGP gene variants. We will develop working collaborations with Patients Care Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI) and the Million Veterans Program by applying eMERGE developed EHR algorithms to these large electronic data warehouses. For Implementation and Evaluation, Aim 3, we will develop tools to evaluate adolescent return of results preferences, examine the ethical and legal obligations and potential to reanalyze results, analyze the cost of tacrolimus management of kidney transplant with and without CYP3A5 testing, develop clinical decision support for phenotyping, test ordering, and returning eTGP results. Our success in these eMERGE III studies will be enhanced by the ongoing institutional investments made in the CCHMC BioBank, the comprehensive EHR (EPIC), and the i2b2 deidentified medical record data warehouse, and hundreds of Faculty and senior staff who make genomics or informatics an active focus of their research. We present a comprehensive program addressing all of the salient elements presented in the RFP for eMERGE III (HG-14-025) to enhance our collaborative productivity within the eMERGE Network in ways that ultimately improve our healthcare systems through discovery, implementation, and advanced applications of genomics and informatics. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center (CCHMC) proposes to contribute as a funded site in the eMERGE III Network by pursuing a series of initiatives designed to advance genomics and the electronic health record (EHR). We propose 100 genes to evaluate by sequencing in 2,000 patients consented for return of results, to advance genomics by evaluating fee for service for DNA sequence-based genetic testing at CCHMC, to develop the reliable identification many diseases in the EHR and along with genome wide genetic testing, to explore genetic variants for alleged and unknown clinical manifestations, to extend the work of eMERGE to other large collections of EHR and genetic data, to evaluate cost benefits of genetic testing, to characterize the genetics of pain, to explor the preferences of adolescents concerning the genetic results they prefer to learn, and to explore the legal, ethical, and social issues that surround the re-interpretation of genetic variants.

"Understanding and predicting cardiac events in HD using real-time EHRs DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of this K25 proposal is to provide Dr. Benjamin Goldstein Ph.D., M.P.H., with the necessary protected time and additional training to develop as an independent, clinical biostatistician. This proposal has two key components: (1) an innovative research plan and (2) a comprehensive training plan. It is well recognized that patients undergoing hemodialysis (HD) are at increased risk of cardiac related events which often prove fatal. While substantive research has identified risk factors for these events, little work has been performed on forecasting their occurrence. The proposed research proposes to use existing electronic health record (EHR) data available through a collaborating dialysis center, DaVita Inc, to derive such a prediction model. EHRs contain detailed information on both a patient's health history (e.g. comorbidities, medications) as well as their evolving health statu (i.e. changes in health). A particularly unique aspect of the DaVita EHR system is the availability of real-time measures of health (e.g. blood pressure, pulse) available over the course of an HD session. Through our ongoing collaboration we will have data on 10,000s of individuals each with 100s of HD sessions, presenting the opportunity to analyze millions of dialysis sessions. Within this wealth of data two particular questions will be addressed: (1) How does a patient's hemodynamics vary over the course of and across HD sessions? (2) Can we derive a predictor for the near term onset of a cardiac event? To answer question 1, sophisticated statistical methodology, referred to as functional data analysis (FDA), will be utilized. Patterns of hemodynamic measures will be compared during and across HD sessions with key features extracted. For question 2, machine learning methodology will be used to derive a prediction model for the onset of cardiac events. The final aim will be to assess the feasibility of applying such models within a clinical environment. As a Ph.D. biostatistician, Dr. Goldstein has many of the methodological and computational skills necessary to perform the proposed analyses. The proposed methods, while established, also have ample room for statistical investigation and will provide the basis for methodological research. He will be mentored by Dr. Bradley Efron, professor in the Stanford Department of Statistics, and a world recognized expert in statistical methodology. Serving as a consultant will be Drs. Trevor Hastie and John Ioannidis, fellow members of the department of statistics and experts in FDA and prediction evaluation respectively. The focus of Dr. Goldstein's training will be on developing his clinical expertise. This will be performed through a combination of didactic courses, one-on- one tutorials and clinical exposure. Dr. Wolfgang Winkelmayer, a clinical nephrologist and close collaborator of Dr. Goldstein, will supervise Dr. Goldstein's clinical knowledge development. He will be joined by Dr. Mark Hlatky, a research cardiologist, who will also provide mentorship with regards to the cardiac substance of the project. Additional consultants across the department of medicine will be used as needed. The proposed project will have a tremendous impact on Dr. Goldstein's career prospects. At the end of the 5 year period he will have begun the process of developing a research program in the analysis of EHR data. There will be ample avenues to pursue future studies, through the analysis of other predictor variables (e.g. biomarkers, psycho-social factors), outcomes (e.g. hospitalization, cost) and most importantly, implementation of the prediction models in the clinic. The clinical training period will provide him with the necessary background to succeed as a clinically-oriented biostatistician and develop as a leader in the field. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Electronic health records have become increasingly common in clinical settings but to this point have been underutilized for research purposes. This project will analyze real-time EHR data that are generated during a dialysis session. The focus will be on understanding patients' hemodynamic changes over the course of a three hour dialysis session and using that information to derive a prediction model for severe cardiac events.",Understanding and predicting cardiac events in HD using real-time EHRs,9324206,K25DK097279,"['Accounting', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Advertising', 'Algorithms', 'Assessment tool', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Pressure', 'Breast Cancer Risk Assessment Tool', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Cluster randomized trial', 'Collaborations', 'Comorbidity', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Dialysis procedure', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Economics', 'Education', 'Electronic Health Record', 'End stage renal failure', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Heart Arrest', 'Hemodialysis', 'Hospitalization', 'Hour', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Investigation', 'Kidney', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Length', 'Machine Learning', 'Master of Public Health', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mind', 'Modeling', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Play', 'Preventive measure', 'Process', 'Psychosocial Factor', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'career', 'clinical care', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'demographics', 'disorder risk', 'health information technology', 'hemodynamics', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'member', 'predictive modeling', 'professor', 'programs', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'skills', 'statistics', 'tool']",NIDDK,DUKE UNIVERSITY,K25,2017,156686,0.02163537363104761
"Childhood obesity surveillance using electronic health records data ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Childhood obesity is associated with high financial cost and increased morbidity and mortality in adulthood. Health care spending due to obesity is estimated to be as high as \$210 billion annually, or 21\% of total national spending. A childhood obesity surveillance system will discern disparities, detect aberrant signals, design targeted interventions, and track change over time. In addition to national public health surveillance systems, local data are increasingly necessary to reflect regional trends. Current systems in Wisconsin are subject to (1) bias estimation of obesity rates, (2) limited data in school-aged children ages 5-10 years, (3) insufficient power to estimate disparities in local subgroups, and (4) limited ability to track local changes over time. Therefore, the impact of investments and collective efforts in Wisconsin childhood obesity prevention has been difficult to measure. This, in turn, demands approaches that overcome and transcend the posited limitations. Since large electronic health records (EHRs) systems have been developed to routinely collect information over time, there has been a paradigm shift and accelerated improvements in the use of EHR data for the purpose of population health promotion and tracking of progress. The University of Wisconsin Population Health Information Exchange (PHINEX) database contains de- identified EHR data from a multicenter healthcare system located primarily in south central Wisconsin. In partnership with The Wisconsin Obesity Prevention Initiative, we aim to create an EHR model for a childhood obesity prevention surveillance system. We propose to develop innovative statistical machine learning methods using the platform of PHINEX for childhood obesity prevention purposes. This enhance and extend surveillance activities of childhood obesity conditions, and increase the effectiveness of evidence-based interventions aimed at changing policies, systems, and environments associated with childhood obesity. We plan to address the following aims: (1) robust estimation of the spatiotemporal prevalence at area level, (2) hot spot detection on areas with aberrant obesity incidence, and (3) prediction for childhood weight gain phenotypes. The developed and implemented surveillance system can benefit future planning, legislation and implementation in other states and/or surveillance of other acute and chronic health conditions. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Childhood obesity has emerged as a leading health concern in the 21st century. Current data sources from which childhood obesity estimates are derived in most systems are primarily cross-sectional, are from small sample sizes, and/or have limited generalizability. Large electronic health records (EHRs) systems have been developed to routinely collect information over time, which provide unprecedented opportunities for individual and population health surveillance. We propose to develop innovative statistical machine learning methods to increase the use of large EHR data for childhood obesity prevention purposes, extending the scope of public health surveillance.",Childhood obesity surveillance using electronic health records data,9328110,R21HD086754,"['Accounting', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Affordable Care Act', 'Age', 'Area', 'Biometry', 'Caring', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Chronic', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Collaborations', 'Comorbidity', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'County', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Evaluation', 'Evidence based intervention', 'Family Practice', 'Financial cost', 'Future', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Personnel', 'Health Promotion', 'Health Sciences', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hot Spot', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention', 'Investments', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Municipalities', 'Obesity', 'Overweight', 'Phenotype', 'Policies', 'Population Surveillance', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention strategy', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reporting', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sample Size', 'School-Age Population', 'Signal Transduction', 'Smiling', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Statutes and Laws', 'Subgroup', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Transcend', 'Uncertainty', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Weight Gain', 'Wisconsin', 'Work', 'base', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'data resource', 'data structure', 'design', 'evidence base', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'intervention program', 'learning strategy', 'mortality', 'novel', 'obesity in children', 'obesity prevention', 'population based', 'population health', 'public health intervention', 'public health relevance', 'spatiotemporal', 'statistics', 'success', 'tool', 'trend', 'user friendly software']",NICHD,FRED HUTCHINSON CANCER RESEARCH CENTER,R21,2017,259287,0.030441159880124555
"Patient Medical History Representation, Extraction, and Inference from EHR Data DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The significance of developing tools for automatically harvesting temporal constraints of clinical events from Electronic Health Records (EHR) cannot be overestimated. Efficient analysis of the temporal aspects in EHR data could boost an array of clinical and translational research such as disease progression studies, decision support systems, and personalized medicine.     One big challenge we are facing is to automatically untangle and linearize the temporal constraints of clinical events embedded in highly diverse large-scale EHR data. Barriers to temporal data modeling, normalization, extraction, and reasoning have precluded the efficient use of EHR data sources for event history evaluation and trending analysis: (1) The current federally-supported EHR data normalization tools do not focus on the time aspect of unstructured data yet; (2) Existing time models focus only on structured data with absolute time, lack of supporting reasoning systems, or only offer application-specific partial solutions which cannot be adopted by the complex EHR data; (3) Current temporal information extraction approaches are either difficult to be adopted to EHR data, not scalable, or only offers application-specific partial solution.     This proposed project fills in the current gaps among ontologies, Natural Language Processing (NLP), and EHR-based clinical research for temporal data representation, normalization, extractions, and reasoning. We propose to develop novel approaches for automatic temporal data representation, normalization and reasoning for large, diverse, and heterogeneous EHR data and prepare the integrated data for further analysis. We will build new reasoning and extraction capacities on our TIMER (Temporal Information Modeling, Extracting, and Reasoning) framework to provide an end-to-end, open-source, standard-conforming software package. TIMER will be built on strong prior work by our team. We will develop new features in our CNTRO (Clinical Narrative Temporal Relation Ontology) for semantically defining the time domain and representing temporal data in complex EHR data. On top of the new developed CNTRO semantics, we will implement temporal relation reasoning capacities to automatically normalize temporal expressions, compute and infer temporal relations, and resolve ambiguities. We will leverage existing NLP tools and work on top of these tools to develop new extraction approaches to fill in the current gaps between NLP approaches and ontology-based reasoning approaches. We will adapt the SHARPn EHR data normalization pipeline and cTAKES for extracting and normalizing clinical event mentions from clinical narratives. We will explore an innovative approach for temporal relation extraction and event coreference, and make it work with the TIMER framework. We will evaluate the system using Diabetes Mellitus (DM) and colorectal cancer (CRC) patient cohorts from two insititutions. Each component will be tested separately first followed by an evaluation of the whole framework. Results such as precision, recall, and f-measure will be reported. Project Narrative The significance of developing capabilities for automatically harvesting temporal constraints for clinical events from Electronic Health Records (EHR) cannot be overestimated. A substantial portion of the information in the EHR is historical in nature. Patient medical history can be long, especially in complex patients. The proposed work, by offering an end-to-end open-source framework for automatically extracting, normalizing, and reasoning clinically-important time-relevant information from large-scale EHR data, can boost an array of clinical and translational research such as disease progression studies, decision support systems, and personalized medicine; as well as facilitate clinical practice for early disease detection, post-treatment care, and patient-clinician communication.","Patient Medical History Representation, Extraction, and Inference from EHR Data",9332464,R01LM011829,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Aftercare', 'Archives', 'Automated Annotation', 'Big Data', 'Caring', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Reporting', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Detection', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Harvest', 'Human', 'Institutes', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medical History', 'Medical Records', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Ontology', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Recording of previous events', 'Registries', 'Reporting', 'Resolution', 'Semantics', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translational Research', 'Work', 'application programming interface', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'colon cancer patients', 'data modeling', 'data structure', 'information model', 'innovation', 'novel strategies', 'open source', 'personalized medicine', 'tool', 'trend analysis']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR HOUSTON,R01,2017,335217,0.09895186513416336
"Improved Disease Stratification Using Electronic Health Records ABSTRACT This Career Development Application describes targeted coursework and mentored research for progression to independent research in the use of electronic health record data for disease subtyping. Electronic health records have demonstrated great promise as a scalable source of data for biomedical research to enable “precision medicine.” Use of natural language processing techniques has enabled computational analysis of specific terms found in free text clinical notes. An improved ability to extract symptom information from clinical notes would improve researchers’ ability to use de-identified data from patient records for discovery of disease subtypes. Symptom-related terms are particularly important in the context of mental health, but also harder to detect in notes than other terms like diseases or drug names.  The research aims of this proposal present a novel approach to scalable extension of biomedical terminologies and improved detection of those terms and their modifiers (e.g. severe, familial, absent). The richer dataset that can be extracted using these enhanced approaches is then used to define patient cohorts and to detect disease subtypes and predictors of response to specific pharmaceutical intervention.  Resulting patient stratification will be compared to groupings made without the enriched data and validated on an independent data set. The overarching hypothesis of this work is that enhanced mining of clinical notes will enable statistically significant and clinically relevant symptom-based stratification of psychiatric disorders. In order to test this hypothesis, I will: Aim 1: Develop a semi-automated pipeline for domain-specific terminology extension Aim 2: Define and stratify patient cohorts through use of enhanced term extraction Aim 3: Evaluate the validity and utility of the richer set of data obtained through Aims 1 and 2  One area of greatest need for more evidence-based disease stratification, and also of greatest challenge for a number of reasons, is that of mental health. Mental health disorders account for 30% of non-fatal disease burden world-wide, and pose an economic burden of trillions of dollars and climbing. Moreover, mental health symptoms are generally subjective and self-reported, with few objectively measurable signs. The impact of this proposal is that it will dramatically improve our ability to use EHR data to stratify patients in this drastically underserved area of health and healthcare.  The major innovations of this project are the adaptation and application of a semi-supervised pattern learning pipeline to augment mental health terminologies, and a novel approach to disease stratification using a significantly underutilized source of biomedical data, namely clinical notes.  This work addresses a major challenge for mining clinical notes in rapidly evolving biomedical domains and leverages a valuable source of medical evidence that is largely untapped and underutilized. Together, these methods for enhanced use of clinical notes will enable identification of distinct patient subgroups using data that is sitting idle in EHRs. Project Narrative Electronic health records have demonstrated great promise as a scalable source of data for biomedical research to enable “precision medicine.” Natural language processing has enabled the use of information from clinical notes in addition to structured data like diagnoses and lab values. This work aims to improve our ability to extract useful information from electronic health records to enable disease subtyping, particularly in the area of mental health.",Improved Disease Stratification Using Electronic Health Records,9453180,K01LM012529,"['Address', 'Area', 'Biological', 'Biomedical Research', 'Categories', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Complement', 'Computer Analysis', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease stratification', 'Economic Burden', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Genotype', 'Grouping', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Measurable', 'Medical', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Names', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Phenotype', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rheumatology', 'Severities', 'Source', 'Statistical Models', 'Stratification', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Supervision', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Terminology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Work', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'career development', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinically actionable', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'disease classification', 'disorder subtype', 'electronic data', 'evidence base', 'improved', 'innovation', 'novel strategies', 'patient stratification', 'phenotypic data', 'precision medicine', 'predicting response', 'response', 'treatment response']",NLM,DUKE UNIVERSITY,K01,2017,189054,0.032155827516047814
"Advancing Cancer Pharmacoepidemiology Research Through EHRs and Informatics ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of cancer pharmacoepidemiology is to identify adverse and/or long-term effects of chemotherapeutic agents and determine the impact of drugs on cancer risk, prevention, and response to treatments. Pharmacoepidemiology studies exert strong influence on defining optimal treatments and accelerating translational research. Therefore, it is imperative for these to be done efficiently and leveraging real-world patient data such as electronic health records (EHR). Massive clinical data from EHRs are being tapped into for research in disease-gene associations, comparative effectiveness and clinical outcomes. There is however paucity in pharmacoepidemiological studies using comprehensive EHR data due to the inherent challenges that exist for data abstraction, handling and analysis. The hurdles include heterogeneity of reports, embedding of detailed clinical information in narrative text, differing EHR platforms across different sites and missing data to name a few. In this study, we propose to integrate and extend preexisting tools to build an informatics infrastructure for EHR data extraction, interpretation, management and analysis to advance cancer pharmacoepidemiology research. We will leverage existing tools of natural language processing (NLP), standardized ontologies and clinical data management systems to extract and manipulate EHR data for cancer pharmacoepidemiological research. To achieve our goal we propose four specific aims. In aim 1, we intend to develop a high-performance, user- centric information extraction framework with advanced features such as active learning (to reduce annotation cost), domain adaptation (to transfer data across multiple sites) and user-friendly interfaces (for non-technical end users). In aim 2, we plan to improve data harmonization across differing platforms, develop components for seamless data export as well as expand methodologies to address impediments inherent to EHR-based data (such as the missing data problem). In aim 3, we will conduct demonstration projects of cancer pharmacoepidemiology including pharmacovigilance and pharmacogenomics of chemotherapeutic agents to evaluate, refine and validate the broad uses of our tools. Finally in aim 4, we propose to disseminate the methods and tools developed in this project to the cancer research and pharmacoepidemiology communities. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In this project, we propose to integrate and extend previously developed tools to build an informatics infrastructure for electronic health records (EHR) data extraction, interpretation, management, and analysis, to advance cancer pharmacoepidemiology research. Such methods can efficiently integrate and standardize cancer pharmacoepidemiology specific information from EHRs across different sites, thus advancing research in this field.",Advancing Cancer Pharmacoepidemiology Research Through EHRs and Informatics,9331533,U24CA194215,"['Active Learning', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Advanced Malignant Neoplasm', 'Algorithms', 'American Association of Cancer Research', 'American Society of Clinical Oncology', 'Award', 'Benefits and Risks', 'CCL4 gene', 'Cancer Intervention', 'Cancer Patient', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Data Aggregation', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Documentation', 'Drug Exposure', 'Drug usage', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ethics', 'Face', 'Funding', 'Generic Drugs', 'Genes', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health Policy', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hybrids', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Learning', 'Letters', 'Long-Term Effects', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medex', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Names', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Observational Study', 'Ontology', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacoepidemiology', 'Pharmacogenomics', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Preventive', 'Public Health Informatics', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recurrence', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Selection Bias', 'Site', 'Smoking Status', 'Standardization', 'System', 'Text', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Translational Research', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vision', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'cancer risk', 'cancer type', 'chemotherapeutic agent', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'comparative effectiveness', 'cost', 'data management', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'informatics infrastructure', 'interest', 'longitudinal dataset', 'novel', 'open source', 'public health relevance', 'rapid growth', 'success', 'tool', 'treatment response', 'user-friendly']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR HOUSTON,U24,2017,623596,0.06940470421842232

Advanced informatics methods supported include natural language processing (NLP), ontologies, database and clinical decision support, and application of vital data management tools for secure data collection, storage, annotation, retrieval, and integration. Advanced epidemiological and statistical methods include time-updated exposure techniques, multiple imputation, propensity score techniques, measurement error correction, and competing risks regression. Routine, but essential, statistical methods include Cox proportional hazards, logistic and linear regression, goodness of fit diagnostics, and agreement/accuracy metrics (kappa, sensitivity, specificity, etc.). The RIB will further leverage the observational and interventional studies, simulation models, and well-coordinated network of cores and workgroups of COMpAAAS with advanced informatics and biostatistical techniques tailored to the particular challenges of large scale, longitudinal data from multiple sources including electronic health records (EHR), clinical interventions, patient self-report, and tissue repositories. Our specific aims are to provide 1) statistical and 2) informatics expertise for COMpAAAS to maximize scientific impact. To accomplish this, we will enhance the design, recruitment, and follow-up of intervention studies, support appropriate design and execution of data analyses and cross cohort collaborations, provide advanced statistical methods plus estimates of alcohol patterns for OR modeling and identify sexual/gender minority populations (CHAMP) from VACS survey data. In addition we will enhance the Consortium Web-Based Laboratory (WBL Portal) informatics infrastructure to support ongoing research design, data collection and management, development and testing of interventions such as clinical decision support and eHealth tools and enhance support for the analysis of textual data. The Resource for Informatics and Biostatistics (RIB) will extend and enhance the research capacities and productivity among investigators at the NIAAA-funded Consortium to improve OutcoMes in hiv/AIDS, Alcohol, Aging, and multi-Substance use (COMpAAAS). This resource will provide Biostatistics and Informatics expertise that will allow investigators to develop techniques tailored to the particular challenges of large scale, longitudinal data from multiple sources including electronic health records (EHR), clinical interventions, patient self-report, and tissue repositories.",5/6 COMpAAAS U24: Resource in Informatics and Biostatistics (RIB),9338098,U24AA022001,"['Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome', 'Address', 'Aging', 'Agreement', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Alcohols', 'Biometry', 'Biostatistics Core', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Databases', 'Delirium', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Documentation', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Epidemiology', 'Funding', 'HIV', 'HIV/HCV', 'Informatics', 'Information Technology', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Laboratories', 'Linear Regressions', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Observational Study', 'Online Systems', 'Ontology', 'Operations Research', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Pneumonia', 'Policy Maker', 'Polypharmacy', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Productivity', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Resource Informatics', 'Resources', 'Retrieval', 'Risk', 'Secure', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Sexual and Gender Minorities', 'Source', 'Statistical Methods', 'Surveys', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Update', 'Validation', 'Work', 'alcohol research', 'cohort', 'data management', 'design', 'eHealth', 'experience', 'falls', 'follow-up', 'hazard', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'informatics infrastructure', 'models and simulation', 'repository', 'therapy design', 'tool']",NIAAA,YALE UNIVERSITY,U24,2017,282773,0.01282366266828141
"Temporal relation discovery for clinical text ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         The overarching long-term vision of our research is to create novel technologies for processing clinical free text. We will build upon the previous work of our ongoing project ""Temporal relation discovery for clinical text"" (R01LM010090) dubbed Temporal Histories of Your Medical Events (THYME; thyme.healthnlp.org) which has been focusing on methodology for event, temporal expressions and temporal relations discovery from the clinical text residing in the Electronic Health Records (EHR). We developed a comprehensive approach to temporality in the clinical text and innovated in computable temporal representations, methods for temporal relation discovery and their evaluation, rendering temporality to end users - resulting in over 35+ papers and presentations. Our dissemination is international and far-reaching as the best performing methods are released open source as part of the Apache Clinical Text Analysis and Knowledge Extraction System (ctakes.apache.org). The methods we developed are now being used in such nation-wide initiatives as the Electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE), Pharmacogenomics Network (PGRN), Informatics for Integrating the Biology and the Bedside (i2b2), Patient Centered Outcomes Research Institute and National Cancer Institute's Informatics Technology for Cancer Research (ITCR). Through our participation in organizing major international bakeoffs - CLEF/ShARe 2014, SemEval 2014 Analysis of Clinical Text Task 7, SemEval 2015 Analysis of Clinical Text Task 14, SemEval 2015 Clinical TempEval Task 6 - we further disseminated the THYME resources and challenged the international research community to explore new solutions to the unsolved temporality task. Through all these activities it became clear that computational approaches to temporality still present great challenges and usability of the output is still limited. Therefore, we propose to further innovate on methodologies and end user experience.             Specific Aim 1: Extract enhanced representations and novel features to support deriving timeline information.     Specific Aim 2: Develop methods to amalgamate individual patient episode timelines into an aggregate patient-level timeline.     Specific Aim 3: Mine the EHR - the unstructured clinical text and the structured codified information - for full patient-level temporality.     Specific Aim 4: Develop a comprehensive temporal visualization tool     Specific Aim 5: Develop methodology for and perform extrinsic evaluation on specific use case.     Specific Aim 6: (1) Evaluate state-of-the-art of temporal relations through organizing international challenges under the auspices of SemEval, (2) Disseminate the results through publications, presentations, and open source code in Apache cTAKES. Functional testing. Project Narrative Temporal relations are of prime importance in biomedicine as they are intrinsically linked to diseases, signs and symptoms, and treatments. Understanding the timeline of clinically relevant events is key to the next generation of translational research where the importance of generalizing over large amounts of data holds the promise of deciphering biomedical puzzles.

"Integrating EHR and Genomics to Predict Multiple Sclerosis Drug Response PROJECT SUMMARY The growing expansion of the approved multiple sclerosis (MS) disease-modifying treatments (DMTs) and the variable responses to MS treatment have created an unmet medical need to provide individually tailored therapy. Efforts to bring precision medicine to provide individualized MS treatment selection have been impeded by our limited understanding of the factors that determine treatment response. While genomics hold the promise for closing this knowledge gap, the insufficient number of patients with detailed treatment response data and the modest effect size of genetic variants that influence treatment responses are the main limiting factors in pharmacogenomics studies. As electronic health records (EHR) become widely adopted and increasingly standardized and as we implement sophisticated computational and statistical methods to harness the EHR data, EHR systems can become cost-effective platforms to perform large-scale treatment response studies in real-life settings. Our team with a history of productive collaborations and diverse expertise (led by PI Dr. Xia) previously developed robust algorithms to identify 5,495 MS patients from the Partners HealthCare EHR systems and then model MS disease activity in these patients using EHR data. The Partners EHR system contains longitudinal clinical information on thousands of MS patients from two large academic medical centers and is linked to a well-characterized MS patient research registry and biobanks with existing genomics data. For the proposed study, we will test the hypothesis that meaningful phenotypes of MS disease activity can be extracted from EHR data to inform treatment response, and that additional common genetic variants exist in the population and can predict therapeutic response in MS when combined with clinical features derived from EHR data. The proposed study has three aims with the overall goal to produce a computational and analytic approach capable of identifying MS disease activity in relation to treatment history using EHR data and integrate with genomics profile to develop a predictive model of therapeutic response to commonly prescribed DMTs in this cohort of 5,495 MS patients, including injectable (interferon-β, glatiramer acetate) and oral (fingolimod, dimethyl fumarate) options. Specifically, we will (1) leverage narrative electronic health records data (e.g., clinical notes, radiology reports) and natural language processing (NLP) to ascertain individualized response to DMTs (n=600 for each DMT); (2) Identify clinical features from electronic health record data (e.g., diagnoses, exposures) that predict response to DMTs using a systematic phenome-wide approach; (3) Develop and test a comprehensive predictive model of individualized response to DMTs that incorporates clinical and genetic predictors. This research has the potential impact to be transformative by contributing to a major knowledge gap regarding the factors that influence treatment response and bringing precision medicine closer to individualized MS treatment selection. PROJECT NARRATIVE AND PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic neurological condition that affects over 400,000 individuals in the United States and creates a high socioeconomic burden as a leading cause of neurological disability in young adults. Because not all patients respond the same way to a specific medication, physicians and MS patients often lose precious time searching for effective treatment with serially testing of costly medications. An individually tailored treatment can ensure early start of effective medication that can prevent relapse and progression of disability. Ultimately, this project will help gain insights into the factors that determine treatment response and enable physicians to match an individual MS patient's clinical and genomic profile with uniquely tailored therapy to maximize effectiveness, delay disease progression and reduce overall cost.",Integrating EHR and Genomics to Predict Multiple Sclerosis Drug Response,9358350,R01NS098023,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Adopted', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Biology', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Computing Methodologies', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Fumarates', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Injectable', 'Interferon-beta', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Link', 'Longitudinal prospective study', 'Manuals', 'Medical', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neurologic', 'Neurologist', 'Oral', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacogenomics', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Recording of previous events', 'Registries', 'Relapse', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Selection for Treatments', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Methods', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'TimeLine', 'Treatment Cost', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States', 'Variant', 'biobank', 'clinical predictors', 'cohort', 'copolymer 1', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'disability', 'effective therapy', 'experience', 'genetic predictors', 'genetic variant', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'genomic profiles', 'individualized medicine', 'insight', 'multiple sclerosis patient', 'multiple sclerosis treatment', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'phenome', 'portability', 'precision medicine', 'predicting response', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'socioeconomics', 'treatment group', 'treatment response', 'young adult']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2017,344715,0.07686752110648665
"Novel Informatics Approaches for Ascertainment of PAD Status and Adverse Outcomes ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The applicant and principal investigator (PI) is a board-certified cardiologist, Assistant Professor of Medicine and Senior Associate Consultant in the Mayo Clinic Cardiovascular Division. [The long-term goal of the PI is to become an independent clinician-investigator in translational informatics focused on the development, validation and deployment of electronic tools to the point-of-care to improve outcomes for patients with cardiovascular disease.

"Data-Mining Clinical Decision Support from Electronic Health Records ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)    Data-Mining Clinical Decision Support from Electronic Health Records Public Health Motivation: National healthcare quality is compromised by undesirable variability, reflected in different locales having anywhere from 20-80% compliance with evidence-based guidelines. Much of this is due to uncertainty, with half of clinical practice guidelines lacking adequate evidence to confirm their efficacy. This is unsurprising when clinical trials cost >$15 million to answer individual clinical questions. The result is medical practice routinely driven by individual opinio and anecdotal experience. While Big Data has revolutionized how society processes internet scale information, the status quo in clinical decision making remains the manual interpretation of literature and isolated decision aids. The adoption of electronic health records (EHR) creates a new opportunity to answer a ""grand challenge in clinical decision support (CDS)."" In a learning health system, we could automatically adapt knowledge from the collective expertise embedded in the EHR practices of real clinicians and close the loop by disseminating that knowledge back as executable decision support. Candidate Goals and Objectives: The unifying goal of this BD2K K01 proposal is the mentored career development of Jonathan H. Chen, MD, PhD. This proposal will accelerate his transition into an independent physician scientist, towards his long-term goals to produce Big Data technologies that answer such grand challenges in clinical decision support. His near-term objective is developing methods to translate EHR data into useful knowledge in the form of patient- specific, point-of-care clinical order recommendations for acute medical hospitalizations. His doctoral background in computer science gives him the technical capability to achieve these objectives, while his medical training will ensure clinically meaningful results. His preliminary work to build an order recommender, analogous to commercial product recommenders, demonstrates the proposal's overall feasibility. Institutional Environment and Career Development: The research facilities and training opportunities at Stanford University provide the ideal environment to achieve these objectives, with established and growing Centers for Biomedical Informatics Research, the Biomedical Data Science Initiative, and the first Clinical Informatics Fellowship accredited in the nation. Prof. Russ Altman, Director of the Biomedical Informatics Training Program, will lead a collaborative team of mentors with expertise in clinical decision support (Mary Goldstein), implementation science (Steven Asch), data-mining electronic health records (Nigam Shah), statistical learning algorithms (Lester Mackey), and healthcare statistics (Michael Baiocchi). Combined with respective didactic training, this mentorship will enable Dr. Chen to achieve his objectives through a series of research aims. Research Aims: The overriding hypothesis of the proposal is that clinical knowledge reflected in clinical order patterns from historical EHR data can improve medical decision making when adapted into functional clinical decision support. The specific aims each address components of this concept, as they seek to: (1) Develop the algorithms to learn clinical order patterns from historical EHR data, building on a preliminary recommender system; (2) Assess how underlying clinician proficiency affects the quality of those learned clinical order patterns through observational data inference against external standards; and (3) Determine the impact of automatically learned clinical decision support (CDS) on (simulated) clinical workflows through a randomized controlled crossover trial of human-computer interfaces with real clinicians. Expected Results and General Significance: By the completion of the proposed work, Dr. Chen will answer the grand challenge in clinical decision support (CDS) by automating much of the CDS production process, and have direct translational impact with a prototype system. This will advance the field with new paradigms of generating and disseminating clinical knowledge, which can then improve the consistency and quality of healthcare delivery. Additional benefits will include methods to identify and monitor areas of high practice variability for targeted optimization and improve predictive models that inform precision medicine. With this applied research experience and career development, Dr. Chen can compete for R01 funding and become an independent physician scientist developing Big Data approaches to solve national healthcare problems in clinical decision making. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    National healthcare quality is compromised by undesirable practice variability and medical uncertainty, with most medical practice routinely driven by individual opinions and anecdotal experience. With methods analogous to commercial product recommender systems, the proposed project will automatically learn patterns in raw clinical transaction data to capture the undocumented knowledge of real-world clinicians, and close the loop in a learning health system by disseminating that knowledge back as clinical decision support to improve patient care.",Data-Mining Clinical Decision Support from Electronic Health Records,9325317,K01ES026837,"['Accreditation', 'Achievement', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Admission activity', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Applied Research', 'Area', 'Back', 'Big Data', 'Big Data to Knowledge', 'Caring', 'Chiroptera', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Clinical Practice Guideline', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cross-Over Trials', 'Crowding', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Decision Aid', 'Decision Making', 'Diagnosis', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Exhibits', 'Failure', 'Fellowship', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'Internet', 'Investments', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Locales', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Medical', 'Medical Residency', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Motivation', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Privatization', 'Process', 'Production', 'Public Health', 'Quality of Care', 'Randomized', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Research Training', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Services', 'Societies', 'Source', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Transact', 'Translating', 'Uncertainty', 'Universities', 'User-Computer Interface', 'Validation', 'Weight', 'Work', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'career development', 'clinical care', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical practice', 'clinical predictors', 'computer science', 'cost', 'data mining', 'design', 'evidence based guidelines', 'experience', 'health care delivery', 'health care quality', 'implementation science', 'improved', 'multidisciplinary', 'point of care', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'research facility', 'routine practice', 'statistics', 'support tools', 'training opportunity', 'translational impact']",NIEHS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,K01,2017,178606,-0.0057775535995157985
"Using the electronic health record to identify children likely to suffer last-minute surgery cancellation PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Last-minute cancellation of surgery frequently leads to psychological stress and financial hardships that disproportionately affect individuals of low socioeconomic status. Moreover, cancellation leaves unutilized healthcare resources valued as high as $1 per second. Machine learning can uncover patterns in historical data to identify predictors, and captures relationships among many factors to allow assessment of risk associated with a particular set of conditions. There is a critical need to develop a model system through machine learning both to understand and to predict cancellation. The long-term goal is to develop evidence- based strategies for improved perioperative resource utilization and efficiency. The overall objective in this application is to develop and deploy an analytical model for predicting last-minute surgical cancellations. The central hypothesis is that a predictive model based on patient-specific and contextual factors will accurately determine the probability of cancellation. The hypothesis has been formulated on the basis of preliminary data showing that risk of cancellation varies substantially with respect to data extracted from the electronic health record (EHR). The rationale for the proposed research is that development of a model that can accurately predict the probability of last-minute cancellation of surgical procedures is likely to provide new opportunities for improving healthcare costs and efficiency. The hypothesis will be tested by pursuing three specific aims: 1) Develop computerized models for predicting surgery cancellation; 2) Identify key predictors of last-minute cancelation of surgery from the EHR and online data resources; and 3) Establish a scalable last-minute surgery cancellation prediction system. Under the first aim, using a pre-existing database and machine- learning techniques already established as feasible in the applicants' hands, patient-specific and contextual data from two pediatric surgical sites in a large Midwest conurbation will be mined. Under the second aim, these predictive models will be interrogated to generate actionable advice. Under the third aim, the optimal model will be identified and integrated into the clinical workflow to direct cancellation prevention and mitigation strategies. The approach is innovative, in the applicants' opinion, because it represents a substantial departure from the status quo by employing machine-learning techniques on large and detailed datasets drawing from the modern EHR and publicly available contextual data. The proposed research is significant because it will both have broad translational importance in perioperative management and also elucidate the etiology of cancellation. The positive impact is expected to be in facilitating quality improvement projects and operating room management strategies to increase utilization of expensive perioperative resources. Successful completion of the proposed research is also expected to lead to more timely surgeries at lower cost for hundreds of thousands of patients, which is of vital importance at a time when the cost of healthcare is ever increasing. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research is relevant to public health because a clinically useful approach to decreasing last- minute cancellations of surgery will provide new opportunities to reduce healthcare expenditures and improve overall efficiency. The project is relevant to AHRQ's mission by making surgical care more accessible, equitable, and affordable.",Using the electronic health record to identify children likely to suffer last-minute surgery cancellation,9338140,R21HS024983,[' '],AHRQ,CINCINNATI CHILDRENS HOSP MED CTR,R21,2017,174567,0.041729568668255744
"NLP to Identify and Rank Clinically Relevant Information for EHRs in the Emergency Department Summary Timely identification of relevant or “need to know” clinical information about a patient’s history in the acute care setting can be critical for patient safety and medical decision-making. Often the relevant information is buried in unstructured or free-text narratives within the Electronic Health Record (EHR), making it difficult to access in a timely fashion. Currently, it is estimated that over 50% of the EHR is free-text. EHR search tools today are often inefficient, simplistic, and unable to rank or evoke the relevance of information for a particular problem or complaint. This is compounded by the fact that EHRs are amassing clinical information at an exponential rate. While the benefits of having a wealth of information at a provider’s fingertips seem obvious, the time and energy cost of culling through enormous amounts of data creates new issues of decreased efficiency and information overload for providers seeking to identify the most pertinent and relevant information about their patients. In the emergency department, where patients can present with life threatening conditions, timely unlocking of clinically relevant information for a patient’s problem or complaint at the point of care can be critical to medical decision-making and patient safety. In this study, we plan to address this challenge through the development of a sophisticated natural language processing (NLP) search tool to automatically identify and rank clinically relevant information based on the patients presenting complaint. We will accomplish this through the following specific aims: 1) identify and define complaint- specific information elements within a patient’s history and 2) develop and test an NLP-based information retrieval tool. Narrative Patient safety hinges on having right information about the right patient and the right time. Often the relevant information is buried in unstructured or free-text narratives within the Electronic Health Record (EHR), making it difficult to access in a timely fashion. The purpose of this study is to develop and evaluate a sophisticated natural language processing (NLP) search tool to automatically identify and rank clinically relevant information from EHRs that providers rely upon to make medical decisions for their patients. This study comes at an important time where data in the EHRs is increasing at an exponential rate, creating a new problem for clinicians, that of finding all the relevant information for patient’s particular problem. This is particularly true in the emergency department setting where providers have limited if any prior relationship and often have to make quick decisions for patients with life threatening conditions. This search tool will provide a snapshot of clinically relevant information that the providers can view alongside the structured information already in the EHR. We believe this approach has the potential to increase clinician efficiency, decrease healthcare costs by avoiding duplicate diagnostic tests, and provide clinicians with the tools they need to make well-informed medical decisions, thereby improving patient safety and reducing suffering.",NLP to Identify and Rank Clinically Relevant Information for EHRs in the Emergency Department,9342692,R21HS024541,[' '],AHRQ,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,R21,2017,148922,0.04009383460023337
"Scalable Clinical Decision Support for Individualized Cancer Risk Management Project Summary / Abstract We propose to enable a scalable clinical decision support (CDS) platform that helps clinicians and patients select cancer screening strategies that are best suited to each individual. This kind of CDS is important because increased evidence supports personalizing cancer screening decisions according to each individual's unique cancer risks. While a highly desired goal, individualizing screening at a population scale requires the implementation of patient-specific risk assessments for several types of cancer. This is quite challenging in today's overwhelmed primary care environment. Our proposed CDS platform addresses this challenge by (i) automating the risk stratification process at the population level based on EHR data and patient reported data; (ii) prioritizing patients for case review by genetic counselors; and (iii) automatically communicating risk and screening recommendations with primary care providers and their patients. We will integrate the CDS platform with the Epic EHR and test it at the University of Utah Health Care community clinics and the Huntsman Cancer Institute. We will assess the generalizability of the CDS platform with a different EHR (Cerner) at a different institution (Intermountain Healthcare). To maximize the dissemination potential for the proposed cancer risk screening platform, we will extend two well-established open source CDS platforms: OpenCDS and OpenInfobutton. These platforms are reference implementations of international EHR standards that are required for EHR certification in the US. We will also obtain software certification from the Open Source EHR Alliance, share the CDS platform and our experiences with other awardees in the ITCR Program, present the CDS platform at national and international cancer and informatics conferences; and engage with relevant stakeholders through a technical expert panel. Any healthcare organization with a certified EHR will be able to use the proposed CDS platform. Therefore, if successful, this proposal can have a significant impact on disseminating individualized cancer screening practices according to the best available evidence. The proposed research addresses the need for individualizing cancer screening according to the risk of an individual. We propose to enable software that scans electronic health records of entire patient populations to automatically detect those at a high risk to develop specific types of cancer according to cancer guidelines.

"National Infrastructure for Standardized and Portable EHR Phenotyping Algorithms PROJECT SUMMARY With the rapidly growing adoption of patient electronic health record systems (EHRs) due to Meaningful Use, and linkage of EHRs to research biorepositories, evaluating the suitability of EHR data for clinical and translational research is becoming ever more important, with ramifications for genomic and observational research, clinical trials, and comparative effectiveness studies. A key component for identifying patient cohorts in the EHR is to define inclusion and exclusion criteria that algorithmically select sets of patients based on stored clinical data. This process is commonly referred to, as “EHR-driven phenotyping” is time-consuming and tedious due to the lack of a widely accepted and standards-based formal information model for defining phenotyping algorithms. To address this overall challenge, the proposed project will design, build and promote an open-access community infrastructure for standards-based development and sharing of phenotyping algorithms, as well as provide tools and resources for investigators, researchers and their informatics support staff to implement and execute the algorithms on native EHR data. PROJECT NARRATIVE The identification of patient cohorts for clinical and genomic research is a costly and time-consuming process. This bottleneck adversely affects public health by delaying research findings, and in some cases by making research costs prohibitively high. To address this issue, leveraging electronic health records (EHRs) for identifying patient cohorts has become an increasingly attractive option. This proposal will investigate and implement standards based approaches for computable phenotype identification from multiple EHRs.",National Infrastructure for Standardized and Portable EHR Phenotyping Algorithms,9381197,R01GM105688,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Benchmarking', 'Benign Prostatic Hypertrophy', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Element', 'Data Quality', 'Data Reporting', 'Development', 'Educational workshop', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Engineering', 'Event', 'Exclusion Criteria', 'Flowcharts', 'Genomics', 'Gold', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Human', 'Informatics', 'Intuition', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Logic', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Needs Assessment', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Precision Medicine Initiative', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Public Health Informatics', 'Rare Diseases', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Risk Factors', 'Running', 'Scientist', 'Services', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Text', 'Time', 'Translational Research', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'University Hospitals', 'authority', 'base', 'biobank', 'clinical phenotype', 'cohort', 'comparative effectiveness', 'cost', 'data modeling', 'database query', 'design', 'endophenotype', 'experience', 'inclusion criteria', 'informatics training', 'information model', 'interoperability', 'knowledge base', 'learning strategy', 'meetings', 'portability', 'precision medicine', 'repository', 'syntax', 'tool', 'usability']",NIGMS,WEILL MEDICAL COLL OF CORNELL UNIV,R01,2017,745771,0.09666024145939643
"Automated Problem and Allergy Lists Enrichment Based on High Accuracy Information Extraction from the Electronic Health Record ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Medical errors are recognized as the cause of numerous deaths, and even if some are difficult to avoid, many are preventable. Computerized physician order-entry systems with decision support have been proposed to reduce this risk of medication errors, but these systems rely on structured and coded information in the electronic health record (EHR). Unfortunately, a substantial proportion of the information available in the EHR is only mentioned in narrative clinical documents. Electronic lists of problems and allergies are available in most EHRs, but they require manual management by their users, to add new problems, modify existing ones, and the removal of the ones that are irrelevant. Consequently, these electronic lists are often incomplete, inaccurate, and out of date. Clinacuity, Inc. proposed a new system to automatically extract structured and coded medical problems and allergies from clinical narrative text in the EHR of patients suffering from cancer, and established its feasibility. To advance this new system from a prototype to an accurate, adaptable, and robust system, integrated into the commercial EHR system used in our implementation and testing site (Huntsman Cancer Institute and University of Utah Hospital, Salt Lake City, Utah), and ready for commercialization efforts, we will work on the following aims: 1) enhance the NLP system performance, scalability, and quality, 2) develop an advanced visualization interface for local adaptation of the NLP system, and 3) integrate the NLP system with a commercial EHR system. A large and varied reference standard for training and testing the information extraction application will also be developed, a reference standard including a random sample of de-identified clinical narratives from patients treated at the Huntsman Cancer Institute and at the University of Utah Hospital (Salt Lake City, Utah), with problems and allergies annotated by domain experts. Commercial application: The system Clinacuity proposes will not only help healthcare providers maintain complete and timely lists of problems and allergies, providing them with an efficient overview of a patient, but also help healthcare organizations attain meaningful use requirements. The proposed system has potential commercial applications in inpatient and outpatient settings, increasing the efficiency of busy healthcare providers by saving time, and aiding healthcare organizations in demonstrating ""meaningful use"" and obtaining Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services incentive payments. Clinacuity will further extend the commercial potential of the system and its output, using modular design principles allowing utilization of each module independently, and enhancing its local adaptability for easier deployment. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Medical errors cause numerous deaths, and even if some are difficult to avoid, many could be prevented. Computerized physician order-entry systems with decision support have been proposed to reduce this risk of medication errors, but these systems rely on structured and coded information such as entries in electronic lists of problems and allergies. Such lists are available in most electronic health records, but they require manual management and are often incomplete, inaccurate, and out of date. On the other hand, clinical text reports contain the majority of the patient information, including problems and allergies.

"Improving Quality by Maintaining Accurate Problem Lists in the EHR (IQ-MAPLE) DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  A complete patient problem list is the cornerstone of the problem-oriented medical record. It serves as a valuable tool for providers assessing a patient's clinical status and succinctly communicates this information between providers. Accurate problem lists drive clinical decision support tools that improve quality, and an accurate problem list has been associated with higher quality care. Accurate problem lists are also critical for establishing accurate phenotypes for research and supporting quality improvement; however, problem lists in electronic health records are routinely incomplete. In this study, we propose to develop and validate problem inference algorithms to identify problems potentially missing from patient problem lists, and to conduct a randomized trial of these algorithms, studying their effects on quality of care. We call our approach IQ-MAPLE. Our project has three specific aims: 1) develop problem inference algorithms for heart, lung, and blood conditions, 2) implement problem inference alerts and optimize the workflow at four sites and 3) conduct a randomized controlled trial of the problem inference alerts, measuring the acceptance rate of alerts, the direct effect on problem list completeness and, critically, downstream impact of the alerts on key clinical quality measures, including both process and outcomes across a range of heart, lung and blood conditions. If successful, IQ-MAPLE will improve problem list accuracy, which has significant downstream implications: More accurate clinical decision support: Most clinical decision support is disease-oriented and, as such, depends on an accurate problem list. When problems are missing, opportunities to provide support to the clinician are missed, and quality suffers. Better quality measurement: Quality measurement today is often inaccurate, as patients are omitted from measures due to incomplete information on their clinical problems. A more accurate problem list would, in turn, lead to more accurate quality measurement. More accurate research: Clinical, translational and even basic science and genomic research increasingly use EHR data, particularly to identify patients with disease phenotypes, generally using problem lists. When problems are missing, the accuracy of research suffers. Better patient care: Secondary benefits aside, the problem list is, fundamentally, a tool for organizing patient care and communicating among providers. A more accurate, problem list supports these goals. The IQ-MAPLE rules, and our best practices for implementing them, will be freely available, ensuring broad dissemination of these benefits. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  An accurate, complete clinical problem list the cornerstone of a problem-oriented medical record, and research shows that accurate problem lists improve healthcare quality; however, problem lists are often incomplete. In this study, we will develop and evaluate an intervention to identify gaps in problem lists for patients with heart, lung, and blood conditions.

"EHR-Based Strategies to Improve Outcomes in Familial Hypercholesterolemia PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is a relatively common genetic disorder characterized by elevated plasma low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and a dramatically increased lifetime risk for premature atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). Available data suggest substantial under treatment of individuals with FH, and it is estimated that <5% of prevalent FH cases in the US are diagnosed and treated. The proposed research will develop electronic health record (EHR)-based strategies to reduce mortality and morbidity from FH. We will develop and validate a phenotyping algorithm for rapid and efficient identification of FH cases thereby enabling EHR-based surveillance of FH. We will deploy the phenotyping algorithm in the population-based setting of Olmsted County, Minnesota, to estimate prevalence and provide hitherto unavailable data on awareness, detection and control of FH. We will develop CDS to help care providers manage FH patients and an FH-specific decision aid to facilitate shared decision making related to lipid-lowering therapy and screening of family members. To accomplish these goals, we will leverage the following resources: a) the electronic phenotyping expertise available in the electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) network; b) the Rochester Epidemiology Project (REP), that links medical records of Olmsted County MN residents thereby capturing nearly all health care delivered to residents of the community; and c) expertise in developing and deploying CDS in the EHR and in creating decision aids for disclosing cardiovascular risk and the benefits of lipid-lowering drugs. Our specific aims are: Aim 1. Develop and validate an electronic phenotyping algorithm to rapidly identify FH cases from the EHR. Aim 2. Conduct an e- epidemiology study to obtain hitherto unknown data regarding prevalence, awareness, detection, control of FH in a population-based setting in the US. Aim 3. a) Develop EHR-based tools to help care providers manage FH and facilitate shared decision making and cascade screening and b) assess outcomes after implementation of CDS and decision aid. The proposed research will enable rapid identification of FH in EHRs, provide hitherto unavailable data on the burden of FH in the community, facilitate EHR-based strategies for early detection, increase awareness of FH among care providers, provide guidance for management of FH at point of care and help both patients and providers make informed decisions about drug therapy and screening of family members. These are critical steps for early detection and treatment of FH to reduce the burden of premature ASCVD due to this condition. PROJECT NARRATIVE Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is a relatively common genetic disorder characterized by high cholesterol levels and increased risk of heart attack or sudden cardiac death. The proposed research will develop electronic health record (EHR)-based strategies to prevent adverse outcomes such as heart attack in FH patients. These include methods to rapidly identify FH patients, estimate prevalence of FH and develop clinical decision support to help care providers manage FH patients.

"Natural Language Question Understanding for Electronic Health Records ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Patient information in the electronic health record (EHR) such as lab results, medications, and past medical history is the basis for physician decisions about patient care. It also helps patients better understand and manage their care. Efficient access to this patient information is thus essential. One of the most intuitive ways of accessing data is by asking natural language questions. A significant amount of work in medical question answering has been conducted, yet little work has been performed in question answering for EHRs. Natural language questions can be represented in logical forms, a standard structured knowledge representation technique. This project proposes to take natural language EHR questions, both for doctors and patients, and automatically convert them to a logical form. The logical forms can then be converted to a structured query such as those used by EHRs. A major obstacle to this approach is the lack of data containing questions annotated with logical forms. This project hypothesizes that a small set of questions can be manually annotated, and then paraphrases can be produced for each annotated question. Since paraphrasing is a simpler task than logical form annotation, crowd-sourcing techniques can be used to collect thousands of question paraphrases. This question paraphrase corpus will then be used to build a semantic grammar capable of recognizing the logical structure of EHR questions. To ensure a robust, generalizable grammar, existing NLP techniques will be used to pre-process questions, simplifying their syntactic structure and abstracting their medical concepts.     In order to develop such a method, the candidate, Dr. Kirk Roberts, requires additional training and mentoring in natural language processing and biomedical informatics. This application for the NIH Pathway to Independence Award (K99/R00) describes a career development plan that will allow Dr. Roberts to achieve the goals of this project as well as transition to a career as an independent researcher. He will be mentored by Dr. Dina Demner-Fushman, a leading medical NLP researcher, and co-mentored by Dr. Clement McDonald, a leading EHR and medical informatics researcher.     The specific aims of the project are: (1) Build a paraphrase collection of EHR questions, where each prototype question will have many unique paraphrases. The paraphrases encompass different lexical and syntactic means of conveying the same logical form. (2) Construct a semantic grammar for EHR questions. The grammar can then be used to convert a natural language question to a logical form. (3) Implement an end- to-end question analyzer that generalizes EHR questions for improved parsing, parses the question into a logical form using the grammar, and converts the logical form into a leading structured EHR query format. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed work aims to significantly improve the ability of both doctors and patients to find information within electronic health records (EHR). By providing an interface to EHRs where users can specify their information needs in the form of a natural language question, the proposed work provides a more intuitive means of finding patient data than is currently available.",Natural Language Question Understanding for Electronic Health Records,9228509,R00LM012104,"['Artificial Intelligence', 'Award', 'Blood Glucose', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Development Plans', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Glucose', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Knowledge', 'Literature', 'Medical', 'Medical History', 'Medical Informatics', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Process', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Semantics', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'TimeLine', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'abstracting', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'career', 'career development', 'crowdsourcing', 'data access', 'database structure', 'design', 'health data', 'illiterate', 'improved', 'information organization', 'lexical', 'natural language', 'open source', 'operation', 'phrases', 'prototype', 'syntax']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR HOUSTON,R00,2016,249000,0.054382557527370624
"Automated Detection of Anomalous Accesses to Electronic Health Records DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Health information technology (HIT) can lower costs, strengthen productivity, and promote safety. To realize such benefits on a large scale, healthcare organizations (HCOs) are adopting electronic health records (EHRs) to provide various capabilities. Yet, as EHRs and the healthcare workforce grow in diversity, so does their complexity. This is a concern because evidence suggests complex HIT can interrupt care delivery, contribute to medical errors, and expose patient data to privacy breaches. Moreover, such events tend to be discovered only after they transpire en masse, leading to negative media coverage, loss of patients' trust, and sanctions. Federal regulations now enable patients to receive accountings of who accessed their medical records during treatment, payment, and operations related activities. Yet, for patients to make sense of such accountings, they need to be provided with explanations regarding the extent to which accesses are normal in the context of routine HCO activities. We believe that relating specific accesses to patterns of healthcare operations can help explain how medical records are utilized. Unfortunately, many of the aforementioned problems manifest because EHR utilization patterns rarely guide the design and refinement of healthcare management practices. Thus, the overarching objective of our research is to develop novel strategies to automatically learn HCO behavior based on EHR usage. The past several years has witnessed a flurry of activity in this field, but it remains in is infancy and has only scratched the surface of care patterns and the types of anomalies that can be detected. Through this project, we propose to develop anomaly detection methods that integrate the semantics of healthcare operations and allow for the detection of workflows over time. This will enable HCOs and patients to audit in a meaningful way. Moreover, we believe the innovation and dissemination of such data mining strategies will enable HCOs to detect anomalous events that indicate system misuse and patients who require special attention, but also effectively audit business practices and discover inefficient workflows. The specific aims of this project are (1) to develop machine learning approaches, based on intrasession utilization patterns, to streamline EHR interface configuration and detect anomalous sessions, (2) to design a data mining framework, based on intersession EHR access patterns, to characterize HCO departmental interactions in patient treatment and detect anomalous events, and (3) to infer patient management pathways to consolidate redundant processes and detect deviations from anticipated workflows. In support of these goals, we will evaluate, compare, and contrast the workflows and anomalies in the EHR systems of two large medical centers. Additionally, we will ensure that our methods are integrated into an open source software system that can assist HCOs to extract, transform, and load (ETL) access data from EHRs, analyze such data for anomalies, and visualize the results in interfaces that enable review by healthcare administrators and patients. In doing so, we will be able to compare and contrast behavior of the workflows and multiple institutions and develop methods that appropriately generalize across EHR systems. As electronic health record systems, and healthcare organizations, grow in diversity, so do their complexity, which can lead to inefficient documentation, management of patients, and expose patient data to privacy breaches. In this research, we will develop technologies, to be disseminated through an open source software suite, to learn patterns associated with healthcare operations, upon which anomaly detection techniques can be based. The specific goals of this project are to 1) model HCO users' intrasession behaviors when interacting with an EHR, 2) learn interdepartmental relations based on the accesses of common patients, and 3) infer patient management pathways based on the sequence of accesses to a patient's record.",Automated Detection of Anomalous Accesses to Electronic Health Records,9143798,R01LM010207,"['Accounting', 'Administrator', 'Admission activity', 'Adopted', 'Architecture', 'Attention', 'Behavior', 'Businesses', 'Caring', 'Case Manager', 'Case Study', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Security', 'Detection', 'Documentation', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Employee', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Entropy', 'Event', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Graph', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Inpatients', 'Institution', 'Interdepartmental Relations', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Errors', 'Medical Records', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Movement', 'Neonatal Intensive Care', 'Neonatology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Patterns of Care', 'Phase', 'Practice Management', 'Primary Health Care', 'Privacy', 'Process', 'Productivity', 'Provider', 'Recording of previous events', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Safety', 'Semantics', 'Surface', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Trust', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'care delivery', 'comparative', 'cost', 'data access', 'data mining', 'design', 'follow-up', 'health information technology', 'infancy', 'innovation', 'novel strategies', 'open source', 'operation', 'organizational structure', 'payment', 'programs', 'software systems', 'ward', 'web portal']",NLM,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2016,341475,0.06955534119596746
"Better Outcomes for Children: Promoting Excellence in Healthcare Genomics to Inform Policy ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In May 2012 Cincinnati Children's (CCHMC) joined eMERGE II with our Boston Children's partner. Since then we have developed algorithms for the electronic health record (EHR), led the Pediatric Workgroup, developed pharmacogenomics, evaluated the preferences of parents and caregivers to advance genomic medicine and assimilated technical advances into our EHR. The eMERGE effort has become the basic fabric of the institutional initiative to incorporate the extraordinary advances of genetics, genomics and the electronic medical record into healthcare. In addition, we bring a comprehensive EHR (EPIC), operating in every venue for healthcare delivery at CCHMC; a deidentified i2b2 data warehouse of 1.2 million patient records; and a Biobank with 150,000 consents that allow return of results to 38,000 patients and guardians who have provided 58,000 DNA samples, all with consent to return results and i2b2 EHR records. Now, we present our plan to join the eMERGE III network with 17 proposed initiatives. Our eMERGE effort is designed to move an entire institution with our eMERGE III partners into a genomic-EHR era of healthcare implementation and discovery. Our effort is divided into Genomics , Aim 1, where we hope to help the eMERGE III Steering Committee identify the 100 or so genes for the eMERGE III Targeted Gene Panel (eTGP), select our 2,000 CCHMC patients to be sequenced (of the 38,000 in our Biobank), review 4,000 targeted gene panels from clinical care at CCHMC for somatic mosaicism and reinterpretation, and further develop and disseminate a software workflow suite for sequence analysis (CASSI). For Phenotypes, Aim 2, we will extend our work generating EHR phenotype algorithms using heuristic and machine learning methods with a comprehensive set of EHR features derived from data driven algorithms to describe phenotypic pleiotropy of eTGP gene variants. We will develop working collaborations with Patients Care Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI) and the Million Veterans Program by applying eMERGE developed EHR algorithms to these large electronic data warehouses. For Implementation and Evaluation, Aim 3, we will develop tools to evaluate adolescent return of results preferences, examine the ethical and legal obligations and potential to reanalyze results, analyze the cost of tacrolimus management of kidney transplant with and without CYP3A5 testing, develop clinical decision support for phenotyping, test ordering, and returning eTGP results. Our success in these eMERGE III studies will be enhanced by the ongoing institutional investments made in the CCHMC BioBank, the comprehensive EHR (EPIC), and the i2b2 deidentified medical record data warehouse, and hundreds of Faculty and senior staff who make genomics or informatics an active focus of their research. We present a comprehensive program addressing all of the salient elements presented in the RFP for eMERGE III (HG-14-025) to enhance our collaborative productivity within the eMERGE Network in ways that ultimately improve our healthcare systems through discovery, implementation, and advanced applications of genomics and informatics.

"Childhood obesity surveillance using electronic health records data ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Childhood obesity is associated with high financial cost and increased morbidity and mortality in adulthood. Health care spending due to obesity is estimated to be as high as \$210 billion annually, or 21\% of total national spending. A childhood obesity surveillance system will discern disparities, detect aberrant signals, design targeted interventions, and track change over time. In addition to national public health surveillance systems, local data are increasingly necessary to reflect regional trends. Current systems in Wisconsin are subject to (1) bias estimation of obesity rates, (2) limited data in school-aged children ages 5-10 years, (3) insufficient power to estimate disparities in local subgroups, and (4) limited ability to track local changes over time. Therefore, the impact of investments and collective efforts in Wisconsin childhood obesity prevention has been difficult to measure. This, in turn, demands approaches that overcome and transcend the posited limitations. Since large electronic health records (EHRs) systems have been developed to routinely collect information over time, there has been a paradigm shift and accelerated improvements in the use of EHR data for the purpose of population health promotion and tracking of progress. The University of Wisconsin Population Health Information Exchange (PHINEX) database contains de- identified EHR data from a multicenter healthcare system located primarily in south central Wisconsin. In partnership with The Wisconsin Obesity Prevention Initiative, we aim to create an EHR model for a childhood obesity prevention surveillance system. We propose to develop innovative statistical machine learning methods using the platform of PHINEX for childhood obesity prevention purposes. This enhance and extend surveillance activities of childhood obesity conditions, and increase the effectiveness of evidence-based interventions aimed at changing policies, systems, and environments associated with childhood obesity. We plan to address the following aims: (1) robust estimation of the spatiotemporal prevalence at area level, (2) hot spot detection on areas with aberrant obesity incidence, and (3) prediction for childhood weight gain phenotypes. The developed and implemented surveillance system can benefit future planning, legislation and implementation in other states and/or surveillance of other acute and chronic health conditions.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Childhood obesity has emerged as a leading health concern in the 21st century. Current data sources from which childhood obesity estimates are derived in most systems are primarily cross-sectional, are from small sample sizes, and/or have limited generalizability. Large electronic health records (EHRs) systems have been developed to routinely collect information over time, which provide unprecedented opportunities for individual and population health surveillance. We propose to develop innovative statistical machine learning methods to increase the use of large EHR data for childhood obesity prevention purposes, extending the scope of public health surveillance.            ",Childhood obesity surveillance using electronic health records data,9018958,R21HD086754,"['Accounting', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Affordable Care Act', 'Age', 'Area', 'Biometry', 'Caring', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Chronic', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Collaborations', 'Comorbidity', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'County', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Evaluation', 'Evidence based intervention', 'Family Practice', 'Financial cost', 'Future', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Personnel', 'Health Promotion', 'Health Sciences', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hot Spot', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Investments', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Obesity', 'Overweight', 'Phenotype', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Population Surveillance', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention strategy', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reporting', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sample Size', 'School-Age Population', 'Signal Transduction', 'Smiling', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Statutes and Laws', 'Subgroup', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Transcend', 'Uncertainty', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Weight Gain', 'Wisconsin', 'Work', 'base', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'data structure', 'design', 'evidence base', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'intervention program', 'learning strategy', 'mortality', 'novel', 'obesity in children', 'obesity prevention', 'population based', 'population health', 'public health intervention', 'public health relevance', 'spatiotemporal', 'statistics', 'success', 'tool', 'trend', 'user friendly software']",NICHD,FRED HUTCHINSON CANCER RESEARCH CENTER,R21,2016,234419,0.030441159880124555
"Understanding and predicting cardiac events in HD using real-time EHRs DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of this K25 proposal is to provide Dr. Benjamin Goldstein Ph.D., M.P.H., with the necessary protected time and additional training to develop as an independent, clinical biostatistician. This proposal has two key components: (1) an innovative research plan and (2) a comprehensive training plan. It is well recognized that patients undergoing hemodialysis (HD) are at increased risk of cardiac related events which often prove fatal. While substantive research has identified risk factors for these events, little work has been performed on forecasting their occurrence. The proposed research proposes to use existing electronic health record (EHR) data available through a collaborating dialysis center, DaVita Inc, to derive such a prediction model. EHRs contain detailed information on both a patient's health history (e.g. comorbidities, medications) as well as their evolving health statu (i.e. changes in health). A particularly unique aspect of the DaVita EHR system is the availability of real-time measures of health (e.g. blood pressure, pulse) available over the course of an HD session. Through our ongoing collaboration we will have data on 10,000s of individuals each with 100s of HD sessions, presenting the opportunity to analyze millions of dialysis sessions. Within this wealth of data two particular questions will be addressed: (1) How does a patient's hemodynamics vary over the course of and across HD sessions? (2) Can we derive a predictor for the near term onset of a cardiac event? To answer question 1, sophisticated statistical methodology, referred to as functional data analysis (FDA), will be utilized. Patterns of hemodynamic measures will be compared during and across HD sessions with key features extracted. For question 2, machine learning methodology will be used to derive a prediction model for the onset of cardiac events. The final aim will be to assess the feasibility of applying such models within a clinical environment. As a Ph.D. biostatistician, Dr. Goldstein has many of the methodological and computational skills necessary to perform the proposed analyses. The proposed methods, while established, also have ample room for statistical investigation and will provide the basis for methodological research. He will be mentored by Dr. Bradley Efron, professor in the Stanford Department of Statistics, and a world recognized expert in statistical methodology. Serving as a consultant will be Drs. Trevor Hastie and John Ioannidis, fellow members of the department of statistics and experts in FDA and prediction evaluation respectively. The focus of Dr. Goldstein's training will be on developing his clinical expertise. This will be performed through a combination of didactic courses, one-on- one tutorials and clinical exposure. Dr. Wolfgang Winkelmayer, a clinical nephrologist and close collaborator of Dr. Goldstein, will supervise Dr. Goldstein's clinical knowledge development. He will be joined by Dr. Mark Hlatky, a research cardiologist, who will also provide mentorship with regards to the cardiac substance of the project. Additional consultants across the department of medicine will be used as needed. The proposed project will have a tremendous impact on Dr. Goldstein's career prospects. At the end of the 5 year period he will have begun the process of developing a research program in the analysis of EHR data. There will be ample avenues to pursue future studies, through the analysis of other predictor variables (e.g. biomarkers, psycho-social factors), outcomes (e.g. hospitalization, cost) and most importantly, implementation of the prediction models in the clinic. The clinical training period will provide him with the necessary background to succeed as a clinically-oriented biostatistician and develop as a leader in the field. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Electronic health records have become increasingly common in clinical settings but to this point have been underutilized for research purposes. This project will analyze real-time EHR data that are generated during a dialysis session. The focus will be on understanding patients' hemodynamic changes over the course of a three hour dialysis session and using that information to derive a prediction model for severe cardiac events.",Understanding and predicting cardiac events in HD using real-time EHRs,9133363,K25DK097279,"['Accounting', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Advertising', 'Algorithms', 'Assessment tool', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Pressure', 'Breast Cancer Risk Assessment Tool', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Cluster randomized trial', 'Collaborations', 'Comorbidity', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Dialysis procedure', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Economics', 'Education', 'Electronic Health Record', 'End stage renal failure', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Heart Arrest', 'Hemodialysis', 'Hospitalization', 'Hour', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Investigation', 'Kidney', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Length', 'Machine Learning', 'Master of Public Health', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mind', 'Modeling', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Play', 'Preventive measure', 'Process', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Specific qualifier value', 'System', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'career', 'clinical care', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'demographics', 'disorder risk', 'health information technology', 'hemodynamics', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'member', 'predictive modeling', 'professor', 'programs', 'skills', 'social', 'statistics', 'tool']",NIDDK,DUKE UNIVERSITY,K25,2016,157765,0.02163537363104761
"Use Frailty Status to Predict Postoperative Outcomes in Elderly Patient Frailty is increasingly recognized as a leading indicator of poor health outcomes, even death, as well as a barometer of how well patients respond to treatment. To truly provide patient-centered care, providers should be aware of each patient's frailty status and incorporate it into clinical decision making. Providers can now offer a number of invasive and aggressive procedures for cardiovascular disease, which involve risk, and can be painful. The treatment intensity need to match the expected patient outcome, yet providers do not have a reliable method to estimate prognosis for frail patients. In the study proposed here, we will use a novel approach that leverages the electronic health record (EHR) in identifying patient frailty status, with the goal of supporting retrospective clinical studies and prospective clinical decision making. Our preliminary studies have demonstrated the availability of frailty-related findings in EHR, the feasibility of extracting frailty findings, and the feasibility of using EHR-extracted frailty for outcome prediction. The specific aims of the project are to 1) Create a frailty ontology building on existing functional status and quality of life measurements; 2) Develop ontology guided, natural language processing (NLP) methods for extracting frailty descriptions and measurements; 3) Develop a model to aggregate NLP-extracted frailty findings to generate a patient-level frailty score; 4) Examine the all-cause mortality and all-cause hospital readmission one year after major cardiac procedures in heart failure patients with different frailty scores and assess the impact of this information on surgical decision making. Frailty is an important, but often overlooked, determinant of health outcomes in older adults. Providers can now offer invasive and aggressive treatments for various conditions, but these interventions involve risk and careful patient selection that balances risk and benefit is imperative. We will develop automated methods to extract frailty information from clinical records and generate an aggregated frailty score, which will enable retrospective analyses of EHR data for risk prediction and support prospective clinical decisional making.",Use Frailty Status to Predict Postoperative Outcomes in Elderly Patient,9354376,R56AG052536,"['Address', 'Affect', 'American', 'Atrial Fibrillation', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Surgery procedures', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Caregivers', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collection', 'Comorbidity', 'Critical Care', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Devices', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Documentation', 'Elderly', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Equilibrium', 'Fatigue', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heart failure', 'Hospitalization', 'Implantable Defibrillators', 'Informatics', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Life', 'Life Expectancy', 'Malnutrition', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Ontology', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Selection', 'Patient-Centered Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Perioperative', 'Population', 'Postoperative Period', 'Procedures', 'Provider', 'Quality of life', 'Records', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Technology', 'Veterans', 'base', 'clinical decision-making', 'cohort', 'comparative effectiveness', 'exercise capacity', 'frailty', 'functional status', 'hospital readmission', 'indexing', 'individualized medicine', 'interest', 'mortality', 'novel strategies', 'older patient', 'outcome forecast', 'outcome prediction', 'patient population', 'predictive modeling', 'prospective', 'treatment choice', 'treatment planning', 'trend']",NIA,GEORGE WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R56,2016,616197,0.02797727644938554
"Patient Medical History Representation, Extraction, and Inference from EHR Data DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The significance of developing tools for automatically harvesting temporal constraints of clinical events from Electronic Health Records (EHR) cannot be overestimated. Efficient analysis of the temporal aspects in EHR data could boost an array of clinical and translational research such as disease progression studies, decision support systems, and personalized medicine.     One big challenge we are facing is to automatically untangle and linearize the temporal constraints of clinical events embedded in highly diverse large-scale EHR data. Barriers to temporal data modeling, normalization, extraction, and reasoning have precluded the efficient use of EHR data sources for event history evaluation and trending analysis: (1) The current federally-supported EHR data normalization tools do not focus on the time aspect of unstructured data yet; (2) Existing time models focus only on structured data with absolute time, lack of supporting reasoning systems, or only offer application-specific partial solutions which cannot be adopted by the complex EHR data; (3) Current temporal information extraction approaches are either difficult to be adopted to EHR data, not scalable, or only offers application-specific partial solution.     This proposed project fills in the current gaps among ontologies, Natural Language Processing (NLP), and EHR-based clinical research for temporal data representation, normalization, extractions, and reasoning. We propose to develop novel approaches for automatic temporal data representation, normalization and reasoning for large, diverse, and heterogeneous EHR data and prepare the integrated data for further analysis. We will build new reasoning and extraction capacities on our TIMER (Temporal Information Modeling, Extracting, and Reasoning) framework to provide an end-to-end, open-source, standard-conforming software package. TIMER will be built on strong prior work by our team. We will develop new features in our CNTRO (Clinical Narrative Temporal Relation Ontology) for semantically defining the time domain and representing temporal data in complex EHR data. On top of the new developed CNTRO semantics, we will implement temporal relation reasoning capacities to automatically normalize temporal expressions, compute and infer temporal relations, and resolve ambiguities. We will leverage existing NLP tools and work on top of these tools to develop new extraction approaches to fill in the current gaps between NLP approaches and ontology-based reasoning approaches. We will adapt the SHARPn EHR data normalization pipeline and cTAKES for extracting and normalizing clinical event mentions from clinical narratives. We will explore an innovative approach for temporal relation extraction and event coreference, and make it work with the TIMER framework. We will evaluate the system using Diabetes Mellitus (DM) and colorectal cancer (CRC) patient cohorts from two insititutions. Each component will be tested separately first followed by an evaluation of the whole framework. Results such as precision, recall, and f-measure will be reported. Project Narrative The significance of developing capabilities for automatically harvesting temporal constraints for clinical events from Electronic Health Records (EHR) cannot be overestimated. A substantial portion of the information in the EHR is historical in nature. Patient medical history can be long, especially in complex patients. The proposed work, by offering an end-to-end open-source framework for automatically extracting, normalizing, and reasoning clinically-important time-relevant information from large-scale EHR data, can boost an array of clinical and translational research such as disease progression studies, decision support systems, and personalized medicine; as well as facilitate clinical practice for early disease detection, post-treatment care, and patient-clinician communication.","Patient Medical History Representation, Extraction, and Inference from EHR Data",9115724,R01LM011829,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Aftercare', 'Archives', 'Automated Annotation', 'Big Data', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Reporting', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Detection', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Harvest', 'Human', 'Institutes', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medical History', 'Medical Records', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Ontology', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Recording of previous events', 'Registries', 'Reporting', 'Resolution', 'Semantics', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translational Research', 'Work', 'application programming interface', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'colon cancer patients', 'data modeling', 'data structure', 'information model', 'innovation', 'novel strategies', 'open source', 'personalized medicine', 'tool', 'trend analysis']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR HOUSTON,R01,2016,335217,0.09895186513416336
"Clinical Text Automatic De-Identification to Support Large Scale Data Reuse and Sharing ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The adoption of Electronic Health Record (EHR) systems is growing at a fast pace in the U.S., and this growth results in very large quantities of patient clinical data becoming available in electronic format, with tremendous potentials, but also equally growing concern for patient confidentiality breaches. Secondary use of clinical data is essential to fulfill the potentials for high quality healthcare, improved healthcare management, and effective clinical research. NIH expects that larger research projects share their research data in a way that protects the confidentiality of the research subjects. De-identification of patient data has been proposed as a solution to both facilitate secondary uses of clinical data, and protect patient data confidentiality. The majority of clinical data found in the EHR is represented as narrative text clinical notes, and de-identification of clinical text is a tedious ad costly manual endeavor. Automated approaches based on Natural Language Processing have been implemented and evaluated, allowing for much faster de- identification than manual approaches. Clinacuity, Inc. proposes to develop a new system to automatically de-identify clinical notes found in the EHR, to then improve the availability of clinical text for secondary uses, as well as ameliorate the protection of patient data confidentiality. To establish the merit and feasibility of such a system, we will work on the following objectives: 1) create a reference standard for training and testing the text de-identification application, a reference standard that will include a random sample of clinical narratives with protected health information annotated by domain experts; 2) develop a prototype to automatically de-identify clinical text in near real-time, a prototype that will implement a novel stepwise hybrid approach to maximize sensitivity first (our priority for de-identification), and then filter out false positives to enhance positive predictive value, and also replace PHI with realistic substitutes for improved protection; and 3) test the prototype with the aforementioned reference standard, using a cross-validation approach for training and testing, and also train and test the prototype with a reference standard from another healthcare organization. Commercial application: To strengthen patient information confidentiality protection, the HITECH Act heightened financial penalties incurred for breaches of PHI, even introducing criminal penalties. These new severe consequences for violation of patient information confidentiality render protection requirements even more obvious, and automatic high-accuracy clinical text de-identification, as offered by the system Clinacuity proposes, will strongly help healthcare and clinical research organizations avoid such consequences. This system has potential commercial applications in clinical research and in healthcare settings. It will improve access to richer, more detailed, and more accurate clinical data (in clinical text) for clinical researchers. It will also ease research data sharing, and help healthcare organizations protect patient data confidentiality.

"Advancing Cancer Pharmacoepidemiology Research Through EHRs and Informatics ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of cancer pharmacoepidemiology is to identify adverse and/or long-term effects of chemotherapeutic agents and determine the impact of drugs on cancer risk, prevention, and response to treatments. Pharmacoepidemiology studies exert strong influence on defining optimal treatments and accelerating translational research. Therefore, it is imperative for these to be done efficiently and leveraging real-world patient data such as electronic health records (EHR). Massive clinical data from EHRs are being tapped into for research in disease-gene associations, comparative effectiveness and clinical outcomes. There is however paucity in pharmacoepidemiological studies using comprehensive EHR data due to the inherent challenges that exist for data abstraction, handling and analysis. The hurdles include heterogeneity of reports, embedding of detailed clinical information in narrative text, differing EHR platforms across different sites and missing data to name a few. In this study, we propose to integrate and extend preexisting tools to build an informatics infrastructure for EHR data extraction, interpretation, management and analysis to advance cancer pharmacoepidemiology research. We will leverage existing tools of natural language processing (NLP), standardized ontologies and clinical data management systems to extract and manipulate EHR data for cancer pharmacoepidemiological research. To achieve our goal we propose four specific aims. In aim 1, we intend to develop a high-performance, user- centric information extraction framework with advanced features such as active learning (to reduce annotation cost), domain adaptation (to transfer data across multiple sites) and user-friendly interfaces (for non-technical end users). In aim 2, we plan to improve data harmonization across differing platforms, develop components for seamless data export as well as expand methodologies to address impediments inherent to EHR-based data (such as the missing data problem). In aim 3, we will conduct demonstration projects of cancer pharmacoepidemiology including pharmacovigilance and pharmacogenomics of chemotherapeutic agents to evaluate, refine and validate the broad uses of our tools. Finally in aim 4, we propose to disseminate the methods and tools developed in this project to the cancer research and pharmacoepidemiology communities.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In this project, we propose to integrate and extend previously developed tools to build an informatics infrastructure for electronic health records (EHR) data extraction, interpretation, management, and analysis, to advance cancer pharmacoepidemiology research. Such methods can efficiently integrate and standardize cancer pharmacoepidemiology specific information from EHRs across different sites, thus advancing research in this field.            ",Advancing Cancer Pharmacoepidemiology Research Through EHRs and Informatics,9094161,U24CA194215,"['Active Learning', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Advanced Malignant Neoplasm', 'Algorithms', 'American Association of Cancer Research', 'American Society of Clinical Oncology', 'Award', 'Benefits and Risks', 'CCL4 gene', 'Cancer Patient', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Clinical and Translational Science Awards', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Data Aggregation', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Documentation', 'Drug Exposure', 'Drug usage', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ethics', 'Face', 'Funding', 'Generic Drugs', 'Genes', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health Policy', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hybrids', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Letters', 'Long-Term Effects', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medex', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Names', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Observational Study', 'Ontology', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacoepidemiology', 'Pharmacogenomics', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Preventive', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recurrence', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Selection Bias', 'Site', 'Smoking Status', 'Standardization', 'System', 'Text', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Translational Research', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vision', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'cancer risk', 'cancer type', 'chemotherapeutic agent', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'comparative effectiveness', 'cost', 'data management', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'informatics infrastructure', 'interest', 'novel', 'open source', 'public health relevance', 'rapid growth', 'success', 'tool', 'treatment response', 'user-friendly']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR HOUSTON,U24,2016,652772,0.06940470421842232
"5/6 COMpAAAS U24: Resource in Informatics and Biostatistics (RIB) The overall aim of the NIAAA-funded Consortium to improve OutcoMes in hiv/Aids, Alcohol, Aging, & multi- Substance use (COMpAAAS) is to build and disseminate the evidence needed to optimize care for HIV+ experiencing medical harm from alcohol and related substance use, through coordinated, integrated, and externally validated observational, operations research modeling, and intervention studies. Combining and integrating the complimentary expertise of informatics, biostatistics and epidemiology, we propose a U24 Resource for Informatics and Biostatistics (RIB) to support and inform the other COMpAAAS components. This resource will address the complex challenges required to maximize power and minimize bias in analyses addressing consortium-wide questions. Advanced informatics methods supported include natural language processing (NLP), ontologies, database and clinical decision support, and application of vital data management tools for secure data collection, storage, annotation, retrieval, and integration. Advanced epidemiological and statistical methods include time-updated exposure techniques, multiple imputation, propensity score techniques, measurement error correction, and competing risks regression. Routine, but essential, statistical methods include Cox proportional hazards, logistic and linear regression, goodness of fit diagnostics, and agreement/accuracy metrics (kappa, sensitivity, specificity, etc.). The RIB will further leverage the observational and interventional studies, simulation models, and well-coordinated network of cores and workgroups of COMpAAAS with advanced informatics and biostatistical techniques tailored to the particular challenges of large scale, longitudinal data from multiple sources including electronic health records (EHR), clinical interventions, patient self-report, and tissue repositories. Our specific aims are to provide 1) statistical and 2) informatics expertise for COMpAAAS to maximize scientific impact. To accomplish this, we will enhance the design, recruitment, and follow-up of intervention studies, support appropriate design and execution of data analyses and cross cohort collaborations, provide advanced statistical methods plus estimates of alcohol patterns for OR modeling and identify sexual/gender minority populations (CHAMP) from VACS survey data. In addition we will enhance the Consortium Web-Based Laboratory (WBL Portal) informatics infrastructure to support ongoing research design, data collection and management, development and testing of interventions such as clinical decision support and eHealth tools and enhance support for the analysis of textual data. The Resource for Informatics and Biostatistics (RIB) will extend and enhance the research capacities and productivity among investigators at the NIAAA-funded Consortium to improve OutcoMes in hiv/AIDS, Alcohol, Aging, and multi-Substance use (COMpAAAS).

"Integrating EHR and Genomics to Predict Multiple Sclerosis Drug Response PROJECT SUMMARY The growing expansion of the approved multiple sclerosis (MS) disease-modifying treatments (DMTs) and the variable responses to MS treatment have created an unmet medical need to provide individually tailored therapy. Efforts to bring precision medicine to provide individualized MS treatment selection have been impeded by our limited understanding of the factors that determine treatment response. While genomics hold the promise for closing this knowledge gap, the insufficient number of patients with detailed treatment response data and the modest effect size of genetic variants that influence treatment responses are the main limiting factors in pharmacogenomics studies. As electronic health records (EHR) become widely adopted and increasingly standardized and as we implement sophisticated computational and statistical methods to harness the EHR data, EHR systems can become cost-effective platforms to perform large-scale treatment response studies in real-life settings. Our team with a history of productive collaborations and diverse expertise (led by PI Dr. Xia) previously developed robust algorithms to identify 5,495 MS patients from the Partners HealthCare EHR systems and then model MS disease activity in these patients using EHR data. The Partners EHR system contains longitudinal clinical information on thousands of MS patients from two large academic medical centers and is linked to a well-characterized MS patient research registry and biobanks with existing genomics data. For the proposed study, we will test the hypothesis that meaningful phenotypes of MS disease activity can be extracted from EHR data to inform treatment response, and that additional common genetic variants exist in the population and can predict therapeutic response in MS when combined with clinical features derived from EHR data. The proposed study has three aims with the overall goal to produce a computational and analytic approach capable of identifying MS disease activity in relation to treatment history using EHR data and integrate with genomics profile to develop a predictive model of therapeutic response to commonly prescribed DMTs in this cohort of 5,495 MS patients, including injectable (interferon-β, glatiramer acetate) and oral (fingolimod, dimethyl fumarate) options. Specifically, we will (1) leverage narrative electronic health records data (e.g., clinical notes, radiology reports) and natural language processing (NLP) to ascertain individualized response to DMTs (n=600 for each DMT); (2) Identify clinical features from electronic health record data (e.g., diagnoses, exposures) that predict response to DMTs using a systematic phenome-wide approach; (3) Develop and test a comprehensive predictive model of individualized response to DMTs that incorporates clinical and genetic predictors. This research has the potential impact to be transformative by contributing to a major knowledge gap regarding the factors that influence treatment response and bringing precision medicine closer to individualized MS treatment selection. PROJECT NARRATIVE AND PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic neurological condition that affects over 400,000 individuals in the United States and creates a high socioeconomic burden as a leading cause of neurological disability in young adults. Because not all patients respond the same way to a specific medication, physicians and MS patients often lose precious time searching for effective treatment with serially testing of costly medications. An individually tailored treatment can ensure early start of effective medication that can prevent relapse and progression of disability. Ultimately, this project will help gain insights into the factors that determine treatment response and enable physicians to match an individual MS patient's clinical and genomic profile with uniquely tailored therapy to maximize effectiveness, delay disease progression and reduce overall cost.",Integrating EHR and Genomics to Predict Multiple Sclerosis Drug Response,9158403,R01NS098023,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Adopted', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Biology', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Computing Methodologies', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Fumarates', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Injectable', 'Interferon-beta', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Link', 'Medical', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neurologic', 'Neurologist', 'Oral', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacogenomics', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prospective Studies', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Recording of previous events', 'Registries', 'Relapse', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Statistical Methods', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'TimeLine', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States', 'Variant', 'biobank', 'clinical predictors', 'cohort', 'copolymer 1', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'disability', 'effective therapy', 'experience', 'genetic predictors', 'genetic variant', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'genomic profiles', 'individualized medicine', 'insight', 'multiple sclerosis patient', 'multiple sclerosis treatment', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'phenome', 'portability', 'precision medicine', 'predicting response', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'socioeconomics', 'treatment group', 'treatment response', 'young adult']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2016,370421,0.07686752110648665
"Temporal relation discovery for clinical text ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         The overarching long-term vision of our research is to create novel technologies for processing clinical free text. We will build upon the previous work of our ongoing project ""Temporal relation discovery for clinical text"" (R01LM010090) dubbed Temporal Histories of Your Medical Events (THYME; thyme.healthnlp.org) which has been focusing on methodology for event, temporal expressions and temporal relations discovery from the clinical text residing in the Electronic Health Records (EHR). We developed a comprehensive approach to temporality in the clinical text and innovated in computable temporal representations, methods for temporal relation discovery and their evaluation, rendering temporality to end users - resulting in over 35+ papers and presentations. Our dissemination is international and far-reaching as the best performing methods are released open source as part of the Apache Clinical Text Analysis and Knowledge Extraction System (ctakes.apache.org). The methods we developed are now being used in such nation-wide initiatives as the Electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE), Pharmacogenomics Network (PGRN), Informatics for Integrating the Biology and the Bedside (i2b2), Patient Centered Outcomes Research Institute and National Cancer Institute's Informatics Technology for Cancer Research (ITCR). Through our participation in organizing major international bakeoffs - CLEF/ShARe 2014, SemEval 2014 Analysis of Clinical Text Task 7, SemEval 2015 Analysis of Clinical Text Task 14, SemEval 2015 Clinical TempEval Task 6 - we further disseminated the THYME resources and challenged the international research community to explore new solutions to the unsolved temporality task. Through all these activities it became clear that computational approaches to temporality still present great challenges and usability of the output is still limited. Therefore, we propose to further innovate on methodologies and end user experience.             Specific Aim 1: Extract enhanced representations and novel features to support deriving timeline information.     Specific Aim 2: Develop methods to amalgamate individual patient episode timelines into an aggregate patient-level timeline.     Specific Aim 3: Mine the EHR - the unstructured clinical text and the structured codified information - for full patient-level temporality.     Specific Aim 4: Develop a comprehensive temporal visualization tool     Specific Aim 5: Develop methodology for and perform extrinsic evaluation on specific use case.     Specific Aim 6: (1) Evaluate state-of-the-art of temporal relations through organizing international challenges under the auspices of SemEval, (2) Disseminate the results through publications, presentations, and open source code in Apache cTAKES. Functional testing. Project Narrative Temporal relations are of prime importance in biomedicine as they are intrinsically linked to diseases, signs and symptoms, and treatments. Understanding the timeline of clinically relevant events is key to the next generation of translational research where the importance of generalizing over large amounts of data holds the promise of deciphering biomedical puzzles.

"SCH: Enhancing Nurse Decision-Making via Augmented Communication Tools (ACTs)  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Smart algorithms that effectively analyze patient care data can enhance clinical communication to save lives. In 2000, the Institute of Medicine estimated 98,000 preventable patient deaths occur annually in US hospitals due to miscommunication [1]. Electronic health records (EHRs) were expected to facilitate accurate communication within the care team and provide data to enable automated clinical decision support systems. Unfortunately, miscommunication remains a significant cause of patient deaths [2]. Providers are now required to demonstrate meaningful use of EHR systems to improve quality of care and patient outcomes. Despite this, providers continue to report that EHR systems are cumbersome and interfere with care-team communication. Information entered into an EHR is rarely used by nurses due to the time and difficulty involved in its retrieval. As a result, nurses continue to verbally convey critical patient care information to the next nurse during shift changes. Verbal report or hand-off, where critical patient information is exchanged in only minutes, is inefficient. Worse, it is highly susceptible to communication errors. Broader Impacts: Research: 1) Increase patient safety; 2) Provide preliminary data to expand this work to include physician-physician and physician-RN communication and decision-making in the EHR; 3) Share our discoveries to inform other industries who may also benefit from this technology. Education: 1) Contribute to curriculum enhancements whereby RN students learn strategies to recognize and effectively communicate CEs; 2) As part of curriculum enhancements, include healthcare applications for computer and information science students; 3) Disseminate findings via academic publications, professional meetings, a project website and social media. Mentoring: 1) Mentor budding scientists in the roles of research assistants (RAs) and post doctoral fellows studying nursing and computer science to forge collaborative interdisciplinary relationships for ongoing research; 2) Interest and recruit underrepresented students in STEM and careers in healthcare. RELEVANCE (See instructions): The electronic health record (EHR) has been thought to be a tool to decrease patient deaths related to miscommunication. However, the current EHR falls short of this goal.

"Data-Mining Clinical Decision Support from Electronic Health Records ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)    Data-Mining Clinical Decision Support from Electronic Health Records Public Health Motivation: National healthcare quality is compromised by undesirable variability, reflected in different locales having anywhere from 20-80% compliance with evidence-based guidelines. Much of this is due to uncertainty, with half of clinical practice guidelines lacking adequate evidence to confirm their efficacy. This is unsurprising when clinical trials cost >$15 million to answer individual clinical questions. The result is medical practice routinely driven by individual opinio and anecdotal experience. While Big Data has revolutionized how society processes internet scale information, the status quo in clinical decision making remains the manual interpretation of literature and isolated decision aids. The adoption of electronic health records (EHR) creates a new opportunity to answer a ""grand challenge in clinical decision support (CDS)."" In a learning health system, we could automatically adapt knowledge from the collective expertise embedded in the EHR practices of real clinicians and close the loop by disseminating that knowledge back as executable decision support. Candidate Goals and Objectives: The unifying goal of this BD2K K01 proposal is the mentored career development of Jonathan H. Chen, MD, PhD. This proposal will accelerate his transition into an independent physician scientist, towards his long-term goals to produce Big Data technologies that answer such grand challenges in clinical decision support. His near-term objective is developing methods to translate EHR data into useful knowledge in the form of patient- specific, point-of-care clinical order recommendations for acute medical hospitalizations. His doctoral background in computer science gives him the technical capability to achieve these objectives, while his medical training will ensure clinically meaningful results. His preliminary work to build an order recommender, analogous to commercial product recommenders, demonstrates the proposal's overall feasibility. Institutional Environment and Career Development: The research facilities and training opportunities at Stanford University provide the ideal environment to achieve these objectives, with established and growing Centers for Biomedical Informatics Research, the Biomedical Data Science Initiative, and the first Clinical Informatics Fellowship accredited in the nation. Prof. Russ Altman, Director of the Biomedical Informatics Training Program, will lead a collaborative team of mentors with expertise in clinical decision support (Mary Goldstein), implementation science (Steven Asch), data-mining electronic health records (Nigam Shah), statistical learning algorithms (Lester Mackey), and healthcare statistics (Michael Baiocchi). Combined with respective didactic training, this mentorship will enable Dr. Chen to achieve his objectives through a series of research aims. Research Aims: The overriding hypothesis of the proposal is that clinical knowledge reflected in clinical order patterns from historical EHR data can improve medical decision making when adapted into functional clinical decision support. The specific aims each address components of this concept, as they seek to: (1) Develop the algorithms to learn clinical order patterns from historical EHR data, building on a preliminary recommender system; (2) Assess how underlying clinician proficiency affects the quality of those learned clinical order patterns through observational data inference against external standards; and (3) Determine the impact of automatically learned clinical decision support (CDS) on (simulated) clinical workflows through a randomized controlled crossover trial of human-computer interfaces with real clinicians. Expected Results and General Significance: By the completion of the proposed work, Dr. Chen will answer the grand challenge in clinical decision support (CDS) by automating much of the CDS production process, and have direct translational impact with a prototype system. This will advance the field with new paradigms of generating and disseminating clinical knowledge, which can then improve the consistency and quality of healthcare delivery. Additional benefits will include methods to identify and monitor areas of high practice variability for targeted optimization and improve predictive models that inform precision medicine. With this applied research experience and career development, Dr. Chen can compete for R01 funding and become an independent physician scientist developing Big Data approaches to solve national healthcare problems in clinical decision making. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    National healthcare quality is compromised by undesirable practice variability and medical uncertainty, with most medical practice routinely driven by individual opinions and anecdotal experience. With methods analogous to commercial product recommender systems, the proposed project will automatically learn patterns in raw clinical transaction data to capture the undocumented knowledge of real-world clinicians, and close the loop in a learning health system by disseminating that knowledge back as clinical decision support to improve patient care.",Data-Mining Clinical Decision Support from Electronic Health Records,9147612,K01ES026837,"['Achievement', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Admission activity', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Applied Research', 'Area', 'Back', 'Big Data', 'Big Data to Knowledge', 'Biomedical Research', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Clinical Practice Guideline', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cross-Over Trials', 'Crowding', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Decision Aid', 'Decision Making', 'Diagnosis', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Exhibits', 'Failure', 'Fellowship', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'Internet', 'Investments', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Locales', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Medical', 'Medical Residency', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Motivation', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Process', 'Production', 'Public Health', 'Quality of Care', 'Randomized', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Research Training', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Services', 'Societies', 'Source', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Translating', 'Uncertainty', 'Universities', 'User-Computer Interface', 'Validation', 'Weight', 'Work', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'career development', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical practice', 'computer science', 'cost', 'data mining', 'design', 'evidence based guidelines', 'experience', 'health care delivery', 'health care quality', 'implementation science', 'improved', 'informatics training', 'point of care', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'prototype', 'research facility', 'statistics', 'support tools', 'training opportunity']",NIEHS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,K01,2016,178606,-0.0057775535995157985
"Using the electronic health record to identify children likely to suffer last-minute surgery cancellation PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Last-minute cancellation of surgery frequently leads to psychological stress and financial hardships that disproportionately affect individuals of low socioeconomic status. Moreover, cancellation leaves unutilized healthcare resources valued as high as $1 per second. Machine learning can uncover patterns in historical data to identify predictors, and captures relationships among many factors to allow assessment of risk associated with a particular set of conditions. There is a critical need to develop a model system through machine learning both to understand and to predict cancellation. The long-term goal is to develop evidence- based strategies for improved perioperative resource utilization and efficiency. The overall objective in this application is to develop and deploy an analytical model for predicting last-minute surgical cancellations. The central hypothesis is that a predictive model based on patient-specific and contextual factors will accurately determine the probability of cancellation. The hypothesis has been formulated on the basis of preliminary data showing that risk of cancellation varies substantially with respect to data extracted from the electronic health record (EHR). The rationale for the proposed research is that development of a model that can accurately predict the probability of last-minute cancellation of surgical procedures is likely to provide new opportunities for improving healthcare costs and efficiency. The hypothesis will be tested by pursuing three specific aims: 1) Develop computerized models for predicting surgery cancellation; 2) Identify key predictors of last-minute cancelation of surgery from the EHR and online data resources; and 3) Establish a scalable last-minute surgery cancellation prediction system. Under the first aim, using a pre-existing database and machine- learning techniques already established as feasible in the applicants' hands, patient-specific and contextual data from two pediatric surgical sites in a large Midwest conurbation will be mined. Under the second aim, these predictive models will be interrogated to generate actionable advice. Under the third aim, the optimal model will be identified and integrated into the clinical workflow to direct cancellation prevention and mitigation strategies. The approach is innovative, in the applicants' opinion, because it represents a substantial departure from the status quo by employing machine-learning techniques on large and detailed datasets drawing from the modern EHR and publicly available contextual data. The proposed research is significant because it will both have broad translational importance in perioperative management and also elucidate the etiology of cancellation. The positive impact is expected to be in facilitating quality improvement projects and operating room management strategies to increase utilization of expensive perioperative resources. Successful completion of the proposed research is also expected to lead to more timely surgeries at lower cost for hundreds of thousands of patients, which is of vital importance at a time when the cost of healthcare is ever increasing. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research is relevant to public health because a clinically useful approach to decreasing last- minute cancellations of surgery will provide new opportunities to reduce healthcare expenditures and improve overall efficiency. The project is relevant to AHRQ's mission by making surgical care more accessible, equitable, and affordable.",Using the electronic health record to identify children likely to suffer last-minute surgery cancellation,9223041,R21HS024983,[' '],AHRQ,CINCINNATI CHILDRENS HOSP MED CTR,R21,2016,119761,0.041729568668255744
"NLP to Identify and Rank Clinically Relevant Information for EHRs in the Emergency Department Summary Timely identification of relevant or “need to know” clinical information about a patient’s history in the acute care setting can be critical for patient safety and medical decision-making. Often the relevant information is buried in unstructured or free-text narratives within the Electronic Health Record (EHR), making it difficult to access in a timely fashion. Currently, it is estimated that over 50% of the EHR is free-text. EHR search tools today are often inefficient, simplistic, and unable to rank or evoke the relevance of information for a particular problem or complaint. This is compounded by the fact that EHRs are amassing clinical information at an exponential rate. While the benefits of having a wealth of information at a provider’s fingertips seem obvious, the time and energy cost of culling through enormous amounts of data creates new issues of decreased efficiency and information overload for providers seeking to identify the most pertinent and relevant information about their patients. In the emergency department, where patients can present with life threatening conditions, timely unlocking of clinically relevant information for a patient’s problem or complaint at the point of care can be critical to medical decision-making and patient safety. In this study, we plan to address this challenge through the development of a sophisticated natural language processing (NLP) search tool to automatically identify and rank clinically relevant information based on the patients presenting complaint. We will accomplish this through the following specific aims: 1) identify and define complaint- specific information elements within a patient’s history and 2) develop and test an NLP-based information retrieval tool. Narrative Patient safety hinges on having right information about the right patient and the right time. Often the relevant information is buried in unstructured or free-text narratives within the Electronic Health Record (EHR), making it difficult to access in a timely fashion. The purpose of this study is to develop and evaluate a sophisticated natural language processing (NLP) search tool to automatically identify and rank clinically relevant information from EHRs that providers rely upon to make medical decisions for their patients. This study comes at an important time where data in the EHRs is increasing at an exponential rate, creating a new problem for clinicians, that of finding all the relevant information for patient’s particular problem. This is particularly true in the emergency department setting where providers have limited if any prior relationship and often have to make quick decisions for patients with life threatening conditions. This search tool will provide a snapshot of clinically relevant information that the providers can view alongside the structured information already in the EHR. We believe this approach has the potential to increase clinician efficiency, decrease healthcare costs by avoiding duplicate diagnostic tests, and provide clinicians with the tools they need to make well-informed medical decisions, thereby improving patient safety and reducing suffering.",NLP to Identify and Rank Clinically Relevant Information for EHRs in the Emergency Department,9245525,R21HS024541,[' '],AHRQ,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,R21,2016,148922,0.04009383460023337
"Automated Problem and Allergy Lists Enrichment Based on High Accuracy Information Extraction from the Electronic Health Record ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Medical errors are recognized as the cause of numerous deaths, and even if some are difficult to avoid, many are preventable. Computerized physician order-entry systems with decision support have been proposed to reduce this risk of medication errors, but these systems rely on structured and coded information in the electronic health record (EHR). Unfortunately, a substantial proportion of the information available in the EHR is only mentioned in narrative clinical documents. Electronic lists of problems and allergies are available in most EHRs, but they require manual management by their users, to add new problems, modify existing ones, and the removal of the ones that are irrelevant. Consequently, these electronic lists are often incomplete, inaccurate, and out of date. Clinacuity, Inc. proposed a new system to automatically extract structured and coded medical problems and allergies from clinical narrative text in the EHR of patients suffering from cancer, and established its feasibility. To advance this new system from a prototype to an accurate, adaptable, and robust system, integrated into the commercial EHR system used in our implementation and testing site (Huntsman Cancer Institute and University of Utah Hospital, Salt Lake City, Utah), and ready for commercialization efforts, we will work on the following aims: 1) enhance the NLP system performance, scalability, and quality, 2) develop an advanced visualization interface for local adaptation of the NLP system, and 3) integrate the NLP system with a commercial EHR system. A large and varied reference standard for training and testing the information extraction application will also be developed, a reference standard including a random sample of de-identified clinical narratives from patients treated at the Huntsman Cancer Institute and at the University of Utah Hospital (Salt Lake City, Utah), with problems and allergies annotated by domain experts. Commercial application: The system Clinacuity proposes will not only help healthcare providers maintain complete and timely lists of problems and allergies, providing them with an efficient overview of a patient, but also help healthcare organizations attain meaningful use requirements. The proposed system has potential commercial applications in inpatient and outpatient settings, increasing the efficiency of busy healthcare providers by saving time, and aiding healthcare organizations in demonstrating ""meaningful use"" and obtaining Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services incentive payments. Clinacuity will further extend the commercial potential of the system and its output, using modular design principles allowing utilization of each module independently, and enhancing its local adaptability for easier deployment.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Medical errors cause numerous deaths, and even if some are difficult to avoid, many could be prevented. Computerized physician order-entry systems with decision support have been proposed to reduce this risk of medication errors, but these systems rely on structured and coded information such as entries in electronic lists of problems and allergies. Such lists are available in most electronic health records, but they require manual management and are often incomplete, inaccurate, and out of date. On the other hand, clinical text reports contain the majority of the patient information, including problems and allergies.

"Improving Quality by Maintaining Accurate Problem Lists in the EHR (IQ-MAPLE) DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  A complete patient problem list is the cornerstone of the problem-oriented medical record. It serves as a valuable tool for providers assessing a patient's clinical status and succinctly communicates this information between providers. Accurate problem lists drive clinical decision support tools that improve quality, and an accurate problem list has been associated with higher quality care. Accurate problem lists are also critical for establishing accurate phenotypes for research and supporting quality improvement; however, problem lists in electronic health records are routinely incomplete. In this study, we propose to develop and validate problem inference algorithms to identify problems potentially missing from patient problem lists, and to conduct a randomized trial of these algorithms, studying their effects on quality of care. We call our approach IQ-MAPLE. Our project has three specific aims: 1) develop problem inference algorithms for heart, lung, and blood conditions, 2) implement problem inference alerts and optimize the workflow at four sites and 3) conduct a randomized controlled trial of the problem inference alerts, measuring the acceptance rate of alerts, the direct effect on problem list completeness and, critically, downstream impact of the alerts on key clinical quality measures, including both process and outcomes across a range of heart, lung and blood conditions. If successful, IQ-MAPLE will improve problem list accuracy, which has significant downstream implications: More accurate clinical decision support: Most clinical decision support is disease-oriented and, as such, depends on an accurate problem list. When problems are missing, opportunities to provide support to the clinician are missed, and quality suffers. Better quality measurement: Quality measurement today is often inaccurate, as patients are omitted from measures due to incomplete information on their clinical problems. A more accurate problem list would, in turn, lead to more accurate quality measurement. More accurate research: Clinical, translational and even basic science and genomic research increasingly use EHR data, particularly to identify patients with disease phenotypes, generally using problem lists. When problems are missing, the accuracy of research suffers. Better patient care: Secondary benefits aside, the problem list is, fundamentally, a tool for organizing patient care and communicating among providers. A more accurate, problem list supports these goals. The IQ-MAPLE rules, and our best practices for implementing them, will be freely available, ensuring broad dissemination of these benefits. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  An accurate, complete clinical problem list the cornerstone of a problem-oriented medical record, and research shows that accurate problem lists improve healthcare quality; however, problem lists are often incomplete. In this study, we will develop and evaluate an intervention to identify gaps in problem lists for patients with heart, lung, and blood conditions.

"Automated Detection of Anomalous Accesses to Electronic Health Records DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Health information technology (HIT) can lower costs, strengthen productivity, and promote safety. To realize such benefits on a large scale, healthcare organizations (HCOs) are adopting electronic health records (EHRs) to provide various capabilities. Yet, as EHRs and the healthcare workforce grow in diversity, so does their complexity. This is a concern because evidence suggests complex HIT can interrupt care delivery, contribute to medical errors, and expose patient data to privacy breaches. Moreover, such events tend to be discovered only after they transpire en masse, leading to negative media coverage, loss of patients' trust, and sanctions. Federal regulations now enable patients to receive accountings of who accessed their medical records during treatment, payment, and operations related activities. Yet, for patients to make sense of such accountings, they need to be provided with explanations regarding the extent to which accesses are normal in the context of routine HCO activities. We believe that relating specific accesses to patterns of healthcare operations can help explain how medical records are utilized. Unfortunately, many of the aforementioned problems manifest because EHR utilization patterns rarely guide the design and refinement of healthcare management practices. Thus, the overarching objective of our research is to develop novel strategies to automatically learn HCO behavior based on EHR usage. The past several years has witnessed a flurry of activity in this field, but it remains in is infancy and has only scratched the surface of care patterns and the types of anomalies that can be detected. Through this project, we propose to develop anomaly detection methods that integrate the semantics of healthcare operations and allow for the detection of workflows over time. This will enable HCOs and patients to audit in a meaningful way. Moreover, we believe the innovation and dissemination of such data mining strategies will enable HCOs to detect anomalous events that indicate system misuse and patients who require special attention, but also effectively audit business practices and discover inefficient workflows. The specific aims of this project are (1) to develop machine learning approaches, based on intrasession utilization patterns, to streamline EHR interface configuration and detect anomalous sessions, (2) to design a data mining framework, based on intersession EHR access patterns, to characterize HCO departmental interactions in patient treatment and detect anomalous events, and (3) to infer patient management pathways to consolidate redundant processes and detect deviations from anticipated workflows. In support of these goals, we will evaluate, compare, and contrast the workflows and anomalies in the EHR systems of two large medical centers. Additionally, we will ensure that our methods are integrated into an open source software system that can assist HCOs to extract, transform, and load (ETL) access data from EHRs, analyze such data for anomalies, and visualize the results in interfaces that enable review by healthcare administrators and patients. In doing so, we will be able to compare and contrast behavior of the workflows and multiple institutions and develop methods that appropriately generalize across EHR systems. As electronic health record systems, and healthcare organizations, grow in diversity, so do their complexity, which can lead to inefficient documentation, management of patients, and expose patient data to privacy breaches. In this research, we will develop technologies, to be disseminated through an open source software suite, to learn patterns associated with healthcare operations, upon which anomaly detection techniques can be based. The specific goals of this project are to 1) model HCO users' intrasession behaviors when interacting with an EHR, 2) learn interdepartmental relations based on the accesses of common patients, and 3) infer patient management pathways based on the sequence of accesses to a patient's record.",Automated Detection of Anomalous Accesses to Electronic Health Records,8882547,R01LM010207,"['Accounting', 'Administrator', 'Admission activity', 'Adopted', 'Architecture', 'Attention', 'Behavior', 'Businesses', 'Caring', 'Case Manager', 'Case Study', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Security', 'Detection', 'Documentation', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Employee', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Entropy', 'Event', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Graph', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Inpatients', 'Institution', 'Interdepartmental Relations', 'Internet', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Errors', 'Medical Records', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Movement', 'Neonatal Intensive Care', 'Neonatology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Patterns of Care', 'Phase', 'Practice Management', 'Primary Health Care', 'Privacy', 'Process', 'Productivity', 'Provider', 'Recording of previous events', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Safety', 'Semantics', 'Surface', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Trust', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'care delivery', 'comparative', 'cost', 'data mining', 'design', 'follow-up', 'health information technology', 'infancy', 'innovation', 'novel strategies', 'open source', 'operation', 'organizational structure', 'payment', 'programs', 'software systems', 'ward']",NLM,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,R01,2015,80,0.06955534119596746
"Better Outcomes for Children: Promoting Excellence in Healthcare Genomics to Inform Policy ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In May 2012 Cincinnati Children's (CCHMC) joined eMERGE II with our Boston Children's partner. Since then we have developed algorithms for the electronic health record (EHR), led the Pediatric Workgroup, developed pharmacogenomics, evaluated the preferences of parents and caregivers to advance genomic medicine and assimilated technical advances into our EHR. The eMERGE effort has become the basic fabric of the institutional initiative to incorporate the extraordinary advances of genetics, genomics and the electronic medical record into healthcare. In addition, we bring a comprehensive EHR (EPIC), operating in every venue for healthcare delivery at CCHMC; a deidentified i2b2 data warehouse of 1.2 million patient records; and a Biobank with 150,000 consents that allow return of results to 38,000 patients and guardians who have provided 58,000 DNA samples, all with consent to return results and i2b2 EHR records. Now, we present our plan to join the eMERGE III network with 17 proposed initiatives. Our eMERGE effort is designed to move an entire institution with our eMERGE III partners into a genomic-EHR era of healthcare implementation and discovery. Our effort is divided into Genomics , Aim 1, where we hope to help the eMERGE III Steering Committee identify the 100 or so genes for the eMERGE III Targeted Gene Panel (eTGP), select our 2,000 CCHMC patients to be sequenced (of the 38,000 in our Biobank), review 4,000 targeted gene panels from clinical care at CCHMC for somatic mosaicism and reinterpretation, and further develop and disseminate a software workflow suite for sequence analysis (CASSI). For Phenotypes, Aim 2, we will extend our work generating EHR phenotype algorithms using heuristic and machine learning methods with a comprehensive set of EHR features derived from data driven algorithms to describe phenotypic pleiotropy of eTGP gene variants. We will develop working collaborations with Patients Care Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI) and the Million Veterans Program by applying eMERGE developed EHR algorithms to these large electronic data warehouses. For Implementation and Evaluation, Aim 3, we will develop tools to evaluate adolescent return of results preferences, examine the ethical and legal obligations and potential to reanalyze results, analyze the cost of tacrolimus management of kidney transplant with and without CYP3A5 testing, develop clinical decision support for phenotyping, test ordering, and returning eTGP results.

"Understanding and predicting cardiac events in HD using real-time EHRs DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of this K25 proposal is to provide Dr. Benjamin Goldstein Ph.D., M.P.H., with the necessary protected time and additional training to develop as an independent, clinical biostatistician. This proposal has two key components: (1) an innovative research plan and (2) a comprehensive training plan. It is well recognized that patients undergoing hemodialysis (HD) are at increased risk of cardiac related events which often prove fatal. While substantive research has identified risk factors for these events, little work has been performed on forecasting their occurrence. The proposed research proposes to use existing electronic health record (EHR) data available through a collaborating dialysis center, DaVita Inc, to derive such a prediction model. EHRs contain detailed information on both a patient's health history (e.g. comorbidities, medications) as well as their evolving health statu (i.e. changes in health). A particularly unique aspect of the DaVita EHR system is the availability of real-time measures of health (e.g. blood pressure, pulse) available over the course of an HD session. Through our ongoing collaboration we will have data on 10,000s of individuals each with 100s of HD sessions, presenting the opportunity to analyze millions of dialysis sessions. Within this wealth of data two particular questions will be addressed: (1) How does a patient's hemodynamics vary over the course of and across HD sessions? (2) Can we derive a predictor for the near term onset of a cardiac event? To answer question 1, sophisticated statistical methodology, referred to as functional data analysis (FDA), will be utilized. Patterns of hemodynamic measures will be compared during and across HD sessions with key features extracted. For question 2, machine learning methodology will be used to derive a prediction model for the onset of cardiac events. The final aim will be to assess the feasibility of applying such models within a clinical environment. As a Ph.D. biostatistician, Dr. Goldstein has many of the methodological and computational skills necessary to perform the proposed analyses. The proposed methods, while established, also have ample room for statistical investigation and will provide the basis for methodological research. He will be mentored by Dr. Bradley Efron, professor in the Stanford Department of Statistics, and a world recognized expert in statistical methodology. Serving as a consultant will be Drs. Trevor Hastie and John Ioannidis, fellow members of the department of statistics and experts in FDA and prediction evaluation respectively. The focus of Dr. Goldstein's training will be on developing his clinical expertise. This will be performed through a combination of didactic courses, one-on- one tutorials and clinical exposure. Dr. Wolfgang Winkelmayer, a clinical nephrologist and close collaborator of Dr. Goldstein, will supervise Dr. Goldstein's clinical knowledge development. He will be joined by Dr. Mark Hlatky, a research cardiologist, who will also provide mentorship with regards to the cardiac substance of the project. Additional consultants across the department of medicine will be used as needed. The proposed project will have a tremendous impact on Dr. Goldstein's career prospects. At the end of the 5 year period he will have begun the process of developing a research program in the analysis of EHR data. There will be ample avenues to pursue future studies, through the analysis of other predictor variables (e.g. biomarkers, psycho-social factors), outcomes (e.g. hospitalization, cost) and most importantly, implementation of the prediction models in the clinic. The clinical training period will provide him with the necessary background to succeed as a clinically-oriented biostatistician and develop as a leader in the field. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Electronic health records have become increasingly common in clinical settings but to this point have been underutilized for research purposes. This project will analyze real-time EHR data that are generated during a dialysis session. The focus will be on understanding patients' hemodynamic changes over the course of a three hour dialysis session and using that information to derive a prediction model for severe cardiac events.",Understanding and predicting cardiac events in HD using real-time EHRs,8921191,K25DK097279,"['Accounting', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Advertising', 'Algorithms', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Pressure', 'Breast Cancer Risk Assessment Tool', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Cluster randomized trial', 'Collaborations', 'Comorbidity', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Dialysis procedure', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Economics', 'Education', 'Electronic Health Record', 'End stage renal failure', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Heart Arrest', 'Hemodialysis', 'Hospitalization', 'Hour', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Investigation', 'Kidney', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Length', 'Machine Learning', 'Master of Public Health', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mind', 'Modeling', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Play', 'Process', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Specific qualifier value', 'System', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'career', 'clinical care', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'demographics', 'disorder risk', 'health information technology', 'hemodynamics', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'member', 'predictive modeling', 'professor', 'programs', 'skills', 'social', 'statistics', 'tool']",NIDDK,DUKE UNIVERSITY,K25,2015,159162,0.02163537363104761
"An Information Fusion Approach to Longitudinal Health Records DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our goal is to leverage an information fusion approach to integrate structured and unstructured information to generate a longitudinal health record (LHR) for accelerating the pace at which patients can be recruited into clinical trials. Because electronic health records (EHR) contain clinical summaries of a patient's clinical history, one would assume that they could be easily leveraged to automatically screen and identify potentially eligible patients. However most EHRs are not well designed to support screening of eligible patients and are composed of multiple data sources that are often redundant or inconsistent, stored in uncoordinated unstructured clinical narratives and structured data. These characteristics make EHRs difficult to use for matching patients against the complex event and temporal criteria of clinical trials protocols. This research proposes that an improved LHR, which contains a comprehensive clinical summary of a patient, can improve patient screening. We propose using a method of information fusion to generate this LHR, which merges information from multiple data sources, that addresses both the meaning and temporal nature of data, such that the resulting information is more accurate than would be possible if these sources were used individually.         The specific aims are to: 1) characterize the barriers of using EHR sources for screening in terms of data redundancy, inconsistency, lack of structure, and temporal imprecision; 2) automatically extract information from unstructured EHR sources necessary for screening patients against clinical trials eligibility criteria using natural language processing; 3) developan LHR appropriate for screening patients against eligibility criteria using information fusion methods based on semantic and temporal information; and 4) evaluate the accuracy of an LHR formed through information fusion for screening patients against clinical trials eligibility critera.         The respective hypotheses to be tested are: 1) Different parts of the EHR will contain variable amounts of redundancy, inconsistency, and temporal imprecision. Some sources will be more valuable for matching patients than others to clinical trials eligibility criteria. 2) Including th information contained in the unstructured notes will reduce the false positive rate of identifying potentially eligible patients over leveraging only the structured data in the EHR. 3) By using information fusion methods based on leveraging semantic and temporal information on a combination of structured and unstructured data, we will be able to accurately summarize the information contained in uncoordinated EHR data sources into an LHR that can be used for screening patients for clinical trials. 4) The use of information fusion to generate a longitudinal health record will increase the sensitivity and specificity of electronic clinical trial screening ver using a traditional EHR.         With an LHR formed through information fusion for screening patients for clinical trials eligibilit, we will be able to not only reduce the amount of staff effort required to recruit a patient into a clinical trial, but also accelerate the pace at which clinical trials can be conducted. Narrative This project is focused on generating a longitudinal health record for accelerating the pace at which patients can be recruited into clinical trials. Accelerating the pace at which patients are recruited into clinical trials has the potential for improving the speed at which new treatments are made available to the public.",An Information Fusion Approach to Longitudinal Health Records,8906937,R01LM011116,"['Address', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical trial protocol document', 'Complex', 'Consultations', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Electronics', 'Eligibility Determination', 'Enrollment', 'Event', 'Failure', 'Goals', 'Hour', 'Laboratories', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patients', 'Process', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Semantics', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Series', 'Source', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'TimeLine', 'Work', 'base', 'cohort', 'cost', 'design', 'falls', 'health record', 'improved', 'screening']",NLM,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2015,297811,0.06918693361346304
"Patient Medical History Representation, Extraction, and Inference from EHR Data DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The significance of developing tools for automatically harvesting temporal constraints of clinical events from Electronic Health Records (EHR) cannot be overestimated. Efficient analysis of the temporal aspects in EHR data could boost an array of clinical and translational research such as disease progression studies, decision support systems, and personalized medicine.     One big challenge we are facing is to automatically untangle and linearize the temporal constraints of clinical events embedded in highly diverse large-scale EHR data. Barriers to temporal data modeling, normalization, extraction, and reasoning have precluded the efficient use of EHR data sources for event history evaluation and trending analysis: (1) The current federally-supported EHR data normalization tools do not focus on the time aspect of unstructured data yet; (2) Existing time models focus only on structured data with absolute time, lack of supporting reasoning systems, or only offer application-specific partial solutions which cannot be adopted by the complex EHR data; (3) Current temporal information extraction approaches are either difficult to be adopted to EHR data, not scalable, or only offers application-specific partial solution.     This proposed project fills in the current gaps among ontologies, Natural Language Processing (NLP), and EHR-based clinical research for temporal data representation, normalization, extractions, and reasoning. We propose to develop novel approaches for automatic temporal data representation, normalization and reasoning for large, diverse, and heterogeneous EHR data and prepare the integrated data for further analysis. We will build new reasoning and extraction capacities on our TIMER (Temporal Information Modeling, Extracting, and Reasoning) framework to provide an end-to-end, open-source, standard-conforming software package. TIMER will be built on strong prior work by our team. We will develop new features in our CNTRO (Clinical Narrative Temporal Relation Ontology) for semantically defining the time domain and representing temporal data in complex EHR data. On top of the new developed CNTRO semantics, we will implement temporal relation reasoning capacities to automatically normalize temporal expressions, compute and infer temporal relations, and resolve ambiguities. We will leverage existing NLP tools and work on top of these tools to develop new extraction approaches to fill in the current gaps between NLP approaches and ontology-based reasoning approaches. We will adapt the SHARPn EHR data normalization pipeline and cTAKES for extracting and normalizing clinical event mentions from clinical narratives. We will explore an innovative approach for temporal relation extraction and event coreference, and make it work with the TIMER framework. We will evaluate the system using Diabetes Mellitus (DM) and colorectal cancer (CRC) patient cohorts from two insititutions. Each component will be tested separately first followed by an evaluation of the whole framework. Results such as precision, recall, and f-measure will be reported. Project Narrative The significance of developing capabilities for automatically harvesting temporal constraints for clinical events from Electronic Health Records (EHR) cannot be overestimated. A substantial portion of the information in the EHR is historical in nature. Patient medical history can be long, especially in complex patients. The proposed work, by offering an end-to-end open-source framework for automatically extracting, normalizing, and reasoning clinically-important time-relevant information from large-scale EHR data, can boost an array of clinical and translational research such as disease progression studies, decision support systems, and personalized medicine; as well as facilitate clinical practice for early disease detection, post-treatment care, and patient-clinician communication.","Patient Medical History Representation, Extraction, and Inference from EHR Data",8911361,R01LM011829,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Aftercare', 'Archives', 'Automated Annotation', 'Big Data', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Detection', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Harvest', 'Human', 'Institutes', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medical History', 'Medical Records', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Ontology', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Recording of previous events', 'Registries', 'Reporting', 'Resolution', 'Semantics', 'Solutions', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translational Research', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'colon cancer patients', 'data modeling', 'data structure', 'information model', 'innovation', 'novel strategies', 'open source', 'personalized medicine', 'programs', 'tool', 'trend']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR HOUSTON,R01,2015,325159,0.09895186513416336
"SCH: Enhancing Nurse Decision-Making via Augmented Communication Tools (ACTs)  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Smart algorithms that effectively analyze patient care data can enhance clinical communication to save lives. In 2000, the Institute of Medicine estimated 98,000 preventable patient deaths occur annually in US hospitals due to miscommunication [1]. Electronic health records (EHRs) were expected to facilitate accurate communication within the care team and provide data to enable automated clinical decision support systems. Unfortunately, miscommunication remains a significant cause of patient deaths [2]. Providers are now required to demonstrate meaningful use of EHR systems to improve quality of care and patient outcomes. Despite this, providers continue to report that EHR systems are cumbersome and interfere with care-team communication. Information entered into an EHR is rarely used by nurses due to the time and difficulty involved in its retrieval. As a result, nurses continue to verbally convey critical patient care information to the next nurse during shift changes. Verbal report or hand-off, where critical patient information is exchanged in only minutes, is inefficient. Worse, it is highly susceptible to communication errors. Broader Impacts: Research: 1) Increase patient safety; 2) Provide preliminary data to expand this work to include physician-physician and physician-RN communication and decision-making in the EHR; 3) Share our discoveries to inform other industries who may also benefit from this technology. Education: 1) Contribute to curriculum enhancements whereby RN students learn strategies to recognize and effectively communicate CEs; 2) As part of curriculum enhancements, include healthcare applications for computer and information science students; 3) Disseminate findings via academic publications, professional meetings, a project website and social media. Mentoring: 1) Mentor budding scientists in the roles of research assistants (RAs) and post doctoral fellows studying nursing and computer science to forge collaborative interdisciplinary relationships for ongoing research; 2) Interest and recruit underrepresented students in STEM and careers in healthcare. RELEVANCE (See instructions): The electronic health record (EHR) has been thought to be a tool to decrease patient deaths related to miscommunication. However, the current EHR falls short of this goal. We propose to develop and test an algorithm that will augment the EHR to more effectively assist nurses in decision-making and communication, ultimately increasing patient safety.",SCH: Enhancing Nurse Decision-Making via Augmented Communication Tools (ACTs) ,8932003,R01EB020395,"['Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Communication', 'Communication Tools', 'Computer Simulation', 'Conscious', 'Data', 'Data Reporting', 'Decision Making', 'Discipline of Nursing', 'Documentation', 'Education', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Electronics', 'Event', 'Fever', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Hemorrhage', 'Hospitals', 'Imagery', 'Industry', 'Information Sciences', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'Instruction', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Nurses', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Pain', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Provider', 'Publications', 'Quality of Care', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Retrieval', 'Role', 'STEM career', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Severities', 'Students', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Underrepresented Students', 'Validity and Reliability', 'Work', 'computer science', 'falls', 'forging', 'high risk', 'improved', 'interest', 'light weight', 'meetings', 'patient safety', 'prototype', 'respiratory', 'social', 'tool', 'usability', 'web site']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA,R01,2015,248507,0.07611155141456127
"Temporal relation discovery for clinical text ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         The overarching long-term vision of our research is to create novel technologies for processing clinical free text. We will build upon the previous work of our ongoing project ""Temporal relation discovery for clinical text"" (R01LM010090) dubbed Temporal Histories of Your Medical Events (THYME; thyme.healthnlp.org) which has been focusing on methodology for event, temporal expressions and temporal relations discovery from the clinical text residing in the Electronic Health Records (EHR). We developed a comprehensive approach to temporality in the clinical text and innovated in computable temporal representations, methods for temporal relation discovery and their evaluation, rendering temporality to end users - resulting in over 35+ papers and presentations. Our dissemination is international and far-reaching as the best performing methods are released open source as part of the Apache Clinical Text Analysis and Knowledge Extraction System (ctakes.apache.org). The methods we developed are now being used in such nation-wide initiatives as the Electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE), Pharmacogenomics Network (PGRN), Informatics for Integrating the Biology and the Bedside (i2b2), Patient Centered Outcomes Research Institute and National Cancer Institute's Informatics Technology for Cancer Research (ITCR). Through our participation in organizing major international bakeoffs - CLEF/ShARe 2014, SemEval 2014 Analysis of Clinical Text Task 7, SemEval 2015 Analysis of Clinical Text Task 14, SemEval 2015 Clinical TempEval Task 6 - we further disseminated the THYME resources and challenged the international research community to explore new solutions to the unsolved temporality task. Through all these activities it became clear that computational approaches to temporality still present great challenges and usability of the output is still limited. Therefore, we propose to further innovate on methodologies and end user experience.             Specific Aim 1: Extract enhanced representations and novel features to support deriving timeline information.     Specific Aim 2: Develop methods to amalgamate individual patient episode timelines into an aggregate patient-level timeline.     Specific Aim 3: Mine the EHR - the unstructured clinical text and the structured codified information - for full patient-level temporality.     Specific Aim 4: Develop a comprehensive temporal visualization tool     Specific Aim 5: Develop methodology for and perform extrinsic evaluation on specific use case.     Specific Aim 6: (1) Evaluate state-of-the-art of temporal relations through organizing international challenges under the auspices of SemEval, (2) Disseminate the results through publications, presentations, and open source code in Apache cTAKES. Functional testing.             Project Narrative Temporal relations are of prime importance in biomedicine as they are intrinsically linked to diseases, signs and symptoms, and treatments. Understanding the timeline of clinically relevant events is key to the next generation of translational research where the importance of generalizing over large amounts of data holds the promise of deciphering biomedical puzzles.

"Data-Mining Clinical Decision Support from Electronic Health Records ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)    Data-Mining Clinical Decision Support from Electronic Health Records Public Health Motivation: National healthcare quality is compromised by undesirable variability, reflected in different locales having anywhere from 20-80% compliance with evidence-based guidelines. Much of this is due to uncertainty, with half of clinical practice guidelines lacking adequate evidence to confirm their efficacy. This is unsurprising when clinical trials cost >$15 million to answer individual clinical questions. The result is medical practice routinely driven by individual opinio and anecdotal experience. While Big Data has revolutionized how society processes internet scale information, the status quo in clinical decision making remains the manual interpretation of literature and isolated decision aids. The adoption of electronic health records (EHR) creates a new opportunity to answer a ""grand challenge in clinical decision support (CDS)."" In a learning health system, we could automatically adapt knowledge from the collective expertise embedded in the EHR practices of real clinicians and close the loop by disseminating that knowledge back as executable decision support. Candidate Goals and Objectives: The unifying goal of this BD2K K01 proposal is the mentored career development of Jonathan H. Chen, MD, PhD. This proposal will accelerate his transition into an independent physician scientist, towards his long-term goals to produce Big Data technologies that answer such grand challenges in clinical decision support. His near-term objective is developing methods to translate EHR data into useful knowledge in the form of patient- specific, point-of-care clinical order recommendations for acute medical hospitalizations. His doctoral background in computer science gives him the technical capability to achieve these objectives, while his medical training will ensure clinically meaningful results. His preliminary work to build an order recommender, analogous to commercial product recommenders, demonstrates the proposal's overall feasibility. Institutional Environment and Career Development: The research facilities and training opportunities at Stanford University provide the ideal environment to achieve these objectives, with established and growing Centers for Biomedical Informatics Research, the Biomedical Data Science Initiative, and the first Clinical Informatics Fellowship accredited in the nation. Prof. Russ Altman, Director of the Biomedical Informatics Training Program, will lead a collaborative team of mentors with expertise in clinical decision support (Mary Goldstein), implementation science (Steven Asch), data-mining electronic health records (Nigam Shah), statistical learning algorithms (Lester Mackey), and healthcare statistics (Michael Baiocchi). Combined with respective didactic training, this mentorship will enable Dr. Chen to achieve his objectives through a series of research aims. Research Aims: The overriding hypothesis of the proposal is that clinical knowledge reflected in clinical order patterns from historical EHR data can improve medical decision making when adapted into functional clinical decision support. The specific aims each address components of this concept, as they seek to: (1) Develop the algorithms to learn clinical order patterns from historical EHR data, building on a preliminary recommender system; (2) Assess how underlying clinician proficiency affects the quality of those learned clinical order patterns through observational data inference against external standards; and (3) Determine the impact of automatically learned clinical decision support (CDS) on (simulated) clinical workflows through a randomized controlled crossover trial of human-computer interfaces with real clinicians. Expected Results and General Significance: By the completion of the proposed work, Dr. Chen will answer the grand challenge in clinical decision support (CDS) by automating much of the CDS production process, and have direct translational impact with a prototype system. This will advance the field with new paradigms of generating and disseminating clinical knowledge, which can then improve the consistency and quality of healthcare delivery. Additional benefits will include methods to identify and monitor areas of high practice variability for targeted optimization and improve predictive models that inform precision medicine. With this applied research experience and career development, Dr. Chen can compete for R01 funding and become an independent physician scientist developing Big Data approaches to solve national healthcare problems in clinical decision making.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    National healthcare quality is compromised by undesirable practice variability and medical uncertainty, with most medical practice routinely driven by individual opinions and anecdotal experience. With methods analogous to commercial product recommender systems, the proposed project will automatically learn patterns in raw clinical transaction data to capture the undocumented knowledge of real-world clinicians, and close the loop in a learning health system by disseminating that knowledge back as clinical decision support to improve patient care.                ",Data-Mining Clinical Decision Support from Electronic Health Records,9044538,K01ES026837,"['Achievement', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Admission activity', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Applied Research', 'Area', 'Back', 'Big Data', 'Biomedical Research', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Clinical Practice Guideline', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cross-Over Trials', 'Crowding', 'Data', 'Decision Aid', 'Decision Making', 'Diagnosis', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Exhibits', 'Failure', 'Fellowship', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'Internet', 'Investments', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Locales', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Medical', 'Medical Residency', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Motivation', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Process', 'Production', 'Public Health', 'Quality of Care', 'Randomized', 'Recommendation', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Research Training', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Services', 'Societies', 'Source', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Translating', 'Uncertainty', 'Universities', 'User-Computer Interface', 'Validation', 'Weight', 'Work', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'career development', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical practice', 'computer science', 'cost', 'data mining', 'design', 'evidence based guidelines', 'experience', 'health care delivery', 'health care quality', 'implementation science', 'improved', 'informatics training', 'point of care', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'research facility', 'statistics', 'tool']",NIEHS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,K01,2015,178606,-0.0057775535995157985
"Improving Quality by Maintaining Accurate Problem Lists in the EHR (IQ-MAPLE) DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  A complete patient problem list is the cornerstone of the problem-oriented medical record. It serves as a valuable tool for providers assessing a patient's clinical status and succinctly communicates this information between providers. Accurate problem lists drive clinical decision support tools that improve quality, and an accurate problem list has been associated with higher quality care. Accurate problem lists are also critical for establishing accurate phenotypes for research and supporting quality improvement; however, problem lists in electronic health records are routinely incomplete. In this study, we propose to develop and validate problem inference algorithms to identify problems potentially missing from patient problem lists, and to conduct a randomized trial of these algorithms, studying their effects on quality of care. We call our approach IQ-MAPLE. Our project has three specific aims: 1) develop problem inference algorithms for heart, lung, and blood conditions, 2) implement problem inference alerts and optimize the workflow at four sites and 3) conduct a randomized controlled trial of the problem inference alerts, measuring the acceptance rate of alerts, the direct effect on problem list completeness and, critically, downstream impact of the alerts on key clinical quality measures, including both process and outcomes across a range of heart, lung and blood conditions. If successful, IQ-MAPLE will improve problem list accuracy, which has significant downstream implications: More accurate clinical decision support: Most clinical decision support is disease-oriented and, as such, depends on an accurate problem list. When problems are missing, opportunities to provide support to the clinician are missed, and quality suffers. Better quality measurement: Quality measurement today is often inaccurate, as patients are omitted from measures due to incomplete information on their clinical problems. A more accurate problem list would, in turn, lead to more accurate quality measurement. More accurate research: Clinical, translational and even basic science and genomic research increasingly use EHR data, particularly to identify patients with disease phenotypes, generally using problem lists. When problems are missing, the accuracy of research suffers. Better patient care: Secondary benefits aside, the problem list is, fundamentally, a tool for organizing patient care and communicating among providers. A more accurate, problem list supports these goals. The IQ-MAPLE rules, and our best practices for implementing them, will be freely available, ensuring broad dissemination of these benefits. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  An accurate, complete clinical problem list the cornerstone of a problem-oriented medical record, and research shows that accurate problem lists improve healthcare quality; however, problem lists are often incomplete. In this study, we will develop and evaluate an intervention to identify gaps in problem lists for patients with heart, lung, and blood conditions. If successful, this system should improve problem list completeness and, ultimately, the quality of care delivered to patients.",Improving Quality by Maintaining Accurate Problem Lists in the EHR (IQ-MAPLE),8838253,R01HL122225,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Algorithms', 'Aortic Aneurysm', 'Basic Science', 'Blood', 'Caring', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Code', 'Communication', 'Congestive Heart Failure', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Documentation', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Electronics', 'Elements', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Foundations', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Sciences', 'Healthcare', 'Heart', 'Heart Diseases', 'Hematological Disease', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'Intervention', 'Journals', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical center', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Mind', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'New England', 'Nurses', 'Oregon', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Primary Health Care', 'Problem-Oriented Medical Records', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Quality of Care', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Reading', 'Registries', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Support', 'Role', 'Site', 'Solutions', 'Sorting - Cell Movement', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'United States Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services', 'Universities', 'Update', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical care', 'clinical research site', 'design', 'disease phenotype', 'electronic data', 'experience', 'health care quality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'intervention effect', 'knowledge base', 'neglect', 'patient safety', 'randomized trial', 'tool']",NHLBI,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2015,590477,0.017891700301031613
"Automated Detection of Anomalous Accesses to Electronic Health Records  Health information technology (HIT) can lower costs, strengthen productivity, and promote safety. To realize such benefits on a large scale, healthcare organizations (HCOs) are adopting electronic health records (EHRs) to provide various capabilities. Yet, as EHRs and the healthcare workforce grow in diversity, so does their complexity. This is a concern because evidence suggests complex HIT can interrupt care delivery, contribute to medical errors, and expose patient data to privacy breaches. Moreover, such events tend to be discovered only after they transpire en masse, leading to negative media coverage, loss of patients' trust, and sanctions. Federal regulations now enable patients to receive accountings of who accessed their medical records during treatment, payment, and operations related activities. Yet, for patients to make sense of such accountings, they need to be provided with explanations regarding the extent to which accesses are normal in the context of routine HCO activities. We believe that relating specific accesses to patterns of healthcare operations can help explain how medical records are utilized. Unfortunately, many of the aforementioned problems manifest because EHR utilization patterns rarely guide the design and refinement of healthcare management practices. Thus, the overarching objective of our research is to develop novel strategies to automatically learn HCO behavior based on EHR usage. The past several years has witnessed a flurry of activity in this field, but it remains in its infancy and has only scratched the surface of care patterns and the types of anomalies that can be detected. Through this project, we propose to develop anomaly detection methods that integrate the semantics of healthcare operations and allow for the detection of workflows over time. This will enable HCOs and patients to audit in a meaningful way. Moreover, we believe the innovation and dissemination of such data mining strategies will enable HCOs to detect anomalous events that indicate system misuse and patients who require special attention, but also effectively audit business practices and discover inefficient workflows. The specific aims of this project are (1) to develop machine learning approaches, based on intrasession utilization patterns, to streamline EHR interface configuration and detect anomalous sessions, (2) to design a data mining framework, based on intersession EHR access patterns, to characterize HCO departmental interactions in patient treatment and detect anomalous events, and (3) to infer patient management pathways to consolidate redundant processes and detect deviations from anticipated workflows. In support of these goals, we will evaluate, compare, and contrast the workflows and anomalies in the EHR systems of two large medical centers. Additionally, we will ensure that our methods are integrated into an open source software system that can assist HCOs to extract, transform, and load (ETL) access data from EHRs, analyze such data for anomalies, and visualize the results in interfaces that enable review by healthcare administrators and patients. In doing so, we will be able to compare and contrast behavior of the workflows and multiple institutions and develop methods that appropriately generalize across EHR systems.  As electronic health record systems, and healthcare organizations, grow in diversity, so do their complexity, which can lead to inefficient documentation, management of patients, and expose patient data to privacy breaches. In this research, we will develop technologies, to be disseminated through an open source software suite, to learn patterns associated with healthcare operations, upon which anomaly detection techniques can be based. The specific goals of this project are to 1) model HCO users' intrasession behaviors when interacting with an EHR, 2) learn interdepartmental relations based on the accesses of common patients, and 3) infer patient management pathways based on the sequence of accesses to a patient's record.",Automated Detection of Anomalous Accesses to Electronic Health Records,8694383,R01LM010207,"['Accounting', 'Administrator', 'Admission activity', 'Adopted', 'Architecture', 'Attention', 'Behavior', 'Businesses', 'Caring', 'Case Manager', 'Case Study', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Security', 'Detection', 'Documentation', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Employee', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Entropy', 'Event', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Graph', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Inpatients', 'Institution', 'Interdepartmental Relations', 'Internet', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Errors', 'Medical Records', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Movement', 'Neonatal Intensive Care', 'Neonatology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Patterns of Care', 'Phase', 'Practice Management', 'Primary Health Care', 'Privacy', 'Process', 'Productivity', 'Provider', 'Recording of previous events', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Safety', 'Semantics', 'Simulate', 'Surface', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Trust', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'care delivery', 'comparative', 'cost', 'data mining', 'design', 'follow-up', 'health information technology', 'infancy', 'innovation', 'novel strategies', 'open source', 'operation', 'organizational structure', 'payment', 'programs', 'software systems', 'ward']",NLM,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,R01,2014,392500,0.0697929607067748
"Understanding and predicting cardiac events in HD using real-time EHRs     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of this K25 proposal is to provide Dr. Benjamin Goldstein Ph.D., M.P.H., with the necessary protected time and additional training to develop as an independent, clinical biostatistician. This proposal has two key components: (1) an innovative research plan and (2) a comprehensive training plan. It is well recognized that patients undergoing hemodialysis (HD) are at increased risk of cardiac related events which often prove fatal. While substantive research has identified risk factors for these events, little work has been performed on forecasting their occurrence. The proposed research proposes to use existing electronic health record (EHR) data available through a collaborating dialysis center, DaVita Inc, to derive such a prediction model. EHRs contain detailed information on both a patient's health history (e.g. comorbidities, medications) as well as their evolving health statu (i.e. changes in health). A particularly unique aspect of the DaVita EHR system is the availability of real-time measures of health (e.g. blood pressure, pulse) available over the course of an HD session. Through our ongoing collaboration we will have data on 10,000s of individuals each with 100s of HD sessions, presenting the opportunity to analyze millions of dialysis sessions. Within this wealth of data two particular questions will be addressed: (1) How does a patient's hemodynamics vary over the course of and across HD sessions? (2) Can we derive a predictor for the near term onset of a cardiac event? To answer question 1, sophisticated statistical methodology, referred to as functional data analysis (FDA), will be utilized. Patterns of hemodynamic measures will be compared during and across HD sessions with key features extracted. For question 2, machine learning methodology will be used to derive a prediction model for the onset of cardiac events. The final aim will be to assess the feasibility of applying such models within a clinical environment. As a Ph.D. biostatistician, Dr. Goldstein has many of the methodological and computational skills necessary to perform the proposed analyses. The proposed methods, while established, also have ample room for statistical investigation and will provide the basis for methodological research. He will be mentored by Dr. Bradley Efron, professor in the Stanford Department of Statistics, and a world recognized expert in statistical methodology. Serving as a consultant will be Drs. Trevor Hastie and John Ioannidis, fellow members of the department of statistics and experts in FDA and prediction evaluation respectively. The focus of Dr. Goldstein's training will be on developing his clinical expertise. This will be performed through a combination of didactic courses, one-on- one tutorials and clinical exposure. Dr. Wolfgang Winkelmayer, a clinical nephrologist and close collaborator of Dr. Goldstein, will supervise Dr. Goldstein's clinical knowledge development. He will be joined by Dr. Mark Hlatky, a research cardiologist, who will also provide mentorship with regards to the cardiac substance of the project. Additional consultants across the department of medicine will be used as needed. The proposed project will have a tremendous impact on Dr. Goldstein's career prospects. At the end of the 5 year period he will have begun the process of developing a research program in the analysis of EHR data. There will be ample avenues to pursue future studies, through the analysis of other predictor variables (e.g. biomarkers, psycho-social factors), outcomes (e.g. hospitalization, cost) and most importantly, implementation of the prediction models in the clinic. The clinical training period will provide him with the necessary background to succeed as a clinically-oriented biostatistician and develop as a leader in the field.     PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Electronic health records have become increasingly common in clinical settings but to this point have been underutilized for research purposes. This project will analyze real-time EHR data that are generated during a dialysis session. The focus will be on understanding patients' hemodynamic changes over the course of a three hour dialysis session and using that information to derive a prediction model for severe cardiac events.",Understanding and predicting cardiac events in HD using real-time EHRs,8725658,K25DK097279,"['Accounting', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Advertising', 'Algorithms', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Pressure', 'Breast Cancer Risk Assessment Tool', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Comorbidity', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Dialysis procedure', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Economics', 'Education', 'Electronic Health Record', 'End stage renal failure', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Heart Arrest', 'Hemodialysis', 'Hospitalization', 'Hour', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Investigation', 'Kidney', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Length', 'Machine Learning', 'Master of Public Health', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Metric', 'Mind', 'Modeling', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Play', 'Process', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Specific qualifier value', 'System', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'career', 'clinical care', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'demographics', 'disorder risk', 'health information technology', 'hemodynamics', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'member', 'professor', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'randomized trial', 'skills', 'social', 'statistics', 'tool']",NIDDK,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,K25,2014,31657,0.02163537363104761
"An Information Fusion Approach to Longitudinal Health Records     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our goal is to leverage an information fusion approach to integrate structured and unstructured information to generate a longitudinal health record (LHR) for accelerating the pace at which patients can be recruited into clinical trials. Because electronic health records (EHR) contain clinical summaries of a patient's clinical history, one would assume that they could be easily leveraged to automatically screen and identify potentially eligible patients. However most EHRs are not well designed to support screening of eligible patients and are composed of multiple data sources that are often redundant or inconsistent, stored in uncoordinated unstructured clinical narratives and structured data. These characteristics make EHRs difficult to use for matching patients against the complex event and temporal criteria of clinical trials protocols. This research proposes that an improved LHR, which contains a comprehensive clinical summary of a patient, can improve patient screening. We propose using a method of information fusion to generate this LHR, which merges information from multiple data sources, that addresses both the meaning and temporal nature of data, such that the resulting information is more accurate than would be possible if these sources were used individually.         The specific aims are to: 1) characterize the barriers of using EHR sources for screening in terms of data redundancy, inconsistency, lack of structure, and temporal imprecision; 2) automatically extract information from unstructured EHR sources necessary for screening patients against clinical trials eligibility criteria using natural language processing; 3) developan LHR appropriate for screening patients against eligibility criteria using information fusion methods based on semantic and temporal information; and 4) evaluate the accuracy of an LHR formed through information fusion for screening patients against clinical trials eligibility critera.         The respective hypotheses to be tested are: 1) Different parts of the EHR will contain variable amounts of redundancy, inconsistency, and temporal imprecision. Some sources will be more valuable for matching patients than others to clinical trials eligibility criteria. 2) Including th information contained in the unstructured notes will reduce the false positive rate of identifying potentially eligible patients over leveraging only the structured data in the EHR. 3) By using information fusion methods based on leveraging semantic and temporal information on a combination of structured and unstructured data, we will be able to accurately summarize the information contained in uncoordinated EHR data sources into an LHR that can be used for screening patients for clinical trials. 4) The use of information fusion to generate a longitudinal health record will increase the sensitivity and specificity of electronic clinical trial screening ver using a traditional EHR.         With an LHR formed through information fusion for screening patients for clinical trials eligibilit, we will be able to not only reduce the amount of staff effort required to recruit a patient into a clinical trial, but also accelerate the pace at which clinical trials can be conducted.                  Narrative This project is focused on generating a longitudinal health record for accelerating the pace at which patients can be recruited into clinical trials. Accelerating the pace at which patients are recruited into clinical trials has the potential for improving the speed at which new treatments are made available to the public.",An Information Fusion Approach to Longitudinal Health Records,8722624,R01LM011116,"['Address', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical trial protocol document', 'Complex', 'Consultations', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Electronics', 'Eligibility Determination', 'Enrollment', 'Event', 'Failure', 'Goals', 'Hour', 'Laboratories', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patients', 'Process', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Semantics', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Series', 'Source', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'TimeLine', 'Work', 'base', 'cohort', 'cost', 'design', 'falls', 'health record', 'improved', 'screening']",NLM,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2014,300537,0.06918693361346304
"Patient Medical History Representation, Extraction, and Inference from EHR Data     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The significance of developing tools for automatically harvesting temporal constraints of clinical events from Electronic Health Records (EHR) cannot be overestimated. Efficient analysis of the temporal aspects in EHR data could boost an array of clinical and translational research such as disease progression studies, decision support systems, and personalized medicine.     One big challenge we are facing is to automatically untangle and linearize the temporal constraints of clinical events embedded in highly diverse large-scale EHR data. Barriers to temporal data modeling, normalization, extraction, and reasoning have precluded the efficient use of EHR data sources for event history evaluation and trending analysis: (1) The current federally-supported EHR data normalization tools do not focus on the time aspect of unstructured data yet; (2) Existing time models focus only on structured data with absolute time, lack of supporting reasoning systems, or only offer application-specific partial solutions which cannot be adopted by the complex EHR data; (3) Current temporal information extraction approaches are either difficult to be adopted to EHR data, not scalable, or only offers application-specific partial solution.     This proposed project fills in the current gaps among ontologies, Natural Language Processing (NLP), and EHR-based clinical research for temporal data representation, normalization, extractions, and reasoning. We propose to develop novel approaches for automatic temporal data representation, normalization and reasoning for large, diverse, and heterogeneous EHR data and prepare the integrated data for further analysis. We will build new reasoning and extraction capacities on our TIMER (Temporal Information Modeling, Extracting, and Reasoning) framework to provide an end-to-end, open-source, standard-conforming software package. TIMER will be built on strong prior work by our team. We will develop new features in our CNTRO (Clinical Narrative Temporal Relation Ontology) for semantically defining the time domain and representing temporal data in complex EHR data. On top of the new developed CNTRO semantics, we will implement temporal relation reasoning capacities to automatically normalize temporal expressions, compute and infer temporal relations, and resolve ambiguities. We will leverage existing NLP tools and work on top of these tools to develop new extraction approaches to fill in the current gaps between NLP approaches and ontology-based reasoning approaches. We will adapt the SHARPn EHR data normalization pipeline and cTAKES for extracting and normalizing clinical event mentions from clinical narratives. We will explore an innovative approach for temporal relation extraction and event coreference, and make it work with the TIMER framework. We will evaluate the system using Diabetes Mellitus (DM) and colorectal cancer (CRC) patient cohorts from two insititutions. Each component will be tested separately first followed by an evaluation of the whole framework. Results such as precision, recall, and f-measure will be reported.                 Project Narrative The significance of developing capabilities for automatically harvesting temporal constraints for clinical events from Electronic Health Records (EHR) cannot be overestimated. A substantial portion of the information in the EHR is historical in nature. Patient medical history can be long, especially in complex patients. The proposed work, by offering an end-to-end open-source framework for automatically extracting, normalizing, and reasoning clinically-important time-relevant information from large-scale EHR data, can boost an array of clinical and translational research such as disease progression studies, decision support systems, and personalized medicine; as well as facilitate clinical practice for early disease detection, post-treatment care, and patient-clinician communication.","Patient Medical History Representation, Extraction, and Inference from EHR Data",8760594,R01LM011829,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Aftercare', 'Archives', 'Automated Annotation', 'Big Data', 'Cancer Patient', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Detection', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Harvest', 'Human', 'Institutes', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medical History', 'Medical Records', 'Medicine', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Ontology', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Recording of previous events', 'Registries', 'Reporting', 'Resolution', 'Semantics', 'Solutions', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translational Research', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'data modeling', 'data structure', 'information model', 'innovation', 'novel strategies', 'open source', 'programs', 'tool', 'trend']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR HOUSTON,R01,2014,398307,0.09895186513416336
"SCH: Enhancing Nurse Decision-Making via Augmented Communication Tools (ACTs)  ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Smart algorithms that effectively analyze patient care data can enhance clinical communication to save lives. In 2000, the Institute of Medicine estimated 98,000 preventable patient deaths occur annually in US hospitals due to miscommunication [1]. Electronic health records (EHRs) were expected to facilitate accurate communication within the care team and provide data to enable automated clinical decision support systems. Unfortunately, miscommunication remains a significant cause of patient deaths [2]. Providers are now required to demonstrate meaningful use of EHR systems to improve quality of care and patient outcomes. Despite this, providers continue to report that EHR systems are cumbersome and interfere with care-team communication. Information entered into an EHR is rarely used by nurses due to the time and difficulty involved in its retrieval. As a result, nurses continue to verbally convey critical patient care information to the next nurse during shift changes. Verbal report or hand-off, where critical patient information is exchanged in only minutes, is inefficient. Worse, it is highly susceptible to communication errors. Broader Impacts: Research: 1) Increase patient safety; 2) Provide preliminary data to expand this work to include physician-physician and physician-RN communication and decision-making in the EHR; 3) Share our discoveries to inform other industries who may also benefit from this technology. Education: 1) Contribute to curriculum enhancements whereby RN students learn strategies to recognize and effectively communicate CEs; 2) As part of curriculum enhancements, include healthcare applications for computer and information science students; 3) Disseminate findings via academic publications, professional meetings, a project website and social media. Mentoring: 1) Mentor budding scientists in the roles of research assistants (RAs) and post doctoral fellows studying nursing and computer science to forge collaborative interdisciplinary relationships for ongoing research; 2) Interest and recruit underrepresented students in STEM and careers in healthcare. RELEVANCE (See instructions): The electronic health record (EHR) has been thought to be a top! to decrease patient deaths related to miscommunication. However, the current EHR falls short of this goal. We propose to develop and test an algorithm that will augment the EHR to more effectively assist nurses in decision-making and communication, ultimately increasing patient safety.                 n/a",SCH: Enhancing Nurse Decision-Making via Augmented Communication Tools (ACTs) ,8894220,R01EB020395,"['Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Communication', 'Communication Tools', 'Computer Simulation', 'Conscious', 'Data', 'Data Reporting', 'Decision Making', 'Discipline of Nursing', 'Documentation', 'Education', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Electronics', 'Event', 'Fever', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Hemorrhage', 'Hospitals', 'Imagery', 'Industry', 'Information Sciences', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'Instruction', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Nurses', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Pain', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Principal Investigator', 'Provider', 'Publications', 'Quality of Care', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Retrieval', 'Role', 'STEM career', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Severities', 'Students', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Validity and Reliability', 'Work', 'computer science', 'falls', 'forging', 'high risk', 'improved', 'interest', 'light weight', 'meetings', 'patient safety', 'prototype', 'respiratory', 'social', 'usability', 'web site']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA,R01,2014,251572,0.07601341766106282
"Automated Dynamic Lists for Efficient Electronic Health Record Management DESCRIPTION (provided by APPLICANT): Medical errors are recognized as the cause of numerous deaths, and even if some are difficult to avoid, many are preventable. Computerized physician order-entry systems with decision support have been proposed to reduce this risk of medication errors, but these systems rely on structured and coded information in the electronic health record (EHR). Unfortunately, a substantial proportion of the information available in the EHR is only mentioned in narrative clinical documents. Electronic lists of problems and allergies are available in most EHRs, but they require manual management by their users, to add new problems, modify existing ones, and the removal of the ones that are irrelevant. Consequently, these electronic lists are often incomplete, inaccurate, and out of date. Clinacuity, Inc. proposes to develop a new system to automatically extract structured and coded medical problems and allergies from clinical narrative text in the EHR of patients suffering from cancer.

"Improving Quality by Maintaining Accurate Problem Lists in the EHR (IQ-MAPLE)     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  A complete patient problem list is the cornerstone of the problem-oriented medical record. It serves as a valuable tool for providers assessing a patient's clinical status and succinctly communicates this information between providers. Accurate problem lists drive clinical decision support tools that improve quality, and an accurate problem list has been associated with higher quality care. Accurate problem lists are also critical for establishing accurate phenotypes for research and supporting quality improvement; however, problem lists in electronic health records are routinely incomplete. In this study, we propose to develop and validate problem inference algorithms to identify problems potentially missing from patient problem lists, and to conduct a randomized trial of these algorithms, studying their effects on quality of care. We call our approach IQ-MAPLE. Our project has three specific aims: 1) develop problem inference algorithms for heart, lung, and blood conditions, 2) implement problem inference alerts and optimize the workflow at four sites and 3) conduct a randomized controlled trial of the problem inference alerts, measuring the acceptance rate of alerts, the direct effect on problem list completeness and, critically, downstream impact of the alerts on key clinical quality measures, including both process and outcomes across a range of heart, lung and blood conditions. If successful, IQ-MAPLE will improve problem list accuracy, which has significant downstream implications: More accurate clinical decision support: Most clinical decision support is disease-oriented and, as such, depends on an accurate problem list. When problems are missing, opportunities to provide support to the clinician are missed, and quality suffers. Better quality measurement: Quality measurement today is often inaccurate, as patients are omitted from measures due to incomplete information on their clinical problems. A more accurate problem list would, in turn, lead to more accurate quality measurement. More accurate research: Clinical, translational and even basic science and genomic research increasingly use EHR data, particularly to identify patients with disease phenotypes, generally using problem lists. When problems are missing, the accuracy of research suffers. Better patient care: Secondary benefits aside, the problem list is, fundamentally, a tool for organizing patient care and communicating among providers. A more accurate, problem list supports these goals. The IQ-MAPLE rules, and our best practices for implementing them, will be freely available, ensuring broad dissemination of these benefits.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  An accurate, complete clinical problem list the cornerstone of a problem-oriented medical record, and research shows that accurate problem lists improve healthcare quality; however, problem lists are often incomplete. In this study, we will develop and evaluate an intervention to identify gaps in problem lists for patients with heart, lung, and blood conditions. If successful, this system should improve problem list completeness and, ultimately, the quality of care delivered to patients.            ",Improving Quality by Maintaining Accurate Problem Lists in the EHR (IQ-MAPLE),8669579,R01HL122225,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Algorithms', 'Aortic Aneurysm', 'Basic Science', 'Blood', 'Caring', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Code', 'Communication', 'Congestive Heart Failure', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Documentation', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Electronics', 'Elements', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Foundations', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Sciences', 'Healthcare', 'Heart', 'Heart Diseases', 'Hematological Disease', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'Intervention', 'Journals', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical center', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Mind', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'New England', 'Nurses', 'Oregon', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Primary Health Care', 'Problem-Oriented Medical Records', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Quality of Care', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Reading', 'Registries', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Support', 'Role', 'Site', 'Solutions', 'Sorting - Cell Movement', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'United States Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services', 'Universities', 'Update', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical care', 'clinical research site', 'design', 'disease phenotype', 'electronic data', 'experience', 'health care quality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'intervention effect', 'knowledge base', 'neglect', 'patient safety', 'public health relevance', 'randomized trial', 'tool']",NHLBI,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2014,590279,0.017891700301031613
"Understanding and predicting cardiac events in HD using real-time EHRs DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of this K25 proposal is to provide Dr. Benjamin Goldstein Ph.D., M.P.H., with the necessary protected time and additional training to develop as an independent, clinical biostatistician. This proposal has two key components: (1) an innovative research plan and (2) a comprehensive training plan. It is well recognized that patients undergoing hemodialysis (HD) are at increased risk of cardiac related events which often prove fatal. While substantive research has identified risk factors for these events, little work has been performed on forecasting their occurrence. The proposed research proposes to use existing electronic health record (EHR) data available through a collaborating dialysis center, DaVita Inc, to derive such a prediction model. EHRs contain detailed information on both a patient's health history (e.g. comorbidities, medications) as well as their evolving health statu (i.e. changes in health). A particularly unique aspect of the DaVita EHR system is the availability of real-time measures of health (e.g. blood pressure, pulse) available over the course of an HD session. Through our ongoing collaboration we will have data on 10,000s of individuals each with 100s of HD sessions, presenting the opportunity to analyze millions of dialysis sessions. Within this wealth of data two particular questions will be addressed: (1) How does a patient's hemodynamics vary over the course of and across HD sessions? (2) Can we derive a predictor for the near term onset of a cardiac event? To answer question 1, sophisticated statistical methodology, referred to as functional data analysis (FDA), will be utilized. Patterns of hemodynamic measures will be compared during and across HD sessions with key features extracted. For question 2, machine learning methodology will be used to derive a prediction model for the onset of cardiac events. The final aim will be to assess the feasibility of applying such models within a clinical environment. As a Ph.D. biostatistician, Dr. Goldstein has many of the methodological and computational skills necessary to perform the proposed analyses. The proposed methods, while established, also have ample room for statistical investigation and will provide the basis for methodological research. He will be mentored by Dr. Bradley Efron, professor in the Stanford Department of Statistics, and a world recognized expert in statistical methodology. Serving as a consultant will be Drs. Trevor Hastie and John Ioannidis, fellow members of the department of statistics and experts in FDA and prediction evaluation respectively. The focus of Dr. Goldstein's training will be on developing his clinical expertise. This will be performed through a combination of didactic courses, one-on- one tutorials and clinical exposure. Dr. Wolfgang Winkelmayer, a clinical nephrologist and close collaborator of Dr. Goldstein, will supervise Dr. Goldstein's clinical knowledge development. He will be joined by Dr. Mark Hlatky, a research cardiologist, who will also provide mentorship with regards to the cardiac substance of the project. Additional consultants across the department of medicine will be used as needed. The proposed project will have a tremendous impact on Dr. Goldstein's career prospects. At the end of the 5 year period he will have begun the process of developing a research program in the analysis of EHR data. There will be ample avenues to pursue future studies, through the analysis of other predictor variables (e.g. biomarkers, psycho-social factors), outcomes (e.g. hospitalization, cost) and most importantly, implementation of the prediction models in the clinic. The clinical training period will provide him with the necessary background to succeed as a clinically-oriented biostatistician and develop as a leader in the field. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Electronic health records have become increasingly common in clinical settings but to this point have been underutilized for research purposes.

"An Information Fusion Approach to Longitudinal Health Records     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our goal is to leverage an information fusion approach to integrate structured and unstructured information to generate a longitudinal health record (LHR) for accelerating the pace at which patients can be recruited into clinical trials. Because electronic health records (EHR) contain clinical summaries of a patient's clinical history, one would assume that they could be easily leveraged to automatically screen and identify potentially eligible patients. However most EHRs are not well designed to support screening of eligible patients and are composed of multiple data sources that are often redundant or inconsistent, stored in uncoordinated unstructured clinical narratives and structured data. These characteristics make EHRs difficult to use for matching patients against the complex event and temporal criteria of clinical trials protocols. This research proposes that an improved LHR, which contains a comprehensive clinical summary of a patient, can improve patient screening. We propose using a method of information fusion to generate this LHR, which merges information from multiple data sources, that addresses both the meaning and temporal nature of data, such that the resulting information is more accurate than would be possible if these sources were used individually.         The specific aims are to: 1) characterize the barriers of using EHR sources for screening in terms of data redundancy, inconsistency, lack of structure, and temporal imprecision; 2) automatically extract information from unstructured EHR sources necessary for screening patients against clinical trials eligibility criteria using natural language processing; 3) developan LHR appropriate for screening patients against eligibility criteria using information fusion methods based on semantic and temporal information; and 4) evaluate the accuracy of an LHR formed through information fusion for screening patients against clinical trials eligibility critera.         The respective hypotheses to be tested are: 1) Different parts of the EHR will contain variable amounts of redundancy, inconsistency, and temporal imprecision. Some sources will be more valuable for matching patients than others to clinical trials eligibility criteria. 2) Including th information contained in the unstructured notes will reduce the false positive rate of identifying potentially eligible patients over leveraging only the structured data in the EHR. 3) By using information fusion methods based on leveraging semantic and temporal information on a combination of structured and unstructured data, we will be able to accurately summarize the information contained in uncoordinated EHR data sources into an LHR that can be used for screening patients for clinical trials. 4) The use of information fusion to generate a longitudinal health record will increase the sensitivity and specificity of electronic clinical trial screening ver using a traditional EHR.         With an LHR formed through information fusion for screening patients for clinical trials eligibilit, we will be able to not only reduce the amount of staff effort required to recruit a patient into a clinical trial, but also accelerate the pace at which clinical trials can be conducted.                  Narrative This project is focused on generating a longitudinal health record for accelerating the pace at which patients can be recruited into clinical trials.

"Integration of an NLP-based application to support medication management     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): An accurate and complete medication list on a patient's electronic health record (EHR) is critical to prevent prescribing and administration errors. Stage 1 of Meaningful Use requires certified EHRs to be capable of providing a user with the ability to perform medication reconciliation. However, most previous studies have taken place in the inpatient setting, while medication reconciliation in the outpatient setting is importnt and challenging. In addition, clinical notes contain critical medication information that also need to be reconciled. Our goal of this study is to develop novel methods and a system using natural language processing (NLP) and other technologies to facilitate the medication reconciliation process in the ambulatory setting. Our specific aims are to : 1) identify the requirements, use cases, work flow issues, barriers to and facilitators of using clinical notes and a NLP-based system in the medication reconciliation process; 2) design a generic system architecture and an application that integrates an NLP system and a web-based user interface within an existing medication reconciliation system; 3) pilot this study in two primary care clinics and measure the utilization, usability, performance and feasibility of the proposed methods and the tool; and 4) distribute our methods and the tool and to make them widely available to other researchers and healthcare institutions for non-commercial use.

"Contextual ASR to Support EHR Adoption    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The adoption of electronic health record (EHR) systems is a national healthcare priority. However studies show massive physician productivity drop of up to 25-40% upon transition to EHR. The majority of workflow delay is based on the need to perform manual operations to fill structured forms within the EHR, as opposed to simple unstructured narratives used in traditional written notes and transcriptions. Vanguard Medical Technologies (VMT), under NIH grant 1R43LM010750, proved feasibility for DocTalk, a real-time, speech-driven, open-source augmented, small practice encounter recording system that processes voice to text to structured medical data to EHR input, utilizing integrated automated speech recognition (ASR) and natural language processing (NLP) in the cloud. While NLP accuracy in Phase I was high, voice accuracy prior to physician review was inadequate. Fortunately, the tight integration of ASR and NLP combined with the formal structure of physician notes offers unique context based approaches to address the challenge. Current speech recognition methods use a single general-purpose medical lexicon to train a recognizer when identifying words. Medical context-specific probabilities are ignored. The four Specific Aims of this Phase I SBIR project are to: 1. Create a textual corpus for each section of a patient encounter note by processing 1 million text based narrative structured encounter notes 2. Build a family of Section-Specific Statistical Language Models (SS-SLMs) specialized in recognizing speech pertaining to each specific section of a patient encounter note, using industry standard open source statistical language modeling tools. 3. Use NLP techniques to infer patterns of language usage from text of each section, a. To detect section boundaries to be used as trigger words for invoking SS-SLMs b. To determine characteristic word distributions of each section 4. Assess improvement in accuracy per section due to use of SS-SLMs, with the goal of 50% overall reduction of errors compared to non-section-specific SLMs in the same medical dictation system.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Successful completion of this innovative proposed program of NLP-enhanced context based ASR, will provide the accuracy required to deploy an integrated, interactive, intuitive, low-cost data entry system for small practice primary care physicians. The augmented DocTalk system will enable physicians to increase usable information, avoid third-party transcription errors, and mitigate workflow delays. Increased small practice EHR adoption directly addresses national healthcare goals.              Successful completion of this innovative proposed program of NLP-enhanced context based ASR, will provide the accuracy required to deploy an integrated, interactive, intuitive, low-cost data entry system for small practice primary care physicians.

"An Information Fusion Approach to Longitudinal Health Records     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our goal is to leverage an information fusion approach to integrate structured and unstructured information to generate a longitudinal health record (LHR) for accelerating the pace at which patients can be recruited into clinical trials. Because electronic health records (EHR) contain clinical summaries of a patient's clinical history, one would assume that they could be easily leveraged to automatically screen and identify potentially eligible patients. However most EHRs are not well designed to support screening of eligible patients and are composed of multiple data sources that are often redundant or inconsistent, stored in uncoordinated unstructured clinical narratives and structured data. These characteristics make EHRs difficult to use for matching patients against the complex event and temporal criteria of clinical trials protocols. This research proposes that an improved LHR, which contains a comprehensive clinical summary of a patient, can improve patient screening. We propose using a method of information fusion to generate this LHR, which merges information from multiple data sources, that addresses both the meaning and temporal nature of data, such that the resulting information is more accurate than would be possible if these sources were used individually.         The specific aims are to: 1) characterize the barriers of using EHR sources for screening in terms of data redundancy, inconsistency, lack of structure, and temporal imprecision; 2) automatically extract information from unstructured EHR sources necessary for screening patients against clinical trials eligibility criteria using natural language processing; 3) developan LHR appropriate for screening patients against eligibility criteria using information fusion methods based on semantic and temporal information; and 4) evaluate the accuracy of an LHR formed through information fusion for screening patients against clinical trials eligibility critera.         The respective hypotheses to be tested are: 1) Different parts of the EHR will contain variable amounts of redundancy, inconsistency, and temporal imprecision. Some sources will be more valuable for matching patients than others to clinical trials eligibility criteria. 2) Including th information contained in the unstructured notes will reduce the false positive rate of identifying potentially eligible patients over leveraging only the structured data in the EHR. 3) By using information fusion methods based on leveraging semantic and temporal information on a combination of structured and unstructured data, we will be able to accurately summarize the information contained in uncoordinated EHR data sources into an LHR that can be used for screening patients for clinical trials. 4) The use of information fusion to generate a longitudinal health record will increase the sensitivity and specificity of electronic clinical trial screening ver using a traditional EHR.         With an LHR formed through information fusion for screening patients for clinical trials eligibilit, we will be able to not only reduce the amount of staff effort required to recruit a patient into a clinical trial, but also accelerate the pace at which clinical trials can be conducted.                  Narrative This project is focused on generating a longitudinal health record for accelerating the pace at which patients can be recruited into clinical trials.

"Using medical records repositories to improve the alert system design    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Rapid and accurate alerting of concerning patient events and conditions remains an important problem in clinical practice. Typical computer-based detection methods developed for this purpose rely on the use of clinical knowledge, such as expert-derived rules, that are incorporated into the monitoring and alerting systems. However, it is often time-consuming and costly to extract and codify such knowledge; hence such systems are typically built to cover only very specific conditions. In addition, it is difficult for an expert to foresee the performance of the deployed systems and their potential drawbacks, especially their false alarm rates.

"An NLP Approach to Generating Patient Record Summaries :  The long-term goal of this proposal is to enhance the manner in which physicians access, process and marshal medical information by providing them with an automatically generated, comprehensive, and up-to date summary of the information appearing in a patient record. At the point of patient care, physicians must often rapidly process a potentially overwhelming quantity of information pertaining to a patient. Failure to do so effectively may lead to provision of suboptimal care. Some electronic health record systems provide an automatically produced “cover sheet” geared to help physicians with a broad overview of a given patient, but the information is derived from the structured data fields in the patient record, ignoring the valuable narrative text entered by clinicians over time. We are building upon our prior work in summarization and natural language processing and leveraging our expertise in cognitive research studying information needs and decision making of clinicians to build a patient record summarizer that gathers information narrative (unstructured) as well as structured parts in the record. We focus on producing a summary for patients with kidney disease, as they often have a complex medical history with numerous conditions, procedures and medications. Providing a holistic, up-to-date summary of their chart would prove valuable to physicians in general and nephrologists in particular. The following three aims will be carried out: (1) conduct a formative study to determine how physicians prioritize and mentally represent relevant information when reviewing a patient chart; (2) create a set of automated methods to select salient pieces of information in the patient record and organize them into a coherent summary; and (3) evaluate the efficacy, efficiency and physician-user satisfaction associated with the use of the summarizer. A primary strength of this proposal is that we are addressing the problem of information overload, a bottleneck in the use of electronic health records, and evaluate the impact of our solution on clinicians’ actions and patients’ health outcomes. Furthermore, we propose to use novel natural language processing, knowledge-based and data mining methods to extract and organize salient information. Finally, we contribute to informatics research by extending the electronic health record functionalities to go beyond a simple documentation-entry system towards a useful reference and decision-making tool for physicians  Project Narrative We propose to design an automatically generated, comprehensive, and up-to-date summary of the information appearing in a patient record.

"Temporal Processing for Medical Discharge Summaries    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       The goals of our project are as follows:     1. Create a corpus of temporally annotated data. Under the supervision of our consultants Dr. Frank Sacks, Dr. Vincent Carey, and two Registered Nurses, we will create a gold-standard annotation of events and temporal information within patient narratives from de- identified Electronic Health Record data using the CLEF and TimeML guidelines. We will use the framework of the Brandeis Annotation Tool, a system we have designed to facilitate the quick construction of accurately annotated corpora against a specified guideline. Extensions to the current event library and lexicon with medical event references will be made during the annotation process, under the guidance of the Registered Nurses.          2. Adapt the TARSQI Toolkit (TTK) to targeted temporal properties and relations in the EHR domain. We will use the TARSQI toolkit, a robust set of temporal processing algorithms we have designed for parsing natural language text, to automatically annotate the events and temporal information in EHR data. Combined with the Brandeis AcroMed Medical Abbreviation Server and those terms introduced in part 1, we will employ the Specialist Lexicon and other medical resources to extend the toolkit capabilities for recognizing and interpreting medical event information. Algorithms for identifying events, temporal expressions, and event anchorings and orderings will be trained against the gold standard created in Aim 1, and tested against held-out data.     3. Create a cross-document temporal database of medical events. Using the recognition algorithms introduced in Aim 2, we will create a searchable, temporally ordered database of medical events such as diseases, symptoms, surgeries/interventions, and test results. Events referred to multiple times in the data will be merged using a constraint- satisfaction analysis in order to create a more coherent narrative for a single patient over multiple records.           Project Narrative It is becoming increasingly common for medical researchers to use Electronic Health Records (EHRs) as a primary source of data for researching correlations between various medical issues and concepts.

"Voice Based, Workflow Enhancing, Primary Care Medical Data Input System    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The adoption of electronic health records (EHR) in hospitals and physician offices has been widely promoted as a single solution to a wide variety of health care issues. Yet 84% of small and medium business (SMB) physician practices in the US have not adopted EHR systems. Interventional Dynamics Corporation (IDC) has conducted more than 200 primary care physician interviews, finding that the major disincentives to adoption are workflow delay and expense. The single greatest factor in the reduction of workflow speed is the data input process. IDC's proposed project has this specific aim: Utilize an innovative voice entry technique and open source code systems to develop a low-cost, automated solution to allow primary care physicians to complete a primary care note entirely during the patient examination process. The narrative speech input will be analyzed in a context-sensitive, domain-restricted manner to produce structured clinical data that can be readily integrated into standards-compliant electronic medical records. By using speech inputs that are converted directly to relevant EHR entries, physicians can increase the accuracy of their notes, eliminate third party transcription errors and avoid workflow delays. The project approach will include:    Further testing and final development of DocTalk, the IDC patent pending speech system that allows accurate natural language processing of structured medical information; Development of a proof-of-concept data system that converts physician voice input from voice to text to structured text to EHR data using domain enhanced open source code; The evaluation of the effectiveness of the proof-of-concept system against traditional EHR  input methods with the following goals: Achieve 50% or more reduction in charting time,  achieve 90% or more accuracy in output, and score greater than 4 of 5 on subjective  metrics including learnability, workflow fit, usability, and overall satisfaction. Successful completion of the proposed program will provide IDC with a viable technology platform that can immediately be useful to primary care physicians in generating structured documents for use with their current EHR platforms. Furthermore, the technology developed and refined within this program can be expanded in multiple ways.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The IDC technology is designed to circumvent the normal barriers to adoption in the SMB market and allow for quick increases in workflow and quality of patient care at a minimal price point. IDC will provide physicians who currently use pen and paper a more natural and faster way to input clinical data, eliminating time spent on hunt-and-peck keyboard entry or complicated EHR screen navigation. The system will generate structured clinical data that enables the exchange of health information, the portability of patient records, billing, data analytics (both local practice and public health), marketing, and other benefits, resulting in the reduction of overall healthcare costs.           Narrative The IDC technology is designed to circumvent the normal barriers to adoption in the SMB market and allow for quick increases in workflow and quality of patient care at a minimal price point.

"An NLP Approach to Generating Patient Record Summaries :  The long-term goal of this proposal is to enhance the manner in which physicians access, process and marshal medical information by providing them with an automatically generated, comprehensive, and up-to date summary of the information appearing in a patient record. At the point of patient care, physicians must often rapidly process a potentially overwhelming quantity of information pertaining to a patient. Failure to do so effectively may lead to provision of suboptimal care. Some electronic health record systems provide an automatically produced “cover sheet” geared to help physicians with a broad overview of a given patient, but the information is derived from the structured data fields in the patient record, ignoring the valuable narrative text entered by clinicians over time. We are building upon our prior work in summarization and natural language processing and leveraging our expertise in cognitive research studying information needs and decision making of clinicians to build a patient record summarizer that gathers information narrative (unstructured) as well as structured parts in the record. We focus on producing a summary for patients with kidney disease, as they often have a complex medical history with numerous conditions, procedures and medications. Providing a holistic, up-to-date summary of their chart would prove valuable to physicians in general and nephrologists in particular. The following three aims will be carried out: (1) conduct a formative study to determine how physicians prioritize and mentally represent relevant information when reviewing a patient chart; (2) create a set of automated methods to select salient pieces of information in the patient record and organize them into a coherent summary; and (3) evaluate the efficacy, efficiency and physician-user satisfaction associated with the use of the summarizer. A primary strength of this proposal is that we are addressing the problem of information overload, a bottleneck in the use of electronic health records, and evaluate the impact of our solution on clinicians’ actions and patients’ health outcomes. Furthermore, we propose to use novel natural language processing, knowledge-based and data mining methods to extract and organize salient information. Finally, we contribute to informatics research by extending the electronic health record functionalities to go beyond a simple documentation-entry system towards a useful reference and decision-making tool for physicians  Project Narrative We propose to design an automatically generated, comprehensive, and up-to-date summary of the information appearing in a patient record. Such a summary would enhance the manner in which both patients and their physicians access, process and marshal medical information.",An NLP Approach to Generating Patient Record Summaries,7635002,R01LM010027,"['Address', 'Allergic', 'Caring', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Decision Making', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Evaluation Studies', 'Failure', 'Goals', 'Harvest', 'Health', 'Informatics', 'Information Resources', 'Interview', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Kidney Function Tests', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Marshal', 'Medical', 'Medical History', 'Methods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Research', 'Solutions', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Text', 'Time', 'Visit', 'Work', 'data mining', 'design', 'information gathering', 'knowledge base', 'medical schools', 'meetings', 'novel', 'research study', 'satisfaction', 'stem', 'tool']",NLM,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2009,455605,0.02849946264136973
"Temporal Processing for Medical Discharge Summaries    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       The goals of our project are as follows:     1. Create a corpus of temporally annotated data. Under the supervision of our consultants Dr. Frank Sacks, Dr. Vincent Carey, and two Registered Nurses, we will create a gold-standard annotation of events and temporal information within patient narratives from de- identified Electronic Health Record data using the CLEF and TimeML guidelines. We will use the framework of the Brandeis Annotation Tool, a system we have designed to facilitate the quick construction of accurately annotated corpora against a specified guideline. Extensions to the current event library and lexicon with medical event references will be made during the annotation process, under the guidance of the Registered Nurses.          2. Adapt the TARSQI Toolkit (TTK) to targeted temporal properties and relations in the EHR domain. We will use the TARSQI toolkit, a robust set of temporal processing algorithms we have designed for parsing natural language text, to automatically annotate the events and temporal information in EHR data. Combined with the Brandeis AcroMed Medical Abbreviation Server and those terms introduced in part 1, we will employ the Specialist Lexicon and other medical resources to extend the toolkit capabilities for recognizing and interpreting medical event information. Algorithms for identifying events, temporal expressions, and event anchorings and orderings will be trained against the gold standard created in Aim 1, and tested against held-out data.     3. Create a cross-document temporal database of medical events. Using the recognition algorithms introduced in Aim 2, we will create a searchable, temporally ordered database of medical events such as diseases, symptoms, surgeries/interventions, and test results. Events referred to multiple times in the data will be merged using a constraint- satisfaction analysis in order to create a more coherent narrative for a single patient over multiple records.           Project Narrative It is becoming increasingly common for medical researchers to use Electronic Health Records (EHRs) as a primary source of data for researching correlations between various medical issues and concepts. However, EHRs typically contain unstructured text, making them difficult to mine. This research will create a database of temporal orderings from events extracted from EHR patient narratives, using algorithms previously applied to news articles.",Temporal Processing for Medical Discharge Summaries,7789943,R21LM009633,"['Abbreviations', 'Adopted', 'Algorithms', 'Authorization documentation', 'Body of uterus', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Event', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Guidelines', 'Information Resources', 'Intervention', 'Language', 'Libraries', 'Licensing', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medical History', 'Medical Libraries', 'Mining', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Patients', 'Process', 'Property', 'Records', 'Registered nurse', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resource Development', 'Resources', 'Science', 'Software Tools', 'Specialist', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Supervision', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'Vocabulary', 'acronyms', 'base', 'design', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'interest', 'lexical', 'natural language', 'news', 'open source', 'repository', 'satisfaction', 'tool']",NLM,BRANDEIS UNIVERSITY,R21,2009,177750,0.00834731178833868
"POET: Consolidated, Comprehensive Clinical Text Preprocessing    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       As electronic health records (EHRs) continue their expansion into clinical settings, there has been a corresponding increase in interest in mining the data they contain, both for research as well as for clinical decision support. Informaticists are increasingly studying ways to mine EHR textual content. This is an important trend, because there is a wealth of information contained in clinical text not represented anywhere else in the EHR. There is a low level text-as-data issue which presents a significant obstacle to the widespread use of available medical NLP systems: hand-typed clinical narratives in EHRs are usually ungrammatical; short or telegraphic in style; full of abbreviations, acronyms, and misspellings; formatted in a templated or pseudo-tabular form; and contain embedded non-text such as a list of laboratory values cut-and-pasted from elsewhere in the EHR. As we show in the Preliminary Studies Section, this makes high-level processing by popular tools like MedLEE and MetaMap effectively useless for all but a few ""clean"" document types like discharge summaries or consult reports (e.g., pathology or radiology reports). This in turn explains why there is so little published about what is certainly the preponderance of clinical texts, those that are not as well-behaved lexically and syntactically as a discharge summary.       In this application we distinguish clinical narratives (e.g., a progress note) from biomedical narratives (e.g., a PubMed abstract). We are interested in texts that arise in the clinical or research setting; texts that are composed by clinicians and researchers directly into a computer system. We propose to build and publish a tool called POET (Parsable Output Extracted from Text). POET will be designed to accept unstructured textual documents and return structured, linguistic equivalents that are, to the extent possible, parsable by higher-level NLP engines. POET will have an architecture is modular, extensible, and based on open-source platforms and sources (e.g., Java, Perl, UMLS, NegEx, the Stanford Parser, HL7 Clinical Document Architecture, caGRID, etc.). To implement POET, we will collect, program, and evaluate published as well as novel algorithms for: acronym/abbreviation resolution; spelling correction; template and pseudo-table re-writing; and removal of embedded non-text. To test POET we will use a large corpus of cross-discipline (e.g., medical, nursing, pharmacy, etc.) clinical note types, as well as the clinical research texts MedWatch reports and IRB adverse event reports. The development of POET will combine the best practices found in the literature and new research efforts as part of the project. To validate the fidelity of POET processing we plan a formal analysis of information loss and information gain pre- and post-process. To ensure broad access to the tools, POET will be released under an open-source license. Finally, we plan to assess the feasibility of offering POET as a Web service for remote processing.           Public Health Relevance This project attempts the construction of POET, a low-level preprocessing system for full text that can be used to open up large portions of the electronic health record (EHR) to high-level NLP systems.

"Using artificial intelligence to enable early identification and treatment of peripheral artery disease ABSTRACT The purpose of this award is to provide Dr. Elsie Ross, Assistant Professor of Surgery (Vascular Surgery) and Medicine (Biomedical Informatics Research) at Stanford University, the support necessary to transition her from a junior investigator into an independent surgeon-scientist in translational biomedical informatics. Dr. Ross is a vascular surgeon with an advanced degree in health services research and postdoctoral training in biomedical informatics. Her long-term goal is to combine her interdisciplinary training to develop and implement machine learning tools that will enable the delivery of precise, high-value care to patients with cardiovascular diseases. Her career development activities focus on advancing her ability to translate informatics discoveries into viable clinical tools by 1) completing didactic courses to deepen and expand her knowledge of deep learning algorithms, clinical trials and implementation science, 2) designing and conducting her first independent human subjects clinical research study evaluating the performance of machine learning technology, 3) implementing and evaluating the effects of an electronic health record (EHR)-based screening tool to identify latent vascular disease, and 4) strengthening her previous training in cost-effectiveness analysis to enable her future aim of evaluating the associated costs and utility of pro-active, automated disease screening. The candidate has convened a mentorship team that includes Dr. Nigam Shah, a biomedical informatics expert who combines machine learning, text-mining and medical ontologies to enable a learning health care system; Dr. Kenneth Mahaffey a world-expert in cardiovascular clinical trials; and Dr. Paul Heidenreich, an expert in implementation sciences with a focus on the use of EHR interventions to improve care quality for cardiovascular patients and evaluating the cost-effectiveness of new technologies. The research proposal builds on the candidate's prior work with using machine learning and EHR data to evaluate and predict cardiovascular disease outcomes. The candidate now proposes to characterize the performance of machine learning algorithms in identifying patients with peripheral artery disease (PAD) using EHR data (Aim 1), evaluate whether learned classification models perform better than traditional risk factors for identification of undiagnosed PAD in a prospective patient cohort (Aim 2), and implement an EHR-based screening tool to identify patients with undiagnosed PAD and evaluate the diagnosis and treatment effects (Aim 3). Completion of the proposed research will result in a novel, EHR-based screening tool for identification of undiagnosed vascular disease that can decrease PAD-related cardiovascular morbidity and mortality through earlier and more aggressive medical management. This research will also form the basis for an R01 application before the end of the award to conduct a multi-site randomized-controlled clinical trial to evaluate the impact of EHR- based proactive PAD screening. ! ! ! PROJECT NARRATIVE Peripheral artery disease is a prevalent yet under-diagnosed condition that can lead to limb loss, stroke, heart attacks and/or premature death. Work proposed in this grant aims to develop technology using electronic health records and machine learning algorithms to automatically identify patients with undiagnosed peripheral artery disease and recommend treatment.

"Machine Learning Approach to Identify Candidates for Epilepsy Surgery Project Summary/Abstract Despite the widespread adoption of new drug classes to treat epilepsy, approximately one third of patients do not respond to anti-epileptic medication. Patients with drug-resistant epilepsy (DRE) suffer permanent memory and cognitive impairment from uncontrolled seizures. Only 8-10% of patients with DRE obtain long-term seizure freedom. About half of patients with DRE are eligible for surgical treatment, which results in seizure freedom in 58-73% of patients. However, it is difficult to determine when patients with DRE need surgery. DRE has a complex disease course that fluctuates according to weekly and monthly patterns. Further, neurologists report that they lack the resources (i.e. time) needed to analyze and interpret large amounts of electronic health record (EHR) data to determine surgical candidacy. This results in substantial delays in treatment - 6 years in pediatrics and 20 years in adults, on average - and contributes to avoidable morbidity and mortality. Automated systems are capable of assisting clinicians in identifying candidates for epilepsy surgery two years earlier in the disease course. One such system uses natural language processing to analyze free-text neurology notes in a real-time clinical setting. This system was able to increase the rate of surgical candidate identification by 46%, but it could still be improved in two important ways. First, the system is not able to incorporate results from EEG and MRIs - the most influential factors on surgical candidacy - into its recommendations. Second, it does not utilize rich information hidden in structured EHR data that captures epilepsy disease burden. A system that fuses information from all three data sources (neurology notes, EEG and MRI reports, and structured data) would drastically improve the accuracy and impact of the model. In the proposed research, I will first develop a deep learning (DL) approach for fusing multi-modal EHR data. Specifically, I will use recent advances in deep representation learning to produce richer features from both free- text and structured data. I will represent free-text in neurology notes and EEG and MRI reports with word embedding vectors, and medication, procedure, and visit codes with medical concept vectors. I will combine disparate data sources with a deep neural network to produce high-level representations of surgical candidacy. This will enable me to estimate patients' risk of future epilepsy surgery. Second, I will establish the generalizability of this approach using a neighboring hospital's EHR data and validate the system in a clinical setting. This contribution will be significant because it will increase the number of surgical candidates identified earlier in the disease course, thereby reducing epilepsy disease sequelae. This proposal will lay the groundwork for nationwide expansion of the DL system and generate the only automated DL system designed to improve the timeliness of surgical referral rates in the adult population. Project Narrative Automating the identification of patients with epilepsy who would benefit from surgical treatment is imperative to reducing morbidity and mortality from uncontrolled seizures. This research proposal will develop and clinically validate a generalizable deep learning framework for analyzing multi-modal electronic health record data to predict epilepsy surgery candidacy. Implementing this system into clinical care is expected to reduce the time to surgery by 45%, which would prevent one epilepsy-related death for every 58 patients who receive surgery.",Machine Learning Approach to Identify Candidates for Epilepsy Surgery,10066989,F31NS115447,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Adult', 'Antiepileptic Agents', 'Area', 'Benchmarking', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Child', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Disease', 'Electroencephalography', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Epilepsy', 'Evaluation', 'Exposure to', 'Failure', 'Freedom', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Guidelines', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitals', 'Impaired cognition', 'Influentials', 'Intractable Epilepsy', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manuals', 'Medical', 'Memory impairment', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neurologic', 'Neurologist', 'Neurology', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pediatrics', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Procedures', 'Provider', 'Quality-Adjusted Life Years', 'ROC Curve', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Proposals', 'Resources', 'Savings', 'Schedule', 'Seizures', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'System', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Update', 'Validation', 'Visit', 'automated analysis', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'candidate identification', 'case control', 'clinical care', 'cohort', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'design', 'electronic structure', 'improved', 'learning classifier', 'magnetic resonance imaging/electroencephalography', 'mortality', 'multidimensional data', 'multimodality', 'novel', 'novel drug class', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'prospective test', 'structured data', 'tool', 'vector']",NINDS,CINCINNATI CHILDRENS HOSP MED CTR,F31,2020,39617,0.018541882168730567
"Resource Curation and Evaluation for EHR Note Comprehension Title: Resource Curation and Evaluation for EHR Note Comprehension The American Diabetes Association estimates that over 25.8 million Americans have diabetes.

"Deep clinical trajectory modeling to optimize accrual to cancer clinical trials PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Electronic health records (EHRs) are now ubiquitous in routine cancer care delivery. The large volumes of data that EHRs contain could constitute an important resource for research and quality improvement, but to date, EHRs have not fully realized this potential. Important clinical endpoints, such as disease histology, stage, response, progression, and burden, are often recorded in the EHR only in unstructured free-text form. Even when structured data are available, they may be recorded only at one point in time, such as diagnosis, and may not be as relevant later in a patient's dynamic disease trajectory. These barriers prevent scalable analysis of EHR data for even relatively straightforward research tasks, such as identification of a cohort of patients potentially eligible for clinical trials. Identifying patients for trials is an important challenge in cancer research, since under 5% of adults with cancer have historically enrolled in therapeutic trials. Tools are in development to better match patients to trials, but no such tools are both publicly available and capable of incorporating time- specific patient phenotypes generated using unstructured EHR data. Recent rapid innovation in deep learning techniques could provide novel solutions to these challenges. In ongoing work, I have found that natural language processing based on a neural network architecture can reliably extract clinically relevant oncologic endpoints from free-text radiology reports. My goal is to develop an independent research program focused on leveraging such methods to put the EHR to use at scale for discovery and improving cancer care delivery. My specific aims are (1) to develop and validate a clinically relevant, dynamic, pre-trained cancer trajectory model by applying deep learning to integrated structured and unstructured EHR data; (2) to apply transfer learning to a pre-trained cancer trajectory model to match patients to clinical trials using EHR data and clinical trial protocols; and (3) to pilot the incorporation of cancer trajectory modeling into an institutional clinical trial matching tool. In the near term, this work will facilitate accrual to clinical trials at our institution. During the independent research portion of the proposal, it will constitute the basis for a general framework for conducting scalable cancer research using EHR data. PROJECT NARRATIVE Electronic health records (EHRs) are now ubiquitous in routine cancer care delivery, but their utility for research and quality improvement has been limited by a dearth of methods for integrating the unstructured data in which most key cancer outcomes are encoded within EHRs. I propose to apply recent innovations in deep learning to integrate structured and unstructured data to create a dynamic pre-trained model of cancer patients' treatment trajectories, and to apply this model to identify patients who are appropriate candidates for clinical trials at times when they are eligible. I will then evaluate the effect of trajectory modeling on clinical trial accrual as I prepare for an independent research career focused on clinical cancer data science.",Deep clinical trajectory modeling to optimize accrual to cancer clinical trials,9880481,K99CA245899,"['Academia', 'Adult', 'Cancer Model', 'Cancer Patient', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical trial protocol document', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'Dana-Farber Cancer Institute', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Scientist', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Eligibility Determination', 'Enrollment', 'Goals', 'Government', 'Health Services Research', 'Health system', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Histology', 'Institution', 'Intervention', 'Label', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manuals', 'Medical Records', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Oncologist', 'Oncology', 'Outcome', 'Pathology Report', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Primary Neoplasm', 'Psychological Transfer', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Randomized', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Services', 'Site', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Systemic Therapy', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Therapeutic Trials', 'Time', 'Training', 'Work', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'cancer care', 'cancer clinical trial', 'care delivery', 'career', 'clinical candidate', 'clinical practice', 'clinical trial enrollment', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'data registry', 'deep learning', 'design', 'electronic data', 'genomic data', 'improved', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'multiple data types', 'neoplasm registry', 'neural network architecture', 'novel', 'palliative', 'patient population', 'precision medicine clinical trials', 'prevent', 'programs', 'response', 'skills', 'structural genomics', 'structured data', 'survival prediction', 'tool', 'tumor progression', 'unstructured data']",NCI,DANA-FARBER CANCER INST,K99,2020,170176,0.02552247558264311
"Development of End-To-End Clinical Decision Support Tools To Prevent Cardiotoxic Drug Response SUMMARY Drug-induced cardiac toxicity, in the form of QT prolongation and torsade de pointes, is an uncommon but devastating side effect of over one hundred currently marketed drugs. The ubiquity of drug-induced QT prolongation (diLQTS) across medical specialties and conditions creates a challenge for providers seeking to prescribe known QT-prolonging medications, particularly for non-cardiac conditions. Work by our group to develop automated clinical decision support (CDS) tools that alert providers of patient risk has shown promise towards reducing the number of prescriptions to at-risk individuals. However, these tools rely on a history of an electrocardiogram (ECG) with QT prolongation to identify at-risk patients, and thus exclude a large number of potentially at-risk individuals who have not had an ECG within our system. Through a unique institutional partnership with Google, in which a copy of our entire electronic health record (EHR) is stored on the Google Cloud Platform (GCP), we have developed preliminary deep-learning models to predict risk of diLQTS. We have also validated the genetic association with the QT interval and diLQTS across several real-world populations using an aggregate polygenic risk score. Through creation of an institutional biobank with certification for clinical application of results, as well as cloud-based integration of EHR data with genetic data, we have the capability to leverage our existing infrastructure to study the role of deep learning and genetics to reduce the risk of diLQTS. This investigation will combine our unique research and clinical infrastructure on the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus with our investigative team composed of experts in the study of pharmacogenomics and medical informatics to develop and study an end-to-end CDS tool incorporating genetics and deep learning to predict risk of diLQTS. The specific aims of this application include the following: (1) develop and test a cloud-based, deep-learning model using EHR data on in- and outpatients to predict risk of diLQTS; (2) validate genetic predictors of diLQTS using institutional biobank samples, and a multi-ethnic external population; and (3) develop and test CDS tools using these advanced methods to reduce the risk of diLQTS. We will use a common data model (Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership) mapped from EHR data, as well as a custom DNA array (Multi-Ethnic Genotyping Array) designed for imputation across a variety of non-European ancestries, to ensure that the our prediction model and findings from this study can be replicated in other institutions and populations in the future. In such a way, this investigation will not only provide insight into the use of machine learning and genetics for risk prediction of diLQTS, but it will also create a blueprint for future advanced CDS development for other conditions. PROJECT NARRATIVE The goal of this project is the development of a clinical decision support tool that can be used to predict the risk of drug-induced QT prolongation based on deep learning and genetics. This tool could be used to prevent potentially fatal side effects of medications when alternatives are available, or increase vigilance when safer alternatives are not available.

"Learning Universal Patient Representations from Clinical Text with Hierarchical Recurrent Neural Networks Project Summary In this project we develop new methods for extracting important information from electronic health records based on recurrent neural networks. These methods represent the hierarchical and sequential nature of human language, leverage large scale datasets to make learning sophisticated representations possible, and make use of novel sources of supervision that are available at this scale. The model architecture we propose is a hierarchical recurrent neural network (RNN). This architecture explicitly represents temporality at multiple different time scales, with stacked RNN layers representing words, sentences, paragraphs, and documents. At the word level, the model is trained to predict important pieces of clinical information, such as negation and temporality, using existing labeled data sets. Training for clinical information extraction at the lowest level ensures that the higher-level models have a foundation of medically relevant inputs. We are still left with the challenge of training higher-level networks, because these models require massive amounts of labeled training data to learn. We solve this problem by taking advantage of the temporal aspect of information in an EHR, and having each higher-level recurrent layer train getting supervision from the future. For example, the document RNN is trained to predict billing codes and NLP concept codes that were found in the subsequent document. This source of supervision is scalable, and our preliminary data shows that it is effective at learning how to generate generalizable patient representations. The patient representations that our model learns are shareable across multiple tasks, potentially streamlining EHR-based research by eliminating what was previously a manual step – designing text-based variables to represent patients. We demonstrate a new workflow for text-based EHR research, showing how the same representations can be used for two completely distinct phenotyping tasks. These phenotyping studies make use of high-quality datasets of patients with pulmonary hypertension and autism spectrum disorder at Boston Children’s Hospital. PH is relatively rare, so finding every patient with a phenotyping algorithm is important for clinical research. ASD has several sub-phenotypes, and finding large numbers of patients from each sub- phenotype can help to better understand the mechanisms of ASD. Along with demonstrating the applicability of our representations on these specific clinical research use cases, we incorporate our patient representations into the i2b2 clinical research software, making them available to all clinical investigators using this platform at Boston Children’s Hospital. Project Narrative This project develops methods for extracting universal patient representations from unstructured text in electronic health records. These methods leverage huge amounts of clinical data, recurrent neural network architectures, and novel training techniques to incorporate information at multiple time scales. These methods are evaluated using public datasets to promote reproducibility, and applied to clinical research tasks that extend the knowledge of patients with pulmonary hypertension and autism spectrum disorder at Boston Children’s Hospital.",Learning Universal Patient Representations from Clinical Text with Hierarchical Recurrent Neural Networks,9868326,R01LM012973,"['Architecture', 'Boston', 'Brain', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Clinical Research', 'Code', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Event', 'Face', 'Felis catus', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Human', 'Human Characteristics', 'Human Resources', 'Information Retrieval', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Israel', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Left', 'Linguistics', 'Location', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Patients', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Problem Solving', 'Process', 'Pulmonary Hypertension', 'Rare Diseases', 'Records', 'Recurrence', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Source', 'Statistical Methods', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Technics', 'Uncertainty', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'data resource', 'deep neural network', 'design', 'disease phenotype', 'large scale data', 'learning strategy', 'machine translation', 'neural network', 'neural network architecture', 'novel', 'phenotyping algorithm', 'recurrent neural network', 'relating to nervous system']",NLM,BOSTON CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2020,367184,-0.002200010797064017
"Sarcopenia: computable phenotypes and clinical outcomes. PROJECT SUMMARY  Sarcopenia is a generalized muscle condition that develops with aging and complicates many common chronic diseases, resulting in low muscle mass, weakness, and impaired physical function. Sarcopenia contributes to disability, increased hospitalizations, healthcare costs, and risk of death. Despite being under- recognized clinically, sarcopenia is a major public health concern, with the worldwide prevalence projected to increase by up to 72% in the next 30 years. However, limited knowledge of sarcopenia among clinicians, combined with time pressures in clinical encounters delay its detection, and limit opportunity for intervention or recruitment into clinical trials. To overcome this barrier to detecting sarcopenia, we propose to use advanced big data and machine learning methods to identify additional component variables predicting sarcopenia among the rich electronic health record (EHR) data and develop a validated and portable sarcopenia computable phenotype (which uses a computer algorithm to detect patient characteristics or outcomes from the EHR). This innovative proposal takes advantage of key resources at Indiana University and its affiliation with the Regenstrief Institute and the Indiana Network for Patient Care (INPC), a statewide multi-health system clinical data warehouse including >100 healthcare entities and >18 million unique patients with both coded and text-based data, combined with the ability to perform comprehensive musculoskeletal measurements in the Musculoskeletal Function Imaging and Tissue (MSK-FIT) Core funded through a NIAMS Core Center for Clinical Research grant (P30AR072581). Our long-term goal is to accurately identify patients with, or at risk for, sarcopenia and its consequences in order to provide targeted interventions. We hypothesize that by using medical informatics and machine learning innovations, computable phenotypes can identify patients with sarcopenia from the EHR, predict deficits in measured muscle strength and physical function, and prospectively predict risk of hospitalization and death. In Aim 1, we will categorize >2000 adult participants in the MSK-FIT Core with accessible EHR data, as either sarcopenic or nonsarcopenic according to measurements of muscle strength, muscle mass and physical performance. We will then use 75% of the MSK- FIT Core cohort to train machine deep learning algorithms to detect combinations of variables from these subjects’ EHR predicting whether the patient is sarcopenic or not sarcopenic. The performance of the resulting computable phenotype will then be tested in the remaining 25% of the MSK-FIT Core participants. In Aim 2, we will test the performance of the sarcopenia computable phenotype to detect a clinically meaningful phenotype in the entire INPC adult population (>18 million), by evaluating the ability to predict the rate of hospitalizations and death among patients rated as sarcopenic versus matched controls. Such a computable phenotype will then enable large scale targeted recruitment, pragmatic clinical trials, clinical evaluation and intervention.

"Learning Health System Building Blocks: Filling Gaps to Enable a Real Time Physician-AI Partnership PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Over 54% of doctors are experiencing burnout and the primary cause is documentation. Doctors spend up to two hours on clerical work for each hour of direct patient care. Documentation burden is the number one contributor to burnout, which costs the US health care system approximately $150 billion each year. Further, the largely free-text notes generated by healthcare providers are difficult to process and re-use for quality improvement and research. There is a significant opportunity to A) reduce clinicians' clerical burden via ambient data collection while B) enabling incorporation of machine learning into routine clinical care by structuring information in real-time from the patient-doctor conversation. We have built a service that saves each clinician hours per day by using remote human scribes, who we make more efficient with machine learning and natural language processing, to automatically document patient visits. The service runs on a laptop or mobile device and converts patient-clinician conversation audio to structured documentation. Our approach has already enabled the service to be priced at half the cost of a traditional in- person scribe. Finalized notes can be saved into all common electronic health record (EHR) systems via the Redox interoperability interface. We will use the human-curated audio-to-structured documentation dataset to further improve preprocessing, automating more of the scribing process, and reducing human effort over time. A time motion study and EHR click log analysis in a clinical setting demonstrated time savings of up to two hours per clinician per day. We have successfully generated documentation for over 1,700 patient visits and our dataset will double in size in 2 months. In Phase I, we address key impediments in the structure and timeliness of current EHR data, both of which can be improved with our novel system when coupled with the real-time generation of machine learning-ready inputs. In order to do so, we propose three aims: 1) extract machine learning-ready inputs from patient-doctor conversation audio; 2) extract machine learning-ready inputs from structured and unstructured EHR data; 3) further increase cost-efficiency and scale up the quality assurance process using machine learning inputs from conversation audio and historical EHR data. For Phase II we will apply our machine learning inputs to predict disease trajectory for multiple disease phenotypes with a focus on type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension. These diseases are ideal proofs-of- concept due to their high prevalence, morbidity, and inclusion in incentive programs for closing care gaps. The $6.3B in 2018 Medicare Advantage incentives supports a clear business case for leveraging machine learning to achieve value-based goals – improving patient care quality and efficiency.! PROJECT NARRATIVE PredictionHealth has built a service to reduce doctor burnout by automatically documenting patient visits by processing audio from the normal patient-doctor conversation - potentially reducing the $150 billion dollar cost of burnout on the US health system. We propose that integrating and facilitating the application of machine learning in routine clinical care can improve patient care outcomes and efficiency. The primary goal of this Phase I proposal is to further improve the service's cost-efficiency with real-time machine learning predictions based on structured inputs from the patient-doctor conversation and prepare to integrate machine learning as an integral element of each doctor's toolbox.",Learning Health System Building Blocks: Filling Gaps to Enable a Real Time Physician-AI Partnership,10009209,R43LM013215,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Benchmarking', 'Blood Pressure', 'Businesses', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Complication', 'Cost efficiency', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Documentation', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Elements', 'Ensure', 'Foundations', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health Personnel', 'Health system', 'Healthcare Systems', 'High Prevalence', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Hypertension', 'Incentives', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Medical', 'Medicare', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Price', 'Primary Health Care', 'Process', 'Quality of Care', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Rheumatoid Arthritis', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Running', 'Savings', 'Services', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'System', 'Text', 'Time', 'Time and Motion Studies', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Vision', 'Visit', 'Work', 'base', 'burnout', 'care outcomes', 'clinical care', 'clinical predictors', 'clinical risk', 'cost', 'cost effectiveness', 'direct patient care', 'disease phenotype', 'electronic structure', 'experience', 'handheld mobile device', 'improved', 'incentive program', 'insight', 'interoperability', 'laptop', 'novel', 'payment', 'phase 2 study', 'phenotyping algorithm', 'quality assurance', 'scale up', 'sex', 'social', 'treatment planning']",NLM,PREDICTION HEALTH INC.,R43,2020,222130,0.02551078019135866
"Machine Learning to Determine Dynamically Evolving New-Onset Venous Thromboembolic (VTE) Event Risk in Hospitalized Patients Failure to rescue (FTR), a nurse-sensitive national metric of health care quality, refers to death of a hospitalized patient from a treatable complication, and is potentiated by failure to recognize and appropriately respond to early signs of complications. There is a paucity of research examining patient features predictive of FTR complications. Such information could shift the current paradigm of nursing surveillance to earlier recognition, prevention and treatment of FTR complications, thereby saving lives. New-onset venous thromboembolism (VTE), an FTR complication occurring as either a deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or a pulmonary embolism (PE), is the leading cause of preventable hospital death, carrying a high risk of mortality and a national cost burden of $7 billion annually. VTE is a complex disease process involving interactions between clinical risk factors and acquired and/or inherited susceptibilities to thrombosis. Although biomarkers and clinical factors associated with VTE have been identified, clinical manifestations are subtle, presenting gradually over hours to days. Current VTE risk assessment models (RAM), the cornerstone of prevention, have limited utility due to their complexity and lack of reliability, generalizability and external validation. A critical gap in VTE risk modeling research is that while new-onset VTE pathology evolves over the course of hospitalization, no current models incorporate the progressive accrual of dynamic patient data and pattern evolution over time in their modeling approaches. The totality of routinely collected electronic health record (EHR) data is massive in terms of volume, variety, and production at a rapid velocity in real-time. Such big data could be used in machine learning (ML) analytic approaches to process time series clinical data to identify subtle, evolving feature patterns predictive of new-onset VTE and address this gap. This study proposes to assemble a large scale, multi-source, multi-dimensional VTE study dataset, and in tandem, systematically define the EHR data elements associated with a new-onset VTE diagnosis for computable phenotype algorithm development. We will then apply machine learning analytic approaches to baseline and accruing intensive time series clinical data in the curated dataset to develop models identifying data patterns and features predictive of dynamically evolving new-onset VTE in adult hospitalized patients. This proposal aligns with NINR’s strategic vision for nurse scientists to employ new strategies for collecting and analyzing complex big data sets to permit better understanding of the biological underpinnings of health, and improve ways nurses prevent and manage illness. This innovative study and individualized training plan under a strong and well- established team, represents initial steps in the applicant’s research trajectory focused on data science approaches to predict FTR complication risk, and develop, implement and test dynamic RAMs to inform targeted prevention and treatment decisions. Discovering new knowledge informing real-time decision making, nursing surveillance practices and care delivery systems can improve nurse sensitive patient outcomes. PROJECT NARRATIVE Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is the leading cause of preventable hospital death. This study first proposes to develop a reproducible computable phenotype definition for new-onset VTE cohort ascertainment from the electronic health record, and then develop dynamic models for VTE risk assessment through the application of machine learning algorithms to massive electronic health record clinical data repositories. Such models can inform the mechanisms underlying this complex disease and identify subtle pattern changes in a patient’s condition forecasting a VTE event, enabling earlier nurse identification and intervention, and decreasing the development of complications and failure to rescue in hospitalized patients.",Machine Learning to Determine Dynamically Evolving New-Onset Venous Thromboembolic (VTE) Event Risk in Hospitalized Patients,10219195,F31NR018102,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Adverse event', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Censuses', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Code', 'Cohort Studies', 'Complex', 'Complication', 'Data', 'Data Element', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Deep Vein Thrombosis', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Discipline of Nursing', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Failure', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Logic', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nurses', 'Pathology', 'Patient Triage', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Production', 'Pulmonary Embolism', 'Quality of Care', 'Readability', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Savings', 'Scientist', 'Selection for Treatments', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Series', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Source', 'Standardization', 'System', 'Testing', 'Thrombosis', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Failure', 'Validation', 'Venous', 'Vision', 'algorithm development', 'base', 'care delivery', 'classification algorithm', 'clinical data warehouse', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical risk', 'cohort', 'computable phenotypes', 'cost', 'disease phenotype', 'health care quality', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mortality risk', 'multidimensional data', 'prevent', 'venous thromboembolism']",NINR,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,F31,2020,17002,0.03699590324284152
"An Informatics Framework for Discovery and Ascertainment of Drug-Supplement Interactions PROJECT SUMMARY Most U.S. adults (68%) take dietary supplements and there is increasing evidence of drug-supplement interactions (DSIs); In recent years, there has been increasing evidence supporting the role of DSs in ADRD in preventing cognitive impairment but there is limited evidence and the sample sizes have been small. Real- world data (RWD) especially the EHR contain detailed treatment and response information from patients and could be used to detect the usage and effect of DSs, DSIs, which is more translational to clinical outcomes (e.g., MCI to ADRD conversion). To the best of our knowledge, there is no investigation on DSs usage and safety among patients in MCI and ADRD using EHR data. Our current parent award is focusing on the development of a translational informatics framework to enable the discovery of drug-supplement interactions (DSIs) by linking scientific evidence from the biomedical literature. To response to NOT-AG-20-008, this administrative supplement application will complement our parent award in multiple aspects: (1) developing novel and advanced data analytic methods for mining RWD in EHR, (2) identifying DSs usage information among patients with ADRD, and (3) detecting safety and effect of DS among patients with ADRD from existing EHR data. In our preliminary work, we have investigated the methods to identify DSs terms on EHR and developed natural language processing (NLP) methods to identify use status of DSs. We will further our efforts to collect a EHR dataset with DSs usage and AE-DSs signals from AD patients and develop innovative informatics methods to extract such information. Our specific aims are: (1) identifying DSs usage among patients with MCI and ADRD from existing EHR data; and (2) detecting the DSs safety signals and exploring the effect of DSs use on the conversion from MCI to ADRD from existing EHR data. The successful completion of this project will stimulate our further investigation on the role of DS use in patients with ADRD in a larger scale involving EHR data from other healthcare institutions. PROJECT NARRATIVE In this administrative supplement application, we will evaluate the usage and safety of dietary supplements (DSs) usage in patients with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD), respectively using electronic health records (EHR) data. We will also explore the feasibility of using EHR to detect DS effect on the conversion from MCI to ADRD. This research will address a critical and unmet need to conduct large-scale clinical research in DSs and improve evidence bases for healthcare practice. The successful accomplishment of this supplement project will deliver a novel informatics methods and generate DSI signals among patients with ADRD. This project will stimulate our further investigation on the role of DS use in patients with ADRD in a larger scale involving EHR data from other healthcare institutions.",An Informatics Framework for Discovery and Ascertainment of Drug-Supplement Interactions,10119590,R01AT009457,"['Address', 'Administrative Supplement', 'Adult', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease patient', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Award', 'Big Data', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Dementia', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Elderly', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Electronic Medical Records and Genomics Network', 'Florida', 'Future', 'Genomics', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Human', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Institution', 'Intake', 'Investigation', 'Letters', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Records', 'Research', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Sample Size', 'Signal Transduction', 'Surveys', 'Terminology', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Vascular Dementia', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'base', 'cohort', 'deep learning', 'dietary supplements', 'evidence base', 'genomic data', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'novel', 'pharmacovigilance', 'prevent', 'response', 'treatment response']",NCCIH,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,R01,2020,339298,0.0857922096915247
"Biomedical Informatics Tools for Applied Perioperative Physiology Project Summary / Abstract Even though US hospitals have widely adopted electronic health record (EHR) documentation of patient care, interoperability of these systems remains an issue, leading to challenges in data integration. In the operating room (OR) setting, during surgery, physiological waveforms (arterial pressure, EKG, SpO2, central venous pressure, etc.) represent a large source of information used by clinical monitors to extract and display information in order for healthcare providers to make clinical decisions. Integration and synchronization of high-quality EHR and physiological waveform data in large datasets of surgical patients would allow machine learning and deep learning approaches to plumb these datasets for clinically relevant signatures that would promote advanced OR patient monitoring systems to define present state, predict state trajectory, suggest effective counter measures to minimize patients decompensated states, and define the usefulness and efficacy of new monitoring devices. The objective of this proposal is to focus the resources of an interdisciplinary team from academia (University of California Los Angeles (UCLA), University of California Irvine (UCI), and Carnegie Mellon University Computer Sciences), industry (Edwards Lifesciences Critical Care), and clinical medicine (anesthesiology, surgery, and critical care at UCLA, UCI, Beth Israel, and University of Pittsburgh Medical Center) to create, develop, and organize large surgical datasets combining EHR and high fidelity physiological waveform data, to make these datasets freely accessible, and to develop new predictive/forecasting monitoring systems for the surgical patients. The study will begin with the development of a machine learning algorithm to predict cardiovascular collapse during surgery. This algorithm development will be based on physiological signatures predictive of cardiovascular collapse identified in the animal models of shock. The study hypothesis is that the combination of two separate OR databases containing EHR and physiological waveforms will allow for training and development of monitoring solutions, predictive and/or prescriptive analytics tools, clinical decision support, and validate them on an independent, external validation database. The surgical setting is relevant because although 5.7 million Americans are admitted annually to an Intensive Care Unit, more than 50 million undergo surgery. OR databases are unique in medicine because: 1) Changes occur quickly and the lead-time before an event is compressed; 2) Knowledge of baseline/pre-stress status of surgical patients allows normalization, calibration, and markedly enhances prediction; 3) Continuous and immediate presence of dense skilled acute care practitioners allows faster implementation of complex treatment algorithms in the OR; and 4) Defined stages, procedures, and stressors allow building large common relational database registries. By helping to focus the provider's attention on significant events and changes in the patient's state and by suggesting physiological interpretations of that state, such systems will permit early detection of complex problems and provide guidance on therapeutic interventions improving patient outcomes.

We hypothesize that the combination of two separate OR databases containing electronic health record and physiological waveforms will allow us and other investigators to train and develop monitoring solutions, predictive and/or prescriptive analytics tools, clinical decision support, and validate them on an independent, external validation database.

"Machine Learning of Physiological Waveforms and Electronic Health Record Data to Predict, Diagnose, and Treat Hemodynamic Instability in Surgical Patients Project Summary / Abstract If one could accurately predict who, when and why patients develop cardiorespiratory instability (CRI) during surgery, then effective preemptive treatments could be given to improve postoperative outcome and more effectively use healthcare resources. But signs of shock often occur late once organ injury is already present. The goal of this proposal is to develop, validate, and test real-time intraoperative risk prediction tools based on electronic health record (EHR) data and high-fidelity physiological waveforms to predict CRI and make the databases of intraoperative data and waveforms used for these developments freely accessible. This is extremely relevant because although 5.7 million Americans are admitted to an Intensive Care Units (ICU) in one year, more than 42 millions undergo surgery annually. Previous and ongoing studies conducted in the ICU and in the step down unit have built the architecture to collect real-time high-fidelity physiological waveform data streams and integrate them with patient demographics from the EHR to build large data sets, and derive actionable fused parameters based on machine learning (ML) analytics as well as display information in real time at the bedside to drive clinical decision support (CDS) in the critical care setting. The goal of this proposal is to apply these ML approaches to the complex and time compressed environment of high-risk surgery where greater patient and disease variability exist and shorter period of time is available to deliver truly personalized medicine approaches. The work will be initiated using an already existing annotated intraoperative database from the University of California Irvine including EHR and high-fidelity waveform data. This operating room database already exists and needs only to be extracted. This data will be used for the initial training and development of the ML model that will then be tested on prospectively collected University of California Los Angeles and University of Pittsburgh Medical Center databases. Simultaneously, this approach will use existing knowledge of CRI patterns derived from previous step down unit / intensive care unit cohorts, MIMIC II data, University of California Irvine data, and animal studies to create smart alarms and graphic user interface for clinical decision support based on functional hemodynamic monitoring principles. The next step will then leverage the focus on the issues and strengths of the intraoperative environment, some of which can be listed as: 1) Known patients characteristics before surgery to define pre-stress baseline, allowing functional hemodynamic monitoring stress evaluations, preconditioning, and other preoperative calibrations, 2) High degree of direct observation and data density during most phases of surgery allowing close semi-autonomous monitoring and titration of novel treatment algorithms early, 3) Defined stages in the initial part of surgery (induction, intubation, skin incision) allowing ML approaches to build large common relational database registries, and 4) Defined surgical procedure and stressors (anesthesia induction, intra-abdominal air insufflation, and other surgery-specific interventions), which will alter the impact of CRI on measured variables. Project Narrative The purpose of this study is to first develop multivariable models through data-driven classification techniques to predict parsimoniously cardiorespiratory instability, etiology and response to treatment in patients undergoing high-risk surgery. Using high-fidelity intraoperative physiological waveform data augmented with extensive electronic health record derived annotation and applying machine learning approaches we will characterize and quantify common patterns in subjects destined to develop cardiorespiratory instability during high-risk surgery. We will use these inputs in simulated real-time bedside management to develop an iteratively designed prototype clinical decision support system suitable for intraoperative care.","Machine Learning of Physiological Waveforms and Electronic Health Record Data to Predict, Diagnose, and Treat Hemodynamic Instability in Surgical Patients",9846016,R01HL144692,"['Acute', 'Adopted', 'Air', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Anesthesia procedures', 'Animals', 'Architecture', 'Calibration', 'California', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Research', 'Complex', 'Critical Care', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Documentation', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Homeostasis', 'Hospital Mortality', 'Hospitals', 'Hypotension', 'Insufflation', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Intervention', 'Intra-abdominal', 'Intraoperative Care', 'Intraoperative Period', 'Intubation', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Los Angeles', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical center', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Nature', 'Operating Rooms', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic Processes', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perioperative', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Postoperative Complications', 'Postoperative Period', 'Process', 'Recommendation', 'Registries', 'Resources', 'Resuscitation', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Shock', 'Signal Transduction', 'Skin', 'Specificity', 'Stress', 'Surgical incisions', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Titrations', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical care', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical risk', 'cohort', 'data integration', 'data streams', 'data structure', 'database structure', 'deep neural network', 'demographics', 'density', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'effectiveness evaluation', 'electronic data', 'graphical user interface', 'hemodynamics', 'high risk', 'improved', 'information display', 'insight', 'interoperability', 'iterative design', 'large datasets', 'machine learning algorithm', 'model development', 'mortality', 'neural network algorithm', 'novel', 'organ injury', 'patient population', 'personalized medicine', 'preconditioning', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive tools', 'pressure', 'prospective', 'prototype', 'relational database', 'response', 'simulation environment', 'stressor', 'structured data', 'support tools', 'surgical risk', 'tool', 'treatment response']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2020,648089,0.03191684761556195
"Automating Delirium Identification and Risk Prediction in Electronic Health Records Abstract. Delirium, or acute confusional state, affects 30-40% of hospitalized older adults, with the added cost of care estimated to be up to $7 billion. Although originally conceptualized as a transient disorder, delirium is now recognized to have significant consequences, including increased risk of death, functional decline, and long-term cognitive impairment. As up to 75% cases are not recognized by providers, there is an urgent need for additional methods to identify delirium for clinical and research purposes, and to stratify patients based on delirium risk. In this proposal, we present a novel approach to the identification of delirium based on large-scale data mining (i.e., pattern recognition) algorithms using machine learning and natural language processing applied to electronic health record (EHR) data, which will automate chart-based determination of delirium status and risk prediction. We will combine these algorithms with data collected through our recently implemented Virtual Acute Care for Elders (ACE) quality improvement project, which institutes delirium screening once per shift by nursing staff for all individuals over age 65 admitted to the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) Hospital. This unprece- dented volume of data will allow us to achieve the necessary sample sizes for effective training and validation of our data mining algorithms. Data mining algorithms that discover patterns of associations in data, rather than testing predetermined hypotheses, are well suited to application in large-scale algorithms for identification of delirium. Using our Virtual ACE and hospital EHR data, we will be able to evaluate more than 10,000 individual features (e.g., text words and phrases, laboratory and other diagnostic tests, concurrent medical conditions) as- sociated with delirium, which will be classified as risk factors for delirium, as signs, symptoms, and descriptors of delirium itself, and as complications and consequences of delirium, based on expert consensus. We will then use these features to develop rules for identification of delirium in the EHR, as well as risk prediction models that can be integrated into the EHR to provide individualized assessments of delirium risk. This study will lay the foundation for methods of automated delirium identification and risk prediction in healthcare settings that are unable to implement the screening by providers done in our Virtual ACE, as well as for large-scale epidemiological investigations of delirium using EHR data, expanding the current armamentarium for studying this common and debilitating disorder. Project Narrative. Delirium, or acute confusional state, affects up to 7 million hospitalized older adults annu- ally and is associated with long-term declines in cognition and function, but is not recognized by providers in up to 75% of cases. The growth of electronic health records offers a unique opportunity to improve recognition of delir- ium, as methods for identifying delirium based on chart review by clinicians have been developed but are time- and resource-intensive. In this secondary data analysis, we will examine methods for automating delirium recog- nition and risk prediction in electronic health records using machine learning and natural language processing computer algorithms, which in turn will lead to improved care for this serious but often overlooked disorder.",Automating Delirium Identification and Risk Prediction in Electronic Health Records,9873880,R01AG060993,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Agreement', 'Alabama', 'Algorithms', 'Ally', 'Assessment tool', 'Automation', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Computational algorithm', 'Confusion', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Delirium', 'Descriptor', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Discipline of Nursing', 'Disease', 'Elderly', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Epidemiology', 'Foundations', 'Growth', 'Health system', 'Hospitals', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Inpatients', 'Institutes', 'Institutionalization', 'Laboratories', 'Link', 'Logistics', 'Long-Term Care for Elderly', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurable', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nurses', 'Nursing Staff', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Persons', 'Prevention', 'Property', 'Provider', 'ROC Curve', 'Reference Standards', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'acute care', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'care costs', 'confusion assessment method', 'data mining', 'epidemiology study', 'functional decline', 'functional disability', 'health care settings', 'high dimensionality', 'human old age (65+)', 'improved', 'instrument', 'interest', 'large scale data', 'model development', 'mortality risk', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'patient stratification', 'phrases', 'prediction algorithm', 'programs', 'risk prediction model', 'screening', 'validation studies', 'virtual', 'ward']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,R01,2020,376860,0.05782096460657616
"Data-driven shared decision-making to reduce symptom burden in atrial fibrillation PROJECT SUMMARY Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common cardiac arrhythmia with symptoms that directly impair health-related quality of life (HRQoL). While catheter ablation is routinely performed to reduce AF symptoms and improve HRQoL, we lack evidence about which symptoms are likely to improve and for which patients. Ablations themselves may cause complications that lead to lower HRQoL. Shared decision-making (SDM) is a widely encouraged practice to navigate such complex choices by aligning treatment benefits and risks with the patient's stated values. However, no SDM interventions have focused explicitly on AF symptoms due to a lack of rigorous evidence about post-ablation symptom patterns and the decision aids necessary to communicate those findings. In this K99/R00 application, we propose to use data from electronic health records (EHRs) to characterize post-ablation symptom patterns, and display them in decision-aid visualizations to support personalized SDM about the best treatment modalities for an individual's patient's AF symptoms. In the K99 phase, we will use natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML) to extract and analyze symptom data from narrative notes in EHRs. We will also employ a rigorous, user-centered design protocol created during my postdoctoral work to develop decision-aid visualizations. In the R00 phase, we will conduct a feasibility study in which the interactive decision-aid visualizations are introduced during consultations about ablation in clinical electrophysiology practices. Our specific aims are: (1) identify common symptom patterns in patients with paroxysmal AF post-catheter ablation (n>32,014); (2) develop and evaluate decision-aid visualizations of common AF symptom patterns (n=50); and (3) evaluate the feasibility of implementing the decision-aid visualizations in clinical practice (n=75). The training objectives of this project include mastering competencies in NLP, ML, human-computer interaction, symptom science, and implementation science. The long-term training goal is to assist Dr. Reading Turchioe to become a faculty member with an independent program of research. She seeks to lead an interdisciplinary team of scientists and clinicians committed to improving symptom management and HRQoL for individuals living with AF and other chronic cardiovascular conditions, with an eye towards health equity. To ensure success for the planned research and training activities, a multidisciplinary team of mentors with complementary expertise, established, well-funded programs of research, and a record of mentoring high-quality trainees will advise her. Moreover, this research will be conducted in a world-class academic medical center with exceptional resources for building and implementing technology and data science methods using EHR data. The proposed research is both significant and innovative: NLP and ML methods to extract EHR data for decision-aid visualizations are a novel approach to SDM in the understudied area of AF symptoms. Together, these techniques promise to enhance HRQoL for other AF treatment modalities (e.g. medications, lifestyle changes) and other chronic cardiovascular conditions. ! ! PROJECT NARRATIVE Our research has public health significance because atrial fibrillation is the most common cardiac arrhythmia and expected to double in prevalence in the next decade as the population ages. “Real-world evidence” from electronic health record data displayed in personalized decision-aid visualizations can enable patients and providers to choose together the optimal treatments for symptom reduction. Our proposal addresses NINR's key areas of “Symptom Science: Promoting Personalized Health Strategies” and “Promoting Innovation: Technology to Improve Health” by leveraging innovative technologies to deliver personalized interventions that reduce symptom burden and improve quality of life for individuals with chronic conditions. !",Data-driven shared decision-making to reduce symptom burden in atrial fibrillation,9953270,K99NR019124,"['Ablation', 'Academic Medical Centers', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Area', 'Arrhythmia', 'Atrial Fibrillation', 'Award', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Cardiac ablation', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Competence', 'Complex', 'Consultations', 'Data', 'Data Display', 'Data Reporting', 'Data Science', 'Decision Aid', 'Devices', 'Dyspnea', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Enabling Factors', 'Ensure', 'Eye', 'Faculty', 'Fatigue', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Healthcare', 'Impaired health', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life Style', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Mobile Health Application', 'Modality', 'Monitor', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nursing Informatics', 'Outcome', 'Palpitations', 'Patient Outcomes Assessments', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predisposing Factor', 'Prevalence', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Reading', 'Reinforcing Factor', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Site', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Validation', 'Visualization', 'Work', 'associated symptom', 'biomedical informatics', 'career', 'clinical practice', 'common symptom', 'comorbidity', 'computer human interaction', 'data visualization', 'electronic data', 'experience', 'health equity', 'health related quality of life', 'implementation science', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'innovation', 'innovative technologies', 'insight', 'instrument', 'mHealth', 'machine learning method', 'member', 'minimally invasive', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel strategies', 'optimal treatments', 'personalized decision', 'personalized intervention', 'pre-doctoral', 'programs', 'reduce symptoms', 'shared decision making', 'statistics', 'success', 'symptom management', 'symptom science', 'symptomatic improvement', 'treatment risk', 'user centered design']",NINR,WEILL MEDICAL COLL OF CORNELL UNIV,K99,2020,87632,0.020107432675447838
"Statistical Methods for Incorporating Machine Learning Tools in Inference and Large-Scale Surveillance using Electronic Medical Records Data SUMMARY The modernization and standardization of clinical care information systems is creating large networks of linked electronic health records (EHR) that capture key treatments and select patient outcomes for millions of patients throughout the country. The observational data emerging from these systems provide an unparalleled opportunity to learn about the effectiveness of existing and novel treatments, and to monitor potential safety issues that may arise when interventions are used in broad patient populations. However, observational clinical data have exposures that are driven by many factors and therefore aggressive adjustment is needed to remove as much confounding bias as possible in order to make attribution regarding select exposures. The field of machine learning provides a powerful collection of data-driven approaches for performing flexible, thorough confounding adjustment, but performing reliable statistical inference is particularly challenging when these techniques are used as part of the analytic strategy. We propose to advance reproducible research methods by developing and illustrating novel targeted learning tools that leverage the flexibility of machine learning methods to detect and characterize health effect signals using large-scale EHR data. Specifically, we will first develop techniques for making efficient, statistically valid and robust inference for treatment effects using state-of-the-art machine learning tools. We will also develop online learning techniques to make such inference in the context of streaming EHR data. Methodological advances will enable us to formulate a formal, rigorous and practical framework for conducting continuous, effective and reliable surveillance for safety endpoints. Finally, we will develop statistical approaches for incorporating prior information -- including demographic, epidemiologic or pharmacodynamic knowledge, for example -- to improve health effect estimation and inference when the health outcome of interest is rare and the statistical problem is thus difficult, as often occurs in safety surveillance. The ultimate goal of the proposed research is to enable biomedical researchers and public health regulators to carefully monitor and protect the health of the public by allowing them to more effectively and more reliably detect critical health effect signals that may be contained in population-scale EHR data. PROJECT NARRATIVE The modernization and standardization of clinical care information systems is creating large networks of linked electronic medical records that capture key treatments and select patient outcomes for millions of U.S. subjects. The population scale of contemporary health care data is opening new opportunities for quickly learning from observational data, and is now supporting on-going national surveillance that will monitor the risks and benefits of both existing and novel treatment paths. The objective of this proposal is to provide an inferential framework that leverages the flexibility of machine learning methods to detect health effect signals, including in the important setting of high-dimensional confounders and/or rare events, and to develop a real-time sequential updating methodology for safety signal detection.",Statistical Methods for Incorporating Machine Learning Tools in Inference and Large-Scale Surveillance using Electronic Medical Records Data,9979940,R01HL137808,"['Algorithms', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical Data', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Confidence Intervals', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Dimensions', 'E-learning', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Epidemiology', 'Estimation Techniques', 'Event', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Heterogeneity', 'Information Systems', 'Infrastructure', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pharmacodynamics', 'Population', 'Population Surveillance', 'Procedures', 'Public Health', 'Records', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Safety', 'Sentinel', 'Signal Transduction', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stream', 'Structural Models', 'Subgroup', 'Surveillance Program', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Treatment outcome', 'Update', 'base', 'clinical care', 'comparative treatment', 'data streams', 'flexibility', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'interest', 'machine learning method', 'national surveillance', 'novel', 'open source', 'patient population', 'patient subsets', 'risk minimization', 'software development', 'surveillance data', 'tool', 'treatment effect', 'user-friendly']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2020,485987,0.019017719821389206
"Multi-objective representation learning methods for interpetable predictions of patient outcomesusing electronic health records Project Summary/Abstract This project proposes new methods for representing data in electronic health records (EHR) to improve pre- dictive modeling and interpretation of patient outcomes. EHR data offer a promising opportunity for advancing the understanding of how clinical decisions and patient conditions interact over time to inﬂuence patient health. However, EHR data are difﬁcult to use for predictive modeling due to the various data types they contain (con- tinuous, categorical, text, etc.), their longitudinal nature, the high amount of non-random missingness for certain measurements, and other concerns. Furthermore, patient outcomes often have heterogenous causes and re- quire information to be synthesized from several clinical lab measures and patient visits. The core challenge at hand is overcoming the mismatch between data representations in the EHR and the assumptions underly- ing commonly used statistical and machine learning (ML) methods. To this end, this project proposes novel wrapper-based methods for learning informative features from EHR data. Both methods propose specialized operators to handle sequential data, time delays, and variable interactions, and have the capacity to discover underlying clinical rules/decisions that affect patient outcomes. Importantly, both methods also produce archives of possible models that represent the best trade-offs between complexity and accuracy, which assists in model interpretation. These method advances are made possible by encoding a rich set of data operations as nodes in a directed acyclic graph, and optimizing the graph structures using multi-objective optimization. The central hypothesis of this research is that multi-objective optimization can learn effective data representations from the EHR to produce accurate, explanatory models of patient outcomes. Preliminary work has shown that these methods can effectively learn low-order data representations that improve the predictive ability of several state- of-the-art ML methods. This technique demonstrates good scaling properties with high-dimensional biomedical data. Aim 1 (K99) is to develop a multi-objective feature engineering method that pairs with existing ML methods to iteratively improve their performance by constructing new features from the raw data and using feedback from the trained model to guide feature construction. In Aim 2 (K99), this method is applied to form predictive models of the risk of heart disease and heart failure using longitudinal EHR data. The resultant models will be inter- preted with the help of mentors in order to translate predictions into clinical recommendations. For Aim 3 (R00), a second method is proposed that uses a similar framework to optimize existing neural network approaches in order to simplify their structure as much as possible while maintaining accuracy. The goal of Aim 4 (R00) is to identify hospital patients who are at risk of readmission and propose point-of-care strategies to mitigate that risk. This goal is facilitated through the application of the proposed methods to patient data collected from the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, the Geisinger Health System, and publicly available EHR databases. Project Narrative  Understanding how clinical decisions interact with a patient's health and environmental over time to inﬂuence patient outcomes is central to the goals of enhancing health, reducing illness and improving quality of life.

"Advancing Chronic Condition Symptom Cluster Science Through Use of Electronic Health Records and Data Science Techniques Despite their adverse impact on patient quality of life and healthcare utilization and costs, symptom clusters (SCs) in common adult chronic conditions such as cancer, heart failure (HF), type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are understudied and poorly understood. The lack of access to real world, longitudinal patient symptom data sets and inability to adequately model the complexity of SCs has greatly limited research. Based on our previous work, we propose that these gaps can be addressed in an innovative way using electronic health records (EHRs) and data science techniques. Our overall objective is to develop, apply and refine, and implement an optimized data processing and analysis pipeline for the characterization of SCs in common adult chronic conditions for use with EHR data. We hypothesize that a core set of SCs is shared among all common adult chronic conditions and that distinct SCs characterize specific conditions and/or treatments. The long term training goal of this project is to assist Dr. Koleck in becoming an independent investigator conducting a program of research dedicated to mitigating symptom burden in patients with chronic conditions through use of informatics and omics (e.g., genomics and proteomics), the focus of her pre-doctoral work. Using exceptional resources available from Columbia University, the K99 phase of this project will focus on the development of a rigorous pipeline; essential competencies in SC analysis and interpretation; and the data science techniques of clinical data mining, natural language processing, machine learning, and data visualization. In the R00 phase, Dr. Koleck will independently implement the pipeline in another medical center to determine the reproducibility of identified SCs and begin to explore clinical predictors (e.g., socio-demographics, laboratory results, and medications) of SCs. The specific aims are to 1) develop a data-driven pipeline for the characterization of SCs from EHRs using a cohort of adult patients diagnosed with cancer, as SCs have been most systematically characterized in this condition; 2) apply the pipeline to three other common adult chronic conditions that share biological and behavioral risk factors with cancer, i.e., HF, T2DM, and COPD, and evaluate SCs in these conditions; and 3) determine if SCs differ for cancer, HF, T2DM, and COPD when implementing the pipeline within another medical center and explore clinically relevant, EHR- documented predictors of identified SCs. To accomplish research aims and training goals, an interdisciplinary team of scientists with expertise in symptom science, biomedical informatics, data science, pertinent clinical domains, and career development mentorship has been assembled. This research is significant because a pipeline that accommodates the format in which symptom data is already being documented in EHRs has the potential to greatly accelerate the acquisition of SC knowledge and expedite clinical translation of symptom mitigation strategies. Given the array of new competencies to be developed, this K99/R00 award is necessary for achieving the candidate’s career goal of advancing chronic condition symptom science. The proposed research is relevant to public health because adult patients diagnosed with chronic conditions are frequently burdened by two or more co-occurring, related symptoms. Development of an optimized process to study multiple symptoms collected in patient electronic health records has the potential to lead to new knowledge and improved symptom management. The proposed research addresses the NINR theme of “symptom science” and a key area in the NINR Strategic Plan, “taking advantage of innovations in data science in order to develop interventions to promote health and wellness that are leading-edge, effective, and translatable to clinical practice.”",Advancing Chronic Condition Symptom Cluster Science Through Use of Electronic Health Records and Data Science Techniques,10118580,R00NR017651,"['18 year old', 'Academic Medical Centers', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Advance Directives', 'American', 'Anxiety', 'Area', 'Award', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical assessments', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Code', 'Competence', 'Complement', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Depressed mood', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dyspnea', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Equipment and supply inventories', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Fatigue', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Promotion', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heart failure', 'Impaired cognition', 'Informatics', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Knowledge acquisition', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mastectomy', 'Medical Genetics', 'Medical center', 'Mentorship', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nausea', 'Nausea and Vomiting', 'Neurobehavioral Manifestations', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Oncology', 'Pain', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Postoperative Nausea and Vomiting', 'Procedures', 'Proteomics', 'Pruritus', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Race', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk Factors', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Sleep disturbances', 'Strategic Planning', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Woman', 'Work', 'Xerostomia', 'base', 'biomarker discovery', 'biomedical informatics', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical data warehouse', 'clinical practice', 'clinical predictors', 'clinical translation', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'computerized data processing', 'data analysis pipeline', 'data mining', 'data visualization', 'data warehouse', 'electronic data', 'experience', 'health care service utilization', 'health data', 'innovation', 'knowledge translation', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'patient oriented', 'pre-doctoral', 'process optimization', 'programs', 'sociodemographics', 'statistics', 'symptom cluster', 'symptom management', 'symptom science', 'symptomatic improvement', 'unsupervised learning']",NINR,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R00,2020,248966,-0.005243027332134091
"Developing scalable algorithms to incorporate unstructured electronic health records for causal inference based on real-world data Project Summary/Abstract The routine operation of the US Healthcare system produces an abundance of electronically-stored data that captures the care of patients as it is provided in settings outside of controlled research environments. The potential for utilizing these data to inform future treatment choices and improve patient care and outcomes of all patients in the very system that generates the data is widely acknowledged. Given these key properties of the routine-care data and the abundance of electronic healthcare databases covering millions of patients, it is critical to strengthen the rigor of analyses of such data. Our group has previously developed an analytic approach to reduce bias when analyzing routine-care databases, which has proven effective in more than 50 empirical research studies across a range of topics and data sources. However, this approach currently cannot incorporate free-text information that is recorded in electronic health records, such as clinical notes and reports. This limitation has left a large amount of rich patient information underutilized for clinical research. We thus aim to adapt and refine a set of established computerized natural language processing algorithms that can identify and extract useful information from the clinical notes and reports in electronic health records and incorporate them into our validated analytical approach for balancing background risks of different comparison groups, a key step to ensure fair evaluation when comparing different therapeutic options. To test this newly integrated and augmented approach, we will implement and adapt it in simulation studies where we can evaluate and improve the performance of these new analytic methods in a controlled but realistic fashion. In addition, we will assess the performance of our new approach in 8 practical studies comparing medical or surgical treatments that are highly relevant to patients. To ensure highest level of data completeness and quality, we have linked multiple healthcare utilization (claims) databases, spanning from 2007 to 2016, with 3 electronic health records systems, including one each in Massachusetts, North Carolina, and Texas. This data will allow testing of our newly integrated approach in a variety of care delivery systems and data environments, which will be very informative for the application of our products in the real-world settings. Narrative The project will yield a highly flexible and effective analytical method for reducing confounding bias in studies that utilize routine-care data to compare effects of medical or surgical treatments. This method will enable researchers to leverage a large amount of patient information recorded in the clinical notes and reports that are contained within electronic health records to adjust for differences in background risks of different comparison groups. Our proposal can improve the quality of evidence based on electronic healthcare data generated in the routine-care settings to better inform patient care and optimal prescribing.",Developing scalable algorithms to incorporate unstructured electronic health records for causal inference based on real-world data,9970594,R01LM013204,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Code', 'Cohort Studies', 'Comparative Effectiveness Research', 'Complex', 'Confounding Factors (Epidemiology)', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Elements', 'Empirical Research', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Equilibrium', 'Evaluation', 'Future', 'Gold', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Influentials', 'Knowledge', 'Knowledge acquisition', 'Left', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Massachusetts', 'Medical', 'Medicare/Medicaid', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Names', 'Natural Language Processing', 'North Carolina', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Probability', 'Property', 'Proxy', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Semantics', 'Severities', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Stratification', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Texas', 'Text', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment outcome', 'Validation', 'Weight', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'base', 'care delivery', 'care outcomes', 'comparative effectiveness', 'comparison group', 'computerized', 'cost', 'disorder risk', 'evidence base', 'flexibility', 'health care service utilization', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'machine learning method', 'novel strategies', 'operation', 'outcome forecast', 'preservation', 'randomized trial', 'research study', 'routine care', 'safety study', 'simulation', 'sound', 'structured data', 'tool', 'treatment choice', 'unstructured data']",NLM,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2020,469927,0.03617535453041011
"Bridging the Gap between Genomics and Clinical Outcomes in CHD PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The NHLBI has invested extensively in the Pediatric Cardiac Genomics Consortium (PCGC), recognizing that translating genomic discoveries into optimized management and therapeutic strategies for congenital heart disease (CHD) can only be achieved in the context of multi-center, collaborative research. Currently, the PCGC is lacking two fundamental capabilities that hinder its ability to define the genomic basis for CHD outcomes: (1) a robust mechanism for extracting pertinent, machine-readable clinical data from Electronic Health Records (EHRs) across multiple institutions; and (2) a robust Artificial Intelligence (AI) platform that is capable of teasing apart the complex interplay between maternal factors, phenotypes, genotypes, gene functions and clinical outcomes. Here, we propose innovative solutions to these challenges, by assembling teams of content experts to leverage existing infrastructure to extract relevant outcomes directly from the EHR of participating PCGC Centers and by designing best-practice AI tools for outcomes research. Our principal goal is provide the vision, infrastructure and expertise to collaboratively empower CHD outcomes research, foster knowledge exchange, and train the next generation of genomic scientists. We propose to leverage existing data infrastructure to obtain Electronic Health Records (EHR) and other clinical variables at scale by partnering with other research networks to create a PCGC Data Resource. Using this resource, we will create and deploy a platform of Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based predictors for CHD outcomes research, with the goal of translating genomic discoveries into improved management and therapeutic strategies for CHD.

"eMERGE IV Northwest: A partnership to evaluate the use of genomic information in the health care of diverse participants Project Abstract eMERGE IV (E4) proposes to investigate the implementation of 15 “genomic risk assessment” (GRA) scores in a network-wide set of diverse participants. These GRAs will include polygenic risk score (PRS) information, as well as risk information, such as personal and family health history, environmental and social health determinants, and physical and lab measures. The GRA will aggregate these factors into a single score to identify those who would benefit from screening and other interventions. Substantial challenges must be addressed before genomic medicine is a part of standard medical care. We will collaborate to refine multi-ancestry GRAs and support the inclusion of non-genetic risk factors extracted from the electronic health record with innovative natural language processing approaches and apply them in a cohort enriched for Asian ancestry, and sexual and gender minorities. The specific aims of our proposal are designed to use an implementation science approach to advance the integration of genomic data into clinical practice, including evaluation of patient perspectives and economic outcomes, and broadening the impact of eMERGE through collaborations. The University of Washington Medicine dedication to preventative health in a learning health system and broad expertise across genomics, statistical, ethical, informatic, implementation, outcomes and economic disciplines will support this multi-site clinical trial. Specific Aims: Aim 1: Refine GRA scores and outcomes measures for five high impact conditions, considering stakeholder input, for implementation in the electronic health record. The conditions are: colorectal cancer, breast cancer, osteoporosis, coronary artery disease, and glaucoma. Aim 2: Integrate 15 GRA scores and electronic clinical decision support for management into clinical care and the EHR and capture clinical outcomes. Aim 3: Evaluate the implementation, effectiveness, and economic utility of GRA result return.

"Discovering and Applying Knowledge in Clinical Databases PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT The long-term goal of our ongoing project, “Discovering and applying knowledge in clinical databases,” is to learn from data in the electronic health record (EHR) and to apply that knowledge to understand and improve health. The EHR, because of its broad capture of human health, greatly amplifies our ability to carry out observational research, opening the possibility of covering emerging problems, diverse populations, rare diseases, and chronic diseases in long-term longitudinal studies. Unfortunately, the strength of EHR data—its breadth and flexible nature—imposes additional challenges. We have found that the biggest challenge comes from the inaccuracy, incompleteness, complexity, and resulting bias inherent in the recording of the health care process. We previously showed that health care process bias exists to the extent, for example, that simple use of the data can create signals implying the opposite of what we know to be true. One of the most important factors is sparse, irregular sampling; we found that sampling bias can be reduced by reparameterizing time and that prediction techniques that can accommodate EHR-specific data and resist their biases like data assimilation can be used on EHR data to produce good estimates of glucose and HA1c. The previous cycle of this project produced 75 publications. We propose to develop methods to accommodate health care process bias, using both knowledge engineering and experience with health care process bias as well as advanced statistical techniques that employ dynamical models and latent variables. We hypothesize that heuristics and models combined with knowledge can improve our ability to generate inferences and learn phenotypes despite health care process bias. Our aims are as follows: (1) Taking a knowledge engineering approach, study the effect of preprocessing and analytic choices on reducing health care process bias, and using machine learning techniques, learn more about health care process bias. (2) Taking a more empirical approach, use dynamic latent factor modeling and variation inference to accommodate health care process bias, learning how a patient's health state and health processes affect censoring, exploiting information from many variables at once. (3) Use data assimilation and mechanistic models to learn otherwise unmeasurable physiologic phenotypes despite irregular, sparse sampling typical of electronic health records. (4) Use the developed models and generated phenotypes to answer clinical questions, and disseminate the results. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project studies the biases that health care processes bring to electronic health record data, and it develops methods to overcome those biases to improve reuse of the data for purposes such as clinical research and quality improvement.",Discovering and Applying Knowledge in Clinical Databases,9873996,R01LM006910,"['Active Learning', 'Adopted', 'Adverse drug effect', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Assimilations', 'Award', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Reporting', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Engineering', 'Functional disorder', 'Generations', 'Glucose', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Human', 'Insulin', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Nature', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Nonlinear Dynamics', 'Observational Study', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Process', 'Publications', 'Rare Diseases', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Biases', 'Signal Transduction', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Work', 'abstracting', 'clinical database', 'data reuse', 'deep learning', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'heuristics', 'improved', 'novel', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling']",NLM,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2020,582678,0.019532375174496734
"Investigating the documentation of E-cigarette use in the VA EHR PROJECT SUMMARY Electronic cigarettes were developed in China in the early 2000s and first introduced to the US market in 2007. Once established in the US, the product experienced explosive growth, with the number of electronic cigarette users doubling every year between 2008 and 2012. In 2012, it was estimated that 75% of US adults had heard of electronic cigarettes, and 8% had tried them. While electronic cigarettes have been studied over the last sev- eral years, no scientific consensus has emerged regarding either the safety of electronic cigarettes, or their po- tential as a smoking cessation aid. With this proposal, we will investigate how electronic cigarette use is documented in the Veterans Association Electronic Health Record, focusing specifically on the relationship between electronic cigarette use and com- bustible tobacco use, with the goal of understanding both how electronic cigarette use is documented in the context of the United States’ only nationwide health system, and how electronic cigarette related information can be reliably extracted from narrative clinical text using fully automated Natural Language Processing meth- ods. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research focuses on the use of Natural Language Processing methods to automatically extract mentions of electronic cigarette use from the Veterans Association Electronic Health Record. The research will provide insight into important, currently unresolved questions regarding how clinicians record electronic cigarette use in the context of a nationwide health system, and whether patients report the use of electronic cigarettes as a smoking cessation aid or use the devices in conjunction with combustible tobacco.",Investigating the documentation of E-cigarette use in the VA EHR,9852435,R03DA047577,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Area', 'China', 'Cities', 'Clinical', 'Consensus', 'Dangerousness', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Documentation', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Electronic Nicotine Delivery Systems', 'Electronic cigarette', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Evaluation', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Government', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Health system', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hearing', 'Individual', 'Methods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Professional Organizations', 'Public Health', 'Public Health Applications Research', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'Scheme', 'Smoking', 'Sodium Chloride', 'Source', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Tobacco', 'Tobacco use', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Utah', 'Variant', 'Veterans', 'Work', 'authority', 'electronic cigarette use', 'electronic cigarette user', 'electronic hookah', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'information model', 'innovation', 'insight', 'smoking cessation', 'structured data', 'success', 'systems research', 'tobacco control', 'tool', 'vape pens']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,R03,2020,76250,0.040860575835530405
"Deriving high-quality evidence from national healthcare databases to improve suicidality detection and treatment outcomes in PTSD and TBI PROJECT SUMMARY Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) has complex profiles of co-occurring medical conditions (comorbidities) and is associated with high risk of suicide, particularly among Veterans, in which it is a leading cause of death. There is a critical lack of advancement in PTSD pharmacotherapy, as illustrated by increased use of off-label medications and polypharmacy (multiple drugs used simultaneously). The consequent limited evidence on the relative risks and benefits of treatments creates a crisis in PTSD management. Moreover, PTSD and its major comorbidities [traumatic brain injury (TBI) and suicidality] often remain undocumented in electronic health records (EHR). There is also poor predictability of disease outcomes since there are frequent changes in pharmacological treatment and multiple modifying comorbidities. Our long-term goal is to improve diagnostics, secondary/tertiary prevention, and treatment outcomes of PTSD and its comorbidities via enhanced EHR utilization. To achieve our objectives, we will analyze EHR and administrative claims data from Veterans Administration (VA) and non-VA databases, collectively covering >2M PTSD and >2M TBI patients. Specifically, we aim to: (1) Identify undetected PTSD, TBI, and self-harm from EHRs (using machine learning with and without natural language language processing) to guide health service improvements. (2) Predict PTSD clinical course in the VA population through novel modeling of disease trajectories that account for time-varying treatments and biases (3) Compare the effectiveness of PTSD psychotropic monotherapies, polypharmacy, and psychotherapy to guide the choice of treatment for improved patient outcomes. By enhancing and validating a machine learning approach developed by our team, we will impute unrecorded PTSD, TBI, and self-harm from both datasets, and characterize factors associated with documentation disparities. We will model diseases trajectories with enhanced latent class analysis, focusing on self-harm, substance misuse, and psychiatric hospitalization in PTSD. With Local Control methodology innovations, we will compare the risk of PTSD in veterans with and without comorbid TBI. Finally, we will perform the largest comparative effectiveness studies (to date) of PTSD treatments on >100 monotherapy and polypharmacy regimens plus psychotherapy interventions. These studies will provide high-quality evidence on the risk of hospitalizations, substance misuse, and suicidal acts/self-harm. Successful completion of these investigations will improve the quality of decision making for providers and patients, and guide improved service delivery to the population of veterans and non-veterans with PTSD/TBI, and/or high risk of suicide. PROJECT NARRATIVE Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and its associated conditions (e.g., traumatic brain injury and suicidality) are often underdiagnosed, and have outcomes that are difficult to predict. Treatment of PTSD often involves frequent treatment changes with multi-drug regimens (polypharmacy) and off-label medications for which the relative risks and benefits are largely unknown. To address these problems, we will develop and apply methods to identify undiagnosed patients, predict disease trajectories, and compare the effectiveness of all common PTSD treatments using health records from millions of patients in Veterans Administration (VA) and non-VA databases.",Deriving high-quality evidence from national healthcare databases to improve suicidality detection and treatment outcomes in PTSD and TBI,10088135,R56MH120826,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Caring', 'Cause of Death', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Disease Outcome', 'Disease Progression', 'Disease model', 'Documentation', 'Drug Combinations', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Event', 'Fostering', 'General Population', 'Glean', 'Goals', 'Health Services', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitalization', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Label', 'Longterm Follow-up', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Mental Illness', 'Maps', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentally Ill Persons', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Military Personnel', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacological Treatment', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phenotype', 'Polypharmacy', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Provider', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychotherapy', 'Regimen', 'Relative Risks', 'Reporting', 'Research Design', 'Residual state', 'Risk', 'Risk Estimate', 'Safety', 'Secondary Prevention', 'Self-Injurious Behavior', 'Source', 'Suicide', 'Symptoms', 'Time', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States Department of Veterans Affairs', 'Veterans', 'analysis pipeline', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'comparative', 'comparative effectiveness study', 'compare effectiveness', 'data modeling', 'effective therapy', 'experience', 'health record', 'high risk', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'language processing', 'multiple drug use', 'natural language', 'novel', 'off-label drug', 'outcome forecast', 'prevent', 'psychosocial', 'service delivery', 'sociodemographic factors', 'stress related disorder', 'substance misuse', 'suicidal act', 'suicidal risk', 'tertiary prevention', 'therapy design', 'time use', 'treatment choice', 'treatment comparison']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF NEW MEXICO HEALTH SCIS CTR,R56,2020,776198,-0.023916107064014546
"From enrichment to insights Project Summary Most medical decisions are made without the support of rigorous evidence in large part due to the cost and complexity of performing randomized trials for most clinical situations. In practice, clinicians must use their judgement, informed by their own and the collective experience of their colleagues. The advent of the electronic health record (EHR) enables the modern practitioner to algorithmically check the records of thousands or millions of patients to rapidly find similar cases and compare outcomes. In addition to filling the inferential gap in actionable evidence, these kinds of analyses avoid issues of ethics, practicality, and generalizability that plague randomized clinical trials (RCTs). Unfortunately, identifying patients with the appropriate phenotypes, properly leveraging available data to adjust results, and matching similar patients to reduce confounding remain critical challenges in every study that uses EHR data. Overcoming these challenges to improve the accuracy of observational studies conducted with EHR data is of paramount importance. Studies using EHR data begin by defining a set of patients with specific phenotypes, analogous to amassing a cohort for a clinical trial. This process of electronic phenotyping, is typically done via a set of rules defined by experts. Machine learning approaches are increasingly used to complement consensus definitions created by experts and we propose several advances to validate and improve this practice. We will explore and quantify the effects of feature engineering choices to transform the diagnoses, procedures, medications, laboratory tests and clinical notes in the EHR into a computable feature matrix. Finally, building on recent advances, we plan to characterize the performance of existing methods and develop EHR-specific strategies for patient matching. Our work is significant because we will take on three challenging problems--electronic phenotyping, feature engineering, and patient matching--that stand in the way of generating insights via EHR data. If we are successful, we will significantly advance our ability to generate insights from the large amounts of health data that are routinely generated as a byproduct of clinical processes. Narrative The advent of the electronic health record (EHR) enables the search of thousands or millions of patients to rapidly find similar cases and compare outcomes. We will develop methods for feature engineering, electronic phenotyping and patient matching from real-world EHR data. If we are successful, we will significantly advance our ability to generate insights from the large amounts of health data that are routinely generated as a byproduct of clinical processes.",From enrichment to insights,10000216,R01LM011369,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Complement', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Element', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Engineering', 'Ethics', 'Evaluation', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health system', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Institution', 'Judgment', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Observational Study', 'Ontology', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Plague', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Records', 'Resources', 'Scheme', 'Source', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Work', 'base', 'cohort', 'cost', 'electronic data', 'experience', 'health data', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'large datasets', 'machine learning algorithm', 'novel', 'portability', 'randomized trial', 'simulation', 'treatment effect', 'vector']",NLM,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,643304,0.11175525423047901
"Biases introduced by filtering electronic health records for patients with ""complete data"" PROJECT SUMMARY Nationwide adoption of electronic health records (EHRs) has led to the increasing availability of large clinical datasets. With statistical modeling and machine learning, these datasets have been be used in a wide range of applications, including diagnosis, decision support, cost reduction, and personalized medicine. However, because the same patient could be treated at multiple health care institutions, data from only a single EHR might not contain the complete medical history for that patient, with critical events potentially missing. A common approach to addressing this problem is to apply data checks that filter the EHR for patients whose data appear to be more “complete”. Examples of filters include requiring at least one visit per year or ensuring that age, sex, and race are all recorded. However, in a previous study using EHR data from seven institutions, we showed that these filters can greatly reduce the sample size and introduce unexpected biases by selecting sicker patients who seek care more often and changing the demographics of the resulting cohorts. This project extends this prior research by implementing an expanded set of data completeness filters and testing their accuracy and potential biases using a combination of national claims data and EHR data from dozens of hospitals and healthcare centers across the country. This will enable us to understand how data completeness varies in different EHRs and quantify the tradeoffs of different approaches to correcting for gaps in patients' records. First, we will develop and measure the accuracy of data completeness filters using national claims data. This provides a “gold standard” of longitudinal data where patients' complete medical histories are known during the periods in which they were enrolled in the insurance plan. After partitioning the data by provider groups to model gaps in EHR data, we will test how well data completeness filters, individually and in combined machine learning models, select patients with fewer gaps. We will then test whether the filters introduce biases by selecting sicker patients (more diagnoses, more visits, etc.) or changing their demographic characteristics (age, sex, and zip code). Then, we will test the filters on EHR data, first at a single large medical center, and then across a national network of 57 institutions, representing different geographic regions, patient populations, number of years of data, and types of health care facilities. We will evaluate the filters by measuring whether they improve the performance of a machine learning model for predicting hospital admissions. Our ultimate goals are to (a) help researchers balance the need for complete data with the biases this might introduce to their models and (b) help them predict how well models trained on one EHR dataset might work on other EHRs with different data completeness profiles.

However, because the same patient could be treated at multiple health care institutions, data from only a single EHR might not contain the complete medical history for that patient, with critical events potentially missing.

"Health Information Technology for Surveillance of Health Care-Associated Infections PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Health care-associated infections (HAIs) affect one in every 20 hospitalized patients and account for $10 billion dollars in potentially preventable health care expenditures annually. Current efforts at detection of HAIs are limited to manual chart review which hinders the generalizability and scalability of HAI detection. My goal in seeking a Mentored Clinical Scientist Career Development Award is to acquire the necessary training, practical experience, and knowledge to develop a health services research career as a principal investigator focusing on leveraging novel health information technology (HIT) tools to improve the measurement of surgical health care quality, safety, and effectiveness. To continue my progress towards this goal, the objective of this project is to address the challenges of HAI detection by developing a robust and portable automated HAI surveillance toolkit. This toolkit will combine structured electronic health record (EHR) data with rich information locked in clinical notes using machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) to identify HAIs after surgical procedures. Our overall hypothesis is that combining structured variables from the EHR supplemented with NLP will improve our ability to identify HAIs after surgical procedures. To test the central hypothesis and accomplish the objectives for this application, I will pursue the following three specific aims: 1) Determine the EHR data elements indicative of postoperative HAIs and evaluate the performance of a novel HAI surveillance algorithm; 2) Identify the presence of postoperative SSIs from clinical notes using an automated portable NLP-based algorithm; 3) Apply user-centered design to create a high fidelity prototype of a surgical quality dashboard incorporating our HAI case detection methodology. This contribution is a significant first step in a continuum of research that utilizes the large amounts of data in the EHR combined with novel HIT methods to improve the measurement of surgical health-care quality, safety, and effectiveness. This approach is significant because the tools developed in this proposal have potential to serve as a prototype for identification and monitoring hospitals adverse events and could be replicated on a national scale. The proposed research is innovative in its approach using a combination of structured and unstructured data in the EHR along with novel machine learning and NLP tools to create a generalizable surveillance toolkit for the detection of HAIs. This proposal is responsive to the AHRQ Special Emphasis Notice (NOT-HS-13-011) specifically addressing the use of HIT to improve quality measurement. I have assembled a mentoring team who all internationally recognized experts with long and successful track records of funding and trainee mentorship. This project will provide the means to place me on a trajectory towards a health services research career focused on improving the measurement of surgical health-care quality, safety, and effectiveness using novel HIT tools. In summary, my previous training and experience, innovative research plan, high-quality training plan, first-rate mentorship team, and supportive research environment give me the highest likelihood of success to research independence with the proposed K08 award.

"Clinical Text Automatic De-Identification to Support Large Scale Data Reuse and Sharing The adoption of Electronic Health Record (EHR) systems is growing at a fast pace in the U.S., and this growth results in very large quantities of patient clinical data becoming available in electronic format with tremendous potential but an equally large concern for patient confidentiality breaches. Secondary use of clinical data is essential to fulfill the potential for high quality healthcare, improved healthcare management, and effective clinical research. NIH expects that larger research projects share their research data in a way that protects the confidentiality of research subjects. De-identification of patient data has been proposed as a solution to both facilitate secondary use of clinical data and protect patient data confidentiality. The majority of clinical data found in the EHR is represented as narrative text clinical notes, and de-identification of clinical text is a tedious and costly manual endeavor. Automated approaches based on Natural Language Processing have been implemented and evaluated, allowing for higher accuracy and much faster de- identification than manual approaches. Clinacuity, Inc. proposes to advance a text de-identification system from a prototype to an accurate, adaptable, and robust system, integrated into the research infrastructure at our implementation and testing site (Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, SC), and ready for commercialization efforts. To accomplish this undertaking, we will focus on the following specific aims and related objectives, while continuing to prepare the commercialization of the integrated system, with detailed market analysis, commercial roadmap development, and modern media communication: 1) Enhance the text de-identification system performance, scalability, and quality to produce an enterprise-grade solution ready for deployment; 2) Enable use of structured data for enhanced text de-identification (when structured PII is available) and for complete patient records de-identification (i.e., records combining structured and unstructured data). This aim also includes implementing “one-way” pseudo-identifier cryptographic hashing to enable securely linking already de-identified patient records; 3) Integrate the text de-identification system with a research data capture and management system. This includes implementation of the de-identification system as a secure web service, with standards-based access and integration. This de-identification system has potential commercial applications in clinical research and in healthcare settings. It will improve access to richer, more detailed, and more accurate clinical data (in clinical text) for clinical researchers. It will ease research data sharing (as expected for larger NIH-funded research projects) and help healthcare organizations protect patient data confidentiality. Significant time-savings will also be offered, with a process at least 200-1000 times faster than manual de-identification.

"Enhance Arthroplasty Research through Electronic Health Records and Nlp-Enabled Informatics ABSTRACT Total joint arthroplasty (TJA) is the most common and fastest growing surgical procedure in the nation. Despite the high procedure volume, the evidence base for TJA procedures and associated interventions are limited. This is mainly due to lack of high quality data sources and the logistical difficulties associated with manually extracting TJA information from the unstructured text of the Electronic Health Records (EHR). Meanwhile, the rapid adoption of EHR and the advances in health information technology offer the potential to transform unstructured EHR notes into structured, codified format that can then be analyzed and shared with local and national arthroplasty registries and other agencies. We therefore propose to leverage unique data resources and natural language processing (NLP) technologies to build an informatics infrastructure for automated EHR data extraction and analysis. We will (1) develop a high performance, externally validated and user centric NLP- enabled algorithm for extraction of complex TJA-specific data elements from the structured and unstructured text of the EHR, (2) validate the algorithm externally in multiple EHR platforms and hospital settings, and (3) conduct a demonstration project focused on prediction of prosthetic joint infections using data elements collected by the NLP-enabled algorithm. Our overarching goal is to develop valid, open source and portable NLP-enabled data collection and risk prediction tools and disseminate them widely to hospitals participating in regional and national TJA registries. This research is significant as it leverages strong data resources and expertise to tackle the pressing need for high quality data and accurate prediction models in TJA. Automated data collection and processing capabilities will lead to an upsurge in secondary use of EHR to advance scientific knowledge on TJA risk factors, healthcare quality and patient outcomes. Accurate prediction of high risk patients for prosthetic joint infections will guide prevention and treatment decisions resulting in significant health benefits to TJA patients. The research is innovative because TJA-specific bioinformatics technology will shift TJA research from current under-powered, single-center studies to large, multi-center registry-based observational studies and clinical trials. Our deliverables have the potential to exert a sustained downstream effect on future TJA research, practice and policy. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Lack of high quality data is a critical barrier to progress in total joint arthroplasty (TJA) research. We will utilize health information technology to automate extraction of rich TJA information from the electronic health records, and develop a robust risk prediction score for prosthetic joint infections, a devastating and yet preventable complication of TJA. Widespread adoption of these tools will enhance data collection capabilities and enable affordable large scale studies for practice improvements through secondary use of real-world data. Accurate prediction of post- operative infection risk among TJA candidates will guide individualized preventive strategies for modifiable risk factors, thereby reducing the burden of prosthetic joint infections in TJA patients.",Enhance Arthroplasty Research through Electronic Health Records and Nlp-Enabled Informatics,9880374,R01AR073147,"['Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Bioinformatics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complex', 'Complication', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Element', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Documentation', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Epidemic', 'Evidence based practice', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Guide prevention', 'Health Benefit', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Institution', 'Intervention', 'Joint Prosthesis', 'Knowledge', 'Logistics', 'Manuals', 'Marketing', 'Medicare', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Observational Study', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Policies', 'Postoperative Period', 'Prevention', 'Prevention strategy', 'Procedures', 'Provider', 'Publishing', 'Registries', 'Replacement Arthroplasty', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Safety', 'Scientific Advances and Accomplishments', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'United States', 'age group', 'base', 'computerized data processing', 'cost', 'data access', 'data resource', 'electronic data', 'electronic structure', 'epidemiology study', 'evidence base', 'health care quality', 'health information technology', 'high risk', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'infection risk', 'informatics infrastructure', 'informatics tool', 'innovation', 'joint infection', 'modifiable risk', 'novel', 'open source', 'outcome prediction', 'patient population', 'portability', 'pragmatic trial', 'predictive modeling', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'risk prediction model', 'structured data', 'surgery outcome', 'tool', 'willingness']",NIAMS,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,R01,2020,592632,0.08330302154269341
"Advancing Cancer Pharmacoepidemiology Research Through EHRs and Informatics DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of cancer pharmacoepidemiology is to identify adverse and/or long-term effects of chemotherapeutic agents and determine the impact of drugs on cancer risk, prevention, and response to treatments. Pharmacoepidemiology studies exert strong influence on defining optimal treatments and accelerating translational research. Therefore, it is imperative for these to be done efficiently and leveraging real-world patient data such as electronic health records (EHR). Massive clinical data from EHRs are being tapped into for research in disease-gene associations, comparative effectiveness and clinical outcomes. There is however paucity in pharmacoepidemiological studies using comprehensive EHR data due to the inherent challenges that exist for data abstraction, handling and analysis. The hurdles include heterogeneity of reports, embedding of detailed clinical information in narrative text, differing EHR platforms across different sites and missing data to name a few. In this study, we propose to integrate and extend preexisting tools to build an informatics infrastructure for EHR data extraction, interpretation, management and analysis to advance cancer pharmacoepidemiology research. We will leverage existing tools of natural language processing (NLP), standardized ontologies and clinical data management systems to extract and manipulate EHR data for cancer pharmacoepidemiological research. To achieve our goal we propose four specific aims. In aim 1, we intend to develop a high-performance, user- centric information extraction framework with advanced features such as active learning (to reduce annotation cost), domain adaptation (to transfer data across multiple sites) and user-friendly interfaces (for non-technical end users). In aim 2, we plan to improve data harmonization across differing platforms, develop components for seamless data export as well as expand methodologies to address impediments inherent to EHR-based data (such as the missing data problem). In aim 3, we will conduct demonstration projects of cancer pharmacoepidemiology including pharmacovigilance and pharmacogenomics of chemotherapeutic agents to evaluate, refine and validate the broad uses of our tools. Finally in aim 4, we propose to disseminate the methods and tools developed in this project to the cancer research and pharmacoepidemiology communities. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In this project, we propose to integrate and extend previously developed tools to build an informatics infrastructure for electronic health records (EHR) data extraction, interpretation, management, and analysis, to advance cancer pharmacoepidemiology research.

"Interdisciplinary Infrastructure for Aging Research: Rochester Epidemiology Project PROJECT SUMMARY The National Institutes on Aging (NIA) has recommended strengthening research infrastructures to address future aging research questions (2016 Data Infrastructure Review Committee Report and PAR-16-367). In particular, they recommend: 1) integrating biological data into larger population-based studies; 2) increasing use of electronic health record (EHR) data and linking to medical care claims data; and 3) developing new approaches to collecting data to answer important scientific questions about mechanisms of aging. The Rochester Epidemiology Project (REP; NIA R01 AG034676) is a unique infrastructure for studies of aging, because the REP collects longitudinal EHR data on all health conditions that come to medical attention for a large, Midwestern population. Therefore, the REP allows investigators to study all age-related diseases and outcomes. However, the REP has three significant gaps. First, the REP does not include biospecimens. Second, the REP is missing health care delivered outside of the health care institutions that partner with the REP, and it does not include information on filled prescriptions. Third, a significant proportion of EHR data is difficult to access due to two factors: 1) the full text of the EHRs includes extensive clinical notes about aging outcomes and geriatric syndromes, but these notes are not routinely coded for billing, and can only be accessed through laborious manual review; and 2) the REP health care partners use three different EHR systems, making it difficult to apply electronic data extraction tools across all partners. To address these three gaps, we will develop an interdisciplinary collaboration across experts in aging research, epidemiologic methods, biobanking, and medical informatics to create a new, comprehensive research infrastructure (“Bio-REP”) to support aging research. In the R21 phase, we will develop a comprehensive research infrastructure that combines the REP data with Mayo Clinic Biobank biospecimens, medical claims data from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS; Aim 1), and geriatric syndrome data that are included in the unstructured EHR clinical notes using Natural Language Processing techniques (NLP; Aim 2). In the R33 phase, we will deploy NLP algorithms developed in Aim 2 in the clinical notes from two additional EHR systems (Aim 3), and we will conduct two demonstration projects. First, we will measure associations between novel aging-related biomarkers and aging-related outcomes (Aim 4). Second, we will determine whether two common medications that are hypothesized to impact aging (metformin and angiotensin receptor blockers) modify associations between aging biomarkers and aging outcomes (Aim 5). The new, robust Bio-REP infrastructure will support a wide range of efficient, cost-effective observational studies to characterize associations between aging-related biomarkers and specific diseases, geriatric syndromes, and drug utilization. Such studies are urgently needed to design effective clinical trials to improve the health span of the aging population.

"5/6 COMpAAAS U24: Resource in Informatics and Biostatistics (RIB) The overall aim of the NIAAA-funded Consortium to improve OutcoMes in hiv/Aids, Alcohol, Aging, & multi- Substance use (COMpAAAS) is to build and disseminate the evidence needed to optimize care for HIV+ experiencing medical harm from alcohol and related substance use, through coordinated, integrated, and externally validated observational, operations research modeling, and intervention studies. Combining and integrating the complimentary expertise of informatics, biostatistics and epidemiology, we propose a U24 Resource for Informatics and Biostatistics (RIB) to support and inform the other COMpAAAS components. This resource will address the complex challenges required to maximize power and minimize bias in analyses addressing consortium-wide questions. Advanced informatics methods supported include natural language processing (NLP), ontologies, database and clinical decision support, and application of vital data management tools for secure data collection, storage, annotation, retrieval, and integration. Advanced epidemiological and statistical methods include time-updated exposure techniques, multiple imputation, propensity score techniques, measurement error correction, and competing risks regression. Routine, but essential, statistical methods include Cox proportional hazards, logistic and linear regression, goodness of fit diagnostics, and agreement/accuracy metrics (kappa, sensitivity, specificity, etc.). The RIB will further leverage the observational and interventional studies, simulation models, and well-coordinated network of cores and workgroups of COMpAAAS with advanced informatics and biostatistical techniques tailored to the particular challenges of large scale, longitudinal data from multiple sources including electronic health records (EHR), clinical interventions, patient self-report, and tissue repositories. Our specific aims are to provide 1) statistical and 2) informatics expertise for COMpAAAS to maximize scientific impact. To accomplish this, we will enhance the design, recruitment, and follow-up of intervention studies, support appropriate design and execution of data analyses and cross cohort collaborations, provide advanced statistical methods plus estimates of alcohol patterns for OR modeling and identify sexual/gender minority populations (CHAMP) from VACS survey data. In addition we will enhance the Consortium Web-Based Laboratory (WBL Portal) informatics infrastructure to support ongoing research design, data collection and management, development and testing of interventions such as clinical decision support and eHealth tools and enhance support for the analysis of textual data.

"Discovering and Applying Knowledge in Clinical Databases PROJECT SUMMARY The long-term goal of our parent project, “Discovering and applying knowledge in clinical databases,” is to learn from data in the electronic health record (EHR) and to apply that knowledge to understand and improve health. Its first two aims are as follows: (1) Taking a knowledge engineering approach, study the effect of preprocessing and analytic choices on reducing health care process bias, and using machine learning techniques, learn more about health care process bias. (2) Taking a more empirical approach, use dynamic latent factor modeling and variation inference to accommodate health care process bias, learning how a patient's health state and health processes affect censoring, exploiting information from many variables at once. For this supplement, we plan to focus on COVID-19. The emergence of the virus SARS-CoV-2 and its corresponding disease, COVID-19, has led to about 100,000 deaths in the US and great economic loss and human suffering. Carrying out randomized clinical trials to assess treatment is essential but stymied by the difficulty recruiting sufficient patients and the urgency of the question. Clinical databases are beginning to fill with COVID-19 patients, but the acuity and severity of the disease make drawing causal conclusion much more difficult, resulting in a literature filled with conflicting observational studies. We propose to employ structural causal modeling in the study of COVID-19, engaging expertise in such modeling. We will use the Columbia University Irving Medical Center's clinical data warehouse with over 6000 testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 and the Observational Health Data Science and Informatics (OHDSI) network, which includes most COVID-19 patients in Korea, Spain, the US Veterans Administration, Stanford, Tufts, and new sites coming on board. PROJECT NARRATIVE COVID-19 has had a giant impact on society and understanding the risks and finding effective treatments is essential.

Bhavsar, PhD, an Assistant Professor of Medicine at the Duke University School of Medicine. Dr. Bhavsar is a chronic disease epidemiologist who has performed multidisciplinary studies in the epidemiology of CVD, chronic kidney disease and cancer. He is passionate about pursuing a career in clinical research at the intersection of epidemiology, informatics, and biostatistics. At the end of the award period, Dr. Bhavsar will be an independent investigator applying knowledge gained through this K01 to develop large scale EHR-based population studies that identify individuals at high risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD) events. Through training in data linkage, machine learning, and causal inference, he will apply missing data methods to conduct rigorous non-randomized studies to improve health. The topical areas of the proposed training and research are diabetes and incident CVD events in the application of data linkage, machine learning, and causal inference. Career development aim: Obtain transdisciplinary competencies within informatics, biostatistics, and population sciences to investigate methodological challenges inherent in the use of multi-health system EHR data for clinical research. The training approach will leverage didactic and experiential training complemented by analyses of data derived from a multi-health system, multi-state research collaborative. Study population: Patients who received care at one of the North Carolina or South Carolina “Carolinas Collaborative” institutions (Duke University Medical Center, UNC-CH Health System, Wake Forest Baptist Health Center, and 9 additional health systems collaborating within the Health Sciences of South Carolina institutions). Specific aims: This proposal will identify approaches to account for missing data when patients seek care across multiple health systems but EHR data is only available from a single health system. Estimating the systemic bias introduced by missing data for single institution studies and identifying methods for accounting for missing data biases may improve the ability of EHR data to be used for clinical research. Anticipated results: Through this NHLBI K01 Research Scientist Career Development Award, Dr. Bhavsar will acquire essential training and research experience to develop large scale EHR-based population studies in CVD. PROJECT NARRATIVE Data from the electronic health records (EHR) are increasingly being used for clinical research, yet there is limited information on the best approaches to address the methodological limitations of the EHR, such as missing data. In patients with diabetes at risk of cardiovascular disease events, I will examine the impact that missing data has on the ability to use the EHR for clinical research and develop approaches to address the biases resulting from missing data.",Addressing Bias from Missing Data in EHR Based Studies of CVD,9994001,K01HL140146,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Accounting', 'Address', 'Area', 'Award', 'Baptist Church', 'Biometry', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Caring', 'Chronic Disease', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Clinical Research', 'Cohort Studies', 'Competence', 'Complement', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Element', 'Data Linkages', 'Data Pooling', 'Data Science', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Epidemiologist', 'Epidemiology', 'Event', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Sciences', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitalization', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Institution', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Legal', 'Machine Learning', 'Medicine', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'North Carolina', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Population Sciences', 'Population Study', 'Privacy', 'Publishing', 'Renal carcinoma', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Priority', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Scientist', 'South Carolina', 'Stroke', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Work', 'base', 'cardiovascular disorder epidemiology', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'cardiovascular health', 'care seeking', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical care', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'data quality', 'distributed data', 'electronic data', 'epidemiologic data', 'epidemiology study', 'experience', 'forest', 'high risk', 'improved', 'medical schools', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'patient population', 'population health', 'practical application', 'professor', 'randomized trial', 'skills', 'study population']",NHLBI,DUKE UNIVERSITY,K01,2020,165444,0.07273390813880805
"Integrating EHR and Genomics to Predict Multiple Sclerosis Drug Response PROJECT SUMMARY The growing expansion of the approved multiple sclerosis (MS) disease-modifying treatments (DMTs) and the variable responses to MS treatment have created an unmet medical need to provide individually tailored therapy. Efforts to bring precision medicine to provide individualized MS treatment selection have been impeded by our limited understanding of the factors that determine treatment response. While genomics hold the promise for closing this knowledge gap, the insufficient number of patients with detailed treatment response data and the modest effect size of genetic variants that influence treatment responses are the main limiting factors in pharmacogenomics studies. As electronic health records (EHR) become widely adopted and increasingly standardized and as we implement sophisticated computational and statistical methods to harness the EHR data, EHR systems can become cost-effective platforms to perform large-scale treatment response studies in real-life settings. Our team with a history of productive collaborations and diverse expertise (led by PI Dr. Xia) previously developed robust algorithms to identify 5,495 MS patients from the Partners HealthCare EHR systems and then model MS disease activity in these patients using EHR data. The Partners EHR system contains longitudinal clinical information on thousands of MS patients from two large academic medical centers and is linked to a well-characterized MS patient research registry and biobanks with existing genomics data. For the proposed study, we will test the hypothesis that meaningful phenotypes of MS disease activity can be extracted from EHR data to inform treatment response, and that additional common genetic variants exist in the population and can predict therapeutic response in MS when combined with clinical features derived from EHR data. The proposed study has three aims with the overall goal to produce a computational and analytic approach capable of identifying MS disease activity in relation to treatment history using EHR data and integrate with genomics profile to develop a predictive model of therapeutic response to commonly prescribed DMTs in this cohort of 5,495 MS patients, including injectable (interferon-β, glatiramer acetate) and oral (fingolimod, dimethyl fumarate) options. Specifically, we will (1) leverage narrative electronic health records data (e.g., clinical notes, radiology reports) and natural language processing (NLP) to ascertain individualized response to DMTs (n=600 for each DMT); (2) Identify clinical features from electronic health record data (e.g., diagnoses, exposures) that predict response to DMTs using a systematic phenome-wide approach; (3) Develop and test a comprehensive predictive model of individualized response to DMTs that incorporates clinical and genetic predictors. This research has the potential impact to be transformative by contributing to a major knowledge gap regarding the factors that influence treatment response and bringing precision medicine closer to individualized MS treatment selection. PROJECT NARRATIVE AND PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic neurological condition that affects over 400,000 individuals in the United States and creates a high socioeconomic burden as a leading cause of neurological disability in young adults. Because not all patients respond the same way to a specific medication, physicians and MS patients often lose precious time searching for effective treatment with serially testing of costly medications. An individually tailored treatment can ensure early start of effective medication that can prevent relapse and progression of disability. Ultimately, this project will help gain insights into the factors that determine treatment response and enable physicians to match an individual MS patient's clinical and genomic profile with uniquely tailored therapy to maximize effectiveness, delay disease progression and reduce overall cost.",Integrating EHR and Genomics to Predict Multiple Sclerosis Drug Response,9963407,R01NS098023,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Adopted', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Biology', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Computing Methodologies', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Fumarates', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Injectable', 'Interferon-beta', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Link', 'Longitudinal prospective study', 'Manuals', 'Medical', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neurologic', 'Neurologist', 'Oral', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacogenomics', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Recording of previous events', 'Registries', 'Relapse', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Selection for Treatments', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Methods', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'TimeLine', 'Treatment Cost', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States', 'Variant', 'biobank', 'clinical predictors', 'cohort', 'copolymer 1', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'disability', 'effective therapy', 'experience', 'genetic predictors', 'genetic variant', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'genomic profiles', 'individual response', 'individualized medicine', 'insight', 'multiple sclerosis patient', 'multiple sclerosis treatment', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'patient response', 'phenome', 'portability', 'precision medicine', 'predicting response', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'socioeconomics', 'treatment group', 'treatment response', 'young adult']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2020,340616,0.07686752110648665
"SCH: INT Re-envisioned Chat-assessment for Real-time Investigating of Nursing and Guidance  Two decades have lapsed since the seminal publications of the National Academy of Medicine (formerly the Institute of Medicine), To Err Is Human and Crossing the Quality Chasm, cast a national spotlight on health-care safety and quality, yet US patient outcome indices continue to lag behind those in other industrialized countries. The 2009 American Recovery and Reinvestment Act mandated health-care providers adopt electronic health record (EHR) systems, leading to widespread EHR adoption, albeit primarily for billing purposes rather than research or quality improvement efforts. Thus EHR impact on health-care quality has tended to be in the domains of physician efficiency and guideline compliance. Despite a large body of evidence that nursing quality is directly related to patient outcomes in the acute care selling, nurses often lack timely information to use in improving individual patient outcomes, and indices of outcomes across patient populations are slow to budge over lime. Widespread adoption of EHRs in U.S. hospitals now allows determination of outcome quality indicators for all patients in a hospital for real-time feedback to nurses. Quality indicators are often only determined by piecing together other information to determine occurrence of an incident, e.g., exhuming information buried in nursing notes. The goal is to develop Chart-assessment for Real-lime Investigation of Nursing and Guidance (CARING), an automated machine learning system to report and predict nursing quality indicators in real-time for hospitalized patients to assist nurses in care planning. CARI NG will reflect algorithmic innovations to mine sequential patterns from multi-sourced, heterogeneous data including nursing narratives, yielding robust predictive models that are insensitive to uncertain labels and evolve with changes in health-care practices. CARING will represent EHR data using inter-connected tensors, capturing higher-order relations, temporal weighting, i.e., more recent data receives more weight, and incorporating domain expert feedback in development. Although CARING will be developed initially for the ten hospitals of our industry partner Emory Healthcare, its flexible refinement will enable adaptation at other health-care institutions. Outcomes of this project will give nurses actionable data in real time to improve nursing care quality that they do not receive now. Moreover, this system can be implemented into the health information infrastructure at an institutional level, integrating multi-scale and multi-level clinical, contextual, and organizational data surrounding each patient for real-time reporting and incorporation into predictive models. CARING supports the National Library of Medicine mission 1) by creating an innovative open source suite of tools for advancing patient safety; and 2) through educational efforts: training graduate students and fellows, and developing a Massive Open Online Course (MOOG), ""Big Data Analytics for Nursing,"" covering topics at the confluence of computer science, nursing, and patient outcome quality indicators.

"National Infrastructure for Standardized and Portable EHR Phenotyping Algorithms PROJECT SUMMARY With the rapidly growing adoption of patient electronic health record systems (EHRs) due to Meaningful Use, and linkage of EHRs to research biorepositories, evaluating the suitability of EHR data for clinical and translational research is becoming ever more important, with ramifications for genomic and observational research, clinical trials, and comparative effectiveness studies. A key component for identifying patient cohorts in the EHR is to define inclusion and exclusion criteria that algorithmically select sets of patients based on stored clinical data. This process is commonly referred to, as “EHR-driven phenotyping” is time-consuming and tedious due to the lack of a widely accepted and standards-based formal information model for defining phenotyping algorithms. To address this overall challenge, the proposed project will design, build and promote an open-access community infrastructure for standards-based development and sharing of phenotyping algorithms, as well as provide tools and resources for investigators, researchers and their informatics support staff to implement and execute the algorithms on native EHR data. PROJECT NARRATIVE The identification of patient cohorts for clinical and genomic research is a costly and time-consuming process. This bottleneck adversely affects public health by delaying research findings, and in some cases by making research costs prohibitively high. To address this issue, leveraging electronic health records (EHRs) for identifying patient cohorts has become an increasingly attractive option.

"PED Screen: Pediatric Sepsis EHR Registry, Clinical Outcomes, and Predictive Model Project Summary/Abstract Each year over 75,000 children develop sepsis in the United States resulting in substantial morbidity, up to 20% mortality, and billions in US health care expenditures. There have been substantial advances that demonstrate improved patient outcomes with adherence to early aggressive emergency care. However, methods to accurately, reliably, and rapidly identify children who require these resource-intensive therapies are lacking. In addition, understanding the impact of these therapies on near-term outcomes, before significant morbidity occurs, is also lacking. Current algorithms do not reliably discriminate between patients who develop sepsis and those who are clinically similar upon initial presentation but do not progress to sepsis. As a result, children requiring life-saving treatments do not receive them, or do not receive them in a timely fashion, and others may be over-treated, wasting healthcare resources and potentially diverting emergency care from those in need. With the advent of electronic health records (EHR), there are now information-enabled solutions that offer unique opportunities to identify non-biased, heterogeneous samples of children and allow us to accurately and reliably measure risk factors and near-term outcomes for sepsis. This work addresses the critical need to improve pediatric sepsis outcomes by developing methods to accurately identify at-risk children presenting for emergency care. Utilizing the infrastructure of the Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network (PECARN), this proposal will innovatively capture EHR data to create a multi-center registry with the ultimate goal to improve the detection and treatment of pediatric sepsis in the ED setting. To accomplish this, we propose the following specific aims: We will develop an expanded multicenter sepsis registry for pediatric patients from merged electronic health record clinical data from different hospitals with different EHR data sources. We will automate the determination of organ dysfunction in children with sepsis directly from structured and narrative data within the multicenter EHR registry. From the registry and outcome data, we will derive and validate a prediction model of pediatric sepsis using emergency department EHR data from the first 4 hours of care that predicts subsequent organ dysfunction within 48 hours. Each of these aims works to the goal of improving the emergent care for pediatric sepsis with innovative deliverables from this project including the existence of a broad and rich EHR registry, an automated process of outcome determination, and a prediction model of risk of sepsis. We will also have a strong foundation for future projects to implement and evaluate decision support tools, improve diagnostic techniques, engage in comparative effectiveness studies, measure quality of care, establish linked bio-repositories, and guide clinical trial design. The proposed project, thus, has enormous potential to improve our ability to improve the quality of care provided to our most acutely ill children.  Project Narrative Sepsis is a leading cause of pediatric morbidity and mortality with life-saving treatment dependent on early and accurate identification. We will establish a multi-center data registry from electronic health records (EHR), identify a multi-center cohort of pediatric patients at risk for sepsis, automate sepsis-related pediatric organ dysfunction directly from the registry EHR data, and develop an emergency department based prediction model of sepsis related organ dysfunction. Each of these aims has the ultimate goal of improving the emergent care for pediatric sepsis with innovative deliverables from this project including the existence of a broad and rich EHR registry, the automated process of important proximal outcome determination, and an emergency department prediction model of risk of sepsis. ","PED Screen: Pediatric Sepsis EHR Registry, Clinical Outcomes, and Predictive Model",9864083,R01HD087363,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Achievement', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adherence', 'Algorithms', 'Applied Research', 'Blood Pressure', 'Caring', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Derivation procedure', 'Detection', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emergency Care', 'Emergent care', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health Expenditures', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Infrastructure', 'Inpatients', 'Intervention', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Organ', 'Organ failure', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pediatric cohort', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Quality of Care', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Savings', 'Sepsis', 'Shock', 'Site', 'Structure', 'Time', 'United States', 'United States Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality', 'Visit', 'Work', 'base', 'cohort', 'comparative effectiveness study', 'data registry', 'design', 'effective intervention', 'electronic registry', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'member', 'mortality', 'novel', 'patient health information', 'patient registry', 'pediatric emergency', 'pediatric patients', 'predictive modeling', 'repository', 'risk prediction model', 'septic patients', 'support tools', 'wasting']",NICHD,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R01,2020,611937,0.0322840756750685
"Efficient Statistical Learning Methods for Personalized Medicine Using Large Scale Biomedical Data Project Summary/Abstract  Current medical treatment guidelines largely rely on data from randomized controlled trials that study  average effects, which may be inadequate for making individualized decisions for real-world patients. Large-scale electronic health records (EHRs) data provide unprecedented opportunities to optimize personalized treatment strategies and generate evidence relevant to real-world patients. However, there are inherent challenges in the use of EHRs, including non-experimental nature of data collection processes, heterogeneous data types with complex dependencies, irregular measurement patterns, multiple dynamic treatment sequences, and the need to balance risk and benefit of treatments. Using two high-quality EHR databases, Columbia University Medical Center's clinical data warehouse and the Indiana Network for Patient Care database, and focusing on type 2 diabetes (T2D), this proposal will develop novel and scalable statistical learning approaches that overcome these challenges to discover optimal personalized treatment strategies for T2D from real-world patients. Specifically, under Aim 1, we will develop a unified framework to learn latent temporal processes for feature extraction and dynamic patient records representation. Our approach will accommodate large-scale variables of mixed types (continuous, binary, counts) measured at irregular intervals. They extract lower-dimensional components to reflect patients' dynamic health status, account for informative healthcare documentation processes, and characterize similarities between patients. Under Aim 2, we will develop fast and efficient multi-category machine learning methods, in order to evaluate treatment propensities and adaptively learn optimal dynamic treatment regimens (DTRs) among the extensive number of treatment options observed in the EHRs. The methods will provide  sequential decisions that determine the best treatment sequence for a T2D patient given his/her EHRs. Under Aim 3, we will develop statistical learning methods to assist multi-faceted treatment decision-making, which balances risks versus benefits when evaluating a DTR. Our approach will ensure maximizing benefit to the greatest extent while controlling all risk outcomes under the safety margins. For all aims, we will develop efficient stochastic resampling algorithms to scale up the optimization for massive data sizes. We will identify optimal DTRs for T2D using the extracted information from patients' comorbidity conditions, medications, and laboratory tests, as well as records-collection processes. Our methodologies will be applied and cross-validated between the two EHR databases. The treatment strategies learned from the representative EHR databases with a diverse patient  population will be beneficial for individual patient care, assisting clinicians to adaptively choose the optimal treatment for a patient. Finally, we will disseminate our methods and results through freely available software and outreach to the informatics and clinical experts at our Centers for Translational Science and elsewhere. Project Narrative  This proposal aims to develop novel and scalable statistical learning methods to analyze electronic health records (EHRs) and use two real-world, high-quality EHR databases for personalized medicine research. The methods will handle the non-experimental nature of data collection processes, along with heterogeneous data types, dynamic treatment sequences, and the trade-off between benefit and risk outcomes.

"Improving missing data analysis in distributed research networks ABSTRACT Electronic health record (EHR) databases collect data that reflect routine clinical care. These databases are increasingly used in comparative effectiveness research, patient-centered outcomes research, quality improvement assessment, and public health surveillance to generate actionable evidence that improves patient care. It is often necessary to analyze multiple databases that cover large and diverse populations to improve the statistical power of the study or generalizability of the findings. A common approach to analyzing multiple databases is the use of a distributed research network (DRN) architecture, in which data remains under the physical control of data partners. Although EHRs are generally thought to contain rich clinical information, the information is not uniformly collected. Certain information is available only for some patients, and only at some time points for a given patient. There are generally two types of missing information in EHRs. The first is the conventionally understood and obvious missing data in which some data fields (e.g., body mass index) are not complete for various reasons, e.g., the clinician does not collect the information or the patient chooses not to provide the information. The second is less obvious because the data field is not empty but the recorded value may be incorrect due to missing data. For example, EHRs generally do not have complete data for care that occurs in a different delivery system. A medical condition (e.g., asthma) may be coded as “no” but the true value would have been “yes” if more complete data had been available, e.g., from claims data as the other delivery system would submit a claim to the patient’s health plan for the care provided. In other words, one may incorrectly treat “absence of evidence” as “evidence of absence”. EHRs hold great promise but we must address several outstanding methodological challenges inherent in the databases, specifically missing data. Addressing missing data is more challenging in DRNs due to different missing data mechanisms across databases. The specific aims of the study are: (1) Apply and assess missing data methods developed in single-database settings to handle obvious and well-recognized missing data in DRNs; (2) Apply and assess machine learning and predictive modeling techniques to address less obvious and under-recognized missing data for select variables in DRNs; and (3) Apply and assess a comprehensive analytic approach that combines conventional missing data methods and machine learning techniques to address missing data in DRNs. The analytic methods developed in this project, including the extension of existing missing data methods to DRNs, the innovative use of machine learning techniques to address missing data, and their integration with privacy- protecting analytic methods, will have direct impact on the design and analysis of future comparative effectiveness and safety studies, and patient-centered outcomes research conducted in DRNs.

"Clinical Informatics to Advance Epidemiology and Pharmacogenetics of Serious Cutaneous Adverse Drug Reactions Project Summary  Severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs) are morbid immunologic reactions to drugs that confer a mortality of 10-50%. Over the last decade, significant promise for prediction and prevention has come from the discovery that many SCARs are associated with variation within HLA class I alleles. For HLA-B*15:02, this has led to routine pre-prescription screening for carbamazepine in many Southeast Asian countries and a significant reduction in cases of carbamazepine SJS/TEN. Despite this progress, there is little known about genetic and epidemiological risk factors for SCARs related to commonly used drugs such as antibiotics. There is also limited information about HLA risk for SCARs across the diverse populations present in the United States. Furthermore, imprecision of clinical phenotyping and lack of standardized coding has led to challenges in finding SCAR cases in the electronic health record (EHR). Our proposed study aims to address critical challenges and gaps in our knowledge of antibiotic SCARs.  In Aim 1, we will leverage advanced informatics and longitudinal EHR data for over 11 million patients from Partners HealthCare System since the 1980s to identify SCAR cases. We will create, optimize and standardize reproducible methods for finding SCAR cases and validating a cohort of SCAR patients. This iterative process will be used to refine and disseminate an electronic phenotype to be validated cross-institutionally.  In Aim 2, we will analyze SCAR prevalence and conduct a case-control study to identify drug-specific and patient-specific risk factors for antibiotic-associated SCARs. We will compare clinical sequelae, quality of life and adherence of SCAR patients compared to controls through validated survey instruments.  In Aim 3, we will identify candidate HLA and genetic associations from patients with validated antibiotic- associated SCARs. We will examine difference in genetic risk in minority and health disparity populations and predict that we will be powered to establish HLA associations for vancomycin DRESS (i.e., drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms) and sulfonamide antimicrobial and beta-lactam SCAR. HLA alone, or in combination with clinical risk factors, can lead to improved SCAR prevention and early diagnosis. We will establish a data sharing platform, in the form of an online electronic phenotype and patient registry, that can be used to enlarge SCAR cohorts for future large-scale genomics studies.  The roadmap we develop will translate into the development of electronic phenotypes for serious adverse drug reactions that facilitate genetic discovery. Knowledge gained will be crucial to the translation of genetic data into clinical decision making. This is in close alignment with NIH’s research mission to accelerate genetic discovery for iatrogenic and preventable drug-induced diseases that will translate into prevention, earlier diagnosis and an enhanced mechanistic understanding that may lead to targeted therapeutic approaches. Narrative  Severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs) result in substantial morbidity, long term disability, health care burden and a mortality of 10-50%. To advance the science of clinical and genetic risk factor identification for antibiotic SCAR, we will leverage large electronic health record (EHR) data and advanced informatics technology. Through case validation we will create an informatics roadmap for other institutions with similar EHR data to identify SCAR cases and we will establish a data sharing platform, including an online electronic phenotype and patient registry, that can be used to enlarge SCAR cohorts for future large-scale genomics studies.",Clinical Informatics to Advance Epidemiology and Pharmacogenetics of Serious Cutaneous Adverse Drug Reactions,10018800,R01AI150295,"['Address', 'Adherence', 'Adverse event', 'Adverse reactions', 'Affect', 'African American', 'Alleles', 'Allergic Reaction', 'Allopurinol', 'Antibiotics', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Autoimmune Process', 'Biological Markers', 'Carbamazepine', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Code', 'Country', 'Cutaneous', 'Data', 'Dermatology', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Drug Administration Routes', 'Drug Exposure', 'Drug Prescriptions', 'Drug usage', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Eosinophilia', 'Epidemiology', 'Ethnic group', 'Female', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic Translation', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'HLA Antigens', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class I', 'Hypersensitivity', 'Iatrogenesis', 'Immunologics', 'Immunology', 'Infection', 'Informatics', 'Inpatients', 'Institution', 'International', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Mandatory Reporting', 'Medical Genetics', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Monobactams', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nevirapine', 'Outpatients', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacogenetics', 'Pharmacology', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Quality of life', 'Race', 'Reaction', 'Registries', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk stratification', 'Science', 'Source', 'Specificity', 'Standardization', 'Stevens-Johnson Syndrome', 'Sulfonamides', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'United States', 'United States Food and Drug Administration', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Vancomycin', 'Variant', 'abacavir', 'adverse drug reaction', 'antimicrobial', 'base', 'beta-Lactams', 'care burden', 'case control', 'case finding', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinical practice', 'clinical risk', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'data sharing', 'data warehouse', 'design', 'disability', 'dosage', 'genetic association', 'genetic risk factor', 'health disparity', 'immunoreaction', 'improved', 'medication compliance', 'medication safety', 'minority health', 'mortality', 'patient population', 'patient registry', 'prevent', 'racial and ethnic', 'screening', 'sex', 'sharing platform', 'southeast Asian', 'targeted treatment']",NIAID,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2020,696239,0.03732748880500851
"Scalable Clinical Decision Support for Individualized Cancer Risk Management Project Summary / Abstract We propose to enable a scalable clinical decision support (CDS) platform that helps clinicians and patients select cancer screening strategies that are best suited to each individual. This kind of CDS is important because increased evidence supports personalizing cancer screening decisions according to each individual's unique cancer risks. While a highly desired goal, individualizing screening at a population scale requires the implementation of patient-specific risk assessments for several types of cancer. This is quite challenging in today's overwhelmed primary care environment. Our proposed CDS platform addresses this challenge by (i) automating the risk stratification process at the population level based on EHR data and patient reported data; (ii) prioritizing patients for case review by genetic counselors; and (iii) automatically communicating risk and screening recommendations with primary care providers and their patients. We will integrate the CDS platform with the Epic EHR and test it at the University of Utah Health Care community clinics and the Huntsman Cancer Institute. We will assess the generalizability of the CDS platform with a different EHR (Cerner) at a different institution (Intermountain Healthcare). To maximize the dissemination potential for the proposed cancer risk screening platform, we will extend two well-established open source CDS platforms: OpenCDS and OpenInfobutton. These platforms are reference implementations of international EHR standards that are required for EHR certification in the US. We will also obtain software certification from the Open Source EHR Alliance, share the CDS platform and our experiences with other awardees in the ITCR Program, present the CDS platform at national and international cancer and informatics conferences; and engage with relevant stakeholders through a technical expert panel. Any healthcare organization with a certified EHR will be able to use the proposed CDS platform. Therefore, if successful, this proposal can have a significant impact on disseminating individualized cancer screening practices according to the best available evidence. The proposed research addresses the need for individualizing cancer screening according to the risk of an individual. We propose to enable software that scans electronic health records of entire patient populations to automatically detect those at a high risk to develop specific types of cancer according to cancer guidelines. Genetic counselors will review patients identified by the software, and discuss optimal cancer screening strategies with the patient and their primary care providers.",Scalable Clinical Decision Support for Individualized Cancer Risk Management,9979779,U24CA204800,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Breast Cancer Detection', 'Breast Cancer Risk Factor', 'Certification', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Computer software', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Reporting', 'Detection', 'Documentation', 'Ecosystem', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Family', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Incentives', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Information Retrieval', 'Infrastructure', 'Institutes', 'Institution', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Logic', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Modality', 'National Comprehensive Cancer Network', 'Natural Language Processing pipeline', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Population', 'Primary Health Care', 'Process', 'Provider', 'PubMed', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Management', 'Risk stratification', 'Scanning', 'Screening for cancer', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Universities', 'Utah', 'base', 'cancer risk', 'cancer type', 'care providers', 'clinical decision support', 'colorectal cancer risk', 'community clinic', 'design', 'experience', 'genetic counselor', 'health care service organization', 'healthcare community', 'high risk', 'improved', 'incentive program', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'online course', 'online resource', 'open source', 'patient population', 'personalized screening', 'primary care setting', 'programs', 'screening', 'screening guidelines', 'support tools', 'symposium', 'web services']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,U24,2020,745481,0.020425192934152472
"Clinical and Translational Science Award PROJECT SUMMARY: COMBATCOVID The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has affected every corner of the globe and has redefined healthcare throughout the United States. COVID-19 cases in the New York City tri-state area have reached an extraordinarily high number and have quickly become the epicenter region of the crisis in the United States. In New York State alone, there are over 372,000 confirmed cases as of June 1, 2020. NYU Langone Health (NYULH) has been particularly hard hit, with more than 8,100 COVID-19 hospitalizations to date. In response, the entire clinical research community is marshalling resources in an attempt to improve our understanding of how the virus spreads, how it infects various tissues in the body, which patients are more susceptible to infection and fatal outcomes, which therapeutics improve symptoms and survival, whether the immune response confers long-lasting protection against reinfection, and many other crucially important questions. The complexity of the development of this disease and unpredictability of progression into severity, as well as the variety of phenotypic outcomes observed during and post COVID-19, pose major challenges in understanding, predicting, preventing, managing and treating this disease and its sequelae. Answers to these challenges can only be achieved through the comprehensive analysis of a significantly high number of COVID cases. Given how recent and unknown this disease is, and its inherent epidemic nature, there is a limited number of cases at individual medical institutions. The limitation of number of cases per institution becomes even more relevant when isolating subpopulations with specific health conditions and across the lifespan. This proposed study will aim to overcome the above-mentioned challenges by supporting the formation of a consortium comprising multiple medical institutions in the U.S.: COMBATCOVID (Consortium for Multisite Biomedical Analytics and Trials on COVID-19). COMBATCOVID will bring together electronic health records (EHR) data from multiple participating institutions into a shared centralized database. As part of the COMBATCOVID effort, biorepository data of COVID-19 patients collected by some of the participating institutions will also be shared and linked to the respective EHR data. The COMBATCOVID consortium will be responsible for transferring EHR data pertaining to participating institutions interested in contributing EHR data to the N3C database. PROJECT NARRATIVE: COMBATCOVID The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has affected every corner of the globe and has redefined healthcare throughout the United States. To adequately understand the virus much more data is needed, necessitating sharing of data across multiple institutions. The COMBATCOVID (Consortium for Multisite Biomedical Analytics and Trials on COVID-19) initiative will support regional and national efforts by forming a consortium comprising multiple medical institutions in the U.S. to create a shared centralized database of COVID-related EHR data.",Clinical and Translational Science Award,10183901,UL1TR001445,"['2019-nCoV', 'Affect', 'Area', 'COVID-19', 'COVID-19 pandemic', 'Categories', 'Cessation of life', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical and Translational Science Awards', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Coronavirus', 'Critical Care', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Epidemic', 'Event', 'Fatal Outcome', 'Health', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitalization', 'Immune response', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Inflammatory', 'Informatics', 'Institution', 'Ischemic Stroke', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Link', 'Longevity', 'Marshal', 'Medical', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'New York', 'New York City', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Phenotype', 'Pneumonia', 'Procedures', 'Records', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Respiratory Failure', 'Risk', 'Severities', 'Site', 'Subgroup', 'Syndrome', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Therapeutic', 'Thrombosis', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Underrepresented Groups', 'United States', 'Upper respiratory tract', 'Venous', 'Viral Pneumonia', 'Virus', 'biobank', 'central database', 'cohort', 'coronavirus disease', 'data sharing', 'demographics', 'design', 'ethnic minority population', 'health data', 'improved', 'interest', 'medical specialties', 'meetings', 'member', 'pandemic disease', 'prevent', 'racial minority', 'response', 'structured data', 'symptomatic improvement', 'unstructured data', 'venous thromboembolism']",NCATS,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,UL1,2020,768511,0.06031542849038414
"Improving Quality of Electronic Health Record Ophthalmic Data for Big Data Analytics PROJECT SUMMARY The widespread adoption of EHRs has enabled the collection of massive amounts of digital ophthalmic data which have great potential for secondary use in research, quality improvement, and clinical decision support. While the amount of digital ophthalmic data recorded in the EHR is substantial and could be analyzed using the latest techniques for big data, questions about the quality of the data are a barrier to its reuse. Now that the American Academy of Ophthalmology has aggregated digital ophthalmic data from the EHR into the IRIS Registry, data quality is even more imperative for reaching the potential of the registry. To date, there has not be a comprehensive evaluation of the data quality of digital ophthalmic data, nor have there been any solutions for improving its quality. These are important gaps that will limit the utility of EHR data as a tool for knowledge discovery in ophthalmology. The goal of this grant is to assess the quality of digital ophthalmic exam data in order to improve its ability to be reused for research. Our hypothesis is that studying the variability of data quality in large datasets will provide insights into improving its quality. The first aim employs an established framework for data quality analysis to assess the intrinsic quality of a single institution’s EHR data as well as its fitness for use--the ability to be applied to a particular research scenario. In this proposal, we are evaluating the data’s ability to identify patient cohorts for clinical trials and to accurately calculate outcome based clinical quality measures. The variability in data’s quality and fitness among providers, subspecialties, diagnoses, and visit types will be analyzed. The second aim validates the analysis of the first aim by repeating it for all of the ophthalmic data in the IRIS Registry. For this analysis, the differences in quality and fitness between institutions and EHR vendors will also be assessed, along with the barriers to data quality and reuse. For both aims, ophthalmology experts will review the results to make recommendations for improving data quality and utility for digital ophthalmic data. In the future, these recommendations will provide a direction for correcting these quality issues and for ultimately advancing knowledge discovery in ophthalmic care. PROJECT NARRATIVE Electronic health records (EHRs) have not yet reached their potential for transforming healthcare, particularly for reusing clinical data for research. The American Academy of Ophthalmology has aggregated ophthalmic data from the EHR into the IRIS Registry, and data quality is even more imperative to achieve to reach the potential of this registry. Using methodological data quality analysis, we will analyze the quality of a single institution’s ophthalmic data and again for multiple institutions’ ophthalmic data in the IRIS Registry, documenting barriers for data quality and reuse that will lead to improving knowledge discovery from this data.",Improving Quality of Electronic Health Record Ophthalmic Data for Big Data Analytics,9953684,R21EY031443,"['Academy', 'Adoption', 'Age related macular degeneration', 'American', 'Big Data', 'Big Data Methods', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cohort Studies', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Discovery', 'Diabetic Retinopathy', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease Progression', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Evaluation', 'Exfoliation Syndrome', 'Eye', 'Future', 'Glaucoma', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Hand', 'Health Sciences', 'Healthcare', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Institutes', 'Institution', 'Intelligence', 'Iris', 'Knowledge Discovery', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical Informatics', 'Medicine', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Ophthalmology', 'Oregon', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Recommendation', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Retinopathy of Prematurity', 'Secondary to', 'Source', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Terminology', 'Treatment outcome', 'Universities', 'Vendor', 'Vision', 'Visit', 'base', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical encounter', 'cohort', 'data framework', 'data harmonization', 'data quality', 'data registry', 'data reuse', 'data submission', 'deep learning', 'digital', 'electronic data', 'experience', 'fitness', 'improved', 'insight', 'large datasets', 'large scale data', 'research study', 'tool', 'treatment comparison']",NEI,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,R21,2020,231000,0.03494201097522769
"Semi-supervised Algorithms for Risk Assessment with Noisy EHR Data PROJECT SUMMARY Large electronic health record research (EHR) data integrated with -omics data from linked biorepositories have expanded opportunities for precision medicine research. These integrated datasets open opportunities for developing accurate EHR-based personalized cancer risk and progression prediction models, which can be easily incorporated into clinical practice and ultimately realize the promise of precision oncology. However, efficiently and effectively using EHR for cancer research remains challenging due to practical and methodological obstacles. For example, obtaining precise event time information such as time of cancer recurrence is a major bottleneck in using EHR for precision medicine research due to the requirement of laborious medical record review and the lack of documentation. Simple estimates of the event time based on billing or procedure codes may poorly approximate the true event time. Naive use of such estimated event times can lead to highly biased estimates due to the approximation error. Such biases impose challenges to performing pragmatic trials when the study endpoint is time to events and captured using EHR. The overall goal of this proposal is to fill these methodological gaps in risk assessment for cancer research using EHR data, which will advance our ability to achieve the promise of precision oncology. Statistical algorithms and software will be developed to (i) automatically assign event time information using longitudinally recorded EHR information; and (ii) to perform accurate risk assessment using noisy proxies of event times. The proposed tools for risk assessment using imperfect EHR data without requiring extensive manual chart review could greatly improve the utility of EHR for oncology research. PROJECT NARRATIVE This proposal addresses major methodological gaps in effectively utilizing EHR data for risk assessment due to the noisy nature of EHR data. We propose novel statistical algorithms and software to (i) efficiently annotate event time by combining multiple longitudinally recorded code information and (ii) to provide precise risk estimates using noisy proxies of event times. By drawing upon the rich albeit imperfect data from bio-repository linked EHR, our algorithms will advance our ability to use EHR data for precision oncology research.",Semi-supervised Algorithms for Risk Assessment with Noisy EHR Data,9955220,R21CA242940,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Biological', 'Boston', 'Cancer Patient', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Cohort Studies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Documentation', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Event', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Healthcare', 'Infrastructure', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Medical Records', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Nature', 'Oncology', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Procedures', 'Progression-Free Survivals', 'Proxy', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Estimate', 'Software Tools', 'Source', 'Statistical Algorithm', 'Supervision', 'Testing', 'Time', 'adjudicate', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'biobank', 'cancer recurrence', 'cancer risk', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'electronic data', 'evidence base', 'genomic data', 'improved', 'large datasets', 'learning algorithm', 'multimodality', 'novel', 'patient population', 'patient subsets', 'pragmatic trial', 'precision medicine', 'precision oncology', 'predictive modeling', 'repository', 'supervised learning', 'tool', 'tumor progression', 'user friendly software', 'web site']",NCI,HARVARD SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH,R21,2020,177510,0.08924746723729875
"EHR-Based Strategies to Improve Outcomes in Familial Hypercholesterolemia PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is a relatively common genetic disorder characterized by elevated plasma low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and a dramatically increased lifetime risk for premature atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). Available data suggest substantial under treatment of individuals with FH, and it is estimated that <5% of prevalent FH cases in the US are diagnosed and treated. The proposed research will develop electronic health record (EHR)-based strategies to reduce mortality and morbidity from FH. We will develop and validate a phenotyping algorithm for rapid and efficient identification of FH cases thereby enabling EHR-based surveillance of FH. We will deploy the phenotyping algorithm in the population-based setting of Olmsted County, Minnesota, to estimate prevalence and provide hitherto unavailable data on awareness, detection and control of FH. We will develop CDS to help care providers manage FH patients and an FH-specific decision aid to facilitate shared decision making related to lipid-lowering therapy and screening of family members. To accomplish these goals, we will leverage the following resources: a) the electronic phenotyping expertise available in the electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) network; b) the Rochester Epidemiology Project (REP), that links medical records of Olmsted County MN residents thereby capturing nearly all health care delivered to residents of the community; and c) expertise in developing and deploying CDS in the EHR and in creating decision aids for disclosing cardiovascular risk and the benefits of lipid-lowering drugs. Our specific aims are: Aim 1. Develop and validate an electronic phenotyping algorithm to rapidly identify FH cases from the EHR. Aim 2. Conduct an e- epidemiology study to obtain hitherto unknown data regarding prevalence, awareness, detection, control of FH in a population-based setting in the US. Aim 3. a) Develop EHR-based tools to help care providers manage FH and facilitate shared decision making and cascade screening and b) assess outcomes after implementation of CDS and decision aid. The proposed research will enable rapid identification of FH in EHRs, provide hitherto unavailable data on the burden of FH in the community, facilitate EHR-based strategies for early detection, increase awareness of FH among care providers, provide guidance for management of FH at point of care and help both patients and providers make informed decisions about drug therapy and screening of family members. These are critical steps for early detection and treatment of FH to reduce the burden of premature ASCVD due to this condition. PROJECT NARRATIVE Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is a relatively common genetic disorder characterized by high cholesterol levels and increased risk of heart attack or sudden cardiac death. The proposed research will develop electronic health record (EHR)-based strategies to prevent adverse outcomes such as heart attack in FH patients. These include methods to rapidly identify FH patients, estimate prevalence of FH and develop clinical decision support to help care providers manage FH patients.

"Quantifying Microbial Keratitis to Predict Outcomes: An Imaging and Epidemiologic Approach PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT For epidemiological studies, future clinical trials, and personalized patient care, there is a critical need to create a risk-stratification system for microbial keratitis. Microbial keratitis (MK), a debilitating, infectious corneal disease, is estimated to be the fourth-leading cause of blindness worldwide. MK severity depends on a complex interaction of patient, organism, and environment, resulting in a spectrum of clinical presentations and responses to treatment. Clinical presentations manifest with unique morphology features and clinical symptoms. Morphology features are visible in the cornea, and symptoms are measurable. But most patients are treated with non-specific broad-spectrum antimicrobials, an approach that increases antimicrobial resistance. This non-specific treatment approach lacks congruence with the unique MK presentations. There is a critical need for a new strategy to personalize treatments for MK and measure treatment efficacy. With quantified MK morphologic and clinical features, clinicians will have the tools to risk-stratify patients. The long-term goal is to develop rapid, objective, personalized treatment plans for patients with MK. This proposal’s objective is to quantify dynamic morphologic and clinical MK features using image and electronic health record (EHR) analyses and then build a risk-stratification scoring system associated with MK outcomes. The proposed research will test the hypothesis that morphologic and clinical features accurately risk- stratify patients for corneal and vision outcomes. Our premise is supported by preliminary data demonstrating that: (1) different organisms generate distinct morphologic and clinical features; (2) clinicians quantify morphology less precisely than image-analysis methods, (3) an expert is able to use MK features to tailor treatments; (4) the use of quantified features has improved outcomes in other diseases, such as diabetic retinopathy, by helping providers to tailor treatments; (5) EHR data can be used to quantify and classify clinical disease features accurately; and (6) EHR data can be used effectively to risk-stratify patients. Aim 1 will develop objective image analysis tools to measure features of MK with existing clinical equipment. Aim 2 will evaluate MK treatment efficacy using morphologic image analysis and clinical features from prospective surveys. Aim 3 will risk-stratify patients with MK by combining image analysis and EHR extracted data. The expected outcomes are: (1) characterized databases of MK images and linked clinical data, (2) quantified MK features across a spectrum of clinical presentations, (3) performance-tested, open-source imaging algorithms and surveys to measure MK markers dynamically, and (4) a novel risk stratification model and scoring system. The resultant work will have significant value to clinicians. Clinicians can use practical, low-cost technologies and readily-available EHR data to quantify MK features and risk-stratify patients in order to tailor treatments. NARRATIVE The clinical management of microbial keratitis is imprecise and dependent on the expertise of the treating physician. Our innovative strategies will quantify corneal features using image analysis and available clinical data from the electronic health record. Quantified image features will be linked to health outcomes to give physicians new tools to risk-stratify patients and to tailor their management to optimize outcomes.",Quantifying Microbial Keratitis to Predict Outcomes: An Imaging and Epidemiologic Approach,9865483,R01EY031033,"['Algorithms', 'Antimicrobial Resistance', 'Blindness', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complex', 'Control Groups', 'Cornea', 'Corneal Diseases', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Databases', 'Diabetic Retinopathy', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Equipment', 'Evaluation', 'Eye', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Inflammatory', 'Keratitis', 'Link', 'Measurable', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'National Eye Institute', 'Organism', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Outcomes Assessments', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Provider', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk stratification', 'Self-Examination', 'Severities', 'Standardization', 'Strategic Planning', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Universities', 'Virulence', 'Vision', 'Visual Acuity', 'Work', 'antimicrobial', 'automated algorithm', 'base', 'care systems', 'case control', 'clinical risk', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'epidemiology study', 'healing', 'improved outcome', 'individualized medicine', 'innovation', 'microbial', 'novel', 'open source', 'outcome prediction', 'patient stratification', 'performance tests', 'personalized care', 'personalized medicine', 'primary outcome', 'prospective', 'slit lamp imaging', 'tool', 'treatment planning', 'treatment response']",NEI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2020,410000,0.03404554228761178
"ICLIC-MS for Enhancing Outcomes Research and Clinical Care in Multiple Sclerosis PROJECT SUMMARY Cognitive impairment, physical disability and progressive disease are common but understudied clinical outcomes that substantially impact employment and overall quality of life for individuals with multiple sclerosis (MS). We have recently developed and validated an assisted, web-based tool (ICLIC-MS) for systematic and longitudinal clinical outcomes data collection of MS-validated cognitive function measures, physical disability and progressive disease measures that are not reliably captured in the electronic health record (EHR). In response to FOA# PA-17-010, Use of Technology to Enhance Patient Outcomes and Prevent Illness, our team proposes the study of MS outcomes in a large, multi-ethnic population representative sample of more than 3,000 female and male MS cases from the Kaiser Permanente Northern California Health Plan Membership. We will integrate other EHR data such as important comorbid conditions, use of disease modifying therapy, MRI reports, as well as quality of life measures and employment histories. Our goals include: 1) comprehensively characterizing clinical outcomes in a large MS patient cohort; 2) developing and utilizing an integrated MS health report to enhance patient care; and 3) establishing a resource for clinical outcomes research in MS that also includes whole genomic and environmental exposure data. Findings from our proposed study represent an extraordinary opportunity to facilitate effective long-term management of MS, accelerate progress in the understanding of disease pathogenesis, predict patient trajectories and inform prevention strategies. We have assembled a team with strong expertise in clinical neurology/MS neurology, advanced epidemiologic methods, EHR structure and clinical care within a health maintenance organization, human genomics, biostatistics, and big data approaches. PROJECT NARRATIVE Our team has developed and validated an assisted web-based interface for longitudinal clinical data collection of cognitive function measures, physical disability and depression measures that are not reliably captured in the electronic health record (EHR) of multiple sclerosis (MS) patients.

"Identification of biologically relevant subtypes of hidradenitis suppurativa Project Summary Hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) is a neglected, prevalent, chronic, stigmatizing, and debilitating disease that has recently been prioritized for study by NIAMS. Evidence suggests that some HS patients choose to self-manage symptoms remaining unconnected to healthcare, and some seek medical care for repeated outbreaks of boils but never receive a diagnosis. Such ‘hidden populations’ create challenges for designing research studies that are generalizable. Precision medicine initiatives and resources offer opportunities to rapidly increase our knowledge about biological causes of HS and to improve the care that HS patients receive. For example, the NIH has made considerable investments in the development of data repositories that link genetic data to EHR for hundreds of thousands of patients, including the NHGRI-funded eMERGE Network and the NIH-funded All of Us Research Program. Columbia University investigators are integral members of these nationwide programs, both as a recruitment site, as well as a data and research center (5U01HG008680, 1OT2OD026556). Engaging research participants who are willing to contribute longitudinal data is a major obstacle to precision medicine initiatives. The public’s use of the Internet and social media to obtain and exchange health-related information has created opportunities to rapidly and efficiently assemble large longitudinal cohorts, yet there are important differences from traditional research methods and best practice guidelines have yet to be developed. Columbia University is at the forefront of the development and application of these methods. A major challenge to implementing precision medicine arises from patients who share a diagnosis but have different biological causes of disease. HS patients have a high burden of comorbidities and we hypothesize that sets of comorbidities that tend to present together in individual patients can be used to identify biologically relevant disease subtypes. Here we will use three approaches to identify patterns of comorbidities within patients, to characterize the generalizability of the results from studies conducted in EHR, and to use genetic data to biologically validate comorbidities and resolve causality underlying disease associations. Training in biomedical informatics and Internet-based survey research will allow the applicant to use EHR data and Internet resources for assembling cohorts to conduct these studies, and complement her previous training in epidemiology, biostatistics, molecular biology and human genetics, providing fluency across several domains that are crucial for advancing precision medicine initiatives. Completion of this proposal will achieve the applicant’s long-term goal of obtaining advanced training aimed at implementing precision medicine in the treatment of skin disease. Project Narrative This project addresses the imperative needs of hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) patients who suffer from pain, stigma, diminished quality of life, decreased work productivity, and increased healthcare costs that arise from managing a difficult-to-treat, debilitating disease with a high burden of comorbidities. We will conduct studies of HS comorbidities to identify biologically distinct subclasses of HS in large samples of patients using data in electronic health records and data collected from Internet surveys. This work will improve the precision of HS diagnoses and set up the infrastructure for future large-scale studies of HS.",Identification of biologically relevant subtypes of hidradenitis suppurativa,9977561,K01AR075111,"['Abscess', 'Address', 'Advertising', 'Affect', 'All of Us Research Program', 'Anogenital region', 'Attenuated', 'Automobile Driving', 'Axilla', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Biometry', 'Caring', 'Chronic', 'Cicatrix', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Consent', 'Data', 'Data Reporting', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Economic Burden', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Electronic Medical Records and Genomics Network', 'Enrollment', 'Epidemiology', 'Etiology', 'Funding', 'Furuncles', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Healthcare', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hidradenitis Suppurativa', 'Human Genetics', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Inguinal region', 'International Classification of Disease Codes', 'Internet', 'Investments', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Leg', 'Lesion', 'Link', 'Liquid substance', 'Literature', 'Longitudinal cohort', 'Maps', 'Medical', 'Medical Research', 'Methods', 'Molecular Biology', 'Molecular Diagnosis', 'Mutation', 'National Human Genome Research Institute', 'National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases', 'Pain', 'Participant', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Plant Roots', 'Population', 'Practice Guidelines', 'Precision Medicine Initiative', 'Prevalence', 'Productivity', 'Publishing', 'Quality of life', 'Randomized', 'Recording of previous events', 'Records', 'Recurrence', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Site', 'Stigmatization', 'Subgroup', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Work', 'arm', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'data resource', 'data sharing', 'data warehouse', 'design', 'disorder subtype', 'effective therapy', 'genome wide association study', 'health care service utilization', 'health data', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'instrument', 'large datasets', 'learning strategy', 'medically underserved', 'member', 'multidimensional data', 'neglect', 'online resource', 'patient engagement', 'patient stratification', 'patient subsets', 'precision medicine', 'prevent', 'programs', 'psychosocial', 'recruit', 'research study', 'skin disorder', 'social media', 'social stigma', 'symptom self management', 'tool', 'unsupervised learning', 'validation studies']",NIAMS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,K01,2020,121288,0.03066954083185698
